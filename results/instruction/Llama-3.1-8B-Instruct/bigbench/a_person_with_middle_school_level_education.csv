From clue 1, we know the person wearing high heels does not live in the second house. This means the person wearing high heels must live in either house 1 or 4.

From clue 4, we know the person wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house. This means the person wearing high heels must live in house 1.

Now, we have the person wearing sandals in either house 1 or 2, and the person wearing high heels in house 1. Since the person wearing sandals lives directly left of the romance book lover, the person wearing sandals must live in house 1, and the romance book lover must live in house 2.

The person wearing loafers must live in either house 3 or 4. From clue 2, we know the history book buff lives to the right of the person wearing loafers. Since the history book buff cannot live in house 1 (because the person wearing high heels lives there), and cannot live in house 2 (because the romance book lover lives there), the history book buff must live in house 4.

The only house left is house 3, which is where the mystery book reader lives.

The answer is (B) 3."
"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.
2. The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer.

From clue 2, we know the order is: Gameboy, Computer.

From clue 1, we know the person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy. So, the order is: Green, Gameboy, Computer.

Now, let's look at clue 3: The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house. Since the order is Green, Gameboy, Computer, the second house must be the Gameboy's house. The person who likes yellow can't live in the second house, so the person who likes yellow must live in either the first or the third house.

Since the person who likes green lives in the first house, the person who likes yellow must live in the third house.

"Let's break down the clues to figure out where the coffee drinker lives.

From clue 7, we know the person who likes red lives in the third house.

"Let's break down the clues to figure out where the person who is eating kiwis lives.

From clue 8, we know the person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.

So, the answer is (A) 1."
"Let's break down the clues to figure out where the person who had stew lives.

From clue 4, we know the person who had stew lives next to the person who had grilled cheese. 

From clue 8, we know the person who had grilled cheese and the person who has a vase of tulips live next to each other.

From clue 3, we know the person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the fifth house. 

So, the person who had grilled cheese and the person who has a vase of tulips must live in the first, second, or third house.

From clue 7, we know the person who had grilled cheese lives to the right of the person who had spaghetti. 

From clue 1, we know the person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who had grilled cheese. 

From clue 5, we know the person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the fifth house. 

From clue 6, we know the person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who had grilled cheese.

From clue 11, we know the person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating mangos.

From clue 2, we know the person who is eating oranges lives to the left of the person who is eating apples.

From clue 10, we know the person who is eating oranges lives to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.

From clue 9, we know there are two houses between where the person who is eating oranges lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.

Now, let's try to put the people in order from left to right:

- The person who has a carnations arrangement must be in the first house because the person who is eating oranges lives to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
- The person who is eating oranges must be in the second house because the person who is eating oranges lives to the left of the person who is eating apples.
- The person who is eating apples must be in the third house because the person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating mangos.
- The person who is eating mangos must be in the fourth house because the person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating mangos.
- The person who has a rose bouquet must be in the fifth house because the person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who had grilled cheese.

Now, we know the order is: 1. carnations, 2. oranges, 3. apples, 4. mangos, 5. rose bouquet.

From clue 7, we know the person who had grilled cheese lives to the right of the person who had spaghetti. 

From clue 1, we know the person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who had grilled cheese. 

So, the person who had grilled cheese must be in the fourth house because the person who has a rose bouquet is in the fifth house.

From clue 4, we know the person who had stew lives next to the person who had grilled cheese. 

So, the person who had stew must be in the third house because the person who had grilled cheese is in the fourth house.

The answer is (B) 2 is incorrect because the person who had stew lives in the third house, not the second house."
"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person with tulips lives directly left of the dog owner.
2. The person with daffodils does not live in the second house.
3. There is one house between the horse owner and the person with carnations.
4. The person with lilies lives to the right of the horse owner.
5. The cat lover lives in the first house.

From clue 5, we know the cat lover lives in the first house. 

From clue 1, the person with tulips lives directly left of the dog owner. Since the cat lover is in the first house, the dog owner must be in the second house (because the cat lover is already in the first house, and the tulip person is to the left of the dog owner).

From clue 2, the person with daffodils does not live in the second house, so the daffodils must be in either the first, third, or fourth house. But since the cat lover is in the first house, the daffodils must be in either the third or fourth house.

From clue 3, there is one house between the horse owner and the person with carnations. This means the horse owner and the person with carnations cannot be in the first and second houses (because there would be no house in between), and they also cannot be in the third and fourth houses (because there would be two houses in between). So, the horse owner and the person with carnations must be in the second and third houses, or the third and fourth houses.

From clue 4, the person with lilies lives to the right of the horse owner. If the horse owner is in the second house, the person with lilies must be in the third house. But if the horse owner is in the third house, the person with lilies must be in the fourth house.

Now, let's combine the information:

- The cat lover is in the first house.
- The dog owner is in the second house.
- The horse owner and the person with carnations are in the second and third houses, or the third and fourth houses.
- The person with lilies is in the third house (if the horse owner is in the second house) or the fourth house (if the horse owner is in the third house).

Since the horse owner and the person with carnations are in the second and third houses, or the third and fourth houses, and the person with lilies is in the third house (if the horse owner is in the second house), the horse owner must be in the second house, and the person with lilies must be in the third house.

Now, we know the cat lover is in the first house, the dog owner is in the second house, the horse owner is in the second house, and the person with lilies is in the third house. This means the person with carnations must be in the fourth house.

The only person left is the fish enthusiast.

"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who has a phone lives in the first house.
2. The person who is wearing boots does not live in the second house.
3. The person who owns horses and the person who has a radio live directly next to each other.

From clue 1, we know the person with a phone lives in house 1. 

From clue 2, we know the person with boots does not live in house 2, so they must live in house 1. But we already know the person in house 1 has a phone, so the person in house 1 cannot be wearing boots.

From clue 3, we know the person who owns horses and the person who has a radio live next to each other. Since the person with a phone lives in house 1, the person with a radio must live in house 2, and the person with horses must live in house 1.

Now we have: 
- House 1: person with phone, person with horses
- House 2: person with radio, person with boots (not possible, since boots are in house 1) and person with high heels.

So, the person with boots must be in house 2, and the person with high heels must be in house 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Let's break down the clues to figure out the house number where the person who likes green lives.

From clue 10, we know the person with a computer lives directly left of the person with a phone. Since the person with a computer lives next to the person who ate grilled cheese (clue 1), the person with a computer must live in the first house, and the person with a phone must live in the second house.

From clue 9, we know the person with loafers lives next to the person with a computer. Since the person with a computer lives in the first house, the person with loafers must live in the second house.

From clue 7, we know the person who had pizza does not live in the second house. So, the person who had pizza must live in the third house.

From clue 8, we know the person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes yellow. Since the person with loafers lives in the second house, the person who likes yellow must live in the third house. Therefore, the person who is eating mangos must live in the first house.

From clue 3, we know the person who is eating apples does not live in the first house. So, the person who is eating apples must live in the second house.

From clue 4, we know the person who is eating grapes lives to the right of the person who is wearing boots. Since the person with loafers lives in the second house, the person with boots must live in the first house. Therefore, the person who is eating grapes must live in the third house.

From clue 5, we know there is one house between the person who likes blue and the person who has a phone. Since the person with a phone lives in the second house, the person who likes blue must live in the first house.

From the above information, we can conclude that the person who likes green must live in the third house, which is option (C)."
"Let's break down the clues to figure out where the bird keeper lives.

From clue 3, we know the baseball player lives in the second house. 

From clue 7, we know the bird keeper does not live in the third house.

From clue 5, we know the bird keeper does not live in the first house.

So, the bird keeper can live in either the third or fourth house.

From clue 2, we know the basketball player lives to the left of the swimmer. Since the basketball player is not in the first house (clue 1), the basketball player must be in the third or fourth house.

From clue 4, we know the fish enthusiast lives to the right of the dog owner. Since the baseball player is in the second house, the dog owner must be in the first house (because the dog owner can't live to the right of the baseball player).

From clue 6, we know the tennis player lives directly left of the cat lover. Since the cat lover can't live in the first house (because the dog owner is in the first house), the cat lover must be in the second house. But we already know the baseball player is in the second house, so the cat lover must be in the third house.

Now we have a problem: the cat lover is in the third house, but the bird keeper can't be in the third house (clue 7). This means the bird keeper must be in the fourth house.

The answer is (C) 4."

So, the answer is (E) 1."
"Let's break down the clues to figure out who lives in which house.

From clue 3, the pianist and the person wearing high heels live next to each other. Since the pianist doesn't live in the first house (clue 1), the pianist and the person wearing high heels must live in either the second or third house.

- House 3: person wearing high heels, eating oranges, and having a television

However, we still need to figure out who is the pianist. From clue 3, the pianist and the person wearing high heels live next to each other. Since the person wearing high heels is in the third house, the pianist must be in the second house.

But this contradicts clue 6, which says the person with a radio lives to the left of the person wearing high heels. This means the person with a radio must be in the first house.

Now we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: person eating kiwis, wearing running shoes, and having a radio
- House 2: person eating bananas, wearing boots, and being the pianist
- House 3: person wearing high heels, eating oranges, and having a television

The person eating bananas must be the pianist, but we already know the pianist is in the second house. This means the person eating bananas is actually the percussionist. The person eating oranges is the violinist.

The correct order is:
- House 1: person eating kiwis, wearing running shoes, and having a radio
- House 2: person eating bananas, wearing boots, and being the pianist
- House 3: person wearing high heels, eating oranges, and having a television

The person with a television lives in the third house, so the answer is (C) 3."

"Let's figure this out step by step.

We know the person who eats kiwis lives in the first house (clue 5). 

The person who drives a truck does not live in the first house (clue 3) and the person who owns an SUV does not live in the third house (clue 2). 

Since the person who eats kiwis lives in the first house, the person who drives a truck can't live in the first house, so the person who drives a truck must live in the second house. 

The person who eats a banana does not live in the second house (clue 4), so the person who eats a banana must live in the third house. 

The person who owns an SUV can't live in the first or third house (clue 2), so the person who owns an SUV must live in the second house.

"Let's break down the clues to figure out where the person who owns a sedan lives.

From clue 8, the person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. This means the person who only drinks water lives in the house to the right of the person who drives a convertible.

From clue 6, there are two houses between where the person who owns a sedan lives and where the person who only drinks water lives. This means the person who owns a sedan lives in the first house.

"Let's break down the clues to figure out where the cellist lives.

From clue 10, we know the tea drinker lives in the fourth house.

From clue 5, we know the cellist lives directly left of the tea drinker. 

Since the tea drinker lives in the fourth house, the cellist must live in the third house.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Let's break down the clues to figure out where the person who drives a truck lives.

From clue 8, we know the basketball player lives directly left of the person who drives a truck. 

From clue 9, we know the person who drives a minivan lives in the fourth house.

From clue 7, we know the swimmer does not live in the first house. 

From clue 3, we know the swimmer lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan. 

From clue 4, we know the person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.

From clue 2, we know the person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who has a bouquet of lilies live directly next to each other.

From clue 5, we know the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.

From clue 6, we know the tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.

From clue 1, we know there is one house between where the coffee drinker lives and where the tennis player lives.

From clue 10, we know the root beer lover lives in the third house.

Now, let's put it all together:

- The person who drives a minivan lives in the fourth house (clue 9).
- The person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who has a bouquet of lilies live directly next to each other (clue 2).
- The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player (clue 5).
- The basketball player lives directly left of the person who drives a truck (clue 8).
- The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement (clue 4).

So, the order of houses from left to right is: 
- Basketball player
- Person with a bouquet of daffodils or lilies
- Person with a carnations arrangement
- Person who drives a truck
- Person who drives a minivan

Since the person who drives a minivan lives in the fourth house, the person who drives a truck must live in the third house.

The answer is (C) 3."

This is a contradiction, so we need to re-evaluate our assumptions.

From clue 3, the tea drinker does not live in the second house, so the tea drinker lives in either the first or the third house.

From clue 1, the person with a television lives directly left of the tea drinker. This means if the tea drinker is in the first house, the person with a television is in the first house, which is not possible because the person with a television lives directly left of the tea drinker. So, the tea drinker must be in the third house, and the person with a television is in the second house.

From clue 4, the person with a television lives directly left of the guitarist. Since the person with a television is in the second house, the guitarist must be in the third house.

From clue 5, there is one house between where the flutist lives and where the person who is eating a banana lives. This means the flutist and the banana eater are in the first and third houses, respectively.

"Let's figure this out step by step.

We know that the person who has a bouquet of lilies does not live in the first house (house 1). This means the person with lilies lives in house 2.

We also know that the person who has a television lives in the first house (house 1).

Since the person in house 1 has a television, the person in house 2 must have a computer.

So, the person who has a computer lives in house 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"Let's break down the clues:

1. The science fiction book fanatic lives to the left of the golfer.
2. The person who had pizza and the history book buff live next to each other.
3. The guitarist lives to the right of the person with a bouquet of daffodils.

From clue 2, we know the person who had pizza and the history book buff live next to each other. Since they live next to each other, one of them must live in house 1 and the other in house 2.

From clue 1, the science fiction book fanatic lives to the left of the golfer. This means the science fiction book fanatic must live in house 1, and the golfer must live in house 2.

From clue 3, the guitarist lives to the right of the person with a bouquet of daffodils. Since the science fiction book fanatic lives in house 1, the person with a bouquet of daffodils must live in house 2. This means the guitarist lives in house 1.

Now we have: 
- House 1: Science fiction book fanatic, guitarist, and the person who had pizza (since the history book buff lives next to the person who had pizza)
- House 2: Golfer, person with a bouquet of daffodils, and the history book buff

"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house.
2. The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
3. The baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other.
4. The person who only drinks water and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other.

From clue 2, we know the person who likes white lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. This means the person who likes white lives in house 1 and the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2.

From clue 3, the baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2, the baseball player must live in house 2 as well.

From clue 4, the person who only drinks water and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2, the person who only drinks water must live in house 2 as well.

Now we have a problem: the person who only drinks water and the baseball player both live in house 2, but we know the person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house. This means the person who is wearing running shoes must live in house 2, which is already occupied by the person who only drinks water and the baseball player. This is a contradiction.

However, we can resolve this by re-examining clue 3. The baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other. This means the baseball player cannot live in house 1, because the person who likes white lives in house 1. Therefore, the baseball player must live in house 2, and the person who ate spaghetti must live in house 1.

Now we have the person who ate spaghetti in house 1 and the person who likes white in house 2. The person who only drinks water and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other, so the person who only drinks water must live in house 1 as well.

The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house, so the person who is wearing running shoes must live in house 2. The person who likes red must live in house 2, because the person who likes white lives in house 1.

The person who is wearing loafers must be the swimmer, because the baseball player lives in house 2. The swimmer cannot live in house 1, so the swimmer must live in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 1."

3. The root beer lover does not live in the second house.
4. The person eating oranges does not live in the second house.

From clue 3, we know the root beer lover is not in the second house. Since there are only three houses, the root beer lover must be in either the first or the third house.

From clue 4, we know the person eating oranges is not in the second house. This means the person eating oranges must be in either the first or the third house.

From clue 1, we know the coffee drinker lives to the left of the person eating mangos. This means the person eating mangos must be in either the second or the third house.

Now, let's combine the information:

- The root beer lover is in either the first or the third house.
- The person eating oranges is in either the first or the third house.
- The person eating mangos is in either the second or the third house.

Since the person eating oranges is not in the second house, and the person eating mangos is in either the second or the third house, the person eating oranges must be in the third house. This means the person eating mangos is in the second house.

Now, we have:
- The person eating oranges is in the third house.
- The person eating mangos is in the second house.

From clue 1, the coffee drinker lives to the left of the person eating mangos, so the coffee drinker must be in the first house.

Now, we have:

From clue 2, the person drinking water lives to the right of the root beer lover. Since the person drinking water is not in the second house (because the person eating mangos is in the second house), the person drinking water must be in the third house.

Now, we have:
- The person eating oranges is in the third house.
- The person drinking water is in the third house.

This means the person eating oranges and the person drinking water are the same person, which is not possible. This is a contradiction, so our previous assumption is incorrect.

Let's try again:

- The person eating oranges is in either the first or the third house.
- The person eating mangos is in either the second or the third house.

Since the person eating oranges is not in the second house, and the person eating mangos is in either the second or the third house, the person eating oranges must be in the first house. This means the person eating mangos is in the second house.

So, the root beer lover must be in the third house is not possible because the person drinking water is already in the third house.

This is another contradiction, so our previous assumption is incorrect.

"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who is eating grapes does not live in the first house.
2. The baseball player lives in the second house.
3. The person who drives a convertible lives in the second house.

From clue 2 and 3, we know the person in the second house is a baseball player and drives a convertible.

From clue 1, the person who eats grapes does not live in the first house, so the person in the first house must eat mangos.

So, the person who eats mangos lives in the first house. The answer is (B) 1."
"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
2. The person who likes blue lives in the second house.
3. The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating kiwis.
4. The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges.

From clue 2, we know the person who likes blue lives in the second house. 

From clue 3, we know the person who likes blue lives to the left of the person who is eating kiwis. This means the person who is eating kiwis must live in the third house.

From clue 4, we know the person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges. Since the person who is eating kiwis lives in the third house, the person who is eating apples must live in the first house, and the person who is eating oranges must live in the second house.

Now, we have the order: 1 (apples), 2 (oranges), 3 (kiwis).

From clue 1, we know the person who likes white lives to the right of the person who likes green. Since the person who likes blue lives in the second house, the person who likes green must live in the first house. The person who likes white must live in the third house.

So, the person who likes white lives in house 3. The answer is (A) 3."
"Let's break down the clues:

1. The root beer lover lives to the right of the person with a rose bouquet.
2. The soccer player lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
3. The person with a gameboy lives to the left of the mystery book reader.

From clue 2, we know the soccer player lives left of the mystery book reader. Since the person with a gameboy also lives left of the mystery book reader (clue 3), the soccer player must live in house 1 and the person with a gameboy must live in house 2.

Now, from clue 1, the root beer lover lives to the right of the person with a rose bouquet. Since the person with a gameboy lives in house 2, the person with a rose bouquet must live in house 1 (because the root beer lover lives to the right of the person with a rose bouquet, and house 1 is the only option left).

So, the person with a rose bouquet lives in house 1. The answer is (B) 1."
"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who drives a minivan lives to the right of the fish enthusiast.
2. There are two houses between the truck driver and the dog owner.
3. The truck driver lives directly left of the sedan owner.
4. The fish enthusiast lives directly left of the dog owner.
5. The cat lover does not live in the second house.

From clue 4, we know the fish enthusiast lives directly left of the dog owner. This means the dog owner lives in either house 3 or 4.

From clue 2, there are two houses between the truck driver and the dog owner. If the dog owner lives in house 3, the truck driver would live in house 1, and there would be one house between them, not two. So, the dog owner must live in house 4.

From clue 3, the truck driver lives directly left of the sedan owner. If the truck driver lives in house 1, the sedan owner would live in house 2. But from clue 5, the cat lover does not live in the second house, and we know the fish enthusiast lives directly left of the dog owner (house 4). This means the cat lover must live in house 1, and the truck driver must live in house 2, which contradicts clue 3. Therefore, the truck driver must live in house 2, and the sedan owner lives in house 3.

Now we have the order: 1 (cat lover), 2 (truck driver), 3 (sedan owner), 4 (fish enthusiast and dog owner).

From clue 1, the minivan owner lives to the right of the fish enthusiast, so the fish enthusiast lives in house 4, and the dog owner lives in house 4.

The answer is (A) 4."
"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.
2. The person who likes yellow lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.
3. The root beer lover lives in the second house.
4. The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who only drinks water.
5. The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.

From clue 5, we know the person who likes yellow lives in the third house. 

From clue 2, we know the person who likes milk lives to the right of the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes yellow lives in the third house, the person who likes milk must live in the fourth house.

From clue 3, we know the root beer lover lives in the second house.

Now, let's look at the remaining houses: 1 and 4. We know the person who likes white lives to the right of the person who only drinks water (clue 4). Since the person who likes milk lives in the fourth house, the person who only drinks water must live in the first house.

"Let's figure this out step by step.

From clue 2, we know the dog owner does not live in the first house. 

From clue 1, we know the cellist lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy. This means the person with the gameboy lives in the second house (house 2), and the cellist lives in the first house (house 1).

Since the cellist lives in house 1 and the dog owner does not live in house 1, the dog owner must live in house 2. But we already know the person in house 2 has a gameboy. So, the dog owner must live in house 1 is incorrect.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who has a gameboy lives in the third house.
2. The person who drives a minivan lives in the first house.
3. The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
4. The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy.
5. The person who drives a convertible does not live in the third house.
6. The person who has a computer does not live in the first house.

From clue 1, we know the person with a gameboy lives in the third house.

From clue 2, we know the person with a minivan lives in the first house.

From clue 3, we know the person with a phone lives to the left of the person with an SUV. This means the person with a phone cannot live in the first house (because the person with a minivan lives there), so the person with a phone must live in the second house.

From clue 4, we know the person with a radio lives to the right of the person with a gameboy. Since the person with a gameboy lives in the third house, the person with a radio must live in the fourth house.

From clue 5, we know the person with a convertible does not live in the third house. This means the person with a convertible must live in either the first, second, or fourth house. However, we already know the first house is occupied by the person with a minivan, and the fourth house is occupied by the person with a radio. So, the person with a convertible must live in the second house.

From clue 6, we know the person with a computer does not live in the first house. We also know the person with a phone lives in the second house, so the person with a computer must live in the fourth house.

Now, let's summarize what we know:

- House 1: Minivan
- House 2: Phone
- House 3: Gameboy
- House 4: Radio

We still need to figure out who lives in the second house. We know the person with a phone lives in the second house, and the person with a convertible must live in the second house. This means the person with a phone and the person with a convertible are the same person.

We also know the person with a phone lives to the left of the person with an SUV. Since the person with a phone lives in the second house, the person with an SUV must live in the third house.

The correct answer is (B) 3."
"Let's break down the clues to figure out the house number of the person with a carnation arrangement.

From clue 6, we know the person with a computer lives in the second house.

This means the person with a rose bouquet lives in the second house (because the computer is in the second house), and the person with a carnation arrangement lives in the third house.

"Let's break down the clues:

1. The golfer lives directly left of the basketball player.
2. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
3. The soccer player lives in the third house.
4. The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
5. The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the third house.

From clue 3, we know the soccer player lives in the third house. 

From clue 1, the golfer lives directly left of the basketball player. This means the order of the houses for the golfer and basketball player is either 1-2 or 2-3. But since the soccer player is in the third house, the order must be 1-2 for the golfer and basketball player.

From clue 2, the person with lilies lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese. This means the person with lilies must live in the first house.

From clue 4, the person who ate grilled cheese lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. This means the person who ate spaghetti cannot live in the first house, so they must live in the second or third house.

From clue 5, the person with tulips does not live in the third house, so they must live in the first or second house.

Now we have a few possibilities:
- The person with lilies lives in the first house, the person with tulips lives in the second house, and the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the third house.
- The person with lilies lives in the first house, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the second house, and the person with tulips lives in the third house.

However, from clue 4, the person who ate grilled cheese lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. If the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the second house, then the person who ate spaghetti must live in the third house, but this contradicts clue 3, which says the soccer player lives in the third house.

So, the person with lilies lives in the first house, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the second house, and the person with tulips lives in the third house.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's break down the clues to figure out where the person who ate fried rice lives.

The answer is (D) 3."
"Let's break down the clues to figure out where the person wearing running shoes lives.

From clue 6, we know the person wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water live next to each other. 

From clue 4, the person who only drinks water lives to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese. 

Since the person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the first house (clue 7), the person who only drinks water and the person wearing high heels must live in the second or third house.

From clue 2, the person who had stew lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. 

From clue 5, the person wearing running shoes lives to the left of the person who had stew.

Since the person who had stew lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti, and the person wearing running shoes lives to the left of the person who had stew, the person wearing running shoes must live in the first house.

The answer is (C) 1."
"Let's break down the clues to figure out where the person with a computer lives.

From clue 8, we know the soccer player and the person with a computer live next to each other. 

From clue 6, we know the basketball player lives in the fourth house.

"Let's break down the clues to figure out where the violinist lives.

From clue 7, we know the saxophonist lives in the fourth house. Since the saxophonist and the violinist live directly next to each other (clue 6), the violinist must live in either the third or the fifth house.

From clue 5, we know the mystery book reader lives in the fourth house. But we already know the saxophonist lives in the fourth house, so the mystery book reader must be the saxophonist. This is a contradiction, so we need to re-evaluate the clues.

Let's re-evaluate clue 7. If the saxophonist lives in the fourth house, then the violinist must live in the fifth house. But this contradicts clue 5, which says the mystery book reader lives in the fourth house. So, the saxophonist and the mystery book reader cannot be in the fourth house.

From clue 7, we know the saxophonist lives in the fourth house. Since the saxophonist and the violinist live directly next to each other (clue 6), the violinist must live in the third house.

"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who has a television lives in the fourth house.

3. The person who has a phone does not live in the second house.
4. The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing loafers.
5. There are two houses between where the person who has a radio lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.

From clue 4, we know the person wearing boots lives to the left of the person wearing loafers. Since the person wearing loafers lives in the second house, the person wearing boots must live in the first house.

From clue 2, the person wearing loafers lives in the second house. 

From clue 1, the person with a television lives in the fourth house.

From clue 5, there are two houses between the person with a radio and the person wearing sandals. Since the person wearing boots is in the first house and the person wearing loafers is in the second house, the person wearing sandals must be in the fourth house (because there are two houses between the person with a radio and the person wearing sandals, and the person with a television is in the fourth house).

So, the order of houses is: 1 (boots), 2 (loafers), ?, ?, 4 (television).

The person with a radio and the person with a phone are left. The person with a phone does not live in the second house (clue 3), so the person with a phone must live in the third house. The person with a radio must live in the first house.

The order of houses is: 1 (radio), 2 (loafers), 3 (phone), 4 (television).

The person with a gameboy is the only one left. The answer is (C) 1."

From clue 5, we know the person wearing running shoes lives in the third house. So, the coffee drinker must live in the first house.

From clue 3, we know the person who likes milk does not live in the first house. Since the person wearing high heels lives in the second house, the person who likes milk must live in the third house.

- The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the third house (clue 3).

- If the person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house, then the person who had stew lives in the second house, the person who has a gameboy lives in the third house, and the person who has a rose bouquet lives in the fourth house. But this contradicts clue 3, so this is not possible.

- If the person who is wearing running shoes lives in the second house, then the person who had stew lives in the third house, the person who has a gameboy lives in the fourth house, and the person who has a rose bouquet lives in the first house. This is possible.

- The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals (clue 2).

From clue 1, we know the person with a rose bouquet lives to the left of the person with a bouquet of lilies. Since the person eating mangos lives in the first house, the person with a rose bouquet must live in the first house, and the person with a bouquet of lilies must live in the second house.

Now, we know the person eating apples lives in the second house, and the person with a bouquet of lilies also lives in the second house. This means the person eating apples and the person with a bouquet of lilies are the same person.

So, the person eating apples lives in the second house, which is answer (B)."

Since the person who is eating a banana lives directly left of the person who likes white (clue 5), and the person who owns an SUV and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other (clue 10), the person who owns an SUV must live in the first house. But from clue 8, the person who owns an SUV does not live in the second house, so the person who owns an SUV must live in the first house, which is already taken by the person who likes yellow. This means the person who is eating a banana must live in the second house.

From clue 12, the person who owns an SUV and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other. Since the person who owns an SUV lives in the first house, the person who likes blue must live in the second house.

"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who likes green lives in the third house.
2. The person who likes yellow and the person who likes green live directly next to each other.
3. The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
4. The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the second house.
5. The person who had stew lives directly left of the romance book lover.

From clue 1, we know the person who likes green lives in the third house.

From clue 2, we know the person who likes yellow lives next to the person who likes green, so the person who likes yellow must live in the second house.

From clue 5, we know the person who had stew lives directly left of the romance book lover. Since the person who likes green lives in the third house, the person who had stew must live in the first house, and the romance book lover must live in the second house.

From clue 4, we know the person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the second house, so the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the first house. But we already know the person who had stew lives in the first house, so the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the first house is incorrect. This means the person who had stew lives in the second house, and the romance book lover lives in the third house.

Now we have a problem, because we know the person who likes green lives in the third house, but we also know the romance book lover lives in the third house. This means the person who likes green must be the romance book lover, but we know the person who likes green is not the romance book lover. This is a contradiction.

However, we can try another approach. From clue 2, we know the person who likes yellow lives next to the person who likes green. From clue 1, we know the person who likes green lives in the third house. This means the person who likes yellow must live in the second house.

From clue 5, we know the person who had stew lives directly left of the romance book lover. Since the person who likes yellow lives in the second house, the person who had stew must live in the first house, and the romance book lover must live in the third house.

From clue 3, we know the fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew. Since the person who had stew lives in the first house, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the second house.

From clue 4, we know the person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the second house, so the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the first house.

Now we have a complete solution:

- House 1: The person who had stew, who likes blue (because the other colors are taken), and ate grilled cheese.
- House 2: The fantasy book enthusiast, who likes yellow, and ate pizza (because the other food is taken).
- House 3: The romance book lover, who likes green, and ate pizza (because the other food is taken).

The answer is (C) 1."
"Let's break down the clues to figure out where the bird keeper lives.

From clue 7, we know the person with carnations lives in the first house. 

From clue 1, the person with tulips and the bird keeper live next to each other. Since the person with carnations lives in the first house, the person with tulips and the bird keeper must live in the second and third houses.

From clue 4, the person who likes yellow lives in the third house. Since the person with tulips and the bird keeper live in the second and third houses, the person with tulips must live in the third house and the bird keeper must live in the second house.

So, the bird keeper lives in house 2."
"Let's break down the clues:

1. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house.
2. The cellist lives in the first house.
3. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.

From clue 1 and 2, we know the fantasy book enthusiast and the cellist live in the first house. Since the cellist lives in the first house, the fantasy book enthusiast must also live in the first house.

From clue 3, we know the person who likes green lives to the left of the person who likes red. Since the first house is already occupied by the fantasy book enthusiast (who is also the cellist), the person who likes green must live in the first house, and the person who likes red must live in the second house.

Now, we know the first house is occupied by the fantasy book enthusiast (cellist) and the person who likes green. The second house is occupied by the person who likes red.

The only person left is the mystery book reader, who must live in the second house, because the first house is already occupied by the fantasy book enthusiast. So, the mystery book reader lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."

"Let's figure this out step by step.

We know the history book buff lives in the first house. 

From clue 2, the golfer lives in the second house.

So, the order so far is: History book buff (House 1), Golfer (House 2).

From clue 1, there is one house between the swimmer and the science fiction book fanatic. This means the swimmer can't live in the first house (because there would be no house between them and the science fiction book fanatic), and the swimmer can't live in the third house (because there would be two houses between them and the science fiction book fanatic).

So, the swimmer must live in the third house.

The order is: History book buff (House 1), Golfer (House 2), Swimmer (House 3).

The answer is (C) 3."
"Let's break down the clues to figure out the order of the houses.

From clue 8, the bird keeper lives in the third house. 

From clue 7, the person who is eating a banana lives directly left of the soccer player. Since the bird keeper is in the third house, the person eating a banana must be in the second house, and the soccer player must be in the fourth house.

From clue 1, the swimmer lives directly left of the person who is eating apples. Since the soccer player is in the fourth house, the swimmer must be in the third house, but we already know the bird keeper is in the third house. This means the swimmer must be in the second house, and the person eating apples must be in the first house.

From clue 10, the person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast. Since the person eating apples is in the first house, the person eating grapes must be in the second house, but we already know the swimmer is in the second house. This means the person eating grapes must be in the first house, but we already know the person eating apples is in the first house. This is a contradiction, so we need to re-evaluate our previous conclusion. The person eating grapes must be in the second house, and the person eating apples must be in the third house, but we already know the bird keeper is in the third house. This means the person eating grapes must be in the second house, and the person eating apples must be in the fourth house, but we already know the soccer player is in the fourth house. This is another contradiction. The person eating grapes must be in the second house, and the person eating apples must be in the third house, but we already know the bird keeper is in the third house.

"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who owns horses.
2. The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.

From clue 1, we know the person wearing sandals lives to the left of the person who owns horses. This means the person who owns horses lives in house 2 (since house 1 is on the left).

From clue 2, we know the history book buff lives to the right of the person who ate spaghetti. This means the person who ate spaghetti cannot live in house 2 (since the history book buff lives to the right of the person who ate spaghetti, and the person who owns horses lives in house 2). So, the person who ate spaghetti must live in house 1.

Now, we know the person who owns horses lives in house 2 and the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 1. From clue 1, the person wearing sandals lives to the left of the person who owns horses, so the person wearing sandals must live in house 1. But we already know the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 1, and the person wearing sandals lives in house 1. This means the person who ate spaghetti and the person wearing sandals are the same person.

Now, we know the person who owns horses lives in house 2, and the person who ate spaghetti and the person wearing sandals live in house 1. The only thing left is the person who likes romance books and the person who likes history books. Since the history book buff lives to the right of the person who ate spaghetti, the history book buff must live in house 2. This means the person who likes romance books lives in house 1.

We know the person who ate spaghetti and the person wearing sandals live in house 1, and the person who likes romance books lives in house 1. This means the person who ate spaghetti, the person wearing sandals, and the person who likes romance books are the same person.

Now, we know the person who owns horses lives in house 2, and the person who ate fried rice lives in the other house (house 1). The person who ate fried rice is the only person left in house 1. So, the person who ate fried rice lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who owns a sedan lives to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies. This means the person with the sedan lives in house 1, and the person with the lilies lives in house 2.
2. The flutist does not live in the first house. This means the flutist lives in house 2.

Now, we know the person with the sedan lives in house 1, and the person with the lilies lives in house 2. But we also know the flutist lives in house 2. This means the person in house 1 must be the saxophonist, and the person in house 2 must be the flutist.

So, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in house 2. The answer is (B)."

"Let's break down the clues:

1. The pianist and the person who is eating kiwis live directly next to each other.
2. The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.
3. There is one house between where the person who is eating grapes lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.
4. There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.

From clue 4, we know there is one house between the violinist and the person eating kiwis. This means the person eating kiwis can't be in house 1 because there would be no house between them and the violinist. So, the person eating kiwis must be in either house 2 or 3.

From clue 3, there is one house between the person eating grapes and the person eating kiwis. This means the person eating grapes can't be in house 1 because there would be no house between them and the person eating kiwis. So, the person eating grapes must be in either house 1 or 2.

From clue 2, the flutist lives to the right of the violinist. This means the violinist can't be in house 3 because the flutist would have to be in house 4, which doesn't exist. So, the violinist must be in either house 1 or 2.

Now, let's combine the information. If the violinist is in house 1, the person eating kiwis would be in house 3 (from clue 4), and the person eating grapes would be in house 2 (from clue 3). But this would mean the pianist would be in house 1, which contradicts clue 1. So, the violinist can't be in house 1.

If the violinist is in house 2, the person eating kiwis would be in house 4, but there is no house 4. So, the violinist can't be in house 2.

This means the violinist must be in house 3. The person eating kiwis would be in house 2 (from clue 4), and the person eating grapes would be in house 1 (from clue 3).

From clue 1, the pianist lives next to the person eating kiwis, so the pianist must be in house 1.

The answer is (C) 1."

"Let's figure this out step by step.

We know the science fiction book fanatic lives in the first house. 

From clue 1, the coffee drinker lives to the left of the person wearing sandals. Since the science fiction book fanatic is in the first house, the coffee drinker must be in the second house because the person wearing sandals can't be in the first house (because the science fiction book fanatic is already there).

Now we have:
- House 1: Science fiction book fanatic
- House 2: Coffee drinker

The person in house 1 can't be the romance book lover because the science fiction book fanatic is already in house 1. The person in house 2 can't be the romance book lover because the coffee drinker is already in house 2.

So, the romance book lover must be in the house that we haven't assigned yet, which is the house that the person wearing sandals lives in. But we know the person wearing sandals can't be in house 1 (because the science fiction book fanatic is there) and can't be in house 2 (because the coffee drinker is there). 

So, the person wearing sandals must be in house 1, and the romance book lover must be in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's figure this out step by step.

We know the percussionist lives directly left of the person who has a radio. Since the houses are numbered 1 and 2 from left to right, the percussionist must live in house 1 and the person with the radio must live in house 2.

Now, we know the pianist and the person with the phone are the only ones left. Since the percussionist lives in house 1, the pianist must live in house 2 (because the pianist and percussionist play different instruments).

So, the person with the phone must live in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who drives a convertible lives in the second house.
2. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives.
3. The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.

From clue 1, we know the person who drives a convertible lives in the second house.

So, the person who likes yellow must live in either the first or the third house. 

From clue 2, we know there is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives. This means the person who owns a sedan can't live in the first house because there would be no house between the person who likes white and the person who owns a sedan. 

So, the person who owns a sedan must live in the third house. 

Since the person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan, the person who likes yellow must live in the first house.

This means the person who owns a sedan lives in the third house, which is a contradiction. This means the person who owns an SUV lives in the second house, and the person who drives a minivan lives in the third house.

From clue 8, the fish enthusiast does not live in the third house. This means the fish enthusiast lives in the fourth or fifth house.

"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
2. The person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
3. The person who ate fried rice lives in the second house.
4. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house.

From clue 3 and 4, we know the person who ate fried rice and the fantasy book enthusiast both live in the second house. But clue 4 says the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house, so the person who ate fried rice must be the fantasy book enthusiast.

Now, we know the person who ate fried rice is the fantasy book enthusiast, and from clue 1, the person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the person who ate fried rice. So, the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first house.

The only person left is the science fiction book fanatic, and from clue 2, the person who ate fried rice (fantasy book enthusiast) lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. So, the science fiction book fanatic must live in the first house, but we already know the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house. This means the science fiction book fanatic must be the person who ate spaghetti, which is not possible because the person who ate spaghetti is the fantasy book enthusiast.

However, we can still figure out the house number of the person who ate grilled cheese. We know the person who ate fried rice (fantasy book enthusiast) lives in the second house. The person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the person who ate fried rice, so the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first house. The science fiction book fanatic must live in the third house because the person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.

The only person left is the person who ate grilled cheese. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house, the person who ate fried rice lives in the second house, and the science fiction book fanatic lives in the third house, the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the first house is not possible because the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house. The person who ate fried rice lives in the second house, so the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the third house.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Let's figure this out step by step. 

We know that the person with the carnations arrangement lives to the left of the dog owner. Since there are only two houses, the person with the carnations arrangement can either live in house 1 or house 2.

If the person with the carnations arrangement lived in house 2, then the dog owner would have to live in house 1, which would mean the person in house 1 has a vase of tulips and the person in house 2 has a carnations arrangement. But we know the person with the carnations arrangement lives to the left of the dog owner, so this can't be true.

So, the person with the carnations arrangement must live in house 1."
"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
2. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
3. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the second house.

From clue 3, we know the person eating kiwis lives in house 2. Since the person in house 1 is eating grapes (because the other person is eating kiwis), we can start to figure out the order.

From clue 2, the person wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who likes yellow. Since the person in house 1 is eating grapes (not yellow), the person in house 1 must like green (because the other person likes yellow). So, the person in house 1 is wearing sandals and likes green.

Now, from clue 1, the person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the person in house 1 is wearing sandals, the person who only drinks water must live in house 1. But this contradicts the fact that the person in house 1 is eating grapes (not drinking water). So, the person who only drinks water must live in house 2.

Now, we know the person in house 2 is eating kiwis and drinking water. The person in house 1 is eating grapes and wearing sandals. The person in house 2 is wearing high heels (because the person in house 1 is wearing sandals).

So, the person who is wearing high heels lives in house 2. The answer is (B)."
"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who is wearing high heels lives to the left of the person who is wearing sandals.
2. The person who is eating grapes and the person who is wearing sandals live directly next to each other.
3. The tea drinker lives to the left of the person who has a television.

From clue 2, we know the person eating grapes and the person wearing sandals live next to each other. Since the person wearing high heels lives to the left of the person wearing sandals (clue 1), the person wearing high heels must be eating grapes. 

Now, we know the person wearing sandals is eating grapes. The person wearing sandals can't be the tea drinker because the tea drinker lives to the left of the person with a television (clue 3). So, the person wearing sandals is eating grapes, and the person wearing high heels is eating grapes as well, which is not possible. This means the person wearing high heels must be eating grapes, and the person wearing sandals must be eating kiwis.

Since the person wearing high heels is eating grapes and lives to the left of the person wearing sandals (clue 1), the person wearing high heels must live in house 1. The person wearing sandals lives in house 2.

So, the person eating kiwis lives in house 2. The answer is (A) 2."
"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who only drinks water lives to the right of the cellist.
2. There is one house between the violinist and the guitarist.
3. The tea drinker lives in the first house.
4. The violinist does not live in the third house.

From clue 3, we know the tea drinker lives in the first house. 

From clue 4, we know the violinist does not live in the third house, so the violinist can live in either the first or the second house. But since the tea drinker lives in the first house, the violinist must live in the second house.

Now, from clue 2, there is one house between the violinist and the guitarist. This means the guitarist must live in the third house.

So, the guitarist lives in the third house. The answer is (C)."
"Let's break down the clues to find the answer.

From clue 3, we know the person wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. 
From clue 1, we know the person wearing sandals lives in the third house.

So, the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house because the person wearing sandals lives in the third house and they are directly left of each other.

The answer is (B) 4."
"Let's break down the clues to figure out where the person who ate spaghetti lives.

From clue 7, we know the person who had pizza lives in the fourth house. 

From clue 8, we know the person who has a computer does not live in the fourth house.

From clue 1, we know the person who has a gameboy and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other. Since the person who has a computer does not live in the fourth house, the person who has a gameboy also cannot live in the fourth house.

From clue 7, we know the person who had pizza lives in the fourth house. So, the person who has a gameboy and the person who has a computer must live in the first, second, or third house.

From clue 5, we know the person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. This means the person who ate spaghetti lives to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese.

From clue 3, we know there is one house between where the person who ate grilled cheese lives and where the person who has a radio lives. This means the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first or second house, and the person who has a radio lives in the third or fourth house.

From clue 6, we know the person who has a radio does not live in the fourth house. So, the person who has a radio lives in the third house.

From clue 5, we know the person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who has a radio lives in the third house, the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the second house, and the person who ate spaghetti must live in the third house.

So, the person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house, which is option (C)."

From clue 5, the person who ate fried rice and the person who is eating oranges live directly next to each other. So, the person who is eating oranges lives in the fourth house.

From clue 17, the percussionist lives in the fourth house. But we already know the person in the fourth house is eating oranges. So, the percussionist must be eating oranges, which is a contradiction. This means our previous assumption about the person eating oranges is incorrect. 

However, from clue 5, the person who ate fried rice and the person who is eating oranges live directly next to each other. This means the person who ate fried rice lives in the fourth house, and the person who is eating oranges lives in the third house.

From clue 10, the person who had stew and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other. Since the person who ate fried rice lives in the fourth house, the person who had stew and the person who is eating a banana must live in the fifth house.

The correct answer is (D) 4."

1. The person who ate grilled cheese lives to the right of the bird keeper.

Now, we know the bird keeper lives in house 1 and the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house 2. The person in house 1 is the percussionist, and the person in house 2 is the person who ate grilled cheese.

The only person left is the guitarist, who must live in house 2 and eat pizza. So, the person who had pizza lives in house 2.

"Let's break down the clues to figure out where the person who is eating kiwis lives.

From clue 6, we know the person who is eating grapes lives in the second house. 

From clue 2, we know the person who likes green and the person who likes red live directly next to each other. Since the person who is eating grapes lives in the second house, the person who likes green and the person who likes red must be in the first and third houses, or the second and fourth houses. But from clue 4, the person who likes green lives to the left of the person who likes yellow, so the person who likes green must be in the first house and the person who likes red must be in the third house.

"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges.
2. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the cat lover.
3. The mystery book reader and the person who had stew live directly next to each other.

From clue 3, we know the mystery book reader and the person who had stew live next to each other. 

From clue 2, we know the mystery book reader lives directly left of the cat lover. This means the person who had stew must be the cat lover, because they live next to each other.

Now, let's look at clue 1. The person who is wearing running shoes lives to the right of the person who is eating oranges. If the person who had stew (cat lover) is in house 1, then the person eating oranges would be in house 2, and the person wearing running shoes would be in house 3, which is not possible since there are only 2 houses.

So, the person who had stew (cat lover) must be in house 2."

"Let's figure this out step by step.

From clue 3, we know the dog owner lives to the left of the person with tulips. 

From clue 2, we know the dog owner does not live in the second house. So, the dog owner must live in either house 1 or house 3.

If the dog owner lives in house 1, then the person with tulips must live in house 2 (because the dog owner lives to the left of the person with tulips). But then, the person with carnations would have to live in house 3, which is to the right of the bird keeper. This is okay, so this is a possible solution.

If the dog owner lives in house 3, then the person with tulips must live in house 2 (because the dog owner lives to the left of the person with tulips). But then, the person with carnations would have to live in house 1, which is to the left of the bird keeper. This is not okay, so this is not a possible solution.

So, the dog owner lives in house 1, the person with tulips lives in house 2, and the person with carnations lives in house 3.

"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who is eating mangos lives in the first house.
2. The person who owns horses does not live in the first house.
3. The bird keeper and the person who is eating kiwis live directly next to each other.
4. The person who is eating a banana does not live in the third house.
5. The person who owns horses does not live in the second house.
6. The person who is eating a banana lives directly left of the dog owner.

From clue 1, the person eating mangos lives in house 1.

From clue 2, the person who owns horses does not live in house 1, so they can live in house 2, 3, or 4.

From clue 3, the bird keeper and the person who is eating kiwis live directly next to each other. This means they can live in houses 1 and 2, or houses 3 and 4.

From clue 4, the person who is eating a banana does not live in the third house. This means the person eating a banana can live in house 1, 2, or 4.

From clue 5, the person who owns horses does not live in the second house. This means the person who owns horses can live in house 3 or 4.

From clue 6, the person who is eating a banana lives directly left of the dog owner. This means the person eating a banana lives in house 2, and the dog owner lives in house 3.

Now we have the following information:
- House 1: person eating mangos
- House 2: person eating banana
- House 3: dog owner
- House 4: unknown

From clue 3, the bird keeper and the person who is eating kiwis live directly next to each other. Since the person eating a banana lives in house 2, the bird keeper and the person eating kiwis must live in houses 1 and 3, or houses 3 and 4.

However, the dog owner lives in house 3. So, the bird keeper and the person eating kiwis must live in houses 1 and 3.

The bird keeper lives in house 3."
"Let's break down the clues:

1. The romance book lover does not live in the third house.
2. The person who owns horses does not live in the third house.
3. The bird keeper lives directly left of the history book buff.
4. The mystery book reader lives in the first house.

From clue 4, we know the mystery book reader lives in the first house. 

From clue 3, the bird keeper lives directly left of the history book buff. This means the history book buff cannot live in the first house because the bird keeper would have to live in the first house, and there's no space for the history book buff to live directly left of the bird keeper. So, the history book buff must live in the second house, and the bird keeper lives in the first house.

Now, we have the first house: bird keeper (mystery book reader can't be in the first house, but the bird keeper is, so this is a contradiction, but we know the mystery book reader lives in the first house, so the bird keeper must be in the first house, and the history book buff is in the second house).

So, the first house is the bird keeper, the second house is the history book buff, and the third house is left. The only one left is the romance book lover, so the romance book lover lives in the third house.

The answer is (C) 3."

From clue 1, the person who likes white lives directly left of the person who likes red. So, the person who likes red lives in the third house.

From clue 12, the person who is eating a banana lives in the third house.

The answer is (D) 3."

From clue 5, we know the person who had stew lives to the left of the history book buff. Since the person who had stew is in the third house, the history book buff must be in the third house as well.

"Let's figure this out step by step.

From clue 3, we know the violinist lives in the second house. 

From clue 2, we know the basketball player lives in the second house. Since the violinist and the basketball player both live in the second house, the basketball player must be the violinist. But that can't be true because the violinist and the basketball player are two different people. So, the basketball player and the violinist can't be the same person. This means the basketball player lives in the second house, but the violinist lives in the second house. This is a contradiction. 

However, we can still use clue 2 to say that the basketball player lives in the second house. 

From clue 3, we know the violinist lives in the second house. This means the basketball player and the violinist both live in the second house. This is a contradiction, but we can still use clue 2 to say that the basketball player lives in the second house.

From clue 1, we know the cellist lives to the right of the cricketer. This means the cellist can't live in the first house because the cricketer would have to live to the left of the cellist, but the cricketer can't live in the first house because the cricketer can't live to the left of the cellist. So, the cricketer must live in the first house, and the cellist must live in the third house.

Now we know the cricketer lives in the first house, the basketball player lives in the second house, and the cellist lives in the third house. The only person left is the violinist, but we already know the violinist lives in the second house. This is a contradiction, but we can still use clue 3 to say that the violinist lives in the second house.

From clue 11, we know the person who owns horses lives in the fourth house. Since the person who owns horses is the violinist (from clue 3), the fourth house is occupied by the violinist.

From clue 2, we know the coffee drinker lives in the fourth house. Since the fourth house is already occupied by the violinist, the coffee drinker must be the person who plays a different instrument, which is the percussionist or the guitarist. However, the guitarist cannot live in the fourth house (from clue 5), so the coffee drinker is the percussionist.

From clue 10, we know the person who only drinks water and the tennis player live directly next to each other. Since the fourth house is occupied, the person who only drinks water and the tennis player must live in the first, second, or third house.

This means the guitarist must live in the second house, and the cricketer must live in the first house.

From clue 10, we know the person who only drinks water and the tennis player live directly next to each other. Since the cricketer lives in the first house, the person who only drinks water must live in the second house, and the tennis player must live in the third house.

3. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan.
4. The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a convertible.

So, the order of the first four houses is: oranges, apples, daffodils, minivan.

The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives one house to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement, and there is one house between the person who has a carnations arrangement and the person who has a bouquet of lilies. 

The person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house, and the person who is eating a banana also lives in the fourth house. 

The person who owns a sedan lives to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement. 

The order of the houses is: oranges, apples, daffodils, minivan, SUV (banana).

2. The romance book lover does not live in the first house.
3. The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese.
4. The soccer player lives in the second house.

From clue 4, we know the soccer player lives in the second house. Since the soccer player is in the second house, the person in the first house must be the golfer (because the person in the first house can't be the soccer player).

From clue 2, we know the romance book lover does not live in the first house, so the romance book lover must live in the second house. But we already know the soccer player lives in the second house, so the romance book lover must be the soccer player's neighbor, which is not possible. This means the romance book lover must live in the first house, and the soccer player must be the romance book lover's neighbor, which is not possible either. This is a contradiction, but we can resolve it by re-examining the clues.

From clue 4, we know the soccer player lives in the second house. From clue 1, we know the person who likes blue lives directly left of the root beer lover. Since the soccer player lives in the second house, the person who likes blue must live in the first house. 

From clue 3, we know the root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese. Since the person who likes blue lives in the first house, the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the first house. The person who ate grilled cheese can't be the root beer lover because the root beer lover lives to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese. The only person left in the first house is the romance book lover, so the person who ate grilled cheese must be the romance book lover. But we know the romance book lover does not live in the first house (clue 2), which is a contradiction. This means our initial assumption that the person who likes blue lives in the first house is incorrect.

Let's re-examine the clues. From clue 4, we know the soccer player lives in the second house. From clue 2, we know the romance book lover does not live in the first house. From clue 1, we know the person who likes blue lives directly left of the root beer lover. Since the soccer player lives in the second house, the person who likes blue must live in the first house. The only person left in the first house is the person who ate grilled cheese, but we know the root beer lover lives to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese. This means the person who ate grilled cheese can't be in the first house, so the person who likes blue must be in the first house, and the person who ate grilled cheese must be in the second house.

From clue 3, we know the root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese. Since the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the second house, the root beer lover must live in the second house.

From clue 6, the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who likes green."
"Let's break down the clues:

1. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff.
2. The mystery book reader lives in the first house.
3. The person who has a computer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone.
4. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the person who has a television.

From clue 1 and 2, we know the mystery book reader lives in house 1 and the history book buff lives in house 3 (since they are directly next to each other and the mystery book reader is in house 1).

From clue 4, we know the mystery book reader lives directly left of the person who has a television. Since the mystery book reader is in house 1, the person with a television must be in house 2.

Now, from clue 3, we know the person with a computer lives to the right of the person with a phone. Since the person with a television is in house 2, the person with a phone must be in house 1 (because the person with a computer can't be in house 1, as the mystery book reader is in house 1). But we already know the mystery book reader is in house 1, so this is a contradiction.

However, we can re-evaluate clue 3. It says the person with a computer lives to the right of the person with a phone. This means the person with a phone can't be in house 1, because the mystery book reader is in house 1. So, the person with a phone must be in house 2, and the person with a computer must be in house 3.

Now we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: mystery book reader
- House 2: person with a phone
- House 3: person with a computer

The only type of book left is science fiction, so the science fiction book fanatic must live in house 2."
"(A) No

St. Vitus's Dance, also known as Sydenham chorea, is a neurological disorder that affects the nervous system. It's characterized by involuntary movements, especially in the face, arms, and legs. People with this condition often experience involuntary movements that can be quite unpredictable and uncontrollable. Ballet requires a lot of control and coordination, which is hard to achieve when you have involuntary movements. So, it's unlikely that someone with St. Vitus's Dance would be able to perform well in a ballet competition."
(B) Yes.
"(B) No. Ringo Starr is a British musician, best known as the drummer for the Beatles. I don't think he would avoid the pot roast at a restaurant."
"I think (B) Yes. The 1936 Summer Olympics were held in Berlin, Germany, and the main stadium was the Olympiastadion. I think it could hold around 100,000 people. A Super Bowl crowd is usually much bigger, it can be over 65,000 people."
(B) Yes
"(B) No

Seedless cucumbers are often a type of parthenocarpic cucumber, which means they grow without fertilization. However, this can also mean they don't have seeds, but they still have the same plant structure. This means they can still attract pests like aphids, whiteflies, and spider mites, which can be a problem for gardeners with entomophobia (fear of insects)."
"(B) No

Martin Luther wrote 95 theses, not one theses a day. He nailed them to the door of the Castle Church in Wittenberg, Germany, which is a famous event in history that started the Protestant Reformation."
"(B) Yes. Waltz is generally considered a low-impact dance style, which means it's less likely to cause injuries compared to high-impact dances like slam dance. In waltz, the movements are smooth and gliding, with a rise and fall motion that doesn't put a lot of stress on the joints. Slam dance, on the other hand, involves a lot of jumping, spinning, and quick movements that can be tough on the knees, ankles, and other joints."
"(B) No

The 1943 penny is made of copper-plated zinc, not silver. During World War II, the US government switched from making pennies with a copper core to zinc due to copper shortages. The 1943 pennies are not made of silver, so they wouldn't be good for making silverware."
"(B) Yes. I think it would be really hard to snowboard on Venus. First, there's no snow on Venus. It's a really hot planet with thick clouds of sulfuric acid and it's always super hot there."
"(B) No. Charlemagne's father was Pepin the Short. The Battle of Tours was actually fought in 732 AD, and it was won by Charles Martel, who was Pepin's son and Charlemagne's grandfather."

(B) No.
(B) Yes. Ariana Grande has talked about her struggles with PTSD after the Manchester Arena bombing in 2017. She has used her platform to raise awareness about PTSD and mental health.

"(A) No. Simon Cowell is a music executive and TV personality, not a government official. He doesn't have the authority to vote for the next Supreme Court judge."
"I think I know this one. Jack Dempsey was a famous boxer, but he passed away in 1983. Conor McGregor is a UFC fighter, and he started his career in the UFC in 2013. Since Jack Dempsey was already dead by then, I think the answer is (A) No."
I don't know.
"(A) Yes. Euphoria is a feeling of extreme happiness or excitement. Some people who use drugs might feel euphoric when they take them, especially in the beginning. But, it's not a good thing because it can lead to addiction."
"I think (B) Yes. Apollo is the Greek god of the sun, and D'Artagnan is a character from a book called ""The Three Musketeers."" D'Artagnan is a human, and Apollo is a god. Since gods are usually stronger and more powerful than humans, Apollo could probably defeat D'Artagnan. If we're talking about all the famous Apollos, they would be gods, and they would be stronger than all the D'Artagnans, who are just humans. So, I think the Apollos could defeat the D'Artagnans."
"I think I know this one.  Bob Marley died from skin cancer, right?  I remember learning about him in school.  Sunscreen is supposed to help prevent skin cancer by blocking the sun's UV rays.  So, if it helps prevent skin cancer, then it would be helpful, not unhelpful.  The answer is (A) No."
"(B) No 

The French Defence is a chess opening that starts with the moves 1.e4 e6. It's a solid and popular choice among players, but it's not strong enough to defend against a four-move checkmate."
"(B) No. Chlorine is used to disinfect water, but it's not safe to drink after a week. Chlorine can cause stomach problems and other health issues if it's not removed from the water after a certain period."
"(B) No

A dichromat is someone who has red-green color blindness, which means they have trouble telling the difference between these two colors. Chlorine gas and neon gas don't have colors that are red or green, so a dichromat wouldn't have trouble distinguishing between them based on color."
"(B) No

Elizabeth I was born in 1533 and died in 1603. The play ""Dido, Queen of Carthage"" is a play by Christopher Marlowe, and it was written around 1586-1587."
"(B) No 

You can't completely avoid internet trolls on Reddit, but you can minimize your interactions with them. Reddit has a lot of users who post mean comments, but you can block them or report them if they're being mean or spamming."
"I think sea turtles are enjoying life during quarantine. They are living in their natural habitats, swimming in the ocean, and eating their favorite foods like seaweed and jellyfish. They don't have to worry about going to school or doing homework like we do. They just get to relax and be themselves."
"(B) No

I don't think Jesus would understand the Easter Bunny. The Easter Bunny is a tradition that comes from European folklore and is associated with Easter eggs and chocolate. It's not something that Jesus would have known about because it's a modern tradition that started a long time after he lived."
"(B) Yes. Elephants are much bigger and stronger than macaques. They can weigh up to 6 tons, while macaques usually weigh around 5-10 kg. Elephants also have long trunks that can be used as a weapon, and their tusks can cause serious harm."

(B) Yes.
(B) Yes.  I think the most expensive color in the world is blue.  I read that the pigment ultramarine blue is very expensive.  It's made from a type of rock called lapis lazuli.
"(B) No

Ryan Crouser is a professional American track and field athlete who specializes in the shot put and discus throw. He's a world champion and Olympic medalist.

"(B) Yes. The Jackson 5 had 5 members: Michael, Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, and Marlon. The Isley Brothers had 3 brothers: Ronald, Rudolph, and O'Kelly."

I'm not sure what Khanbaliq is.
"(B) Yes. People with Anorexia nervosa often have a lower body mass index (BMI) due to extreme weight loss. This can lead to weaker bones, making them more prone to breaking or fracturing."
"(A) Yes. I think I learned about this in school. Travelers on the Oregon Trail did sing sea shanties. But, I remember that the Oregon Trail was a land route, not a sea route. So, they must have sung songs similar to sea shanties, but not exactly the same. They called them ""singing songs"" or ""traveling songs"" to help them stay motivated and lift their spirits during the long journey."
"I think I know this one.  Michael Vick was a football player who got in trouble for dog fighting. He got a lot of prison time for that. But, I think shooting a bald eagle is a big no-no too. It's a protected bird, you know. If you hurt or kill one, you can get in big trouble. I think it's a federal crime. So, I think shooting a bald eagle could get you more prison time than what Michael Vick got. So, the answer is (A) Yes."
"(B) No 

Gandhi was born in 1869 and passed away in 1948. The first episode of Bonanza aired in 1959."
"(B) Yes. Hornets don't live in the ocean, but their nests can be found near water bodies. Hornets are a type of wasp, and their nests can sometimes be near the ocean. However, hornets themselves don't live in the ocean."
"I think it's (A) No. I've heard that Esperanza Base is in Antarctica, and it's really, really cold there. I don't think it's a good idea to wear sandals outside because it would be too cold and might even hurt your feet."
"I think I know this one. Grey seals are marine mammals that live in the ocean, and they can be found in the North Atlantic and Arctic waters. Moby Dick is a sperm whale, which also lives in the ocean, but it's found in the world's oceans, not just the North Atlantic and Arctic. But, I think they can live in the same water. So, the answer is (A) Yes."
(B) Yes.
(B) Yes.
(B) No. I don't think people celebrate Earth Day with a ceremonial tire fire. Earth Day is a day to help protect the Earth and keep it clean. Burning tires would actually hurt the environment.
(B) No
"(B) Yes. A hamster can experience two leap years. A leap year is when the Earth takes 366 days to orbit the sun. Since hamsters are living creatures, they experience time just like we do. If a hamster is alive for two years, it will experience two leap years if those years are leap years."
(A) No.
"(B) Yes. The 23rd Amendment to the United States Constitution gave the District of Columbia electoral votes, but it also gave the right to vote for president to residents of the District of Columbia."

He's also very skilled at moving huge objects like trees and rocks. As an urban planner, he could use his strength to move massive construction materials and build structures quickly. His size would also allow him to see the big picture and plan cities on a large scale."
"(A) Yes. Parsley is often used in many different types of dishes, like salads, soups, and as a garnish. Because of this, it's usually found in multiple sections of the grocery store, like the produce section, the salad bar, and sometimes even the international or specialty food section."

"(B) Yes. The Gunpowder Plot was a failed assassination attempt in 1605 to blow up the English House of Lords during the state opening of the English Parliament. The plot was led by a group of conspirators, including Robert Catesby, who were mostly English Catholics. 

Mary, Queen of Scots, was a Catholic and the granddaughter of Margaret Tudor, who was the sister of Henry VIII. This made Mary a claimant to the English throne. However, she was executed in 1587 for her role in plotting against Queen Elizabeth I.

The Gunpowder Plot failed, but it was a significant event in English history. The plot's failure meant that the conspirators' goal of restoring Catholicism in England and placing a Catholic on the throne, possibly Mary's son James VI of Scotland (who later became James I of England), was not achieved. However, James I of England was the next in line to the throne after Elizabeth I, and he became the King of England, Scotland, and Ireland in 1603."

The Communist Party of the Soviet Union would not support Trickle Down Economics.

This idea is in direct conflict with the Communist Party's goal of reducing economic inequality and promoting social welfare."

Leopard seals are wild animals that live in the cold waters of the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic. Keeping them in a tank at Sea World can be stressful for them. They might not have enough space to swim and hunt like they do in the wild. This can make them sick.

"I think (A) No. I've seen some of my friends' parents watching Days of Our Lives, and they say it's a pretty old show. They usually watch it for free on TV or on their streaming services. I don't think they would pay a thousand dollars for it."
"I think I've learned about jackrabbits in school. They are actually hares, not rabbits. And I remember that they are prey animals, which means they have to be careful about predators. European wildcats are predators, so I would say that black-tailed jackrabbits probably do fear them. So, the answer is (A) Yes."
"(B) Yes. The Forbidden City is a historical palace complex in Beijing, China, and it's closed to the public on certain days."

While it's very good at protecting armadillos from small predators like coyotes and wild boars, it's not strong enough to protect a human from a bullet. Franz Ferdinand was shot with a pistol by Gavrilo Princip, and the bullet was likely a 9mm or 7.65mm, which is too powerful for armadillo armor to stop."

Woodrow Wilson was the 28th President of the United States. He was a Democrat. The presidents before him, William Howard Taft, and the president after him, Warren G. Harding, were also Democrats."
"To answer this, we need to compare the heights of the three structures. 

The Statue of Unity is 182 meters tall. 
The Statue of Liberty is 93 meters tall. 
The Lighthouse of Alexandria is about 120-130 meters tall, but it was destroyed a long time ago, so we can't be 100% sure of its height. However, it's generally agreed to be around 120-130 meters. 

Since 182 is more than 93, the Statue of Unity is indeed taller than the Statue of Liberty. 
Now, comparing the Statue of Unity with the Lighthouse of Alexandria, 182 is more than 120, so the Statue of Unity is taller than the Lighthouse of Alexandria. 

So, the Statue of Unity is more level with the Statue of Liberty than the Lighthouse of Alexandria."

"To figure this out, we need to know the capacity of Tiger Stadium. Tiger Stadium in Detroit, Michigan, was built in 1912 and had a seating capacity of around 50,000 people. However, during the Great Depression, the stadium was often used for other events like football games, concerts, and even held large gatherings. 

The unemployment rate in the United States during the Great Depression peaked at around 24.9% in 1933. If we assume that all the unemployed people in the United States at that time could fit in the stadium, we need to calculate the total number of unemployed people.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the U.S. population in 1933 was approximately 123 million. If 24.9% of the population was unemployed, that would be around 30.6 million people. 

Since the stadium could hold around 50,000 people, we can divide 30.6 million by 50,000 to get an idea of how many groups of people could fit in the stadium. 

30,600,000 / 50,000 = 612 groups of people.

So, no, all the unemployed people due to the 1933 Great Depression could not fit in Tiger Stadium."
"I think the clerk of the Supreme Court of Canada is a very safe job. They work in an office, and it's not related to earthquakes."

Many people today consider this treatment to be unfair and a form of persecution due to his sexual orientation."

"(B) Yes. The double-slit experiment is a classic physics experiment that demonstrates the principles of wave-particle duality and interference. It's actually pretty simple to set up, and you can do it at home with some basic materials. You'll need a light source, a screen, a card or a wall to block the light, and two parallel slits. You can use a laser pointer or a flashlight as the light source, and a white sheet of paper or a screen to project the pattern. 

Here's how you can do it:

1. Shine the light through the two parallel slits.
2. Observe the pattern on the screen. You should see an interference pattern with bright and dark bands.
3. Now, try blocking one of the slits with the card or your hand. You should see two distinct light spots on the screen instead of the interference pattern.

This experiment shows that light can behave as a wave, and the interference pattern is a result of the light waves passing through both slits and interfering with each other."

In Christianity, the concept of Sheol is actually more related to the Jewish understanding of the afterlife. In the Old Testament, Sheol is a place where the dead reside, but it's not a place of reward or punishment. It's more like a neutral state of being.

JAG is a TV show that ran for 10 seasons with 251 episodes. If you watch one episode a day, it would take you 251 days to finish the show. Six months is 183 days, so it's not possible to watch all of JAG in six months."

Ukemi is a Japanese martial arts term that refers to the art of falling safely. It's a technique used in martial arts like judo and aikido to control and absorb the impact of a fall, rather than trying to prevent it.

Instead, it helps to slow down the fall and make it safer."

However, if we look at the actual information, the Declaration of Independence was written by a committee of five people, known as the Committee of Five, which included:

1. Thomas Jefferson
