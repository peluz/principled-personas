"Let's figure it out step by step.

From clue 5, the cat lover lives in the first house. 

From clue 1, the person with tulips lives to the right of the cat lover, so the cat lover is in house 1 and the person with tulips is in house 2.

From clue 2, the person with daffodils does not live in the second house, so the person with daffodils must live in either house 1, 3, or 4. But the cat lover is in house 1, so the person with daffodils must live in either house 3 or 4.

From clue 3, there is one house between the person who owns horses and the person with carnations. This means the person with carnations must live in either house 2 or 4. But the person with tulips is in house 2, so the person with carnations must live in house 4.

From clue 4, the person with lilies lives to the right of the person who owns horses. This means the person who owns horses must live in either house 1 or 2. But the cat lover is in house 1, so the person who owns horses must live in house 2. And the person with tulips is in house 2, so the person who owns horses must live in house 2 is incorrect. The person who owns horses must live in house 1 is incorrect as well because the cat lover is in house 1. The person who owns horses must live in house 3.

Now we have: 
- House 1: cat lover
- House 2: tulips
- House 3: horses
- House 4: carnations

From clue 4, the person with lilies lives to the right of the person who owns horses. This means the person with lilies must live in house 4.

Now we have: 
- House 1: cat lover
- House 2: tulips
- House 3: horses
- House 4: lilies

The only one left is the fish enthusiast. The answer is (D) 4."
"Let's figure it out step by step.

From clue 2, the person wearing boots does not live in the second house. This means the person wearing boots must live in the first house with the person who has a phone.

From clue 3, the person who owns horses and the person who has a radio live next to each other. Since the person with a phone lives in the first house, the person with a radio must live in the second house.

Now, we know the person with a radio lives in the second house, and the person with a phone lives in the first house. The person with a radio is not wearing boots (because the person with boots lives in the first house), so the person with a radio must be wearing high heels.

So, the person wearing high heels lives in the second house. The answer is (A) 2."

If the pianist lives in house 2, then the person who is wearing high heels lives in house 2 as well. But if the pianist lives in house 3, then the person who is wearing high heels lives in house 2. In both cases, the person who is wearing high heels lives in house 2.

From clue 6, the person who has a radio lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the person who is wearing high heels lives in house 2, the person who has a radio lives in house 1.

Now, let's put this together. If the basketball player lives directly left of the person who drives a truck, and the person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement, then the basketball player must live directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.

From clue 2, we know the person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who has a bouquet of lilies live directly next to each other. 

From clue 5, we know the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.

From clue 9, we know the person who drives a minivan lives in the fourth house.

"Let's figure it out step by step.

From clue 1, we know the tea drinker lives in the first house. 

From clue 2, the person eating apples lives to the left of the person driving a minivan. Since the tea drinker is in the first house, the person eating apples must be in the first house, and the person driving a minivan must be in the third house.

From clue 3, the person driving a convertible lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. This means the science fiction book fanatic can't be in the first house (tea drinker) or the third house (minivan). So, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the second house.

From clue 4, there is one house between the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker. Since the science fiction book fanatic is in the second house, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the first house (because there's one house between them), which we already know is the person eating apples. So, the coffee drinker must be in the third house.

From clue 5, the person eating oranges does not live in the second house. We already know the person eating apples is in the first house, and the person driving a minivan is in the third house. So, the person eating oranges must be in the second house.

From clue 1, we know the person who likes red lives directly left of the mystery book reader. This means the mystery book reader lives in the third house.

Since the person who likes red lives in the second house, the person who likes red must be in house 2, and the mystery book reader must be in house 3.

From clue 3, we know the person who likes white does not live in the third house. Since the mystery book reader lives in the third house, the person who likes white must live in either house 1 or house 2.

From clue 2, we know the fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house. This means the fantasy book enthusiast must live in either house 2 or house 3.

We already know the person who likes red lives in house 2, so the fantasy book enthusiast cannot live in house 2. Therefore, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in house 3.

But we also know the mystery book reader lives in house 3. This is a problem. We can't have two people living in the same house.

Let's go back to clue 2. It says the fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house. This means the fantasy book enthusiast can live in either house 2 or house 3. But we already know the person who likes red lives in house 2, and the mystery book reader lives in house 3.

"Let's figure this out step by step.

From clue 7, we know the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house.

From clue 8, the person who is eating a banana lives to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast. So, the person who is eating a banana lives in the fourth house.

From clue 4, the person who is eating apples does not live in the third house, and since the person who is eating a banana lives in the fourth house, the person who is eating apples must live in the first or second house.

From clue 3, the person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who is eating apples. This means the person who is eating apples cannot live in the first house because there is no house to the left of the first house. So, the person who is eating apples lives in the second house.

From clue 6, there is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is wearing boots lives. Since the person who is eating apples lives in the second house, the person who is wearing boots must live in the fourth house.

From clue 3, the person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who is eating apples. So, the person who is eating apples lives in the second house, and the person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house.

From clue 5, the person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals. This means the person who is wearing sandals must live in the fourth house, but we already know the person who is wearing boots lives in the fourth house.

From clue 2, the science fiction book fanatic lives to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast. Since the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house, the science fiction book fanatic must live in the fourth house.

"Let's figure it out. 

We know the person with a television lives in the first house. 

We also know the person with lilies does not live in the first house. 

So, the person with lilies must live in the second house. 

And the person with a television lives in the first house, so the person with a computer must live in the second house.

So, the person with a computer lives in house number 2. 

The answer is (A) 2."
"Let's figure it out step by step.

From clue 1, we know the science fiction book fanatic lives to the left of the golfer. 

From clue 2, we know the person who had pizza and the history book buff live next to each other. 

From clue 3, we know the guitarist lives to the right of the person with daffodils.

Now, let's put it together. 

Since the science fiction book fanatic lives to the left of the golfer, and the history book buff lives next to the person who had pizza, the history book buff must be the science fiction book fanatic's neighbor. 

So, the history book buff lives to the left of the science fiction book fanatic. 

The person with daffodils lives to the left of the guitarist. 

Now, let's put the people in order from left to right: 

1. History book buff
2. Science fiction book fanatic
3. Person with daffodils
4. Guitarist
5. Golfer

The person with daffodils is not the history book buff, the science fiction book fanatic, or the golfer. The only person left is the baseball player. 

The baseball player must be the person with daffodils. 

The person who had pizza and the history book buff live next to each other. The history book buff is in house 1, so the person who had pizza must be in house 2.

The science fiction book fanatic lives to the left of the golfer, so the science fiction book fanatic is in house 1, and the golfer is in house 3.

The person with daffodils is the baseball player, so the baseball player is in house 3. But we already know the golfer is in house 3. So, the baseball player must be in house 2, and the person with daffodils is in house 3.

The person with daffodils is the baseball player, and the baseball player is in house 2."

"Let's figure it out step by step.

From clue 3, we know the root beer lover does not live in the second house. 

From clue 4, we know the person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house. 

So, the second house must be either the house of the person eating grapes or the person drinking water.

From clue 2, we know the person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover. 

This means the person drinking water cannot live in the first house because if they did, the root beer lover would have to live in the second house, which is not allowed.

So, the person drinking water must live in the third house.

Now, the first house must be either the house of the person eating grapes or the person drinking coffee.

From clue 1, we know the coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person eating mangos. 

This means the person eating mangos must live in the third house because the person drinking water lives in the third house.

So, the first house must be the house of the person drinking coffee.

The second house must be the house of the person eating grapes.

The root beer lover must live in the house that is not the first, second, or third house. But we only have three houses. So, the root beer lover must live in the second house.

The answer is (A) 2."
"Let's figure it out step by step.

We know the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house (clue 3). 

The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice (clue 2). This means the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house because the person who ate spaghetti is in the first house, and the person who is wearing boots can't live in the first house (because the person who ate spaghetti lives there) or the second house (because the person who ate fried rice can't live in the second house, clue 1). 

So, the order is: 1 (spaghetti), 2 (unknown), 3 (fried rice).

The person who is wearing boots lives in the house to the left of the person who ate fried rice, which is the third house. But we know the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house, so the person who is wearing boots lives in the second house.

The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house (clue 4) and the person who is wearing boots lives in the second house. This means the person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house is not true, but we know the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house. So the person who is wearing loafers must live in the third house.

The answer is (C) 3."

"Let's figure it out. 

From clue 2, we know the dog owner does not live in the first house. 

From clue 1, we know the cellist lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy. This means the person with the gameboy lives in the second house. 

So, the cellist lives in the first house. 

Now, the person with the gameboy lives in the second house, and the cellist lives in the first house. 

Since the dog owner does not live in the first house, the dog owner must live in the second house.

"Let's figure it out step by step.

From clue 2, the person who drives a minivan lives in the first house.

From clue 3, the person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV. This means the person who owns an SUV cannot live in the first house because the person who drives a minivan lives in the first house. So, the person who owns an SUV can't be in the first house.

From clue 1, the person who has a gameboy lives in the third house.

From clue 4, the person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy. This means the person who has a radio lives in the fourth house because it's the only house to the right of the third house.

From clue 5, the person who drives a convertible does not live in the third house. This means the person who drives a convertible can live in the first, second, or fourth house.

From clue 6, the person who has a computer does not live in the first house. This means the person who has a computer can live in the second, third, or fourth house.

Now, let's put it all together:

- The person who drives a minivan lives in the first house.
- The person who has a radio lives in the fourth house.
- The person who has a gameboy lives in the third house.
- The person who has a computer can live in the second or fourth house, but the person who has a radio lives in the fourth house. So, the person who has a computer must live in the second house.

So, the person who owns an SUV lives in the third house."

"Let's try to figure it out step by step.

From clue 1, the cricketer lives in the second house. 
From clue 5, the fish enthusiast lives in the second house. But we already know the cricketer lives in the second house, so the fish enthusiast must be the cricketer. This is a problem because the cricketer is already assigned to the second house. Let's go back to clue 5 and re-evaluate it. It says the fish enthusiast lives in the second house, but it doesn't say it's the cricketer. So, the fish enthusiast lives in the second house, and the cricketer lives somewhere else.

From clue 7, the person who is wearing loafers and the cricketer live directly next to each other. Since the cricketer lives in the second house, the person who is wearing loafers must live in the first or third house.

From clue 6, the bird keeper lives in the first house. If the person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house, then the bird keeper and the person who is wearing loafers would be in the same house, which is not possible. So, the person who is wearing loafers must live in the third house.

From clue 8, there is one house between where the bird keeper lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives. Since the bird keeper lives in the first house, the person who is wearing sandals must live in the fourth house.

From clue 9, the person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the fourth house. Since the person who is wearing sandals lives in the fourth house, the person who is wearing running shoes must live in the first, second, or third house.

From clue 4, the person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the fifth house. We already know the person who is wearing sandals lives in the fourth house, so the person who is wearing running shoes must live in the first, second, or third house.

From clue 2, the cricketer lives in the second house. Since the person who is wearing running shoes cannot live in the second house, the person who is wearing running shoes must live in the first or third house.

From clue 7, the person who is wearing loafers and the cricketer live directly next to each other. Since the cricketer lives in the second house, the person who is wearing loafers must live in the first or third house. We already know the person who is wearing loafers lives in the third house, so the cricketer must live in the second house.

From clue 3, the tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals. Since the person who is wearing sandals lives in the fourth house, the tennis player must live in the first, second, or third house.

From clue 10, the baseball player lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing sandals. Since the person who is wearing sandals lives in the fourth house, the baseball player must live in the fifth house.

"Let's figure it out step by step.

From clue 2, we know the person with a radio lives to the left of the person who had pizza. 

From clue 1, we know the person with a radio and the person with a truck live next to each other. 

Since the person with a radio lives to the left of the person who had pizza, the person with a truck must live to the right of the person who had pizza.

From clue 3, we know the root beer lover does not live in the first house. This means the root beer lover must live in the second house.

From clue 4, we know the person eating grapes lives directly left of the person with a computer. This means the person with a computer must live in the second house, and the person eating grapes must live in the first house.

Now, let's put it all together:

- The person with a computer lives in the second house.
- The person eating grapes lives in the first house.
- The person with a truck lives to the right of the person who had pizza.
- The person with a radio lives next to the person with a truck.

Since the person with a computer lives in the second house, the person with a truck must live in the second house. But we already know the person with a computer lives in the second house, so the person with a truck cannot live in the second house. This means the person with a truck must live in the first house.

Now we have a problem: the person with a truck lives in the first house, but the person eating grapes lives in the first house. This means the person with a truck and the person eating grapes must be the same person, but that's not possible because they have different cars. This is a contradiction.

However, we can try another possibility: the person with a truck lives in the second house. In this case, the person with a radio lives next to the person with a truck, so the person with a radio lives in the second house. But we already know the person with a computer lives in the second house, so the person with a radio cannot live in the second house. This is another contradiction.

Let's try again: the person with a truck lives in the first house. In this case, the person with a radio lives next to the person with a truck, so the person with a radio lives in the first house. But we already know the person eating grapes lives in the first house, and the person with a radio lives to the left of the person who had pizza. This means the person with a radio cannot live in the first house. This is another contradiction.

However, we can try another possibility: the person with a truck lives in the first house, and the person with a radio lives in the second house. In this case, the person with a radio lives to the left of the person who had pizza, and the person with a truck lives to the right of the person who had pizza.

"Let's figure it out step by step.

From clue 3, we know the soccer player lives in the third house. 

From clue 1, the golfer lives directly left of the basketball player. This means the golfer can't live in the third house because the soccer player lives there. So, the golfer and basketball player must live in the first and second houses.

From clue 2, the person with lilies lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese. This means the person with lilies can't live in the third house because the soccer player lives there. The person with lilies must live in the first house.

So, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the second house. The answer is (B)."
"Let's figure this out step by step.

From clue 3, the pianist lives in the third house. From clue 9, the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house. So, the answer is (D) 3."
"Let's figure it out step by step.

From clue 7, the person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the first house. So, the person who ate grilled cheese can live in the second, third, or fourth house.

From clue 6, the person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other. This means they can live in the first and second house, or the third and fourth house.

From clue 4, the person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese. If the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the second house, then the person who only drinks water must live in the third or fourth house. But if the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the third or fourth house, then the person who only drinks water must live in the fourth house. 

From clue 6, the person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other. If the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the second house, then the person who is wearing high heels must live in the first house. But if the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the third or fourth house, then the person who is wearing high heels must live in the second house.

From clue 5, the person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew. This means the person who is wearing running shoes can live in the first or second house.

From clue 3, the root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing sandals. This means the person who is wearing sandals can live in the first or second house.

From clue 1, the tea drinker lives in the third house.

Now, let's put it all together. If the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the second house, then the person who is wearing high heels must live in the first house, and the person who only drinks water must live in the third house. But this would mean the person who had stew cannot live in the first house, because the person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew. So, the person who ate grilled cheese cannot live in the second house.

If the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the third house, then the person who is wearing high heels must live in the second house, and the person who only drinks water must live in the fourth house. But this would mean the person who is wearing sandals cannot live in the second house, because the person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other. So, the person who ate grilled cheese cannot live in the third house.

If the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fourth house, then the person who is wearing high heels must live in the third house, and the person who only drinks water must live in the second house. But this would mean the person who is wearing sandals cannot live in the second house, because the person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other. So, the person who ate grilled cheese cannot live in the fourth house.

So, the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the second house. The person who is wearing high heels must live in the first house, and the person who only drinks water must live in the third house. The person who had stew must live in the first house, because the person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew. The person who is wearing sandals must live in the second house, because the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the second house. The person who ate spaghetti must live in the fourth house, because the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. The person who ate fried rice must live in the fourth house, because the person who ate spaghetti lives in the fourth house. The person who is wearing running shoes must live in the first house, because the person who had stew lives in the first house.

The answer is (C) 1."

Now, we know the person in house 1 is a pianist and likes white. We also know the person in house 2 is not a pianist and does not like white.

From clue 2, the root beer lover lives to the right of the person who owns horses. This means the person who owns horses must live in the first house (because the person in the first house is already determined to be a pianist and likes white, so the person in the second house must own horses).

So, the person in house 1 owns horses. And the person in house 2 is a pianist (from clue 1) and does not own horses.

From the remaining options, the person in house 2 must be a violinist (since the person in house 1 is a pianist). The person in house 1 owns horses, and the person in house 2 is a pianist.

From clue 1, the person with a television lives in the fourth house.

From clue 3, the person with a phone does not live in the second house. Since the person wearing boots is in the first house and the person wearing loafers is in the second house, the person with a phone must be in either the third or fourth house. But the person with a television is in the fourth house, so the person with a phone must be in the third house.

From clue 5, there are two houses between the person with a radio and the person with sandals. Since the person with a radio cannot be in the first or second house (because the person with a phone is in the third house and the person with a television is in the fourth house), the person with a radio must be in the first house (because the person with boots is in the first house). The person with sandals must be in the third house because there are two houses between the person with a radio and the person with sandals.

If the person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who had stew, and the person who is wearing running shoes and the person who has a rose bouquet live directly next to each other, then the person who has a rose bouquet must live directly right of the person who is wearing running shoes.

The person who is wearing running shoes cannot live in the third house, so the person who is wearing running shoes must live in either the first or the second house.

If the person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house, then the person who has a rose bouquet lives in the second house. But then the person who has a vase of tulips lives in the third house, and the person who had pizza lives in the fourth house. But from clue 2, the person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals, and from clue 5, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals. This would mean that the person who has a vase of tulips lives in the fourth house, which is not possible because the person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the person who had pizza.

So, the person who is wearing running shoes must live in the second house. The person who has a rose bouquet lives in the first house. The person who had stew lives in the third house. The person who has a vase of tulips lives in the fourth house.

The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals, and the person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza. This means that the person who had pizza lives in the second house, and the person who is wearing boots lives in the first house.

From clue 2, the saxophonist does not live in the first house. Since the first house is taken by the person with mangos and a rose bouquet, the saxophonist must live in the second house.

Now, we have the second house taken by the person with lilies and the saxophonist. The person in the second house is eating apples because the person with mangos lives in the first house.

Now, the person with a rose bouquet lives in the third house. The person with a sedan must live next to them, so the person with a sedan lives in the second house.

From clue 2, the person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.

But we already know the person who had stew lives in the first house and the person who likes green lives in the third house. So, the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the first house.

Now, we have the following information:
- The person who had stew lives in the first house.
- The person who likes yellow lives in the second house.
- The person who likes green lives in the third house.

- The person who had stew lives in the first house.
- The person who likes yellow (romance book lover) lives in the second house.
- The person who likes green (fantasy book enthusiast) lives in the third house.

The only person left is the person who ate grilled cheese. We know the person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the second house.

Since the first house is already occupied by the cellist (who is also the fantasy book enthusiast), the person who likes green must live in the first house.

We know the pianist and the mystery book reader are the only ones left. The person in the second house likes red, and the person in the first house likes green. The person in the second house must be the pianist and the mystery book reader.

We know the history book buff lives in the first house.

So, the first house is the history book buff, and the second house is the golfer. 

There is one house between the swimmer and the science fiction book fanatic.

"Let's figure this out step by step.

From clue 5, we know the person with a rose bouquet lives in the second house. 

From clue 4, we know the person with a rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic live next to each other. Since the person with a rose bouquet lives in the second house, the science fiction book fanatic must live in the first house or the third house.

"Let's figure it out. 

We know the science fiction book fanatic lives in the first house. 

From clue 1, the coffee drinker lives to the left of the person wearing sandals. Since the science fiction book fanatic is in the first house, the coffee drinker must be in the first house too. 

But we know the science fiction book fanatic is in the first house, so the coffee drinker can't be in the first house. This means the coffee drinker must be in the second house.

Now, the person in the first house is the science fiction book fanatic. The person in the second house is the coffee drinker. 

The person wearing sandals can't be in the first house because the science fiction book fanatic is there. So, the person wearing sandals must be in the second house. 

The person in the second house is the coffee drinker, and the person wearing sandals is also in the second house. So, the person in the first house is the science fiction book fanatic, and the person in the second house is the coffee drinker and the person wearing sandals.

The only one left is the romance book lover. The romance book lover can't be in the first house because the science fiction book fanatic is there. So, the romance book lover must be in the second house.

But we already know the person in the second house is the coffee drinker and the person wearing sandals. The romance book lover can't drink coffee or wear sandals. So, the person in the second house can't be the romance book lover.

This means the romance book lover must be in the first house."
"Let's figure this out. We know the percussionist lives left of the person with a radio. Since the houses are numbered 1 and 2, and the percussionist lives left of the person with a radio, the percussionist must live in house 1. 

If the percussionist lives in house 1, then the person with a radio lives in house 2. And the person in house 1 must be the pianist because the percussionist lives in house 1. 

So, the person with a phone must live in house 1. The answer is (A) 1."
"Let's figure it out step by step.

1. The person who drives a convertible lives in the second house. So, the order for the cars is: minivan, convertible, sedan.

2. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives. This means the person who likes white lives in either house 1 or house 3. If the person who likes white lives in house 3, then the person who owns a sedan lives in house 1, which is not possible because the person who drives a convertible lives in house 2. So, the person who likes white lives in house 1.

3. The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan. Since the person who owns a sedan lives in house 3, the person who likes yellow lives in house 2.

So, the person who likes yellow lives in house 2. The answer is (B)."
"Let's figure it out step by step.

From clue 1, the person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house.

From clue 2, the person who owns a sedan lives in the third house.

From clue 3, the dog owner does not live in the third house.

From clue 5, there are two houses between where the person who is wearing running shoes lives and where the bird keeper lives. Since the person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house, the bird keeper lives in the fourth or fifth house.

From clue 4, the person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the left of the bird keeper. This means the person who is wearing sandals lives in the second house.

From clue 10, the person who is wearing loafers does not live in the fifth house. This means the person who is wearing loafers lives in the second, third, or fourth house. But we already know the person who is wearing sandals lives in the second house, so the person who is wearing loafers lives in the third or fourth house.

From clue 2, the person who owns a sedan lives in the third house. This means the person who is wearing loafers cannot live in the third house, so the person who is wearing loafers lives in the fourth house.

From clue 6, the person who is wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house. This means the person who is wearing high heels lives in the first, second, or fifth house. But we already know the person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house and the person who is wearing sandals lives in the second house, so the person who is wearing high heels lives in the fifth house.

From clue 9, the person who is wearing high heels lives directly left of the person who drives a truck. This means the person who drives a truck lives in the fourth house.

From clue 7, the fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV. This means the person who owns an SUV lives in the first, second, or third house. But we already know the person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house, so the person who owns an SUV lives in the second or third house.

From clue 8, the fish enthusiast does not live in the third house. This means the fish enthusiast lives in the first or fifth house. But we already know the person who is wearing high heels lives in the fifth house, so the fish enthusiast lives in the first house.

From clue 13, the person who owns horses lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a minivan. This means the person who drives a minivan lives in the first or second house. But we already know the person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house and the person who is wearing sandals lives in the second house, so the person who drives a minivan lives in the first house.

From clue 12, the dog owner does not live in the first house. This means the dog owner lives in the second, third, fourth, or fifth house. But we already know the person who is wearing sandals lives in the second house, so the dog owner lives in the third, fourth, or fifth house.

From clue 3, the dog owner does not live in the third house. This means the dog owner lives in the fourth or fifth house.

From clue 11, the fish enthusiast does not live in the fifth house. This means the fish enthusiast lives in the first house, which we already know. This also means the dog owner lives in the fourth house.

From clue 13, the person who owns horses lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a minivan. This means the person who owns horses lives in the third, fourth, or fifth house. But we already know the dog owner lives in the fourth house, so the person who owns horses lives in the fifth house.

"Let's solve this puzzle step by step.

Since the person who owns horses cannot live in the first house (bird keeper lives there), the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house. But we already know the person who is wearing loafers lives in the second house. So, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils cannot live in the second house. This means the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the third house, but we already know the person who is eating kiwis lives in the third house. This is a contradiction.

"Let's figure it out step by step.

From clue 2, we know the percussionist does not live in the second house. This means the percussionist must live in the first house.

From clue 1, we know the person who ate grilled cheese lives to the right of the bird keeper. This means the bird keeper must live in the first house and the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the second house.

Now we have a problem: the percussionist lives in the first house, but the bird keeper also lives in the first house. This can't be true because the percussionist and the bird keeper are two different people with different pets. So, the bird keeper must live in the second house.

Now we know the bird keeper lives in the second house. The person who ate grilled cheese lives to the right of the bird keeper, so the person who ate grilled cheese also lives in the second house.

The percussionist lives in the first house, and the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the second house. The only thing left is the person who had pizza. Since the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the second house, the person who had pizza must live in the first house.

The answer is (B) 1."

The person eating a banana must live to the left of the fish enthusiast, and the fish enthusiast must live to the right of the person wearing running shoes. The person eating oranges lives to the right of the pianist, and the flutist lives to the right of the fish enthusiast. The fantasy book enthusiast lives to the left of the flutist, and the percussionist and history book buff must live in the second house. 

Since the cat lover lives in the first house, the person eating a banana must live in the second house. The person wearing running shoes must live in the third house. The person eating"
"Let's try to figure it out. 

From clue 6, we know the person who is eating grapes lives in the second house. 

From clue 2, we know the person who likes green and the person who likes red live next to each other. 

From clue 4, we know the person who likes green lives to the left of the person who likes yellow. 

So, the order of the people who like green, yellow, and red is: green, yellow, red.

From clue 1, we know the person who likes red lives to the right of the person who is eating kiwis. 

So, the order of the people who like green, yellow, and red is: green, yellow, red.

From clue 2, we know the person who likes green and the person who likes red live next to each other. 

From clue 5, we know there is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes red lives. 

So, the order of the people who like white, green, yellow, and red is: white, green, yellow, red.

From clue 3, we know there is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who is eating a banana lives. 

So, the order of the people who like white, green, yellow, red, and the person who is eating a banana is: white, green, yellow, red, banana.

From clue 6, we know the person who is eating grapes lives in the second house. 

So, the order of the people who like white, green, yellow, red, the person who is eating grapes, and the person who is eating a banana is: white, green, yellow, red, grapes, banana.

From clue 1, we know the person who likes red lives to the right of the person who is eating kiwis. 

So, the person who is eating kiwis lives to the left of the person who likes red. 

The order of the people who like white, green, yellow, red, the person who is eating grapes, and the person who is eating a banana is: white, green, yellow, red, grapes, banana.

The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house."
"Let's figure it out step by step.

From clue 3, we know the mystery book reader and the person who had stew live next to each other. 

From clue 2, we know the mystery book reader lives directly left of the cat lover. So, the order is: mystery book reader, person who had stew, cat lover.

Now, from clue 1, we know the person wearing running shoes lives to the right of the person eating oranges. 

Since the person eating oranges can't be the mystery book reader (because the mystery book reader is to the left of the cat lover), the person eating oranges must be the cat lover. 

So, the order is: mystery book reader, person who had stew, cat lover, person eating oranges.

Now, we know the person eating oranges is the cat lover, and the cat lover is to the right of the mystery book reader. The person wearing running shoes is to the right of the person eating oranges. 

So, the order is: mystery book reader, person who had stew, cat lover, person eating oranges, person wearing running shoes.

Now, we know the person wearing running shoes is to the right of the person eating oranges. The person eating apples can't be the person wearing running shoes (because the person wearing running shoes is to the right of the person eating oranges), so the person eating apples must be the mystery book reader.

So, the order is: mystery book reader (eating apples), person who had stew, cat lover (eating oranges), person wearing running shoes, person eating fried rice (because the person eating fried rice is the only one left).

Now, we know the person who had stew lives next to the mystery book reader. The mystery book reader is eating apples, so the person who had stew must be eating fried rice.

So, the person who had stew lives in house number 2."

"Let's solve this puzzle step by step.

From clue 2, the person who owns a sedan lives in the first house.

From clue 8, the person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who likes green. Since the person who owns a sedan lives in the first house, the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the second house.

From clue 8, the person who likes green lives in the third house.

From clue 5, the person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes white. So, the person who likes white must live in the fourth house.

From clue 1, the person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the person who has a vase of tulips lives in the second house (because the cricketer is in the third house), the person who is wearing high heels must live in the first house.

- House 1: person eating mangos
- House 2: person eating banana
- House 3: dog owner

Since the person owning horses lives in house 4, the bird keeper must live in house 3.

The answer is (D) 3."

But we know the bird keeper lives directly left of the history book buff, so the bird keeper must be in the second house and the history book buff must be in the third house.

Now, we know the romance book lover does not live in the third house (clue 1) and the person who owns horses does not live in the third house (clue 2). Since the history book buff is in the third house, the person who owns horses must be in the first house (because the first house is already taken by the mystery book reader).

"Let's figure it out. 

We know the basketball player lives in the second house. We also know the violinist lives in the second house. Since the basketball player and the violinist are in the same house, the basketball player must be the violinist. 

Now we know the second house has a violinist (or basketball player, but we already know it's the violinist). 

The cellist lives to the right of the cricketer. This means the cricketer can't be in the second house because the cellist would be in the third house, and the violinist is already in the second house. 

So, the cricketer must be in the first house. The cellist is to the right of the cricketer, so the cellist must be in the third house. 

The only one left is the soccer player. The soccer player can't be in the first house because the cricketer is there. The soccer player can't be in the third house because the cellist is there. So, the soccer player must be in the second house. 

The answer is (C) 2."

From clue 8, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker. Since the person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the fourth house (clue 7), the person who has a carnations arrangement must live in the second house.

From clue 1, the person who likes green lives directly left of the coffee drinker. Since the person who likes red lives in the first house, the person who likes green must live in the second house. But we already know the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the second house. So, the person who likes green must live in the second house is incorrect. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the second house, and the person who likes green lives to the left of the coffee drinker.
