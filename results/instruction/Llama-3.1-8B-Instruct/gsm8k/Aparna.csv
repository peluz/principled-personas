"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we first need to determine how many eggs she has left after eating and baking. 

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast and bakes 4 for muffins, so she uses a total of 3 + 4 = 7 eggs. 

Now, let's subtract the number of eggs she uses from the total number of eggs she lays: 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.

Janet sells these 9 eggs at $2 each, so she makes 9 * 2 = $18 per day at the farmers' market.

The final answer is: $18"
"To find the total number of bolts needed for the robe, we first need to determine the amount of white fiber required. Since it's half the amount of blue fiber, and there are 2 bolts of blue fiber, we calculate the white fiber as 2 / 2 = 1 bolt.

Now, we add the blue fiber and white fiber together: 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts.

The total number of bolts needed for the robe is 3."
"To find the profit Josh made, we first need to determine the total value of the house after the repairs. 

The original value of the house was $80,000. Josh put in $50,000 in repairs, which increased the value of the house by 150%. 

Let's denote the increased value as x. We can set up the equation: 
80,000 + 50,000 = x + 1.5x (since 150% increase is the same as multiplying by 2.5 or 1.5)

Combine like terms: 
130,000 = 2.5x

Now, divide both sides by 2.5 to solve for x: 
x = 130,000 / 2.5
x = 52,000

So, the total value of the house after the repairs is $52,000. 

To find the profit, we subtract the original cost of the house from the new value: 
Profit = New Value - Original Cost
Profit = 52,000 - 80,000
Profit = -28,000

However, since Josh put in $50,000 in repairs, we need to add that to the profit to get the total profit: 
Total Profit = Profit + Repairs
Total Profit = -28,000 + 50,000
Total Profit = 22,000

The final answer is: $22,000"
"To find the total number of meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total meters he runs in one sprint session and then multiply it by the number of sessions he has in a week.

Since James runs 3 sprints in one session, and each sprint is 60 meters, the total meters he runs in one session is:
3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/session

Since James runs 3 sessions a week, the total meters he runs in a week is:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

Therefore, James runs a total of 540 meters a week. 

The final answer is: 540"
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to determine the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon meals. 

In the morning, Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups of feed. In the afternoon, she gives them another 25 cups of feed. So, the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

Since Wendi feeds each chicken 3 cups of feed per day, and she has 20 chickens, the total amount of feed needed per day is 3 * 20 = 60 cups.

Now, to find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we subtract the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total amount of feed needed per day. 

60 (total feed needed per day) - 40 (feed given in morning and afternoon) = 20 cups.

So, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining glasses. 

The first glass costs $5. 
The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3. 
The third glass costs 60% of $3, which is 0.6 * $3 = $1.8. 
We can see that the cost of each subsequent glass is 60% of the previous glass. 

The sequence of the cost of the glasses is: $5, $3, $1.8, $1.08, $0.64, $0.384, $0.2304, $0.13824, $0.082944, $0.0497664, $0.02986584, $0.017929504, $0.010757904, $0.006454144, $0.0038272864, $0.002306377184, $0.0013737264904.

To find the total cost, we need to add the cost of all the glasses. 
Total cost = $5 + $3 + $1.8 + $1.08 + $0.64 + $0.384 + $0.2304 + $0.13824 + $0.082944 + $0.0497664 + $0.02986584 + $0.017929504 + $0.010757904 + $0.006454144 + $0.0038272864 + $0.002306377184 + $0.0013737264904
Total cost ≈ $23.999999999999996

However, we can simplify this process by using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. The cost of the glasses forms a geometric series with the first term a = $5 and the common ratio r = 0.6. The number of terms is 16. 

The sum of a geometric series is given by the formula: S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r), where n is the number of terms.

S = $5 * (1 - 0.6^16) / (1 - 0.6)
S ≈ $23.999999999999996

However, we can also calculate the total cost by adding the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining 15 glasses. The cost of the first glass is $5. The cost of the remaining 15 glasses is the sum of a geometric series with the first term a = $3 and the common ratio r = 0.6. The number of terms is 15.

S = $3 * (1 - 0.6^15) / (1 - 0.6)
S ≈ $19.999999999999996

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining 15 glasses.
Total cost = $5 + $19.999999999999996
Total cost ≈ $24

The final answer is: $24"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   Since Seattle has 20 sheep, Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.

2. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   Since Charleston has 80 sheep, Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, let's add up the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle:
Toulouse has 160 sheep, Charleston has 80 sheep, and Seattle has 20 sheep.
Total sheep = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260

The final answer is: 260"
"To find the total time it takes Carla to download the file, we need to calculate the time taken for the first part of the download, the time taken for the restart, and the time taken for the second part of the download.

First, let's find the time taken for the first part of the download. Carla can download 2 GB/minute. The file is 200 GB, so the time taken for the first part of the download is:

Time = Total size / Download speed
Time = 200 GB / 2 GB/minute
Time = 100 minutes

Since Carla is 40% of the way through the download, she has downloaded 40% of the file. To find the size of the file downloaded, we multiply the total size by 0.4:

Size downloaded = 200 GB * 0.4
Size downloaded = 80 GB

Now, we need to find the time taken to download 80 GB at a speed of 2 GB/minute:

Time = Size downloaded / Download speed
Time = 80 GB / 2 GB/minute
Time = 40 minutes

The time taken for the first part of the download is 100 minutes, and the time taken to download 80 GB is 40 minutes. However, we need to add the time taken for the restart, which is 20 minutes.

Total time for the first part of the download = 100 minutes + 20 minutes = 120 minutes

Now, Carla has to restart the download from the beginning. The remaining size of the file is 200 GB - 80 GB = 120 GB. The time taken to download the remaining 120 GB is:

Time = Size remaining / Download speed
Time = 120 GB / 2 GB/minute
Time = 60 minutes

The total time taken to download the file is the sum of the time taken for the first part of the download, the time taken for the restart, and the time taken for the second part of the download:

Total time = 120 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes
Total time = 200 minutes

The final answer is: 200"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and calculate the distance covered in each segment.

First, John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph. The distance covered in this segment is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles

Since he turns around, he is now 180 miles away from home.

Next, he spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance in this segment.

Then, he drives for half an hour (0.5 hours) at 30 mph. The distance covered in this segment is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles

Now, he is 180 - 15 = 165 miles away from home.

Finally, he drives for the remaining 2.5 hours (4 - 1.5 hours) at 80 mph. The distance covered in this segment is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 2.5 = 200 miles

Now, he is 165 - 200 = -35 miles away from home. However, since distance cannot be negative, this means he has actually covered more distance than the initial 180 miles, and he is now 35 miles away from home.

The final answer is: 35"
"To find Eliza's total earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings are:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours, she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours. Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, which is $10 * 1.2 = $12/hour. So, her earnings for the overtime hours are:
5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Now, we add the earnings for the regular hours and the overtime hours to get her total earnings for the week:
$400 + $60 = $460

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and add them up.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, which is 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the downloads were reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which is 54. Then, we subtract 54 from 180 to get 126 downloads in the third month.

Now, let's add up the downloads for all three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The final answer is: 366"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the donuts: 3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen will be 3 x $68 = $204.

Next, let's find the cost of the mini cupcakes: 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen will be 2 x $80 = $160.

Now, let's find the cost of the mini cheesecakes: 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen will be 6 x $55 = $330.

Finally, let's add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost is $694."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of planting the tree and the annual expenses, and then find the point at which the total earnings from selling lemons exceed these costs.

The initial cost of planting the tree is $90. The annual expenses for watering and feeding the tree are $3. 

Each year, the tree will grow 7 lemons, which can be sold for $1.5 each, resulting in a total annual revenue of 7 * $1.5 = $10.5.

To find the break-even point, we need to calculate the total cost of the tree and the total annual expenses, and then find the point at which the total earnings from selling lemons exceed these costs.

Let's denote the number of years it takes to break even as 'x'. The total cost of the tree is $90, and the total annual expenses are $3. The total earnings from selling lemons in 'x' years will be $10.5x.

The equation to find the break-even point is:

Total cost = Total earnings - Total expenses
$90 = $10.5x - $3x

Combine like terms:
$90 = $7.5x

Now, divide both sides by $7.5:
x = $90 / $7.5
x = 12

So, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the information given. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. If we let the total number of vacuum cleaners she started with be 'x', then she sold x/3 at the green house.

She then sold 2 more at the red house. So, the total number of vacuum cleaners she has left after the green house is x - x/3 = 2x/3. 

After selling 2 at the red house, she has 2x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

Then, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. Half of 2x/3 is x/3. So, after selling at the orange house, she has 2x/3 - x/3 = x/3 vacuum cleaners left.

We are given that she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. Therefore, x/3 = 5.

To find the value of x, we multiply both sides by 3. x = 5 * 3 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to find the number of students who enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance, and then subtract that from the total number of students.

20% of 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance:
20 * 0.2 = 4 students

The remaining students are 20 - 4 = 16 students.

25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:
16 * 0.25 = 4 students

The number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is the remaining students after subtracting the students who enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance:
16 - 4 = 12 students

To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100:
(12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is: 60"
"To determine the maximum profit, we need to calculate the potential future value of both options. 

The jewelry market is expected to rise by 2.5%, so the future value of the jewelry will be $5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,125.

The electronic gadgets market is expected to rise by 1.2%, so the future value of the electronic gadgets will be $8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,096.

Since the merchant wants to maximize profit, we need to choose the option with the higher future value. In this case, the electronic gadgets option has a higher future value of $8,096.

To calculate the profit, we subtract the initial cost from the future value: $8,096 - $8,000 = $96.

The final answer is: $96"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance covered on the first day and the distance covered on the second day.

On the first day, both trains travel 80 miles westward. Since they are traveling in the same direction, they cover the same distance. 

On the second day, they travel 150 miles northward. Again, since they are traveling in the same direction, they cover the same distance.

So, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 80 miles + 150 miles = 230 miles.

The final answer is: 230"
"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:

She works 35 hours a week as a teacher and gets paid $20 per hour. So, her weekly earnings from teaching are:
35 hours/week * $20/hour = $700/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from teaching are:
$700/week * 50 weeks/year = $35,000/year

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:

She works 15 hours a week as a coach and gets paid $30 per hour. So, her weekly earnings from coaching are:
15 hours/week * $30/hour = $450/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from coaching are:
$450/week * 50 weeks/year = $22,500/year

Now, let's add her earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary:
$35,000/year (teaching) + $22,500/year (coaching) = $57,500/year

The final answer is: $57,500"
"To find out how many eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in a week and then multiply it by 4.

Since Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning, she eats 3 eggs per day. 

There are 7 days in a week, so in one week, she eats 3 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 21 eggs/week.

In 4 weeks, she will eat 21 eggs/week * 4 weeks = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens she will eat in 4 weeks.

84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozens.

So, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much time Marissa has left to walk the remaining distance. 

She has walked 4 miles in 1 hour and 2 miles in another hour, so she has walked a total of 6 miles in 2 hours. 

The total distance of the trail is 12 miles, and she has already walked 6 miles, so she has 12 - 6 = 6 miles left to walk.

Since she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, and the total distance is 12 miles, she needs to cover the total distance in 12 / 4 = 3 hours.

She has already walked for 2 hours, so she has 3 - 2 = 1 hour left to walk the remaining 6 miles.

To find her required speed, we divide the remaining distance by the remaining time: 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total amount of water in the orange drink, we first need to calculate two-thirds of 10 liters. Two-thirds of 10 liters is (2/3) * 10 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters. 

Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the remaining one-third is the non-water portion. So, the non-water portion is 10 - 6.67 = 3.33 liters.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water in the pineapple drink. Three-fifths of 15 liters is (3/5) * 15 = 45/5 = 9 liters.

When we add the orange and pineapple drinks together, we get a total of 10 + 15 = 25 liters. However, we spilled 1 liter of the orange drink, so the actual total is 25 - 1 = 24 liters.

The total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is the sum of the water in the orange and pineapple drinks. This is 6.67 + 9 = 15.67 liters.

The final answer is: 15.67"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha.
2. Samantha is now 31 years old.
3. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, Raymond is 31 - 6 = 25 years old.
4. Raymond had a son at the age of 23, so the son is 25 - 23 = 2 years younger than Raymond.
5. Now, we need to find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born. Since the son is 2 years younger than Raymond, and Raymond is 25 years old, the son is 25 - 2 = 23 years old.
6. To find out how many years ago the son was born, we subtract his age from the current year. However, the current year is not given, but we can calculate the difference in age between Samantha and Raymond, which is 6 years. Since Samantha is 31, we can assume the current year is 31. 
7. Now, we can calculate the number of years ago the son was born by subtracting his age from the current year: 31 - 23 = 8.

"To find the total number of DVDs sold by Billy on Tuesday, we need to calculate the number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers separately and then add them together.

The first 3 customers buy one DVD each, so the total number of DVDs sold to them is 3 * 1 = 3.

The next 2 customers buy 2 DVDs each, so the total number of DVDs sold to them is 2 * 2 = 4.

Now, we add the number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers: 3 + 4 = 7.

So, the total number of DVDs sold by Billy on Tuesday is 7.

"To find out how many centimeters shorter the candle will be, we need to calculate the total time it burns and then multiply it by the rate at which it melts.

The candle burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, which is a total of 4 hours.

Since the candle melts 2 centimeters every hour, we multiply the total hours by the rate of melting:

4 hours * 2 centimeters/hour = 8 centimeters

So, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

"To find the original price of the book, we need to determine the amount of the discount and add it to the discounted price. 

First, let's find the amount of the discount: 
Discount = 25% of the original price
Let the original price be x
Discount = 0.25x

Since the discounted price is $19.50, we can set up the equation:
x - 0.25x = 19.50
0.75x = 19.50

Now, we can solve for x:
x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book was $26.

"To find the total cost of the items Marie ordered excluding the pizza, we need to calculate the cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3 = $15.
The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6.

The total cost of the items excluding the pizza is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the cost of the pizza boxes is $50 - $33 = $17.

To find the number of pizza boxes, we need to divide the cost of the pizza by the cost of each box. 

Number of pizza boxes = $17 / $8.50 = 2.

"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to calculate the total number of cartons she buys and then multiply it by the cost per carton.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she will go through 60 servings in 60 days. Each carton has 15 servings, so we need to divide 60 by 15 to find out how many cartons she buys:

60 servings / 15 servings per carton = 4 cartons

Now, we multiply the number of cartons by the cost per carton:

4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00

So, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream after 60 days.

The final answer is: $16.00"
"To find the distance Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to determine the distance between the two stops. 

First, let's find the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip. Since Henry's second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip is 60 - 15 = 45 miles.

Now, we know that Henry's first stop was after 20 miles. So, the distance from the first stop to the second stop is the difference between the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip and the distance from the first stop. 

Distance from the first stop to the second stop = Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip - Distance from the first stop
= 45 - 20
= 25 miles

"Let's break down the information given. We know that one pair of heels costs $33 and the other costs twice as much, which means the second pair costs 2 * $33 = $66. 

The total cost of the two pairs of heels is $33 + $66 = $99. We are also told that the two pairs of heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. 

Let's represent the cost of the boots as 'x'. Since the two pairs of heels cost five dollars less than the boots, we can write the equation: x - 5 = 99.

To find the cost of the boots, we need to solve for 'x'. We can do this by adding 5 to both sides of the equation: x = 99 + 5.

x = 104

The final answer is: 104"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let Darrell's age be 7x and Allen's age be 11x, where x is a constant.

Since their total age is 162, we can write the equation: 
7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms: 
18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18: 
x = 9

Now that we have the value of x, we can find Darrell's and Allen's current ages: 
Darrell's age = 7x = 7(9) = 63
Allen's age = 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age: 
Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

"To find the average guess, we need to calculate the total number of guesses and divide it by the number of people who made the guesses.

The first person guesses 80 jelly beans.
The second person guesses 20 more than half of the first person's guess, which is (80 / 2) + 20 = 60.
The third person guesses 25% more than the first person's guess, which is 80 + (80 * 0.25) = 100.

Now, let's add up all the guesses: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

There are 3 people who made the guesses. To find the average, we divide the total by 3: 240 / 3 = 80.

"To find the total hours John spends taking care of dogs in a week, we need to first calculate the total hours he spends per day. 

Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day, and John has 10 dogs. So, the total hours per day is 0.5 * 10 = 5 hours.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the total hours per day by 7 to get the total hours per week. 

5 hours/day * 7 days/week = 35 hours/week

The final answer is: 35"
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins can be represented as 'x + 30'. 

We know that the total number of coins is 110, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 30) = 110.

Combine like terms: 2x + 30 = 110.

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2x = 80.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 40.

Since x represents the number of silver coins, and there are 30 more gold coins, the number of gold coins is x + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70.

The final answer is: 70"
"To find out how many jewels Siobhan has, we first need to determine how many jewels Aaron has. 

Since Raymond has 40 jewels, half of Raymond's jewels would be 40 / 2 = 20. 

Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, so Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.

Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, so Siobhan has 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total points scored by Mike, we first need to calculate the points scored in the second 20 minutes. 

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points. 
In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. 
25% of 4 points is 0.25 * 4 = 1 point. 
So, in the second 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 + 1 = 5 points. 
Now, we add the points scored in both periods: 4 + 5 = 9 points.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to first calculate how many yogurts he eats in 30 days and then find out the cost of those yogurts.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. In 30 days, he will eat 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

The sale is 4 yogurts for $5.00. To find the cost of one yogurt, we divide the total cost by the number of yogurts: $5.00 / 4 = $1.25 per yogurt.

Now, we multiply the number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days by the cost of one yogurt: 60 * $1.25 = $75.00.

So, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days.

The final answer is: $75.00"
"To find out how many Lego sets John sold, we first need to calculate the total amount of money he made from selling the Lego sets. 

He sold 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount of money he made is 13 * 15 = $195.

Next, we need to find out how much money he spent on video games. He bought 8 video games for $20 each, so the total amount of money he spent is 8 * 20 = $160.

Since he had $5 left after buying the video games, we can find out how much money he had before buying the video games by adding the money he had left to the money he spent on video games. So, he had $160 + $5 = $165 before buying the video games.

Now, we can find out how much money he made from selling the Lego sets by subtracting the money he had before buying the video games from the total amount of money he made from selling the Lego sets. However, we can also find out how much money he made from selling the Lego sets by subtracting the money he spent on video games from the money he had left plus the money he spent on video games. This will give us the same result. 

So, the total amount of money he made from selling the Lego sets is $165 + $160 = $325. 

Now, we can find out how many Lego sets he sold by dividing the total amount of money he made from selling the Lego sets by the price of each Lego set. 

13 Lego sets were not sold, but we know he sold some. So, the number of Lego sets he sold is $325 / $15 = 21.66. Since we can't sell a fraction of a Lego set, we can round down to 21 Lego sets. 

However, we know he started with 13 Lego sets. So, the number of Lego sets he still has is 13 - 21 = -8."
"To find John's running speed, we first need to calculate the total hours he runs per week. 

He runs 3 hours on the first day. The other two days, he runs half as much as the first day, which is 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours per day. 

So, the total hours he runs per week is 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours.

Since John runs 60 miles a week and runs for 6 hours a week, we can find his speed by dividing the total miles by the total hours: 

Speed = Total miles / Total hours = 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Dana's running and walking speeds. 

Given that Dana can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run, and she can skip at 3 miles per hour, we can find her running speed by multiplying her skipping speed by 2. 

Dana's running speed = 2 * 3 miles per hour = 6 miles per hour.

Since Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, we can find her walking speed by dividing her running speed by 4.

Dana's walking speed = 6 miles per hour / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, we know that Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. So, in 6 hours, she will spend 2 hours running and 4 hours walking.

Distance traveled while running = Speed * Time = 6 miles per hour * 2 hours = 12 miles.

Distance traveled while walking = Speed * Time = 1.5 miles per hour * 4 hours = 6 miles.

Total distance traveled = Distance traveled while running + Distance traveled while walking = 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles.

The final answer is: 18"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old.
2. Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, so Ben's iPhone is 2 * 1 = 2 years old.
3. Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, so Brandon's iPhone is 4 * 2 = 8 years old.

The final answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how far Polly can throw the javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone. Since she can throw it three times farther than when not holding the gemstone, and she can throw it 400 feet without the gemstone, we multiply 400 by 3 to get the distance with the gemstone.

400 * 3 = 1200 feet

Now, we need to find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon. The dragon's reach is 1000 feet, so Polly needs to be at least 1000 feet away from the dragon to be outside its reach. To find the distance outside the dragon's reach, we subtract 1000 from the distance Polly can throw with the gemstone.

1200 - 1000 = 200 feet

So, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the dragon's reach and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

The final answer is: 200"
"To find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we need to first find out the total number of pieces of pie that were available initially. Since Grandma Jones baked 5 pies and cut each pie into 8 pieces, the total number of pieces is 5 * 8 = 40.

Now, we know that at the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces: 40 - 14 = 26.

So, the guests took 26 pieces of pie.

The final answer is: 26"
"To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we first need to calculate how many calories you have left for the day. 

Your daily calorie target is 2000, and you have already consumed 1800 calories. 

2000 (daily target) - 1800 (already consumed) = 200 calories left for the day.

Since each serving of chips has 250 calories, we need to find out how many servings you can have with the remaining calories.

200 (calories left) / 250 (calories per serving) = 0.8 servings

Since a 300g bag has 5 servings, we need to find out how many grams are in one serving.

300g (total weight) / 5 (servings) = 60g per serving

Now, we can multiply the number of servings you can have by the weight per serving to find out how many grams you can eat.

0.8 servings * 60g per serving = 48g

The final answer is: 48"
"To find Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

First, let's find the total cost. Since one pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10.00, and Charlie makes 10 candles from one pound of beeswax, the cost per candle is $1.00. 

Now, let's find the total cost for 20 candles: 
Total cost = cost per candle * number of candles
Total cost = $1.00 * 20
Total cost = $20.00

Next, let's find the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, and he sells 20 candles:
Total revenue = price per candle * number of candles
Total revenue = $2.00 * 20
Total revenue = $40.00

Now, let's find the net profit:
Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $20.00
Net profit = $20.00

The final answer is: $20.00"
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we first need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day.

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. To find 2/5 of 5, we multiply 5 by 2/5:
5 * (2/5) = 2
So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. To find twice the number of articles, we multiply 7 by 2:
7 * 2 = 14
So, she wrote 14 articles on Wednesday.

Now, we add up the number of articles she wrote each day:
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to write, we multiply the total number of articles by 4 to find the total hours spent writing:
26 * 4 = 104

The final answer is: 104"
"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we need to first determine how many Post-it notes she used in total. 

Candice started with 80 Post-it notes. She used 220 Post-it notes at work. To find the total number of Post-it notes she used, we add these two numbers together: 80 + 220 = 300. 

Since she had 23 Post-it notes remaining, we need to subtract this from the total number of Post-it notes she used to find out how many she purchased. 

300 (total used) - 23 (remaining) = 277. 

So, Candice purchased 277 Post-it notes.

The final answer is: 277"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. To find the number of blue ties, we can divide the total amount spent on blue ties by the cost of each blue tie:

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost of each blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is:

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
= 2 * 5
= 10

Now, we know that the red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. This means the cost of each red tie is 1.5 times the cost of each blue tie:

Cost of each red tie = 1.5 * Cost of each blue tie
= 1.5 * $40
= $60

To find the total amount spent on red ties, we multiply the number of red ties by the cost of each red tie:

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of each red tie
= 10 * $60
= $600

The total amount spent on ties is the sum of the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties:

Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
= $200 + $600
= $800

The final answer is: $800"
"To find out how many pieces Tracy obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches, since the pieces are 6 inches long. There are 12 inches in a foot, so the total length of the wire in inches is 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches.

Now, we can divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece to find out how many pieces Tracy obtained: 48 inches / 6 inches/piece = 8 pieces.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total number of units in the building, we need to multiply the number of floors by the number of units per floor. 

Number of floors: 15
Units per floor: 8

Total units = Number of floors * Units per floor
Total units = 15 * 8
Total units = 120

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we need to find 1/4 of the total units to determine the number of unoccupied units.

Unoccupied units = Total units * (1 - 3/4)
Unoccupied units = Total units * 1/4
Unoccupied units = 120 * 1/4
Unoccupied units = 30

"To find out how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we first need to calculate how many eggs he produces in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the number of eggs produced per day by 7.

Eggs produced per day: 252
Eggs produced per week: 252 * 7 = 1764

Next, we need to find out how many dozens of eggs Lloyd produces in a week. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs produced per week by 12.

Eggs produced per week: 1764
Dozens of eggs produced per week: 1764 / 12 = 147

Now, we know that Lloyd sells each dozen of eggs for $2. To find out how much he makes in a week, we multiply the number of dozens of eggs produced per week by the price per dozen.

Price per dozen: $2
Dozens of eggs produced per week: 147
Weekly earnings: 147 * $2 = $294

"To find the total time Tom takes to travel from 1 to 4 PM and back, we first need to calculate the time he takes to travel from 1 to 4 PM. 

Since he travels from 1 to 4 PM, we can assume he travels for 3 hours. 

Now, to find the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM, we multiply the speed by the time: 10 miles/hour * 3 hours = 30 miles.

Now, to find the time he takes to travel back, we divide the distance by the speed: 30 miles / 6 mph = 5 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out the total weight of the comic books Uriah removed. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he removed 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books removed is 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Since Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds, and the comic books already removed weigh 7.5 pounds, the remaining weight to be removed is 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, the number of toys to be removed can be found by dividing the remaining weight by the weight of each toy: 7.5 / 0.5 = 15.

"To find the revenue earned by the mechanic on each day, we need to calculate the total revenue from truck tire repairs and car tire repairs separately for both days.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. The revenue from truck tire repairs is 6 * $60 = $360. The revenue from car tire repairs is 4 * $40 = $160. The total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires. The revenue from car tire repairs is 12 * $40 = $480. Since there were no truck tire repairs, the total revenue on Friday is $480.

To find the day with higher revenue, we compare the revenues: $520 (Thursday) and $480 (Friday). Thursday has higher revenue.

Now, to find how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we subtract the lower revenue from the higher revenue: $520 - $480 = $40.

Patchy had thrice the number of adopted kittens, and since there were 7 adopted kittens, Patchy had 3 * 7 = 21 kittens.

Trixie had 12 kittens.

Now, we add the number of adopted kittens to the number of kittens from the two house cats: 7 (adopted) + 21 (Patchy's kittens) + 12 (Trixie's kittens) = 40.

The Doubtfire family now has 40 kittens."
"To find out how many bags Jean can fill, we first need to determine the number of lollipops remaining after eating 2. 

Jean starts with 30 lollipops and eats 2, so the remaining lollipops are 30 - 2 = 28.

Since Jean wants to package 2 lollipops in one bag, we need to divide the remaining lollipops by 2 to find out how many bags can be filled.

28 / 2 = 14

So, Jean can fill 14 bags with the remaining lollipops.

"To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck, we need to first calculate the remaining weight capacity of the bridge after the truck and driver are on it. 

The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. The weight limit of the bridge is 5000 pounds. 

Remaining weight capacity = Weight limit - Combined weight of driver and empty truck
Remaining weight capacity = 5000 - 3755
Remaining weight capacity = 1245 pounds

Since each box weighs 15 pounds, we can find the maximum number of boxes by dividing the remaining weight capacity by the weight of each box.

Maximum number of boxes = Remaining weight capacity / Weight of each box
Maximum number of boxes = 1245 / 15
Maximum number of boxes = 83

"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to first calculate the total cost after the delivery vendor's fee. 

The delivery vendor's fee is 25% of the final bill, which is $40.00. To find 25% of $40.00, we multiply $40.00 by 0.25. 

$40.00 * 0.25 = $10.00

Now, we add the delivery fee of $3.00 to the vendor's fee of $10.00. 

$10.00 + $3.00 = $13.00

The total cost after the vendor's fee and delivery fee is $40.00 + $13.00 = $53.00.

"To find Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we first need to calculate the value of the pension after 30 years. Since she gets 5% of the value of the pension per year after 20 years, we can calculate the value of the pension after 30 years.

The value of the pension after 20 years is 100% (initial pension) + 5% * 10 years (20 - 10) = 100% + 50% = 150% of the initial pension.

The value of the pension after 30 years is 150% + 5% * 10 years (30 - 20) = 150% + 50% = 200% of the initial pension.

Since the initial pension is $50,000, the value of the pension after 30 years is 200% * $50,000 = $100,000.

"To find the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to calculate the amount she paid for the first half of the year and the second half of the year separately and then add them together.

The streaming service charges $140 per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the first half of the year consists of 6 months. 

The amount paid for the first half of the year is 6 * $140 = $840.

For the second half of the year, the company charges 10% less than the initial amount. To find the amount charged for the second half, we need to calculate 10% of $140 and subtract it from the initial amount.

10% of $140 = 0.1 * $140 = $14
Amount charged for the second half of the year = $140 - $14 = $126

The amount paid for the second half of the year is 6 * $126 = $756.

"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to determine the car's miles per gallon (mpg) rating. We can do this by dividing the distance traveled since the last fill-up (100 miles) by the amount of gas used (4 gallons).

mpg = distance / gas used
mpg = 100 miles / 4 gallons
mpg = 25 miles per gallon

Now that we know the car's mpg rating, we can calculate the total distance Sophia can drive on a full tank by multiplying the tank capacity (12 gallons) by the mpg rating.

total distance = tank capacity * mpg
total distance = 12 gallons * 25 miles/gallon
total distance = 300 miles

So, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas.

"To find out how much Shiela will pay each month, we need to calculate the total cost of the cell phones first, and then divide it by the number of months.

The total cost of the cell phones is 5 units * $150/unit = $750.

Since a 2% interest will be charged for each unit, the total interest for 5 units is 5 * 2% = 10% of the total cost.

The interest amount is 10% of $750 = 0.1 * $750 = $75.

So, the total amount Shiela needs to pay is the cost of the cell phones plus the interest, which is $750 + $75 = $825.

Since Shiela will pay this amount over 3 months, we need to divide the total amount by 3 to find out how much she will pay each month.

$825 / 3 = $275.

The final answer is: $275"
"To find out how much Artie will make, we need to calculate the total revenue from each type of flower and then add them together.

First, let's round the prices to the nearest dollar:
- Marigolds: $2.74 → $3
- Petunias: $1.87 → $2
- Begonias: $2.12 → $2

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from each type of flower:
- Marigolds: 12 pots * $3/pot = $36
- Petunias: 9 pots * $2/pot = $18
- Begonias: 17 pots * $2/pot = $34

Now, let's add the total revenue from each type of flower:
$36 + $18 + $34 = $88

The final answer is: $88"
"To find the average square footage of a level, we need to first find the total square footage of the sandcastle and then divide it by the number of levels.

Since each level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can start with the top level and work our way down. 

The top level has a square footage of 16. 
The second level will have half of 16, which is 8. 
The third level will have half of 8, which is 4. 
The fourth level will have half of 4, which is 2.

Now, we add up the square footage of all levels: 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30.

There are 4 levels in total. To find the average square footage, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels: 30 / 4 = 7.5.

The final answer is: 7.5"
"To find the total number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total number of cups of dog food the puppy will eat in the first year and then divide it by the number of cups in a bag.

The puppy eats 1 cup of dog food for the first 180 days. 
The puppy eats 2 cups of dog food for the rest of its life, which is 365 - 180 = 185 days.

Total cups of dog food for the first 180 days = 1 cup/day * 180 days = 180 cups
Total cups of dog food for the rest of the year = 2 cups/day * 185 days = 370 cups

Total cups of dog food in the first year = 180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the total number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year is:
550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
- Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, so David does 400 / 4 = 100 pounds of laundry.
- Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so Raymond does 400 / 2 = 200 pounds of laundry.

To find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do, we subtract the amount David does from the amount Raymond does: 200 - 100 = 100.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the better price, we need to compare the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 and packages of 2.

For packages of 3: 
- Number of packages = 18 / 3 = 6
- Total cost = 6 * $2.50 = $15

For packages of 2: 
- Number of packages = 18 / 2 = 9
- Total cost = 9 * $1 = $9

Since $9 is less than $15, buying in packages of 2 is the better option.

Now, let's find the savings:
- Savings = $15 - $9 = $6

The final answer is: $6"
"To find the cost of the grooming after the discount, we need to calculate 30% of the original price and subtract it from the original price.

The original price is $100. 
30% of $100 is 0.3 x $100 = $30.

Now, subtract the discount from the original price: $100 - $30 = $70.

The final cost of the grooming is $70.

"To find out how much water the girls got, we need to calculate 1/6 of 24 liters. 

1/6 of 24 liters = (1/6) * 24 = 4 liters

Since there are two girls, they each got 4 liters of water. So, the total amount of water the girls got is 4 * 2 = 8 liters.

Now, we know that the boy got 6 liters of water. 

To find out how much water is left, we need to subtract the total amount of water the girls and the boy got from the initial 24 liters.

Total water taken = 8 liters (girls) + 6 liters (boy) = 14 liters

Water left = Initial water - Total water taken
Water left = 24 liters - 14 liters
Water left = 10 liters

"To find out how many games the team won, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the number of games they lost is x. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games they won is x + 8.

We know that the total number of games played is 22, which is the sum of the games won and lost. So, we can write the equation as:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:
2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:
2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 7

Since x represents the number of games lost, the number of games won is x + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15

"To find Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we first need to calculate her salary after five years of service, and then calculate the increase for the next three years.

Initially, Sylvie's salary is $600. 

After one year, her salary will be 600 + (10% of 600) = 600 + 60 = $660.

After two years, her salary will be 660 + (10% of 660) = 660 + 66 = $726.

After three years, her salary will be 726 + (10% of 726) = 726 + 72.6 = $798.60.

After four years, her salary will be 798.60 + (10% of 798.60) = 798.60 + 79.86 = $878.46.

After five years, her salary will be 878.46 + (10% of 878.46) = 878.46 + 87.85 = $966.31.

Now, for the next three years, her salary will increase by 10% each year. 

After six years, her salary will be 966.31 + (10% of 966.31) = 966.31 + 96.63 = $1062.94.

After seven years, her salary will be 1062.94 + (10% of 1062.94) = 1062.94 + 106.29 = $1169.23.

After eight years, her salary will be 1169.23 + (10% of 1169.23) = 1169.23 + 116.92 = $1286.15.

So, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service will be $1286.15."
"Let's break down the information given. We know that Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's. If we let the number of copies Harald sold be 'x', then the number of copies Marilyn sold would be 10x.

We also know that the total number of copies sold by both of them is 88,000. So, we can set up the equation: x + 10x = 88,000.

Combining like terms, we get 11x = 88,000.

To find the value of x, we divide both sides by 11: x = 88,000 / 11.

x = 8000.

The final answer is: 8000"
"To find out how many gift bags Christina needs, we first need to calculate the number of guests she expects to attend. Since 1/4 of the invited guests don't show up, we can find the number of expected attendees by subtracting 1/4 from the total number of invited guests.

Number of invited guests = 16
Number of guests not showing up = 1/4 * 16 = 4
Number of expected attendees = 16 - 4 = 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we multiply the number of expected attendees by 0.75 to find the total number of gift bags needed.

Number of gift bags needed = 12 * 0.75 = 9

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of gift bags needed by the cost per gift bag.

Cost per gift bag = $2
Total cost = 9 * $2 = $18

"To find Gerald's new time, we first need to find out how long it took him to run the 400-meter hurdles before his diet change. Since Lee runs 2 seconds faster than Gerald, we can set up an equation: 

Lee's time = Gerald's time + 2 seconds
38 = Gerald's time + 2

Now, we can solve for Gerald's original time:
Gerald's time = 38 - 2
Gerald's time = 36 seconds

Gerald's speed improved by 10%, so we need to find 10% of his original time and add it to his original time to find his new time:
10% of 36 = 0.1 * 36 = 3.6 seconds
New time = Original time + Improvement
New time = 36 + 3.6
New time = 39.6 seconds

The final answer is: 39.6"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem.

We know that the number of dogs is 60. Since there are two cats for every dog, the number of cats can be calculated as follows:
Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
= 2 * 60
= 120

We are also given that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. Let's denote the combined number of dogs and cats as D + C, where D is the number of dogs and C is the number of cats. We already know that D = 60 and C = 120.

The number of rabbits (R) is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats, so we can write the equation as:
R = D + C - 12

Substituting the values of D and C, we get:
R = 60 + 120 - 12
R = 168

Now, to find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we need to add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:
Total number of pets = D + C + R

"To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we first need to find the total number of girls and then subtract the number of girls in the girl scout.

First, let's find the number of boys and girls. We know that 2/5 of the students are boys. 

Number of boys = (2/5) * 200 = 80

Since there are 200 students in total, the number of girls can be found by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students.

Number of girls = 200 - 80 = 120

Now, we know that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. 

Number of girls in the girl scout = (2/3) * 120 = 80

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls.

Number of girls not in the girl scout = 120 - 80 = 40

"To find the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we need to first determine the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam. 

We know that 20 cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. Since 5 cars took an exit, we need to subtract those from the total number of cars that were originally on the motorway. 

Total cars originally on the motorway = 30
Cars that took an exit = 5
Cars that drove through the traffic jam = Total cars originally on the motorway - Cars that took an exit
Cars that drove through the traffic jam = 30 - 5 = 25

Now, we know that 20 cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. To find the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes, we subtract the number of cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes from the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam.

Cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes = Cars that drove through the traffic jam - Cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to find the inner volume of one box and then multiply it by 3.

The dimensions of the box are given as 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches, but the walls are 1 inch thick. This means that the inner dimensions of the box will be (5-2) inches by (6-2) inches by (4-2) inches, since 1 inch is subtracted from each side for the wall thickness.

So, the inner dimensions of the box are 3 inches by 4 inches by 2 inches.

The formula to find the volume of a rectangular box is length * width * height. 

Inner volume of one box = 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches.

Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes = 24 * 3 = 72 cubic inches.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 2 episodes of 1-hour shows, which is a total of 2 * 1 = 2 hours.

On Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. Let's call the number of episodes 'x'. The total time he watched on Wednesday is 30x minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert this to hours by dividing by 60: 30x / 60 = 0.5x hours.

On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show. The total time he watched on Thursday is 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 hours.

On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, which is a total of 2 * 1 = 2 hours.

The total time he watched TV in all is 7 hours. We can set up an equation to represent this:

2 (Monday and Tuesday) + 0.5x (Wednesday) + 1.5 (Thursday) + 2 (Friday) = 7

Combine like terms:
2 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 = 7

Combine the constants:
5.5 + 0.5x = 7

Subtract 5.5 from both sides:
0.5x = 1.5

Divide both sides by 0.5:
x = 3

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as 'x'. Since Henry wants to make twice as many as he did last year, he plans to bake 2x cookies this year.

However, he actually baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the actual number of cookies he baked is 2x + 15.

After dropping 5 cookies, he has a total of 110 cookies. This can be represented as (2x + 15) - 5 = 110.

Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 10 = 110.

Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get 2x = 100.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 50.

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To find the total cost of gas after the cashback rewards, we need to first calculate the total cost of gas without the rewards and then subtract the cashback amount.

The cost of gas per gallon is $3.00, and the person is buying 10 gallons. 

Total cost of gas = cost per gallon * number of gallons
Total cost of gas = $3.00 * 10
Total cost of gas = $30.00

The cashback reward is $0.20 per gallon, and the person is buying 10 gallons.

Total cashback = cashback per gallon * number of gallons
Total cashback = $0.20 * 10
Total cashback = $2.00

Now, we subtract the total cashback from the total cost of gas to find the final cost.

Final cost = Total cost of gas - Total cashback
Final cost = $30.00 - $2.00
Final cost = $28.00

"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to calculate the total amount of water taken on per second and then multiply it by the total time taken to reach the shore.

First, let's find the rate at which the boat is taking on water. It takes 2 liters for every 10 feet, and it takes 16 seconds to row 20 feet. 

Since 20 feet is twice 10 feet, the boat will take on twice the amount of water, which is 2 * 2 = 4 liters in 16 seconds.

Now, let's find the rate of water intake per second. 4 liters in 16 seconds is 4/16 = 0.25 liters per second.

The total time taken to reach the shore is 64 seconds. So, the total amount of water taken on is 0.25 liters/second * 64 seconds = 16 liters.

"To find the total number of flowers Ryan has, we need to calculate the total number of flowers he planted and subtract the ones that did not grow.

Ryan plants 2 flowers a day. After 15 days, he would have planted 2 * 15 = 30 flowers.

However, 5 of these flowers did not grow. So, we need to subtract 5 from the total number of flowers planted.

Total flowers = 30 - 5 = 25

The final answer is: 25"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem.

Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs. Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, we can find the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold by dividing 1800 by 6.

Brittany's phone can hold 1800 / 6 = 300 photographs.

The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Let's call the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph 'x'. Then, 50x = 300.

To find the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph, we can divide both sides of the equation by 50.

x = 300 / 50
x = 6

So, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total cost of the lumber, we need to calculate the cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards and the 4 x 4 x 10 boards separately and then add them together.

The cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $10 per board = $100.

The cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $16 per board = $80.

The total cost of the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since prices have gone up by 50%, the new price of the lumber is 1.5 times the original price. 

The new price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 per board.

The new price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 per board.

The total revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $15 per board = $150.

The total revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $24 per board = $120.

The total revenue is $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, we need to first find the total parts in the ratio, which is 7 + 13 = 20. 

We know that the total amount of sugar and water used is 120 teaspoons. To find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar, we need to find the fraction of the total that represents the sugar, which is 7/20. 

We can multiply the total amount of sugar and water (120) by the fraction of sugar (7/20) to find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar used:

(7/20) * 120 = (7 * 120) / 20
= 840 / 20
= 42

The number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used is 42."
"To find the total amount John paid, we need to calculate the cost of the shoes for all 3 children. 

First, we find the cost of shoes for one child: 2 pairs * $60 per pair = $120.

So, John paid a total of $360. 

The final answer is: $360"
"To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we first need to find the total number of vehicles already present at the port on the first day. 

There were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles on the first day is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of vehicles on the second day is 30. To find the number of vehicles brought in on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles already present from the total number of vehicles on the second day: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers brought in on the second day is 20 / 5 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we first need to find Lylah's salary four years ago. 

Let's assume Lylah's salary four years ago was 'x'. Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can express Adrien's salary as 1.3x. We are given that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000, so we can set up the equation:

1.3x = 40000

To find 'x', we can divide both sides by 1.3:

x = 40000 / 1.3
x = 30769.23

So, Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30769.23.

Now, we need to find Adrien's salary four years later. We are given that his salary increased by 40% of his original salary. 

Adrien's salary four years later = 40000 + (40% of 40000)
= 40000 + (0.4 * 40000)
= 40000 + 16000
= 56000

Since Lylah's salary increased simultaneously, we need to find her salary four years later. We can assume her original salary was 30769.23. 

Lylah's salary four years later = 30769.23 + (40% of 30769.23)
= 30769.23 + (0.4 * 30769.23)
= 30769.23 + 12307.69
= 43076.92

Now, we can find the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later:

Total salary = Adrien's salary four years later + Lylah's salary four years later
= 56000 + 43076.92
= 99076.92

The final answer is: $99077"
"To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we first need to calculate how many sheets he uses in a week and then multiply that by the number of weeks in a month.

Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad has 30 sheets. So, the total sheets used in a week is 2 * 30 = 60 sheets.

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly usage by 4 to get the monthly usage. 

60 sheets/week * 4 weeks/month = 240 sheets/month

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the total number of fruits, we first need to determine the number of fruits each person brought. 

Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges. 

Kael brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette, so Kael brought 2 * 5 = 10 apples. 
Kael brought half the number of oranges as Morisette, so Kael brought 8 / 2 = 4 oranges.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits each person brought: 
Morisette brought 5 + 8 = 13 fruits.
Kael brought 10 + 4 = 14 fruits.

To find the total number of fruits, we add the number of fruits each person brought: 
13 (Morisette's fruits) + 14 (Kael's fruits) = 27

The final answer is: 27"
"To find the total hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we need to calculate the hours she slept on each day and add them up.

On Monday, Sadie slept 8 hours.

For the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday), she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours each day.

The rest of the week (Thursday to Sunday) she slept 1 hour more than those two days, so she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours each day.

Now, let's calculate the total hours she slept for each day:
- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday: 6 hours
- Wednesday: 6 hours
- Thursday: 7 hours
- Friday: 7 hours
- Saturday: 7 hours
- Sunday: 7 hours

Now, let's add up the total hours:

"To find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to calculate the distance she covers in the first 3 hours and the distance she covers in the remaining 4 hours.

In the first 3 hours, Rosie runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour. So, the distance covered in 3 hours is:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour x 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

In the remaining 4 hours, Rosie runs at a speed of 5 miles per hour. So, the distance covered in 4 hours is:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour x 4 hours
Distance = 20 miles

Total distance covered in 7 hours = Distance in first 3 hours + Distance in remaining 4 hours
Total distance = 30 miles + 20 miles
Total distance = 50 miles

"Let's break down the information given. Jennie has a pile of 60 letters needing stamps. She puts stamps on one-third of these letters. This means she stamps 60 / 3 = 20 letters.

Now, we know that after stamping these 20 letters, the total number of letters in the already-stamped pile is 30. This means that before stamping the 20 letters, the number of letters in the already-stamped pile was 30 - 20 = 10.

So, when Jennie began, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Julia initially bought a package of spoons, but we don't know the quantity yet. Let's call this quantity 'x'.
2. Her husband bought a package of 5 new spoons and gave them to Julia.
3. Julia used 3 spoons while making the stew.
4. After using the spoons, Julia had a total of 12 spoons.

Now, let's write an equation to represent the situation:

Initial spoons (x) + spoons from her husband (5) - spoons used (3) = Total spoons (12)

x + 5 - 3 = 12

Simplifying the equation:

x + 2 = 12

Subtract 2 from both sides:

x = 10

So, Julia bought a package of 10 spoons.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we need to add the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages. 

First, let's find the number of fish sausages. Since Dylan bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, we can add 6 to the number of chicken sausages: 38 + 6 = 44.

Now, we can add the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages to find the total: 38 + 44 = 82.

The final answer is: 82"
"To find the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together, we first need to determine the number of friends Amy has. Since Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, and Lily has 50 friends, we can calculate Amy's friends by adding 20 to Lily's friends.

Amy's friends = Lily's friends + 20
Amy's friends = 50 + 20
Amy's friends = 70

Now, to find the total number of friends they have together, we add the number of friends Lily and Amy have.

Total friends = Lily's friends + Amy's friends
Total friends = 50 + 70
Total friends = 120

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them up.

First, let's find the cost of a watermelon. Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, and each pepper costs $15, a watermelon costs 3 * $15 = $45.

Next, we find the cost of an orange. An orange costs 5 dollars less than a watermelon, so an orange costs $45 - $5 = $40.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of each item:

- 4 watermelons: 4 * $45 = $180
- 20 peppers: 20 * $15 = $300
- 10 oranges: 10 * $40 = $400

Adding these up, we get the total amount of money Dillon will spend: $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

The final answer is: $880"
"To find the total profit, we first need to calculate the total time spent by doctors and the total amount charged to patients.

The hospital sees 500 people a day, and each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes. 

First, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. 
24 minutes = 24/60 = 0.4 hours

The total time spent by doctors is the number of patients multiplied by the time per patient.
Total time spent by doctors = 500 * 0.4 = 200 hours

The hospital charges $150 an hour to the doctors, so the total cost to the hospital is:
Total cost to the hospital = 200 * $150 = $30,000

The hospital charges $200 an hour to the patients. The total time spent by patients is the same as the time spent by doctors, which is 200 hours.
Total amount charged to patients = 200 * $200 = $40,000

The profit made by the hospital is the total amount charged to patients minus the total cost to the hospital.
Profit = $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000

The hospital makes $10,000 profit from these visits.

"To find the total number of tickets used, we need to calculate the total number of rides taken by both Pam and Fred, and then multiply it by the cost of each ride.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, so she took a total of 2 + 2 = 4 rides.
Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, so he took a total of 4 + 2 = 6 rides.

The total number of rides taken by both Pam and Fred is 4 + 6 = 10 rides.

Since each ride costs 6 tickets, the total number of tickets used is 10 * 6 = 60.

"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we first need to determine how many miles he walked on Tuesday. 

On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. 
On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, which is 4 * 6 = 24 miles.

Now, we know that his total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. We already know that he walked 4 miles on Monday and 24 miles on Tuesday. 

So, the total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday is 4 + 24 = 28 miles. 

To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we subtract the total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage from Monday through Wednesday: 41 - 28 = 13 miles.

For the first test, Mark had 8 hours to complete 75 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour. 

First, let's find out how many questions Mark completed in 8 hours: 
8 hours * 5 questions per hour = 40 questions

Since Mark completed 40 questions in 8 hours, he left 75 - 40 = 35 questions incomplete in the first test.

For the second test, Mark had 6 hours to complete 100 questions at the same rate of 5 questions per hour.

Now, let's find out how many questions Mark completed in 6 hours: 
6 hours * 5 questions per hour = 30 questions

"Let's break down the information given. 

Let the number of baby bees be x. 
Since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, the number of worker bees is 2x. 
Also, there are twice as many babies as queens, so the number of queens is x/2. 

We know that the total number of bees in the hive is 700. So, the sum of worker bees, baby bees, and queens is 700. 

We can write the equation: x + 2x + x/2 = 700 

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 2x + 4x + x = 1400 

Combine like terms: 7x = 1400 

Divide both sides by 7: x = 200 

Now that we know the number of baby bees is 200, we can find the number of worker bees, which is 2x = 2 * 200 = 400

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of food items and non-food items separately and then add the tax to the non-food items.

Food items: milk and eggs
Cost of milk = 2 dollars
Cost of eggs = 3 dollars
Total cost of food items = 2 + 3 = 5 dollars

Non-food items: light bulbs, cups, and roach traps
Cost of light bulbs = 3 dollars
Cost of cups = 3 dollars
Cost of roach traps = 4 dollars
Total cost of non-food items = 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars

Since there is a 10% tax on non-food items, we need to calculate the tax amount.
Tax amount = 10% of 10 dollars = 0.1 * 10 = 1 dollar

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of non-food items.
Total cost of non-food items with tax = 10 + 1 = 11 dollars

Now, we add the cost of food items and non-food items with tax to get the total cost.
Total cost = 5 + 11 = 16 dollars

"I think there's been a mistake in the question. It says ""Kim"" has started the business, but then refers to ""Lucas"" in the last sentence. I'll assume it's referring to Kim throughout the response.

To calculate the total expenses, we need to find out how many bottles of bleach and packs of cloths Kim will need for all 8 clients. Since each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths, the total number of bottles of bleach needed is 8 * 2 = 16, and the total number of packs of cloths needed is 8 * 1 = 8.

The cost of bleach is $2 per bottle, so the total cost of bleach is 16 * $2 = $32. The cost of cloths is $5 per pack, so the total cost of cloths is 8 * $5 = $40.

The total expenses are the sum of the cost of bleach and the cost of cloths, which is $32 + $40 = $72.

Since Kim's total income is $92, the profit is the difference between the total income and the total expenses, which is $92 - $72 = $20.

"To find out how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we first need to calculate the total number of pineapples in his field. 

John has 10 hectares of a pineapple field, and there are 100 pineapples per hectare. So, the total number of pineapples in his field is 10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples.

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, we need to find out how many 3-month periods are in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so the number of 3-month periods in a year is 12 months / 3 months/period = 4 periods.

Now, we can calculate the total number of pineapples John can harvest in a year by multiplying the total number of pineapples in his field by the number of harvest periods in a year: 1000 pineapples * 4 periods = 4000 pineapples.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of the bees that left in the first 6 hours return. So, 1/2 * 30 = 15 bees return.
3. The number of bees that have left but not returned so far is 30 - 15 = 15 bees.
4. In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees as the ones that left in the first 6 hours fly from the hive and leave. So, 2 * 30 = 60 bees leave.
5. The total number of bees that left but not returned so far is 15 (from step 3) + 60 (from step 4) = 75 bees.
6. In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive. So, 75 bees return.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. We know that Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends. 

Let's represent the number of friends Dorothy has as 'x'. Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, we can represent Charlie's friends as 3x. We are given that Charlie has 12 friends, so we can set up the equation 3x = 12.

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3. This gives us x = 12 / 3, which simplifies to x = 4. 

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find the number of friends James has. We are told that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. Since Dorothy has 4 friends, we can represent James' friends as 4 * 4 = 16.

"To find out who will win the race, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school.

First, let's convert the distance from miles to feet for both Steve and Tim. Since 1 mile is equal to 5280 feet, we can convert their distances as follows:

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15,840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10,560 feet

Now, let's calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school:

Steve's time: distance / speed = 15,840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: distance / speed = 10,560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 36 minutes to get home and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve will win the race. To find out how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to subtract the winner's time from the loser's time:

"To find out how much Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total cost of inflating all the tires. 

First, let's calculate the cost of inflating the bicycle tires. Each bicycle has 2 tires, and there were 5 bicycles. So, the total number of bicycle tires is 5 * 2 = 10. The cost of inflating each tire is 25 cents, so the total cost for the bicycle tires is 10 * 25 cents = 250 cents. 

Next, let's calculate the cost of inflating the tricycle tires. Each tricycle has 3 tires, and there were 3 tricycles. So, the total number of tricycle tires is 3 * 3 = 9. The cost of inflating each tire is 25 cents, so the total cost for the tricycle tires is 9 * 25 cents = 225 cents.

Now, let's calculate the cost of inflating the unicycle tire. A unicycle has 1 tire, and there was 1 unicycle. So, the total number of unicycle tires is 1 * 1 = 1. The cost of inflating each tire is 25 cents, so the total cost for the unicycle tire is 1 * 25 cents = 25 cents.

Now, let's add up the total cost of inflating all the tires: 250 cents + 225 cents + 25 cents = 500 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100. So, 500 cents is equal to 500 / 100 = 5 dollars.

The final answer is: $5"
"To find out how much change Carl receives, we first need to calculate the total cost of the cookies. 

There are 10 packs of cookies, and each pack has 6 cookies. So, the total number of cookies is 10 * 6 = 60 cookies.

Each cookie costs $0.10, so the total cost of the cookies is 60 * $0.10 = $6.

Carl pays with a $10 bill, so the change he receives is $10 - $6 = $4.

The final answer is: $4"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume the initial number of french fries in the pack is x.

1. Dave ate 14 fries, so the remaining fries are x - 14.
2. The seagull ate half of the 14 fries Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries. Now, the seagull has eaten a total of 7 fries, and the remaining fries are (x - 14) - 7 = x - 21.
3. The seagull now has x - 21 fries. Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate a total of 3 * 3 = 9 fries. The seagull now has x - 21 - 9 = x - 30 fries.
4. The seagull now has x - 30 fries. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries, which is (2/3) * (x - 30). The remaining fries are (x - 30) - (2/3) * (x - 30).
5. To simplify the expression, we can factor out (x - 30) from the remaining fries: (x - 30) - (2/3) * (x - 30) = (x - 30) * (1 - 2/3) = (x - 30) * (1/3).
6. The remaining fries are (x - 30) * (1/3). Ants carried off a final french fry, leaving 5 behind. So, (x - 30) * (1/3) - 1 = 5.
7. To solve for x, we can add 1 to both sides of the equation: (x - 30) * (1/3) = 6.
8. Multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction: x - 30 = 18.
9. Add 30 to both sides to solve for x: x = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the total hours Kimo spends attending classes in a semester, we need to calculate the total hours he spends in a week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a semester.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes, each lasting 1 hour. So, the total hours he spends on these days in a week is 3 * 1 = 3 hours.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes, each lasting 2 hours. So, the total hours he spends on these days in a week is 2 * 2 = 4 hours.

The total hours Kimo spends in a week is 3 + 4 = 7 hours.

Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, the total hours Kimo spends attending classes in a semester is 7 * 16 = 112 hours.

The final answer is: 112"
"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the length of each type of baked good in feet and then add them together.

First, let's convert the length of each type of baked good from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

- Each roll is 4 inches long, which is 4/12 = 1/3 feet long.
- Each croissant is 6 inches long, which is 6/12 = 1/2 feet long.
- Each baguette is 2 feet long.

Now, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good in feet:

- Total length of rolls: 300 rolls * 1/3 feet per roll = 100 feet
- Total length of croissants: 120 croissants * 1/2 feet per croissant = 60 feet
- Total length of baguettes: 60 baguettes * 2 feet per baguette = 120 feet

Now, let's add the total length of all the baked goods together: 100 feet + 60 feet + 120 feet = 280 feet.

The final answer is: 280"
"To find the total number of bananas needed for 2 months, we need to calculate the total number of bananas needed for each type of ape and then add them together.

The monkeys need 200 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 200 * 2 = 400 bananas.

The gorillas need 400 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 400 * 2 = 800 bananas.

The baboons need 100 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 100 * 2 = 200 bananas.

Now, let's add the total number of bananas needed for each type of ape: 400 (monkeys) + 800 (gorillas) + 200 (baboons) = 1400 bananas.

The zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months. 

The final answer is: 1400"
"To find out who the winner is, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Since he's running back and forth, the total distance he covers is 2 times the length of the field for each run. So, the total distance Blake ran is 15 * 2 * 100 = 3000 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 2 * 100 = 200 yards. Then, she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 2 * 40 = 80 yards. She does this 34 times, so the total distance she covers is 34 * 80 = 2720 yards. 

To find the total distance Kelly ran, we add the initial 200 yards to the distance she ran to the 40-yard line and back: 2720 + 200 = 2920 yards.

Now, we compare the distances: Blake ran 3000 yards, and Kelly ran 2920 yards. Blake is the winner.

To find out how much farther the winner ran than the loser, we subtract the loser's distance from the winner's distance: 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

The final answer is: 80"

"To find the number of tadpoles Finn can see in the pond now, we need to subtract the number of tadpoles that hid from the number of tadpoles that came out of hiding.

Initially, Finn saw 11 tadpoles. 
6 tadpoles came out of hiding, so now there are 11 + 6 = 17 tadpoles.
Then, 2 tadpoles hid under a rock, so we subtract 2 from 17: 17 - 2 = 15.

"To find the depth of the water in the tank on Wednesday, we need to follow the given information step by step.

On Monday, the tank has a depth of 17 feet.

On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water, so we add 7 to the initial depth:
17 + 7 = 24 feet

On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday. To find two-thirds of the depth on Tuesday, we multiply the depth on Tuesday by 2/3:
24 * (2/3) = 16 feet

"To find the total number of fish caught by Anakin, we need to add the number of starfish, sea horses, and clownfish he caught. 

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. 

Total fish caught by Anakin = 10 + 6 + 3 = 19

Now, let's find the number of fish caught by Locsin. 

Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so he caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.

Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so he caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.

Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so he caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Total fish caught by Locsin = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

Now, let's find the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin.

Total fish caught = Total fish caught by Anakin + Total fish caught by Locsin
= 19 + 13

"To find out how many times Sandra has to babysit, we need to determine how many eggs she needs in total for the Spanish flans and then divide that by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting job.

First, let's calculate the total number of eggs needed for 15 Spanish flans. Since each flan requires 3 eggs, we multiply 15 by 3.

15 * 3 = 45 eggs

Now, we know Sandra gets 9 eggs per babysitting job. To find out how many times she needs to babysit, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting job.

45 eggs / 9 eggs per babysitting job = 5 babysitting jobs

So, Sandra has to babysit 5 times to get enough eggs for 15 Spanish flans.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let's assume Brooke's current age is 'x'. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's current age is '2x'.

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be 'x + 2' and Seth's age will be '2x + 2'. According to the problem, the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28. So, we can write the equation:

(x + 2) + (2x + 2) = 28

Combine like terms:

3x + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3x = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 8

Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's current age is 2x, which is 2 * 8 = 16.

The final answer is: 16"

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red.
2. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four.
3. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, and Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.

From point 3, we know Sally Four is 8 years old. 

From point 2, we can calculate Granny Red's age: 
Granny Red's age = 2 * Sally Four's age
Granny Red's age = 2 * 8
Granny Red's age = 16

From point 1, we can calculate Sally Two's age: 
Sally Two's age = Granny Red's age + 3
Sally Two's age = 16 + 3
Sally Two's age = 19

Now, we know the ages of Sally Four, Sally Two, and Granny Red. We still need to find the age of the fourth bird, but there's no information about the fourth bird's age. However, the question asks for the total age of the four birds. Since we have three out of four birds' ages, we can calculate the total age of the three birds we know and assume the fourth bird's age is unknown for now.

Total age of Sally Four, Sally Two, and Granny Red = Sally Four's age + Sally Two's age + Granny Red's age
Total age of Sally Four, Sally Two, and Granny Red = 8 + 19 + 16
Total age of Sally Four, Sally Two, and Granny Red = 43

Since we don't have information about the fourth bird's age, we can't calculate the total age of all four birds. However, we can express the total age as an equation: 
Total age of all four birds = Total age of Sally Four, Sally Two, and Granny Red + Age of the fourth bird
Total age of all four birds = 43 + Age of the fourth bird

Since the question asks for a numerical answer, we can assume the fourth bird's age is 0 (which is not possible in reality, but it's a valid mathematical assumption for this problem). 

The final answer is: $\boxed{43}$"
"To find out how much Jessica pays in a year, we first need to calculate her monthly payments for each debt. 

For the student loans, she pays 50% more than the minimum of $300, which is 1.5 * $300 = $450. 
For the credit card, she pays 50% more than the minimum of $200, which is 1.5 * $200 = $300. 
For the mortgage, she pays 50% more than the minimum of $500, which is 1.5 * $500 = $750.

Now, we add up the monthly payments: $450 + $300 + $750 = $1500.

To find the yearly payment, we multiply the monthly payment by 12: $1500 * 12 = $18,000.

Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds = 5/60 minutes (converting seconds to minutes)

Total time to peel all potatoes: 60 potatoes * 1.5 minutes/potato = 90 minutes
Total time to cut all potatoes: 60 potatoes * (5/60) minutes/potato = 5 minutes

Adding both times together: 90 minutes + 5 minutes = 95 minutes

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.

Let's denote the number of gallons they made as 'g'. 

The cost of lemons and sugar for each gallon is $3 + $2 = $5. 
The revenue from selling each gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10. 
The profit from each gallon is $10 - $5 = $5. 
Since they made a total profit of $25, the number of gallons they made is $25 / $5 = 5 gallons.

The total cost of lemons for 5 gallons is 5 * $3 = $15.

First, let's calculate the amount Zaid spends on rent: 1/4 of his salary is 6000 * 1/4 = 1500 dollars.

Next, let's calculate the amount he spends on car fuel: 1/3 of his salary is 6000 * 1/3 = 2000 dollars.

Now, let's subtract the rent and car fuel expenses from his total salary: 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 dollars.

Since he donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity, we need to find half of 2500, which is 2500 * 1/2 = 1250 dollars.

Now, let's subtract the donation from the remaining amount: 2500 - 1250 = 1250 dollars.

Zaid gives his daughter 200 dollars and his wife 700 dollars, so we need to subtract these amounts from the remaining amount: 1250 - 200 - 700 = 350 dollars.

Therefore, Zaid will have 350 dollars left after all his expenses and donations.

The final answer is: $350"

For the second week, Lloyd tutored 8 hours at $10 per hour, so his earnings for the second week are:
8 hours * $10/hour = $80

Now, let's add his earnings for both weeks:
$50 (first week) + $80 (second week) = $130

The final answer is: $130"
"To find the number of votes the loser got, we first need to find the total number of votes the winner got. Since the winner got 3/4 of the votes, we can calculate it as follows:

Total votes = 80
Winner's votes = 3/4 * Total votes
Winner's votes = 3/4 * 80
Winner's votes = 60

Now, to find the number of votes the loser got, we subtract the winner's votes from the total votes:

Loser's votes = Total votes - Winner's votes
Loser's votes = 80 - 60
Loser's votes = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, the number of red roses is 4x.

We are also given that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations. So, the number of pink calla lilies is 5x.

We know that the total number of flowers ordered is the sum of red roses, white carnations, and pink calla lilies. However, we are not given the total number of flowers ordered. But we do know that the missing red roses are the only issue here, and we need to find out how many red roses are missing.

Since we don't have the total number of flowers, we can't directly find the missing red roses. However, we can express the total number of flowers as an equation: x (white carnations) + 4x (red roses) + 5x (pink calla lilies) = total flowers.

But we are given that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, and the number of red roses is four times the number of white carnations. This means that the number of white carnations is a common factor in both the number of red roses and pink calla lilies.

Since the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, and the number of red roses is four times the number of white carnations, we can say that the number of pink calla lilies is 5/4 times the number of red roses.

We are given that the number of pink calla lilies is 200. So, we can set up the equation: 5/4 * 4x = 200, where 4x is the number of red roses.

Solving for x, we get: 5x = 200 * 4/5
5x = 160
x = 160/5
x = 32

Now that we know the number of white carnations (x) is 32, we can find the number of red roses, which is 4x. 
Number of red roses = 4 * 32 = 128

So, Fred must deliver 128 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business. 

The final answer is: 128"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem.

Let's denote Mark's current age as M and Jean's current age as J. We know that Jean is two years older than Mark, so we can write an equation:

J = M + 2

We are also given that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. Two years ago, Mark's age would be M - 2, and Jan's age would be 30 - 2 = 28. We can write an equation based on this information:

M - 2 = (1/2) * 28 + 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

M - 2 = 14 + 5
M - 2 = 19
M = 21

Now that we know Mark's age, we can find Jean's age using the first equation:

J = M + 2
J = 21 + 2
J = 23

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total time for each team, we need to calculate the time taken by each team to complete the 4-lap relay.

The well-rounded team has each member running 400 meters in 55 seconds. Since there are 4 members, the total time for the well-rounded team is 4 * 55 = 220 seconds.

The less well-rounded team's first runner runs 400 meters in 60 seconds. The subsequent runners are 3 seconds faster than the previous one. So, the second runner runs 400 meters in 60 - 3 = 57 seconds, the third runner in 57 - 3 = 54 seconds, and the fourth runner in 54 - 3 = 51 seconds. The total time for the less well-rounded team is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 162 seconds.

The difference in time between the two teams is 220 - 162 = 58 seconds.

The faster team will win by 58 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, and then find the difference between these two probabilities.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die is the probability of rolling a 4, 5, or 6. There are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, 6) out of 6 possible outcomes, so the probability is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5 or 50%.

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5, since there are 3 even numbers (2, 4, 6) out of 6 possible outcomes. Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 = 0.25 or 25%.

Now, we need to find the difference between these two probabilities. The difference is 50% - 25% = 25%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To find out how many apples Jenna picked, we need to determine half of the number of apples her mom picked. Since her mom picked 20 apples, we can calculate Jenna's share by dividing 20 by 2.

20 / 2 = 10

Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, and her mom picked 20, Jenna picked 10 apples. To find the total number of apples they both picked, we need to add Jenna's share to her mom's share.

20 (mom's apples) + 10 (Jenna's apples) = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of small rodents (rats and hamsters) and the total number of straw pieces given to them. 

Let's start by finding the total number of straw pieces given to the hamsters. Since there are 10 cages of hamsters and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw, the total number of straw pieces given to the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

Now, we know that the total number of straw pieces distributed among the small rodents is 160. Since 50 pieces are given to the hamsters, the remaining straw pieces are given to the rats. So, the number of straw pieces given to the rats is 160 - 50 = 110.

We also know that the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. Let's assume the number of rats in each cage is 'r'. Then, the total number of rats in all the cages is 3r.

Since each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, the total number of straw pieces given to the rats is 6 * 3r = 18r.

We know that the number of straw pieces given to the rats is 110. So, we can set up the equation 18r = 110.

To find the value of 'r', we can divide both sides of the equation by 18. 

r = 110 / 18
r = 6.11 (approximately)

Since the number of rats in each cage must be a whole number, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, we can also consider the fact that the number of rats in each cage must be a multiple of 3 (since they are kept in 3 cages in equal groups). 

The nearest multiple of 3 to 6.11 is 6. 

Therefore, there are 6 rats in each cage.

The final answer is: 6"
"To calculate the total amount Mandy should pay, we need to calculate the interest for 3 months and add it to the principal amount.

The monthly interest rate is 2%, which can be represented as 0.02 in decimal form. 

The principal amount is $100.

The interest for 1 month is $100 * 0.02 = $2.

The interest for 3 months is $2 * 3 = $6.

The total amount Mandy should pay is the principal amount plus the interest for 3 months, which is $100 + $6 = $106.

The final numerical answer is: $106"
"To find the number of bags the trader sold, we need to first calculate the total cost and total revenue. 

Let's denote the number of bags as 'x'. 

The total cost of buying the bags is $20x (since each bag costs $20).
The total cost of transporting the bags is $2x (since each bag costs $2 to transport).
The total cost is the sum of the buying cost and the transportation cost: $20x + $2x = $22x.

The total revenue from selling the bags is $30x (since each bag is sold at $30).

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost: $30x - $22x = $8x.

We are given that the profit is $400, so we can set up the equation: $8x = $400.

To find the number of bags, we can divide both sides of the equation by $8: x = $400 / $8.

x = 50

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how much each friend paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets, food, and rides, and then divide it by 3.

First, let's find the cost of the food. They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. Since they spent $20.25 on tickets, the cost of food is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.

The cost of the rides is 2 rides * $33 per ride = $66.

Now, let's add up the total cost: $20.25 (tickets) + $15.75 (food) + $66 (rides) = $102.

Since they split the cost evenly, each friend paid $102 / 3 = $34.

The final answer is: $34"
"To find out how many peaches John collects, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he collects peaches and then multiply it by the number of peaches he collects per minute.

Since John collects peaches for 3 hours, we need to convert the time to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Now, we know John collects 2 peaches per minute. To find the total number of peaches collected, we multiply the total minutes by the peaches collected per minute:

180 minutes * 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches

So, John collects 360 peaches.

The final answer is: 360"
"To find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ducks needs per day, we first need to calculate the total pounds of insects they need per week. Since there are ten ducks and each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week, we multiply the number of ducks by the pounds of insects each duck needs per week.

10 ducks * 3.5 pounds/duck/week = 35 pounds/week

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of insects they need per day. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total pounds of insects needed per week by 7.

35 pounds/week / 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day

So, the flock of ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day. 

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total number of trees Tom has left, we need to calculate the net change in the number of trees over 10 years.

Initially, Tom has 50 trees.

Each year, he plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees. So, the net change in trees per year is 10 - 2 = 8.

Over 10 years, the net change in trees is 8 * 10 = 80.

So, the total number of trees after 10 years is 50 + 80 = 130.

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find the number of trees that die, we multiply 130 by 0.3 (which is 30% as a decimal).

Number of trees that die = 130 * 0.3 = 39.

Now, we subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees after 10 years to find the final number of trees.

Number of trees left = 130 - 39 = 91.

The final answer is: 91"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos on Sue's front yard.

On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. They painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back out on Sue's front yard. So, now there are 6 white flamingos and 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos.

On Sunday morning, the neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection. Now, there are 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos.

The total number of flamingos on Sue's front yard is 30 pink + 6 white = 36 flamingos.

To find out how many more pink plastic flamingos were out than white plastic flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find out how much change Violetta will get, we first need to determine how many crayons she can buy with $20. Since one crayon costs $2, we can divide the total amount she has by the cost of one crayon.

$20 ÷ $2 = 10 crayons

Since Violetta needs 5 different colors, we can assume she will buy 2 crayons of each color (although the problem doesn't specify this, it's a reasonable assumption). 

The total number of crayons she will buy is 5 colors * 2 crayons per color = 10 crayons

Since she can buy 10 crayons with $20 and she actually buys 10 crayons, the total cost will be 10 crayons * $2 per crayon = $20

The change she will get is $0, as the total cost of the crayons is equal to the amount she has."
"To find the cost of a pen, we need to add the cost of a pencil and an eraser, since a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined. 

Cost of a pencil = $1.20
Cost of an eraser = $0.30
Cost of a pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser = $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50

Now, we need to find the cost of 8 pens. 

Cost of 8 pens = Cost of a pen * 8 = $1.50 * 8 = $12.00

"To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we first need to calculate the total pounds of carrots that will be used by the restaurants. 

Each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants. 

Total pounds of carrots used = Number of restaurants * Pounds per restaurant
Total pounds of carrots used = 40 * 2
Total pounds of carrots used = 80 pounds

Now, we subtract the total pounds of carrots used from the total pounds of carrots available to find out how many pounds will not be used.

Pounds of carrots not used = Total pounds of carrots - Total pounds of carrots used
Pounds of carrots not used = 200 - 80
Pounds of carrots not used = 120

"Let's break down the information given. Mark edits 1000 sentences each week, and Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence. Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, he also edits 1000 sentences for Publisher B.

We know that Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays 2 * 5 cents = 10 cents per sentence.

Mark's total earnings from Publisher A would be 1000 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 5000 cents.

Since Mark earns twice as much from Publisher B, his total earnings from Publisher B would be 2 * 5000 cents = 10000 cents.

Mark's total earnings in a week would be the sum of his earnings from both publishers: 5000 cents + 10000 cents = 15000 cents.

"To calculate John's total earnings for the year, we need to consider both the one-time monetary reward and the 5% raise in salary.

First, let's calculate the total amount John earns from his weekly salary for the year. Since he earns $2000 per week and works every week of the year (52 weeks), his total earnings from his salary would be:

2000 * 52 = 104,000

Now, let's calculate the 5% raise in salary. A 5% raise on his current salary of $2000 would be:

2000 * 0.05 = 100

So, his new salary would be:

2000 + 100 = 2100

Now, let's calculate his total earnings from his new salary for the year:

2100 * 52 = 109,200

Now, let's add the one-time monetary reward of $5000 to his total earnings:

For the sandwiches, Carl ate 7 days' worth of sandwiches (since it's a week) and used 2 slices per sandwich. So, the total slices used for sandwiches = 7 * 2 = 14.

For the omelets, Carl ate 3 days' worth of omelets and used 3 slices per omelet (since he used one more slice per omelet than per sandwich). So, the total slices used for omelets = 3 * 3 = 9.

For the macaroni and cheese dish, Carl used 8 slices.

Now, let's add the slices used for sandwiches, omelets, and the macaroni and cheese dish together: 14 + 9 + 8 = 31.

"To find the total number of pens Janet has now, we need to calculate the number of blue and red pens she bought and add them to the initial number of pens she had.

Janet initially had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, so she had a total of 22 + 10 = 32 pens.

She bought 6 bags of blue pens, with 9 pens in each bag, so she bought 6 x 9 = 54 blue pens.

She bought 2 bags of red pens, with 6 pens in each bag, so she bought 2 x 6 = 12 red pens.

Now, let's add the number of blue and red pens she bought to the initial number of pens she had: 54 (blue) + 12 (red) = 66.

Adding the blue and red pens to the initial number of pens, we get: 32 (initial pens) + 66 (new pens) = 98.

So, Janet now has 98 pens.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy and the total amount of money she has earned so far. 

The total cost of the items is the cost of the jacket plus the cost of 2 pairs of shoes: 
$30 (jacket) + 2 * $20 (shoes) = $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved before she started babysitting. She earns $5 each time she babysits the kids, so the total amount she has earned from babysitting is 4 * $5 = $20. 

The total amount of money Sara has is the sum of the money she already had and the money she earned from babysitting: 
$10 (initial savings) + $20 (babysitting earnings) = $30.

To find out how much more money Sara needs, we subtract the total amount she has from the total cost of the items: 
$70 (total cost) - $30 (total amount she has) = $40.

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn, we divide the amount she needs by the amount she earns per mowing:

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as 'r' and the number of white chickens as 'w'. We know that w = r + 2.

The total number of eggs collected is the sum of the eggs produced by red and white chickens. Since each red chicken produces 3 eggs and each white chicken produces 5 eggs, we can write the equation:

3r + 5w = 42

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

The number of red chickens is 4.

"To find the time Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park since he walks around the edge. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the dimensions of the park, l = 6 miles and w = 1.5 miles, we can substitute these values into the formula:

P = 2(6 + 1.5)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles/hour, we can find the time he spends walking by dividing the perimeter by his speed:

Time = Perimeter / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

"Let's break down the information given. 

On the first day, Sloane counts 100 customers. 
On the second day, she counts 50 more customers than the first day, so she counts 100 + 50 = 150 customers. 
The total number of customers by the third day is 500. 

To find the number of customers on the third day, we need to subtract the total customers on the first two days from the total by the third day. 
Total customers on the first two days = 100 + 150 = 250. 
Customers on the third day = 500 - 250 = 250.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as 'x' gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the initial amount of water in the big pool is 2x gallons.

Since both pools leak at 4 gallons/minute, the rate of water loss for both pools is the same. 

The difference in the amount of water between the big and small pool is 2x - x = x gallons. Since they leak at the same rate, the difference in the amount of water between the big and small pool remains constant.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as 'y' gallons. Then, the current amount of water in the big pool is 4y gallons.

The difference in the amount of water between the big and small pool is still x gallons. Since they have been leaking for 4 minutes, the total amount of water lost from both pools is 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.

The difference in the amount of water between the big and small pool is x gallons, and the total amount of water lost is 16 gallons. So, the difference in the amount of water between the big and small pool after 4 minutes is x - 16 gallons.

Since the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool, we can set up the equation: 4y - y = x - 16.

Simplifying the equation, we get 3y = x - 16.

We also know that the initial difference in the amount of water between the big and small pool is x gallons. Since they have been leaking for 4 minutes, the current difference is x - 16 gallons. The current difference is also equal to the initial difference, which is x gallons. So, we can set up the equation: x - 16 = x.

Simplifying the equation, we get -16 = 0, which is not possible. However, we can rewrite the equation as x - 16 = x, which implies that the difference in the amount of water between the big and small pool is constant.

Since the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool, we can set up the equation: 4y = y + x.

Simplifying the equation, we get 3y = x.

Now we have two equations: 3y = x and 3y = x - 16. Since both equations are equal to x, we can set them equal to each other: x = x - 16.

Simplifying the equation, we get 16 = 0, which is not possible. However, we can rewrite the equation as x = x - 16, which implies that the difference in the amount of water between the big and small pool is constant.

"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy and then divide that by her hourly wage.

The total cost of the items is the cost of the shoes plus the cost of the belt: $320.00 + $32.00 = $352.00.

Now, we divide the total cost by Lori's hourly wage: $352.00 ÷ $8.00 = 44 hours.

So, Lori needs to work 44 hours to earn enough money to buy the shoes and the belt. 

44"
"To find the remaining balance, we first need to calculate the total amount Janeth will pay in 12 months. 

Janeth pays $165 per month for 12 months, so the total amount she pays is:
$165 * 12 = $1980

Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. The additional amount is 10% of $2000, which is:
$2000 * 0.10 = $200

So, the total amount Janeth needs to pay is $2000 (initial amount) + $200 (additional amount) = $2200

Now, let's subtract the total amount she pays ($1980) from the total amount she needs to pay ($2200):
$2200 - $1980 = $220

Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months will be $220."
"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to determine the number of dahlias and add it to the number of roses.

We know there are 4 roses in the vase. We also know there are 7 more dahlias than roses. 

To find the number of dahlias, we add 7 to the number of roses: 
4 (roses) + 7 = 11 dahlias

Now, we add the number of roses and dahlias to find the total number of flowers in the vase:
4 (roses) + 11 (dahlias) = 15

"To find the average age of the three in three years, we first need to find their current ages and then add 3 to each age. 

Given that Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack, Zack's age is 2 * 21 = 42 years.

Since Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, Adrian's age is 3 * 21 = 63 years.

Now, we have the current ages of the three: Harriet (21), Zack (42), and Adrian (63). 

In three years, their ages will be: Harriet (21 + 3 = 24), Zack (42 + 3 = 45), and Adrian (63 + 3 = 66).

To find the average age, we add their ages and divide by 3: (24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first find out how many points Yuri and Brianna scored. 

Naomi scored 68 points. 
Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. 
Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. 
Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points. 

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. 
Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, we know that the total points scored by the four students is 251. 
We can subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total to find out how many points Jojo scored. 
Jojo scored 251 - 68 - 44 - 85 = 54 points.

"To find the total number of flowers Andy planted, we need to calculate the number of petunias first. Since he planted 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, we subtract 40 from the number of geraniums.

Number of geraniums: 90
Number of petunias = Number of geraniums - 40
Number of petunias = 90 - 40
Number of petunias = 50

Now, we add the number of geraniums and petunias to find the total number of flowers.

Total flowers = Number of geraniums + Number of petunias
Total flowers = 90 + 50
Total flowers = 140

The final answer is: 140"
"To find the total amount spent on advertising for the two years, we first need to calculate the amount spent in the second year. 

The company spends a third of $15000 in the second year. To find a third of $15000, we divide $15000 by 3.

$15000 / 3 = $5000

Now, we add the amount spent in the first year to the amount spent in the second year to find the total amount spent on advertising for the two years.

$15000 + $5000 = $20000

The total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is $20000."

"To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we first need to determine the total number of cards James has after the changes. Initially, he has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards. 

After losing 8 water type cards, he has 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards. 

After buying 14 grass type cards, he has 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards.

The total number of cards James has now is 30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96 cards.

The probability of picking a water type card is the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards, which is 32/96.

To find the percentage, we multiply by 100: (32/96) * 100 = 33.333...

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance of picking a water type card is 33."
"To find out how much Chad still owes, we need to calculate the total cost of his meal and then subtract the gift card amount.

The base burrito costs $6.50. 
He adds extra meat for $2.00, extra cheese for $1.00, avocado for $1.00, and 2 sauces for $0.25 each, which is 2 * $0.25 = $0.50. 
So, the total cost of the add-ons is $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $4.50.
The total cost of the meal before the upgrade is $6.50 + $4.50 = $11.00.
He upgrades his meal for an extra $3.00, so the new total is $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00.
He has a gift card for $5.00, so we subtract this from the total: $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00.

"To find the total number of pieces Kalinda and her mom can place per minute, we need to determine how many pieces her mom can place per minute. Since her mom can place half as many pieces as Kalinda, and Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute, her mom can place 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute.

The total number of pieces they can place per minute is 4 (Kalinda) + 2 (her mom) = 6 pieces per minute.

To find the total time it will take to complete the puzzle, we need to divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they can place per minute. 

360 pieces / 6 pieces per minute = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time from minutes to hours by dividing by 60.

60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Therefore, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

"To find the number of melons not ready to be harvested after two weeks, we need to calculate the number of melons harvested in the two instances and subtract that from the total number of melons.

Initially, there were 120 baby watermelons. 

After two months, 30% of them were ready for harvest. 
30% of 120 is 0.3 * 120 = 36 melons. 
So, 36 melons were harvested after two months.

The remaining melons after two months are 120 - 36 = 84.

After two weeks, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready for harvest. 
3/4 of 84 is (3/4) * 84 = 63 melons. 
So, 63 melons were harvested after two weeks.

The total number of melons harvested is 36 + 63 = 99.

The number of melons not ready to be harvested after two weeks is 120 - 99 = 21.

The final answer is: 21"

"To find the total number of insects in the garden, we first need to determine the number of bugs. Since Dax found half as many bugs as ants, and there were 50 ants, we can calculate the number of bugs as follows:

Number of bugs = Number of ants / 2
Number of bugs = 50 / 2
Number of bugs = 25

Now, to find the total number of insects in the garden, we add the number of ants and bugs:

Total number of insects = Number of ants + Number of bugs
Total number of insects = 50 + 25
Total number of insects = 75

"To find out how many vines Steve needs, we first need to determine how many tomatoes he eats per week. Since Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, we multiply this by 7 to get the total tomatoes he eats per week.

6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, we can assume his girlfriend eats half the amount he does. So, his girlfriend eats 6 / 2 = 3 tomatoes per day. 

3 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 21 tomatoes/week

The total number of tomatoes they both eat per week is 42 (Steve) + 21 (girlfriend) = 63 tomatoes/week.

Each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week. To find out how many vines they need, we divide the total number of tomatoes they eat per week by the number of tomatoes each vine produces per week.

63 tomatoes/week / 3 tomatoes/vine/week = 21 vines

So, Steve and his girlfriend need 21 vines to produce enough tomatoes for their weekly consumption.

There are 20 friends, and each friend needs 4 slices. So, the total number of slices required is 20 friends * 4 slices per friend = 80 slices.

Since pizzas are sold in 8 slices each, we need to divide the total number of slices required by the number of slices per pizza to find out how many pizzas John needs to order. 

80 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 10 pizzas.

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas. 

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Initially, Ram buys 25 pens. 

He uses these 25 pens to make new pens. For each new pen, he uses the ink from 5 empty pens. So, the number of new pens he can make is 25 / 5 = 5.

Now, he has 5 new pens and the 25 original pens. So, the total number of pens he has is 5 + 25 = 30.

However, the 5 new pens he made are also made from the ink of 5 original pens. So, we need to subtract these 5 pens from the total count because they are not new pens but rather the original pens that were used to make the new ones. 

So, the total number of new pens he gets is 25 - 5 = 20.

Now, adding the 20 new pens to the 25 original pens, we get 20 + 25 = 45 pens.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find out how much money Johnny had after a year, we need to follow the steps he took.

First, Johnny started with his allowance of $20 and added an extra $10 to it. So, his total amount of money is $20 + $10 = $30.

Next, he invested this sum of money, which tripled in a year. This means that his $30 was multiplied by 3. 

So, the amount of money he had after a year is $30 * 3 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the sum of the ages of the three girls, we need to determine the ages of Mary and Joan first.

Since Jessa is 20 years old, and Joan is five years older than Jessa, we can calculate Joan's age by adding 5 to Jessa's age: 20 + 5 = 25.

Now, Mary is two years younger than Joan, so we can calculate Mary's age by subtracting 2 from Joan's age: 25 - 2 = 23.

Now that we have the ages of all three girls, we can find the sum of their ages by adding their individual ages: 20 (Jessa) + 25 (Joan) + 23 (Mary) = 68.

The final answer is: 68"
"To find the number of students who went out through exit C, we first need to find the number of students who went out through exit A and exit B.

Initially, there were 1000 students. 30% of 1000 students went out through exit A. 

30% of 1000 = 0.3 * 1000 = 300 students went out through exit A.

Now, the remaining students are 1000 - 300 = 700.

3/5 of the remaining 700 students went out through exit B.

3/5 of 700 = (3/5) * 700 = 420 students went out through exit B.

Now, the remaining students are 700 - 420 = 280.

The rest of the students went out through exit C. So, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280.

The final answer is: 280"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

We know that John has 54 candies. Since John has twice as many candies as Robert, we can find the number of candies Robert has by dividing John's candies by 2.

Robert's candies = John's candies / 2
Robert's candies = 54 / 2
Robert's candies = 27

We also know that James has 6 more candies than Robert. So, we can find the number of candies James has by adding 6 to Robert's candies.

James' candies = Robert's candies + 6
James' candies = 27 + 6
James' candies = 33

Now, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James. To do this, we subtract James' candies from John's candies.

Difference = John's candies - James' candies
Difference = 54 - 33
Difference = 21

The final answer is: 21"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Dolly has 2 books and Pandora has 1 book. 

Dolly will read her own 2 books and Pandora's 1 book, so Dolly will read a total of 3 books.

Pandora will read her own 1 book and Dolly's 2 books, so Pandora will read a total of 3 books.

In total, they will read 3 (Dolly's total) + 3 (Pandora's total) = 6 books.

However, we need to consider that they also read each other's books. So, Dolly will read Pandora's book and Pandora will read Dolly's book. This means they will read 2 more books.

Therefore, the total number of books they will read is 6 (initial count) + 2 (additional books) = 8 books.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how many hours Mike spends writing a week, we first need to calculate the total number of letters he writes and responds to.

Initially, Mike had 5 pen pals. He stopped being pen pals with 2 of them, so he has 5 - 2 = 3 pen pals left.

Each of his pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and he responds to each letter. So, the total number of letters he receives and responds to is 3 * 2 * 2 = 12 letters.

Since he responds in kind, he also sends 12 letters.

Each letter is 5 pages long, so the total number of pages he writes is 12 * 5 = 60 pages.

Since he can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time he spends writing a week is 60 * 6 = 360 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 360 / 60 = 6 hours.

Therefore, Mike spends 6 hours writing a week. 

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how many minutes Jason has left, we first need to calculate the total minutes he used for his daily calls with his boss. 

Since Jason has a 15-minute call with his boss every day and this month has 30 days, the total minutes used for these calls would be 15 * 30 = 450 minutes.

Additionally, Jason has 300 extra minutes of calls to other people. 

So, the total minutes used would be 450 (calls with boss) + 300 (extra calls) = 750 minutes.

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from the total minutes available in the plan: 1000 (total minutes) - 750 (used minutes) = 250 minutes.

Therefore, Jason has 250 minutes left in his phone plan this month.

The final answer is: 250"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Griffin had 24 french fries.

Kyle took 5 fries from Griffin. So, Griffin was left with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.

Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, which is 2 * 5 = 10 fries. So, Griffin was left with 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

Ginger gave Griffin some fries, and then Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had taken, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. 

After Colby took 2 fries, Griffin was left with 9 - 2 = 7 fries. But we know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. So, Ginger must have given Griffin 27 - 7 = 20 fries.

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28.

According to the problem, this difference is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums, so we can set up the equation:

28 = 2(2x)

Now, let's solve for x:

28 = 4x

Divide both sides by 4:

7 = x

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the total hours worked. The makeup artist works 6 hours a day, 4 times a week, for 5 weeks. 

Total hours worked per week = 6 hours/day * 4 days/week = 24 hours/week
Total hours worked in 5 weeks = 24 hours/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours

The makeup artist charges $250 per hour. So, the total cost without the discount is:
Total cost = 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000

After the movie is done, the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount. To find the discount amount:
Discount = 10% of $30,000 = 0.1 * $30,000 = $3,000

The final cost after the discount is:
Final cost = Total cost - Discount = $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000

The final answer is: $27,000"
"To find out how much each person paid, we first need to calculate the total cost of the party supplies. 

Total cost = cost of ingredients + cost of presents + cost of decorations + cost of invitations + cost of goodie bags
Total cost = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22
Total cost = $96

Since Isabelle split the cost evenly with her two parents, there are a total of 3 people sharing the cost. 

Cost per person = Total cost / Number of people
Cost per person = $96 / 3
Cost per person = $32

The final answer is: $32"
"To find out how much the chef spent, we need to calculate the total weight of the onions and then multiply it by the cost per pound.

The chef bought 4 bags of onions, and each bag weighs 50 pounds. So, the total weight of the onions is:
4 bags * 50 pounds/bag = 200 pounds

Since a pound of onions costs $1.50, the total cost is:
200 pounds * $1.50/pound = $300

The chef spent $300."
"Let's break down the information given. 

On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Since her sister ate 5 cookies, Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday.

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Since her sister ate 13 cookies, Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.

Total cookies eaten by Sue = 20 (Monday) + 26 (Tuesday) = 46 cookies
Total cookies eaten by her sister = 5 (Monday) + 13 (Tuesday) = 18 cookies

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, the total calories consumed by Sue = 46 * 200 = 9200 calories
The total calories consumed by her sister = 18 * 200 = 3600 calories

The difference in calories consumed by Sue and her sister = 9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories

The final answer is: 5600"
"To find the number of boys in the third class, we first need to determine the total number of girls in the school. 

Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, and there are 3 classes with 20 students each, the total number of students in the school is 3 * 20 = 60.

The total number of girls in the school is 50% of 60, which is 0.5 * 60 = 30.

We already know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27.

Now, to find the number of girls in the third class, we subtract the total number of girls in the first two classes from the total number of girls in the school: 30 - 27 = 3.

Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, the total number of boys in the school is also 30. 

The total number of boys in the first two classes is 60 - 27 = 33 (since there are 60 students in total and 27 are girls). 

To find the number of boys in the third class, we subtract the total number of boys in the first two classes from the total number of boys in the school: 30 - 33 is incorrect, we need to find the number of boys in the first two classes first. 

The first class has 20 students and 15 girls, so the number of boys in the first class is 20 - 15 = 5. 

The second class has 20 students and 12 girls, so the number of boys in the second class is 20 - 12 = 8.

The total number of boys in the first two classes is 5 + 8 = 13.

Now, to find the number of boys in the third class, we subtract the total number of boys in the first two classes from the total number of boys in the school: 30 - 13 = 17.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars. 

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's represent the number of cougars killed today as 'x'. Then, the number of wolves killed today is 3x.

We also know that Rick killed three fewer cougars today than the previous night. So, the number of cougars killed today is 15 - 3 = 12.

Since we know the number of cougars killed today is 12, we can set up the equation 3x = 12 to find the number of wolves killed today. Solving for x, we get x = 4. 

However, we already know that the number of cougars killed today is 12, so we don't need to use x. 

Now, we can find the total number of animals killed by adding the number of wolves and cougars killed last night and today. 

Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars. Today, he killed 12 cougars and 3x wolves, which is 3 * 4 = 12 wolves.

So, the total number of animals killed is (10 + 15) + (12 + 12) = 25 + 24 = 49.

"To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we first need to determine how many times Anne went down the slide. 

Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we need to calculate 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30. 

30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. 

So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Now, we know that Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. 

To find out how many times Robert went down the slide, we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4. 

21 * 4 = 84.

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we first need to determine how many cows Mr. Sylas added to each stall. 

Initially, each stall had 20 cows. Mr. Sylas bought 40 cows and divided them equally among the 10 stalls. 

To find out how many cows he added to each stall, we divide the total number of cows bought (40) by the number of stalls (10). 

40 / 10 = 4

So, Mr. Sylas added 4 cows to each stall. 

Now, we need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. We know that each stall originally had 20 cows and 4 more were added. 

20 (original cows) + 4 (new cows) = 24 cows per stall

Since we want to know the total number of cows in 8 stalls, we multiply the number of cows per stall by 8.

24 * 8 = 192

The final answer is: 192"
"To find the total amount of money in Brady's piggy bank, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and bill, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the value of the pennies:
100 pennies = 100 x $0.01 = $1.00

Next, let's calculate the value of the nickels:
40 nickels = 40 x $0.05 = $2.00

Now, let's calculate the value of the dimes:
20 dimes = 20 x $0.10 = $2.00

Finally, let's calculate the value of the dollar bills:
40 dollar bills = 40 x $1.00 = $40.00

Now, let's add up the values of all the coins and bills:
$1.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $40.00 = $45.00

"To find the total weight of the redwood tree, we first need to calculate the total number of 10-foot sections. 

The redwood is 200 feet tall, so we divide 200 by 10 to get the total number of sections: 200 / 10 = 20 sections.

Each section weighs 400 pounds, so we multiply the number of sections by the weight per section: 20 * 400 = 8000 pounds.

Now, we need to find 30% of the total weight that the termites ate. To do this, we multiply the total weight by 0.3 (which is the decimal equivalent of 30%): 8000 * 0.3 = 2400 pounds.

To find the remaining weight of the redwood, we subtract the weight eaten by the termites from the total weight: 8000 - 2400 = 5600 pounds.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, and Andrea has 52 apples. So, Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.
2. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.
3. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.
4. To find the total number of fruits, we need to add the number of apples and bananas that both Andrea and Jamal have. 
   Total fruits = (Andrea's apples + Jamal's apples + Andrea's bananas + Jamal's bananas)

"To determine the total amount of flour needed, we need to calculate the amount needed for each day and then add them together.

For today, Carla is making 36 cookies. Since 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many cups are needed for 36 cookies. 

First, let's find out how many dozens are in 36 cookies: 36 / 12 = 3. So, Carla needs 3 dozen cookies. 

Since 2 cups of flour are needed for 1 dozen cookies, Carla will need 3 * 2 = 6 cups of flour for today.

For tomorrow, Carla is making 30 cookies. Again, we need to find out how many dozens are in 30 cookies: 30 / 12 = 2.5. Since we can't have half a dozen, we need to calculate the flour needed for 2 dozen and half a dozen separately.

For 2 dozen cookies, Carla will need 2 * 2 = 4 cups of flour. For half a dozen cookies, Carla will need 1 cup of flour (since 1 cup is needed for 6 cookies and half a dozen is 6 cookies). 

So, for tomorrow, Carla will need 4 + 1 = 5 cups of flour.

Now, let's add the flour needed for both days: 6 cups (for today) + 5 cups (for tomorrow) = 11 cups.

"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two-thirds of the pennies in the cup, we first need to calculate two-thirds of 9,300 pennies.

Two-thirds of 9,300 can be calculated as (2/3) * 9,300. 

To find the product, we multiply 2 by 9,300 and then divide by 3.

First, multiply 2 by 9,300: 2 * 9,300 = 18,600

Then, divide 18,600 by 3: 18,600 / 3 = 6,200

Since each penny is worth $0.01, we multiply 6,200 by 0.01 to find the total dollar amount.

6,200 * 0.01 = 62

The total dollar amount in a stack that contains two-thirds of the pennies in the cup is $62."

"To find the total price of the house, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and the transfer fee, and then add them to the selling price.

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, which is 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500.

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price, which is 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000.

The total price of the house is the sum of the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee: $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

To find out how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we subtract her budget from the total price: $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500.

"To find the total time, we first need to determine the time it takes to heat the oil to 400 degrees. 

It takes 20 minutes to heat the oil to 300 degrees. Since it takes 40% longer to heat it up to 400 degrees, we need to find 40% of 20 minutes and add it to 20 minutes.

40% of 20 minutes is 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes. 

So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat the oil to 400 degrees.

After warming the oil, it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil. Therefore, the cooking time is 28 - 5 = 23 minutes.

The total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is the sum of the time it takes to warm up the oil and the time it takes to cook. 

Total time = 28 minutes (to warm up the oil) + 23 minutes (to cook) = 51 minutes.

Now, let's add up the number of M&Ms in each bag: 300 + 312 + 150 = 762.

The total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762."
"To find the total number of windows, we need to calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows in each house.

Each house has 3 bedrooms with 2 windows each, so the total number of windows in the bedrooms of one house is 3 * 2 = 6. Since there are 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms is 6 * 2 = 12.

Each house has 4 additional windows not connected to bedrooms. Since there are 2 houses, the total number of additional windows is 4 * 2 = 8.

The total number of windows in one house is 12 (from bedrooms) + 8 (additional) = 20. Since there are 2 houses, the total number of windows is 20 * 2 = 40.

"To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we first need to determine the total number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette. 

The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches, which is 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so it takes 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

The total number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette is 90 + 180 = 270 stitches.

Since the whole sweater is a 1800-stitch project, the total number of stitches used for the body and the sleeves is 1800 - 270 = 1530 stitches.

The body takes 900 stitches, so the sleeves take 1530 - 900 = 630 stitches in total.

Since there are two sleeves, each sleeve takes 630 / 2 = 315 stitches.

The cost of the celery seeds is 80 packets * $30 per packet = $2400.

The total cost of the seeds is $800 + $2400 = $3200.

The final numerical answer is: $3200"
"To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the lines for each scene and the song, and then add them up.

The solo song has 54 lines.

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. However, only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has (4/5) * 60 = 48 lines from the second scene.

To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add up the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

The final answer is: 138"
"To find the number of cards with the letter D, we need to first find the number of cards with the letters A, B, and C, and then subtract that from the total number of cards.

First, we find the number of cards with the letter A: 2/5 of 80 is (2/5) * 80 = 32 cards.

Next, we find the number of cards with the letter B. The remaining cards after A are 80 - 32 = 48. 1/2 of 48 is (1/2) * 48 = 24 cards.

Now, we find the number of cards with the letter C. The remaining cards after B are 48 - 24 = 24. 5/8 of 24 is (5/8) * 24 = 15 cards.

Now, we add the number of cards with the letters A, B, and C: 32 + 24 + 15 = 71 cards.

Finally, we subtract the number of cards with the letters A, B, and C from the total number of cards to find the number of cards with the letter D: 80 - 71 = 9.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the total time it takes Matthew to dig the holes, we need to calculate the time for small holes and large holes separately and then add them together.

Time taken to dig 30 small holes = 30 * 3 minutes = 90 minutes
Time taken to dig 15 large holes = 15 * 10 minutes = 150 minutes

Total time taken = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours by dividing by 60.

Total time in hours = 240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we first need to determine their current ages. Since the sum of their ages is 20, we can represent their ages as x and 20 - x.

In 10 years, Mico's age will be x + 10 and Marco's age will be (20 - x) + 10, which simplifies to 30 - x.

The sum of their ages in 10 years will be (x + 10) + (30 - x), which simplifies to 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's assume Sam's current age is 'x'. Since Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, Ruby's current age is 6x.

In 9 years, Sam's age will be x + 9, and Ruby's age will be 6x + 9.

According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. So, we can set up the equation:

6x + 9 = 3(x + 9)

Now, let's simplify the equation:

6x + 9 = 3x + 27

Subtract 3x from both sides:

3x + 9 = 27

Subtract 9 from both sides:

3x = 18

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 6

So, Sam is 6 years old now.

The final answer is: 6"

"To find the total number of spots on the cobras, we need to multiply the number of cobras by the number of spots on each cobra. 

Number of cobras: 40
Number of spots per cobra: 70
Total spots on cobras: 40 * 70 = 2800

Since the cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, the number of spots on a mamba is half the number of spots on a cobra.

Number of spots per mamba: 70 / 2 = 35
Total number of mambas: 60
Total spots on mambas: 60 * 35 = 2100

Total spots on both cobras and mambas: 2800 + 2100 = 4900

Half the number of spots they all have combined: 4900 / 2 = 2450

The final answer is: 2450"
"To find out how many pizzas Maddy needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of people she needs to serve. 

There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, so the total number of people from the team and coaches is 12 + 3 = 15. 

Each team member brings 2 guests, so the total number of guests is 12 * 2 = 24. 

The total number of people Maddy needs to serve is 15 (team and coaches) + 24 (guests) = 39.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, the total number of pizzas needed is 39 / 3 = 13.

Each pizza costs $15, so the total amount Maddy will spend is 13 * 15 = $195.

The final answer is: $195"
"To find the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace, we first need to calculate the total space occupied by the topaz gemstones and then subtract that from the total length of the necklace. 

Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and there are 8 of them, so the total space occupied by the gemstones is 8 inches. 

The remaining space for the sterling silver beads is 25 inches (total length of the necklace) - 8 inches (space occupied by gemstones) = 17 inches.

Each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long, so the number of beads that can fit in 17 inches is 17 / (1/4) = 17 / 0.25 = 68.

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

The final answer is: 68"

Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week.
Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week.
Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week.

Total stories in the first week = 20 + 40 + 60 = 120

In the second week, each of them doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week. 

Alani doubled her 20 stories to 20 * 2 = 40 stories.
Braylen doubled his 40 stories to 40 * 2 = 80 stories.
Margot doubled her 60 stories to 60 * 2 = 120 stories.

Total stories in the second week = 40 + 80 + 120 = 240

To find the total number of stories written altogether, we need to add the total number of stories written in the first week and the second week.

Total stories = 120 + 240 = 360

"To find out how many cents Kelly has left, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has and subtract the cost of the can of pop.

Kelly has 5 quarters, which is equivalent to 5 x 25 cents = 125 cents. She also has 2 dimes, which is equivalent to 2 x 10 cents = 20 cents. 

So, the total amount of money Kelly has is 125 cents + 20 cents = 145 cents.

Now, let's subtract the cost of the can of pop, which is 55 cents. 

145 cents - 55 cents = 90 cents.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the number of rows of 5-star, we first need to find the total number of stars in the flag. 

The flag has three rows of 8 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 3 * 8 = 24. 

It also has two rows of 6 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 2 * 6 = 12. 

The total number of stars in the flag is 76. 

Now, we can find the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows, which is 24 + 12 = 36. 

The remaining stars are 76 - 36 = 40. 

Since each row of 5-star has 5 stars, the number of rows of 5-star is 40 / 5 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the number of trucks needed, we first need to calculate the total weight of the flagstones. 

Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, and there are 80 flagstones. 

Total weight = Number of flagstones * Weight of each flagstone
Total weight = 80 * 75
Total weight = 6000 pounds

Since each truck can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds, we need to divide the total weight by the weight capacity of each truck to find out how many trucks are needed.

Number of trucks = Total weight / Weight capacity of each truck
Number of trucks = 6000 / 2000
Number of trucks = 3

"To find the time taken by the car in the slow lane, we first need to determine its speed. Since it's traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, its speed is 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed. Given that the distance is 480 miles and the speed of the car in the slow lane is 30 miles/hour, we can calculate the time taken as follows:

Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours

The final answer is: 16"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem.

Ali has 22 medals. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.

Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

It's given that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have. Let's represent the total number of medals given out as 'x'. Then, we can write the equation as:

x = 10 * 39

To find the total number of medals given out, we multiply 10 by 39.

x = 10 * 39
x = 390

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is 390.

The final answer is: 390"
"To find out how many chocolate bars each child will get, we first need to determine the total number of chocolate bars available. Since there are 8 packets of chocolate bars, and each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

Since each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 * 6 = 24. This leaves 40 - 24 = 16 chocolate bars for the children.

There are 8 children, and they will share the remaining 16 chocolate bars equally. To find out how many chocolate bars each child will get, we divide 16 by 8, which is 2.

So, each child will get 2 chocolate bars.

"To find out how much Susan earns, we need to calculate the total time she works and then multiply it by her hourly wage.

First, let's find the total time she works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total time.

Total time worked = 3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to convert the total time to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Now, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes:

150 minutes / 10 minutes/interval = 15 intervals

Since she earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by her earnings per interval:

15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

So, Susan earns $75 for the online task. 

The final answer is: $75"
"Let's break down the information given. 

Initially, Mike has 21 points. 
Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

After the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. 
Mike has 21 points, which is not over 20, so he gets no extra point.
Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so he gets no extra point.
Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point.

So, after the extra points are distributed, the points are:
Mike: 21
Jim: 18
Tony: 43

Now, let's calculate the total points of all three players:
Total points = Mike's points + Jim's points + Tony's points
Total points = 21 + 18 + 43
Total points = 82

"To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we first need to determine how many oranges the sons washed. 

The oldest son is 8 years old, and he washes as many oranges as his age, so he washes 8 oranges. 

The youngest son is half as old as the oldest son, so he is 8 / 2 = 4 years old. He washes as many oranges as his age, so he washes 4 oranges.

In total, the sons wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

Will buys 15 oranges, and the sons wash 12, so the number of oranges left unwashed is 15 - 12 = 3.

"To find the total count of activities, we need to calculate the number of exercises done on each day and then add them together.

On the first day, Darren did:
- 100 pushups
- 50 squats
- 20 dumbbell presses

Total exercises on the first day = 100 + 50 + 20 = 170

On the second day, Darren did:
- 20 more pushups than the first day, so 100 + 20 = 120 pushups
- 10 fewer squats than the first day, so 50 - 10 = 40 squats
- Doubled the number of dumbbell presses, so 20 * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses

Total exercises on the second day = 120 + 40 + 40 = 200

Total exercises in two days = 170 + 200 = 370

The final answer is: 370"
"To find out how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we first need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day. 

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 3 meals in a day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner). So, the total rice consumption per person per day is 0.2 kg * 3 = 0.6 kg.

Since there are 5 members in the household who eat rice every lunch and dinner, the total rice consumption per day for the household is 0.6 kg * 5 = 3 kg.

Now, we need to find out how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last. To do this, we divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the daily consumption (3 kg).

42 kg / 3 kg/day = 14 days

Since we want to know how many weeks the rice will last, we need to convert the number of days to weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the number of days by 7.

14 days / 7 days/week = 2 weeks

Therefore, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 2 weeks. 

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we first need to calculate the total number of crates he sold in the week. 

Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he sold bread for 5 days. 

He sold 20 crates over the weekend, which is 2 days. 
He sold 15 crates on Tuesday, 12 crates on Wednesday, and 18 crates on Thursday.

Total crates sold = 20 (weekend) + 15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday) = 65 crates

Since he was closed on Monday and Friday, he had 5 working days. His target for the week is 120 crates. 

To find out how many crates he should have sold in 5 days, we can divide the target by 7 and multiply by 5. 

Target for 5 days = (120 / 7) * 5 = 85.71 (approximately)

However, since we can't sell a fraction of a crate, we'll consider the target for 5 days as 85 crates.

Now, let's find out how many crates he was off from his target. 

Crates off from target = Target for 5 days - Total crates sold
= 85 - 65
= 20

So, Sam was 20 crates off from his target for the week.

"To find the total cost of the desk, we need to determine the last bid made by Carmen. 

The initial bid is $200. The bids rise by $50 each time. Since there are 3 other people who bid once, there are a total of 4 people who bid before Carmen makes her final bid. 

The sequence of bids would be: $200, $250, $300, $350, $400, $450, $500. 

Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, so she makes 4 bids. The last bid is made by Carmen, which is $500. 

The total cost of the desk is $500. 

The final answer is: $500"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to find the total miles driven, the total cost of driving, and the total bonus paid.

First, let's find the total miles driven. Since John goes to work and back each day, the total miles driven per day is 2 * 30 = 60 miles. He goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year, so the total miles driven per year is 60 * 5 * 50 = 15,000 miles.

The cost of driving is $2 per mile, so the total cost of driving per year is 15,000 * $2 = $30,000.

John also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus paid per year is $150 * 12 = $1,800.

The total cost per year is the sum of the cost of driving and the bonus paid, which is $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

The final numerical answer is: $31,800"
"To find out how many minutes Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to add the minutes he exercised on both days. 

Monday: 16 minutes
Sunday: 23 minutes
Combined: 16 + 23 = 39 minutes

Since Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to multiply the combined minutes by 2.

Combined minutes: 39
Twice the combined minutes: 39 * 2 = 78 minutes

Therefore, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal.

The final answer is: 78"
"To determine the number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider the folding process. 

When a piece of paper is folded vertically, it creates two layers: the front and the back. 

For a 32-page tabloid, we need to have 32 pages in total. Since each piece of paper can have 2 pages (front and back), we can calculate the number of pieces of paper needed by dividing the total number of pages by 2.

32 pages / 2 pages per paper = 16 pieces of paper

However, this is not the final answer because we need to consider the fact that the first and last pages are on the outside, and they are printed on both sides. This means that the first and last pages are already accounted for in the 32 pages, but they are printed on a single piece of paper.

So, we need to subtract 1 from the total number of pieces of paper to account for the first and last pages.

16 pieces of paper - 1 piece of paper = 15 pieces of paper

Therefore, the number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid is 15."
"To find out how much money Annika has left, we first need to calculate how much she spent on food and snacks. Since she spent half of her $50 on food and snacks, we can calculate this as:

$50 / 2 = $25

She also spent an additional $10 on rides. So, the total amount she spent is:

$25 (food and snacks) + $10 (rides) = $35

Now, to find out how much she has left, we subtract the total amount she spent from the initial amount she had:

$50 (initial amount) - $35 (total spent) = $15

So, Annika has $15 left.

"To find out how much Watson made in April, we need to calculate his total earnings from his hourly wage and the weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate his total hours worked in a week: 
10 hours/day * 5 days/week = 50 hours/week

Since Watson earns $10 per hour, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:
50 hours/week * $10/hour = $500/week

In a month like April, there are 4 weeks. So, his total earnings from his hourly wage in April are:
$500/week * 4 weeks = $2000

Now, let's add the weekly bonus to his total earnings:
$2000 + $300 * 4 = $2000 + $1200 = $3200

So, Watson made $3200 in April if the company performed very well for the whole month.

"To find out how many loaves are sold in the afternoon, we first need to determine how many loaves are left after the morning sales. 

The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. 

Two-thirds of 60 is calculated as (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves. 

So, 40 loaves are sold in the morning. 

Now, we need to find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales. 

The total number of loaves produced is 60, and 40 are sold in the morning. 

So, the number of loaves left is 60 - 40 = 20.

Half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening. 

Half of 20 is calculated as (1/2) * 20 = 10.

Since the remaining loaves are equally divided between the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is 10.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much weight Joey loses in a week and then multiply it by the number of weeks Sandy needs to lose the same amount of weight.

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. To find out how much weight Joey loses in a week, we divide the total weight lost by the number of weeks:

Weight lost per week by Joey = 8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, we multiply the weight lost per week by Joey by the number of weeks Sandy needs:

Weight lost by Sandy in 4 weeks = 2 pounds/week * 4 weeks = 8 pounds

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, the answer is 4 weeks.

"To find the total savings, we need to calculate the savings on the tubs of ice cream and the packets of milk separately and then add them together.

The original price of one tub of ice cream is $13, and it's now sold at $11. The discount on one tub of ice cream is $13 - $11 = $2.

Since you're buying 2 tubs of ice cream, the total discount on the ice cream will be 2 * $2 = $4.

The original price of one packet of milk is not given, but it's sold at a discount of $0.5. Let's assume the original price of one packet of milk is x. The selling price of one packet of milk will be x - $0.5.

You're buying 4 packets of milk, so the total discount on the milk will be 4 * ($x - $0.5).

However, we don't know the original price of the milk packet. To find the total savings, we need to know the original price of the milk packet. 

But, if we assume the original price of the milk packet is $1, then the selling price of one packet of milk will be $1 - $0.5 = $0.5. 

The total discount on the milk will be 4 * $0.5 = $2.

Now, let's calculate the total savings: $4 (savings on ice cream) + $2 (savings on milk) = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and legs grown by the person after 15 days.

The person grows an extra arm every 3 days. To find out how many extra arms are grown in 15 days, we divide 15 by 3. 

15 / 3 = 5

So, the person will grow 5 extra arms.

The person grows an extra leg every 5 days. To find out how many extra legs are grown in 15 days, we divide 15 by 5.

15 / 5 = 3

So, the person will grow 3 extra legs.

In total, the person will grow 5 extra arms and 3 extra legs. 

5 (extra arms) + 3 (extra legs) = 8

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount spent by Theo on the business suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket, and then subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount he had, and then subtract the amount he wishes to save.

First, let's calculate the total amount spent on business suits:
6 suits * $100 each = $600

Next, let's calculate the total amount spent on suitcases:
3 suitcases * $50 each = $150

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket. The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. 
Cost of a business suit = $100
5 times the cost of a business suit = 5 * $100 = $500
Cost of the flight ticket = $500 + $700 = $1200

Now, let's calculate the total amount spent on business suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket:
$600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight ticket) = $1950

Now, let's subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount he had:
$6000 (initial amount) - $1950 (total spent) = $4050

"To find Trent's age, we need to first find Jane's age. Since Quinn is 30 and Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, Jane's age is 30 - 3 = 27.

Now that we know Jane's age, we can find Trent's age. Trent is 5 years older than Jane, so Trent's age is 27 + 5 = 32.

The final answer is: 32"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Noah's current age as N and the population of Chile now as P. 

Since Cera is 46 years old now, six years ago, Cera's age was 46 - 6 = 40 years.

We are given that six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. So, six years ago, Noah's age was 40 / 2 = 20 years.

We are also given that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. So, the population of Chile six years ago was 20 * 3000 = 60000.

It is given that the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now. Therefore, the population of Chile now is 2 * 60000 = 120000.

The final answer is: 120000"
"Let's break down the information given. 

Let's denote the number of players on the defense as D. 

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2D.

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is D/2.

We know that the total number of players on the team is 105. Therefore, the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams is equal to 105.

We can write the equation as: 2D + D + D/2 = 105

To simplify the equation, we multiply all terms by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 4D + 2D + D = 210

Combine like terms: 7D = 210

Now, divide both sides by 7 to solve for D: D = 210 / 7
D = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total number of people invited, we first need to calculate the number of people from the 2 families with 6 people and the 3 families with 4 people.

For the 2 families with 6 people, the total number of people is 2 * 6 = 12.
For the 3 families with 4 people, the total number of people is 3 * 4 = 12.
So, the total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.

However, 8 people couldn't come due to illness. This means 8 people are not attending the party.

Now, 1/4 of 8 people had previous commitments, which is (1/4) * 8 = 2 people. These 2 people are also not attending the party.

So, the total number of people not attending the party is 8 (due to illness) + 2 (previous commitments) = 10.

To find the number of people who show up for Martha's party, we subtract the number of people not attending from the total number of people invited: 24 - 10 = 14.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store, we need to calculate the total number of marbles first. 

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and added them to a store that had 50. So, the total number of marbles in the store after buying from Johanna is 20 + 50 = 70.

His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna, his father gave him 2/5 * 20 = 8 marbles.

Now, the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store is 70 (initial marbles) + 20 (bought from Johanna) + 8 (given by his father) = 98 marbles.

Since each marble weighs 2kgs, the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store is 98 * 2 = 196 kgs.

The final answer is: 196"
"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (such as the pool) is length x width x height.

Given dimensions: 
- Length (L) = 6 feet
- Width (W) = 4 feet
- Height (H) = 5 feet

Volume = L x W x H = 6 x 4 x 5 = 120 cubic feet

Now, we need to find the cost to fill the pool. The cost is given as $0.1 per cubic foot. 

Cost = Volume x Cost per cubic foot
Cost = 120 x 0.1
Cost = 12

The final answer is: $12"
"To find the total number of children in the classroom, we first need to determine the number of girls and nongendered children.

Given that there are 30 boys, and the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, we can calculate the number of girls by multiplying the number of boys by 3.

Number of girls = 3 * 30 = 90

Next, we are told that the classroom has 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys. To find the number of nongendered children, we can multiply the number of boys by 1/10.

Number of nongendered children = 30 * (1/10) = 3

Now, we can find the total number of children by adding the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children.

Total number of children = 30 (boys) + 90 (girls) + 3 (nongendered children) = 123

The final answer is: 123"
"To find the total number of electric poles required, we need to use the given ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This means for every 1 electric pole, 3 electric wires are needed.

Given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles:

1 (electric pole) : 3 (electric wires) = x (electric poles) : 45 (electric wires)

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

1 * 45 = 3x
45 = 3x

Now, divide both sides by 3 to find x:

x = 45 / 3
x = 15

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of people who left the party. We know that 1/4 of the total number of people left, and 22 men stayed. 

Let's denote the total number of people as 'x'. Since 1/4 of the people left, 3/4 of the people stayed. We can set up the equation:

3/4 * x = 22 + (number of women who stayed)

We know that the total number of people at the beginning was 25 men + 15 women = 40 people. So, x = 40.

Now, we can substitute x = 40 into the equation:

3/4 * 40 = 22 + (number of women who stayed)
30 = 22 + (number of women who stayed)
8 = (number of women who stayed)

Since there were 15 women at the beginning, the number of women who left is 15 - 8 = 7.

The total number of women who left is 7, but the question asks for the number of women who are left. We know that 8 women stayed, so the number of women left is 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the cost of the pen, we first need to find the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book, and the book costs $4, the magazine costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, we know that the pen costs $1 less than the magazine. So, the cost of the pen is $2 - $1 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Jam has 3 boxes of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils. We can set up an equation to represent this: 

3x + 2 = 26, where x is the number of pencils in each box.

To find the number of pencils in each box, we can subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: 

3x = 26 - 2
3x = 24

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3 to find the value of x: 

x = 24 / 3
x = 8

So, each box contains 8 pencils. 

Now, let's find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have. Jam has 3 boxes with 8 pencils each, which is 3 * 8 = 24 pencils. Meg has 46 pencils. The total number of pencils they have is 24 + 46 = 70.

To find the number of boxes needed to store all the pencils, we can divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils in each box: 

Number of boxes = Total number of pencils / Number of pencils in each box
= 70 / 8
= 8.75

Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

The final answer is: 9"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total weakening effect of the ice cubes and the added cream.

First, let's calculate the number of ice cubes needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, we can divide 65 by 13 to get the number of ice cubes:

65 / 13 = 5

Since each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, 5 ice cubes will make it 5 x 12 = 60 milliliters weaker.

Next, we need to add the weakening effect of the 15 milliliters of cream. The total weakening effect is the sum of the weakening effects of the ice cubes and the cream:

60 + 15 = 75 milliliters

So, Shannon's iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.

The final answer is: 75"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the trade ratio. For every 2 old records, 1 new record is given. Since 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of new records as 7. 

Now, we need to find out how many old records were traded for these 7 new records. Since the trade ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record, we can multiply the number of new records by 2 to find the total number of old records traded.

Total old records traded = 7 new records * 2 = 14

However, this is the total number of old records traded by all 5 people. To find the number of old records each person brought in, we need to divide the total number of old records by 5.

Old records per person = Total old records traded / Number of people = 14 / 5 = 2.8

Since we can't have a fraction of a record, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can also consider that the 5 people might have traded some records in a way that the total number of old records is a multiple of 5. 

Considering the trade ratio, if 5 people leave with 7 new records, it means they must have traded 14 old records in total. This is because 7 new records * 2 = 14 old records. 

So, the total number of old records brought in by the 5 people is 14."
"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we first need to find the number of junior and senior programmers, and their respective salaries.

Given that the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:
Number of junior programmers = (2/5) * Total number of employees
= (2/5) * 100
= 40

Since the number of senior programmers is the remaining 3/5 of the total number of employees, we can calculate the number of senior programmers as follows:
Number of senior programmers = (3/5) * Total number of employees
= (3/5) * 100
= 60

We are given that senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers. Let's assume the salary of a junior programmer is x. Then, the salary of a senior programmer is x + $400.

We are also given that junior programmers are each paid $2000 per month. So, we can set up the equation:
x = $2000

Now, we can find the salary of a senior programmer:
Salary of a senior programmer = x + $400
= $2000 + $400
= $2400

Now, we can find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month:
Total amount = (Number of junior programmers * Salary of a junior programmer) + (Number of senior programmers * Salary of a senior programmer)
= (40 * $2000) + (60 * $2400)
= $80000 + $144000
= $184000

The final answer is: $184000"
"Let's break down the information given. 

Initially, there were 'x' people on the bus at the terminal. 

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the total became x + 5.

At the second bus stop, 7 people got down, and 8 more got in. So, the total became (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6.

We are given that the total number of people at the third stop is 20. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x + 6 = 20.

To find the value of 'x', we need to isolate it. Subtract 6 from both sides of the equation: x = 20 - 6.

x = 14.

The final answer is: 14"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Oscar starts with 24 lollipops. He eats 2 on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left.

He passes 14 out to his friends, so he has 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops left.

He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now, he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.

He eats 3 more that night, so he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops left.

He eats 2 more in the morning, so he has 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops left.

"To find the time it takes to fully charge the phone, we first need to determine how long it takes to charge 100% from 60%. 

Since the phone recharges at 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, it will take 3 minutes to charge 1%. 

To find the time it takes to charge 40% (from 60% to 100%), we multiply the time it takes to charge 1% by 40: 
3 minutes * 40 = 120 minutes

Now, we need to convert 120 minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide 120 by 60:
120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone from 60% to 100%."
"To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we need to first calculate the total number of lollipops she has after her mother gives her 10 more. 

Erin initially has 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her 10 more, so Erin now has 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops.

Then, Erin gives 3 lollipops to Ella. To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we subtract 3 from 17. 

17 - 3 = 14

So, Erin has 14 lollipops left.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find out how much the customer paid, we first need to determine the rewards they earned from their last shopping trip. Since they spent $80 and get $1 off for every $20 spent, we divide $80 by $20 to find out how many rewards they earned. 

$80 / $20 = 4 rewards

These rewards are worth $4, as each reward is worth $1. 

Now, let's move on to the current shopping trip. They spent $43 and used their rewards, which is $4. They also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. Twice the amount of rewards is 2 * $4 = $8.

So, the total discount they got is the sum of the rewards and the coupon: $4 (rewards) + $8 (coupon) = $12.

Now, let's subtract the total discount from the amount they spent: $43 - $12 = $31.

The customer paid $31 on this shopping trip.

The final answer is: $31"
"To determine which job pays more, we need to calculate the net pay for each job.

For Job A, the total income is $15/hour * 2000 hours/year = $30,000/year. The state tax rate is 20%, so the tax amount is $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000. The net pay for Job A is $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

For Job B, the total income is $42,000/year. The property tax is $6,000, so the net income before taxes is $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000. The state tax rate is 10%, so the tax amount is $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600. The net pay for Job B is $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

To find the difference in net pay between the two jobs, we subtract the net pay of Job A from the net pay of Job B: $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

The difference in net pay between the two jobs is $8,400."
"To find the number of unmanned ruined castles, we first need to find the total number of ruined castles. 

40% of the castles are ruins, so we multiply 220 by 0.4 to find the number of ruined castles.

"To find the final value of Maria's shares, we need to calculate the price of the shares after the first year and then after the second year.

Initially, Maria buys 8 shares for $8 each, so the total cost is 8 * 8 = $64.

The stock price increases by 50% in the first year. To find the new price, we multiply the original price by 1.5 (100% + 50% increase).
New price after the first year = 8 * 1.5 = $12.

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. To find the new price, we multiply the price after the first year by 0.75 (100% - 25% decrease).
New price after the second year = 12 * 0.75 = $9.

Now, we multiply the new price after the second year by the number of shares to find the final value of Maria's shares.
Final value = 9 * 8 = $72.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume the number of students in the two equal groups is x. Since the last group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the last group is x - 10.

We know that the total number of students in the class is 200. Since the two equal groups have x students each, and the last group has x - 10 students, we can set up the equation:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 70

Since x represents the number of students in each of the two equal groups, the number of students in the last group is x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60.

"Let's break down the information given. Farmer Brown has a total of 60 animals, and he has twice as many chickens as cows. 

Let's assume the number of cows is 'x'. Then, the number of chickens will be 2x (since he has twice as many chickens as cows).

We know that the total number of animals is 60, so we can set up the equation: x + 2x = 60

Combine like terms: 3x = 60

Divide both sides by 3: x = 20

So, the number of cows is 20, and the number of chickens is 2x = 2(20) = 40.

"To find the total distance Tyson covered in June, we first need to calculate the new daily distance he needs to run based on his coach's advice. 

The coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters in a day. This means we need to find 1/5 of 5000 meters and add it to the original distance.

1/5 of 5000 meters is (1/5) * 5000 = 1000 meters.

So, the new daily distance is 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters.

Since there are 30 days in June, we can find the total distance covered in June by multiplying the new daily distance by 30.

Total distance = 6000 meters/day * 30 days = 180,000 meters.

"To find the percentage increase in the amount of money the factory is making per day, we need to first find the difference in the amount of money they are making per day now and the amount they used to make per day.

The factory used to make $100 per tractor and sold 10 tractors a day, so they made $100 * 10 = $1000 per day.

Now, they make $220 per silo and sell 5 silos a day, so they make $220 * 5 = $1100 per day.

The difference in the amount of money they are making per day now and the amount they used to make per day is $1100 - $1000 = $100.

To find the percentage increase, we divide the difference by the original amount and multiply by 100: ($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%.

"To find the total time spent on after-work activities, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and add them up.

- Monday's yoga class is 1 hour.
- Tuesday's cooking class is 3 times as long as Monday's yoga, so it's 1 * 3 = 3 hours.
- Wednesday's cheese-tasting event is 0.5 hours (half an hour).
- Thursday's museum tour is half as long as the cooking class, so it's 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours.
- Friday's errands are 2 hours.

Now, let's add up the time spent on each activity:
1 (Monday) + 3 (Tuesday) + 0.5 (Wednesday) + 1.5 (Thursday) + 2 (Friday) = 7.5 hours.

The final answer is: 7.5"
"To find out how many plant pots April has left over, we first need to determine the total number of plant pots she needs for the school garden. 

The school needs 30 plant pots for the daisies. Since they need twice as many for the roses, we multiply 30 by 2 to get the number of plant pots needed for the roses. 

30 * 2 = 60

So, the total number of plant pots needed for both daisies and roses is 30 + 60 = 90.

April had already bought 100 plant pots from the garden center. To find out how many plant pots she has left over, we subtract the total number of plant pots needed from the number she already bought.

100 - 90 = 10

Therefore, April has 10 plant pots left over. 

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how much Andrea saved, we need to first determine how much money she had left after buying the sweater and giving her brother $4. 

Andrea started with $36. She spent $11 on a sweater and gave her brother $4. So, the total amount she spent is $11 + $4 = $15.

Now, let's subtract the amount she spent from the initial amount: $36 - $15 = $21.

This means Andrea had $21 left after spending the money. However, the question asks for how much she saved, which implies the amount she had before spending the money. Therefore, the amount she saved is the initial amount, which is $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"To find the total time John spent, we need to calculate the time he spent boating, swimming, and watching shows. 

He spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours. 

He watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so the total time spent watching shows is 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

The total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows is 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours.

We are given that this is 70% of the total time (100% - 30% for sightseeing). Let's represent the total time as 'x'. 

We can set up the equation: 0.7x = 15

To find 'x', we divide both sides by 0.7: x = 15 / 0.7 = 21.43 hours

Now, we need to find the time spent sightseeing, which is 40% of the total time. 

Time spent sightseeing = 0.4 * 21.43 = 8.57 hours

The final answer is: 8.57"
"To find out how much money Annabelle still needs to save, we first need to calculate how much money she has earned from both jobs. 

From her first job, she earns $10 per hour and works for 20 hours, so she earns 10 * 20 = $200. 

From her second job, she earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours, so she earns 5 * 15 = $75.

In total, Annabelle earns $200 + $75 = $275 from both jobs.

Since she already has $80 in her savings, we add this to the money she earned: $275 + $80 = $355.

The phone costs $400, so to find out how much more money Annabelle needs to save, we subtract the amount she has from the cost of the phone: $400 - $355 = $45.

Therefore, Annabelle still needs to save $45.

The final answer is: $45"
"To find the height of the tallest tree, we first need to find the combined height of the two shorter trees. The shortest tree is 6 feet tall, and the second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, so the second tree is 6 + 5 = 11 feet tall. 

The combined height of the two shorter trees is 6 + 11 = 17 feet. 

The height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two shorter trees combined, so it is 2 * 17 = 34 feet.

The height of the tallest tree is 34 feet."
"To find out how much money Dean has left, we first need to calculate the total amount of money he spent at the toy store. 

The cost of 6 toy cars is 6 * $2 = $12. 
The cost of 5 teddy bears is 5 * $1 = $5. 
The total amount spent is $12 + $5 = $17.

Dean initially had $28. After spending $17, he had $28 - $17 = $11. 
His mother then gave him an extra $10, so he now has $11 + $10 = $21.

The final answer is: $21"
"To find out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to first calculate the total cost of the activities. 

The cost of mini-golf for Morgan and her friends is 1 round * $5 per round = $5. 
Since there are 'x' friends, the total cost for mini-golf for all of them will be $5 + $5x.

The cost of arcade tokens for all of them is $5.

The cost of go-karts for all of them is 2 rides * $10 per ride * (x + 1) because Morgan is also riding the go-karts. So, the total cost for go-karts is 20(x + 1).

The total cost for all activities is $5 + $5x + $5 + 20(x + 1). 

We can simplify this to $5 + $5x + $5 + $20x + $20, which is $25 + $25x.

We know that Morgan's dad has a budget of $90. So, we can set up the equation $25 + $25x = $90.

To solve for x, we subtract $25 from both sides of the equation, which gives us $25x = $65.

Now, we divide both sides by $25 to find x. x = $65 / $25.

x = 2.6

Since we can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much money Marisa saves in her piggy bank, we first need to calculate how much she spends on lollipops each day. 

Marisa buys 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each, so the total amount she spends on lollipops is 4 * 25 cents = 100 cents or $1.

Since Marisa gets $5 as pocket money every day, the change she saves is $5 - $1 = $4.

If she saves for 5 days, the total amount she puts in her piggy bank is 5 * $4 = $20.

The final answer is: $20"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how much change Billy got after buying the candy. Since he spent $1.5 per pound and he had $10, we can divide $10 by $1.5 to find out how many pounds of candy he bought.

$10 / $1.5 = 6.67 pounds (round down to 6.67, but since you can't buy a fraction of a pound, we'll consider it as 6.67 pounds, but for the sake of calculation, we will use 6.67)

Now, let's find out how much change he got. Since he bought 6.67 pounds of candy, the cost would be 6.67 * $1.5 = $10. 

Since he got back the $10 he spent, he has no change from the candy purchase. 

Now, let's find out how much money he spent on gumballs. He bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, so the total cost of gumballs is 40 * $0.05 = $2.

Since he took half of his change (which is $0 in this case) and spent it on gumballs, he spent $2 on gumballs.

Now, let's find out how much money he had left after buying gumballs. He had $10 initially and spent $2 on gumballs, so he has $10 - $2 = $8 left.

Now, let's find out how much change he got after buying gumballs. Since he spent $2 on gumballs, he got back $2 in change.

Now, let's find out how much money he had before buying gumballs. He had $8 and got $2 in change, so he had $8 + $2 = $10.

Now, let's find out how much money he spent on candy. He had $10 initially and spent $10 on candy, so he spent $10 on candy.

Now, let's find out how many pounds of candy he bought. We already know that he spent $10 on candy, and the cost of candy is $1.5 per pound. 

$10 / $1.5 = 6.67 pounds

The final answer is: 6.67"
"Let's break down the information given. Carver's age is 45, and it's 5 years less than twice the age of his son. 

Let's represent the son's age as 'x'. According to the information, 2x - 5 = 45. 

To find the son's age, we need to solve for 'x'. 

First, add 5 to both sides of the equation: 2x = 45 + 5
This simplifies to 2x = 50.

Next, divide both sides by 2: x = 50 / 2
x = 25

The son is 25 years old.

"To find the total distance the train travels in one trip, we need to add the distances between the three cities. The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles, and the distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles. 

The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs, which is 75 + 100 = 175 miles. So, the distance from the third city to the first city is 175 - 50 = 125 miles.

The total distance for one trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles.

To find out how many days the train goes between services, we need to divide the total distance the train can travel before needing service (18,000 miles) by the total distance it travels in a day (900 miles).

18,000 / 900 = 20 days.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the amount of stuffing needed for the collie beds, we first need to find the average amount of stuffing between the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds. 

The average amount of stuffing for a collie bed is (8 + 2) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5 pounds.

Now, we need to find the total amount of stuffing needed for the chihuahua beds and the collie beds. 

For the chihuahua beds: 4 beds * 2 pounds per bed = 8 pounds.
For the collie beds: 3 beds * 5 pounds per bed = 15 pounds.

The total amount of stuffing needed is 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total time taken for the trip, we need to calculate the time taken for each part of the trip and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time taken for the trip to his friend's house. The distance is 200 miles and the speed is 70 mph. 

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 200 miles / 70 mph
Time = 2.857 hours (approximately)

However, he took a detour that added 10 miles to his trip. So, the actual distance traveled to his friend's house is 200 + 10 = 210 miles. 

Time taken for the detour part = 10 miles / 70 mph
Time taken for the detour part = 0.143 hours (approximately)

Total time taken to reach his friend's house = 2.857 hours + 0.143 hours
Total time taken to reach his friend's house = 3 hours

Now, let's calculate the time taken for the trip back home. The distance is 240 miles and the speed is 80 mph.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 240 miles / 80 mph
Time = 3 hours

Total time taken for the trip = Time taken to reach his friend's house + Time taken for the trip back home
Total time taken for the trip = 3 hours + 3 hours
Total time taken for the trip = 6 hours

"To find the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we first need to find the total number of fourth-grade students present on Friday. 

Total fourth-graders = 96
Absent girls = 5
Absent boys = 4
Total absent students = 5 + 4 = 9

Total students present = Total fourth-graders - Total absent students
Total students present = 96 - 9
Total students present = 87

Now, we know that 43 out of the total 96 fourth-graders are girls. So, the number of fourth-grade boys = Total fourth-graders - Number of girls
Number of boys = 96 - 43
Number of boys = 53

However, we need to find the number of boys who were present on Friday. Since 4 boys were absent, the number of boys present = Total number of boys - Number of absent boys
Number of boys present = 53 - 4
Number of boys present = 49

The final answer is: 49"
"To find the total number of kids in the park, we first need to determine the number of boys. Since there are twice the number of boys as girls, and there are 6 girls, we can calculate the number of boys by multiplying the number of girls by 2.

Number of boys = 2 * Number of girls
Number of boys = 2 * 6
Number of boys = 12

Now, to find the total number of kids in the park, we add the number of girls and the number of boys.

Total number of kids = Number of girls + Number of boys
Total number of kids = 6 + 12
Total number of kids = 18

"Let's break down the information given:

1. 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.
2. A number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. 
   Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting as S. 
   We can write the equation as S = 4 * 3 - 5
   S = 12 - 5
   S = 7
3. Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. 
   Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for physical violence as V. 
   We can write the equation as V = 3 * S
   V = 3 * 7
   V = 21
4. If a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart, we can write the equation as:
   Total = 3 (refusing to wear masks) + 7 (shoplifting) + 21 (physical violence) + X (other reasons)
   50 = 3 + 7 + 21 + X
   50 = 31 + X
   X = 50 - 31
   X = 19

Let's denote the number of points Erin had before scoring 14 points as 'x'. After scoring 14 points, Erin will have x + 14 points. Since Erin now has three times more points than Sara, we can set up the equation:

x + 14 = 3 * 8

Simplifying the equation, we get:
x + 14 = 24

Now, we need to isolate 'x' by subtracting 14 from both sides of the equation:
x = 24 - 14
x = 10

So, Erin had 10 points before scoring 14 points.

"To find the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to calculate the cost of the picture frames, the etching, the pins, and the cords separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames. There are 44 seniors, and each picture frame costs $20. So, the total cost of the picture frames is 44 * $20 = $880.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of etching the logo on the picture frames. The etching costs an additional 20% of the cost of the picture frame, which is $20. 20% of $20 is 0.2 * $20 = $4. So, the total cost of etching the logo on all the picture frames is 44 * $4 = $176.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the pins. 2 seniors will receive pins, and each pin costs $5. So, the total cost of the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the cords. 1/4 of the seniors are officers, which is 44 / 4 = 11 officers. Each officer will receive a cord that costs $12. So, the total cost of the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, let's add up the costs of the picture frames, etching, pins, and cords to find the total cost of the senior gifts. The total cost is $880 + $176 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

"To find the total cost of making the hand-painted wallpaper, we first need to calculate the materials cost. Since making it DIY saves 20% of the market price, we can find the materials cost by subtracting 20% of the market price from the market price.

Market price of the hand-painted wallpaper = $400
Savings = 20% of $400 = 0.20 * $400 = $80
Materials cost = Market price - Savings = $400 - $80 = $320

So, the total cost of making the hand-painted wallpaper is $320.

The final answer is: $320"
"To find the total number of shoes sold, we need to calculate the number of shoes sold on each day and then add them together.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes they sold on Friday, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the number of shoes they sold on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six people returned their pairs on Sunday, so we need to subtract those from the total number of shoes sold on Sunday. 14 - 6 = 8 pairs.

Now, let's add up the total number of shoes sold over the three days: 14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 8 (Sunday) = 50 pairs.

Since each pair has 2 shoes, we need to multiply the total number of pairs by 2 to get the total number of shoes sold. 50 * 2 = 100.

"To find the total amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we first need to find the value of the faulty equipment. 

The total value of the equipment is $400,000. 40% of this is faulty. 

40% of $400,000 = 0.4 * $400,000 = $160,000

This means the faulty equipment is worth $160,000. 

To find the value of the functioning equipment, we subtract the value of the faulty equipment from the total value.

Value of functioning equipment = Total value - Value of faulty equipment
= $400,000 - $160,000

"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total interest she has to pay and then divide it by the number of months.

First, let's calculate the total interest she has to pay. The formula for simple interest is:

Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

Here, Principal = $3,650, Rate = 10% or 0.10, and Time = 5 months.

Interest = $3,650 * 0.10 * 5
Interest = $1,825

Now, we need to add the interest to the principal to get the total amount she has to pay.

Total Amount = Principal + Interest
Total Amount = $3,650 + $1,825
Total Amount = $5,475

Since she has to pay an equal amount every month for 5 months, we divide the total amount by 5.

"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we first need to determine how many silver and gold pesos each of them has.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. 

Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos. 
Anna also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

Now, let's add up the total number of silver and gold pesos each of them has:
Axel's total: 50 (silver) + 80 (gold) = 130 pesos
Anna's total: 100 (silver) + 120 (gold) = 220 pesos

To find the total number of pesos they have together, we add Axel's total and Anna's total:
130 (Axel's total) + 220 (Anna's total) = 350 pesos

"To find the total profit per hour, we first need to determine the total revenue and the total cost.

Millie buys supplies for $18 to make 3 pitchers of lemonade. Each pitcher holds 12 cups of lemonade, so she can make 3 * 12 = 36 cups of lemonade.

She sells each cup of lemonade for $1, so her total revenue will be 36 * $1 = $36.

Her total cost is $18.

To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the revenue: $36 - $18 = $18.

Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, we need to find out how many hours it takes her to sell all the lemonade. Since she has 36 cups, and she sells 4 cups per hour, it will take her 36 / 4 = 9 hours to sell all the lemonade.

To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours: $18 / 9 = $2.

"To find the initial amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the initial amount of land as 'x'. Since he sold 3/5 of his land, he was left with 2/5 of the initial amount. We are given that the remaining land is 12.8 hectares.

We can set up the equation as follows:

2/5 * x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2 to isolate x:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land initially.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the number of female members in the choir, we first need to calculate 50% of the total members. Since 50% of the choir members are girls, we can find the number of girls by multiplying the total number of members by 0.5.

Number of girls = Total members * 0.5
Number of girls = 52 * 0.5
Number of girls = 26

Since half the people performing can't make it to the show, we need to find half of the number of girls. 

Number of girls performing initially = Number of girls / 2
Number of girls performing initially = 26 / 2
Number of girls performing initially = 13

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them. To find the total number of people who sang in the performance, we add the number of girls performing initially to the number of teachers.

Total people performing = Number of girls performing initially + Number of teachers
Total people performing = 13 + 3
Total people performing = 16

The cost of 8 pencils is 8 x $3 = $24.

Now, let's add the cost of erasers and pencils together: $12 + $24 = $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to add the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu.

First, let's find out how many messages James delivers to Mr. Yu. Since he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can multiply the number of messages to Ms. Thompson by 1/3.

Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * Messages to Ms. Thompson
Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * 66
Messages to Mr. Yu = 22

Now, we can add the number of messages to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages James delivers.

Total messages = Messages to Ms. Thompson + Messages to Mr. Yu
Total messages = 66 + 22
Total messages = 88

The final answer is: 88"
"To find out how much money David saves, we first need to calculate the cost of the rides for Dasha and compare it to the cost of the ride bracelet for David.

Each ride costs 2 tickets at $2 per ticket, so the cost of one ride is 2 * $2 = $4. 

Since they ride all 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha to buy tickets for all rides is 9 * $4 = $36.

David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides. 

The cost of the rides for Dasha is $36, and the cost for David is $30. 

The amount of money David saves is $36 - $30 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To find out how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we first need to determine the total number of gifts she has to wrap. 

Total gifts = gifts for family + gifts for friends + gifts for teachers
Total gifts = 6 + 4 + 2
Total gifts = 12

Since Monica wants to make a bow for each gift, she will need to make 12 bows in total. 

Now, we need to find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each bow. To do this, we divide the total amount of ribbon by the total number of bows.

Total ribbon = 144 inches
Total bows = 12

Ribbon per bow = Total ribbon / Total bows
Ribbon per bow = 144 / 12
Ribbon per bow = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we first need to find out how many popsicles each of them has. 

Let's assume the number of popsicles Betty has is 5x and the number of popsicles Sam has is 6x. 

Since the total number of popsicles they have together is 165, we can write the equation: 5x + 6x = 165

Combine like terms: 11x = 165

Divide both sides by 11: x = 15

Now that we know x, we can find the number of popsicles each of them has. Betty has 5x = 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles. Sam has 6x = 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has: 90 - 75 = 15

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total cost of the streaming services, we need to calculate the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus. 

The normal cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 each, so together they cost $20. Since Tim saves 20% by bundling, we need to find 20% of $20 and subtract it from $20.

20% of $20 is 0.2 x $20 = $4. 

So, the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $20 - $4 = $16.

The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $16 (bundled Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26.

Since Tim was paying $60 for the cable package, he saves $60 - $26 = $34 by cancelling his cable subscription.

The final answer is: $34"
"To find the total time spent, we need to add up the time spent writing, recording, and editing the song. 

Time spent writing: 4 hours
Time spent recording: 4 hours / 2 = 2 hours
Time spent editing: 90 minutes = 1.5 hours

Total time spent = 4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5 hours

Now, let's find the percentage of time spent editing. 
Percentage = (Time spent editing / Total time) * 100
= (1.5 / 7.5) * 100
= 0.2 * 100
= 20%

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total number of books Wendy wants to place, we first need to determine the number of books in the shelving system and then add 20 more to double that amount.

The shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns, so the total number of books it can hold is 6 * 6 = 36.

Now, Wendy wants to place double the number of books in the system, which is 2 * 36 = 72.

Finally, she wants to add 20 more books to this amount, so the total number of books she needs to carry is 72 + 20 = 92.

The final answer is: 92"
"To find out how many Valentine's Day cards Erica has now, we need to calculate the total number of cards she initially had, added to the cards her dad brought, and then subtract the cards she passed out and add the cards she received.

Initially, Erica made 20 Valentine's cards. Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards that had 15 cards each, so that's 2 * 15 = 30 cards. 

Now, Erica has 20 (initial cards) + 30 (cards from her dad) = 50 cards.

She passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 to her family, so in total, she gave away 24 + 5 = 29 cards.

She received 17 cards from family and friends.

So, the total number of cards Erica has now is 50 (initial cards + cards from her dad) - 29 (cards given away) + 17 (cards received) = 38.

The final answer is: 38"
"To find out how many slices are left, we first need to determine how many slices Jenny gave away. 

Jenny gave 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices, we can calculate the number of slices Bill received as follows: 
1/3 * 12 = 4 slices

Next, Jenny gave 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. We can calculate the number of slices Mark received as follows:
1/4 * 12 = 3 slices

In total, Jenny gave away 4 + 3 = 7 slices.

Jenny ate 2 slices, so the total number of slices she gave away and ate is 7 + 2 = 9 slices.

To find out how many slices are left, we subtract the total number of slices given away and eaten from the total number of slices:
12 - 9 = 3 slices

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many days Mark needs to save his money, we need to divide the cost of the bike by his daily earnings.

Cost of the bike: $300
Daily earnings: $10

Number of days = Cost of the bike / Daily earnings

= 30

So, Mark needs to save his money for 30 days to buy the bike.

30"
"To find the total number of bugs, we first need to find the number of millipedes and stink bugs. 

Nancy saw 90 spiders. The number of millipedes is 1/3rd of the number of spiders, so the number of millipedes is 90 / 3 = 30.

The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12, so the number of stink bugs is (2 * 30) - 12 = 48.

Now, we add the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs to find the total number of bugs: 90 + 30 + 48 = 168.

The final answer is: 168"
"To find the difference between Alice and Erica's ages, we first need to determine Alice's age. Since Beth is 5 years older than Erica, and Erica is 30 years old, Beth's age is 30 + 5 = 35 years.

Alice is 7 years older than Beth, so Alice's age is 35 + 7 = 42 years.

The difference between Alice and Erica's ages is 42 - 30 = 12 years.

"To find the total calories consumed by John, we need to calculate the total ounces of milk he drank and then multiply it by the calories per ounce.

John drank 2 glasses of milk, and each glass is 8 ounces. So, the total ounces of milk he drank is 2 * 8 = 16 ounces.

Since milk has 3 calories per ounce, the total calories consumed by John is 16 * 3 = 48 calories.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find out how much the builder earns in a year, we first need to calculate his daily earnings and then multiply it by the total number of days he works in a year.

The builder works 6 days a week and 4 weeks a month. So, the total number of days he works in a month is 6 days/week * 4 weeks/month = 24 days/month.

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of days he works in a year is 24 days/month * 12 months/year = 288 days/year.

The builder gets paid $50 every day. So, his daily earnings are $50/day.

Now, we can calculate his total earnings in a year by multiplying his daily earnings by the total number of days he works in a year: $50/day * 288 days/year = $14400/year.

The final answer is: $14400"
"To find out how many bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of flour and milk required for the quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. Since Mark is making a quadruple batch, he needs 4 times the amount of each ingredient. 

For flour: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups
For milk: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark needs to buy 12 cups / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags of flour.

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so Mark needs to buy 4 cups / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles of milk.

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour: 6 bags - 2 bottles = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the energy saved, we first need to calculate the energy used by the air conditioner in a day. 

The air conditioner uses 900 watts of energy per hour. Since there are 8 hours of usage, the total energy used in a day is:
900 watts/hour * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours or 7.2 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per day.

If Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours, the new usage time is:
8 hours - 5 hours = 3 hours per day.

The new energy used in a day is:
900 watts/hour * 3 hours = 2700 watt-hours or 2.7 kWh per day.

The energy saved per day is the difference between the original and new usage:
7.2 kWh - 2.7 kWh = 4.5 kWh per day.

To find the total energy saved in 30 days, we multiply the daily energy saved by 30:
4.5 kWh/day * 30 days = 135 kWh.

The final answer is: 135"
"To find the average number of stripes, we first need to find the total number of stripes and then divide it by the total number of zebras.

There are two zebras with 17 stripes each, so that's 2 * 17 = 34 stripes.
There's a zebra with 36 stripes.
There's another zebra with half the number of stripes as the third zebra, which is 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.

The total number of stripes is 34 + 36 + 18 = 88.
The total number of zebras is 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.

To find the average, we divide the total number of stripes by the total number of zebras: 88 / 4 = 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To determine the total cost of the meat and cheese, we first need to calculate the total number of sandwiches required to serve 20 people. Since each sandwich serves 4 people, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each sandwich serves:

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, we need a total of 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

The cost of the meat is $7.00 per pound, so the total cost of the meat is:
5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00

The cost of the cheese is $3.00 per pound, so the total cost of the cheese is:
5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

The total cost of the meat and cheese is the sum of the cost of the meat and the cost of the cheese:
$35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

The final answer is: $50.00"
"To solve this problem, we first need to find the initial number of corns and cannolis Allan had at home. 

Since Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis and he has 40 cannolis, the initial number of corns is 2 * 40 = 80.

Allan bought 60 more cannolis and 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. So, he bought 60 cannolis and 60 - 40 = 20 corns.

Now, we add the initial and the additional items to find the total number of each item. The total number of cannolis is 40 (initial) + 60 (additional) = 100. The total number of corns is 80 (initial) + 20 (additional) = 100.

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 100 (cannolis) + 100 (corns) = 200.

"Let's break down the information given. Elliott wants to walk 10,000 steps in total. He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which is 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps. 

He also took an additional 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So, the total steps he has taken so far is 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

Since he had 2,000 steps left to take after his jog, we can find the total steps he took during his jog by subtracting the remaining steps from the total steps he wanted to take. 

Total steps he wanted to take: 10,000
Steps taken so far: 6,000
Steps left: 2,000

Steps taken during the jog = Total steps - Steps taken so far - Steps left
Steps taken during the jog = 10,000 - 6,000 - 2,000
Steps taken during the jog = 2,000

The final answer is: 2000"
"To find out how many minutes Toby will be early, we first need to determine how long it will take him to read the book. 

The book is 45 pages long and averages 200 words per page, so the total number of words in the book is 45 * 200 = 9000 words.

Toby can read at a rate of 300 words per minute, so the time it will take him to read the book is 9000 / 300 = 30 minutes.

Since it takes 10 minutes to get to the airport, Toby will arrive 30 + 10 = 40 minutes after he starts reading.

However, Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to leave for the airport, so we need to subtract the time it takes him to read the book and get to the airport from the total time he has. 

60 - 40 = 20 minutes.

Therefore, Toby will be 20 minutes early.

"To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we first need to calculate the total number of employees and the total hours worked in each month.

In May, the company hired 40 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, so the total hours worked by each employee in May is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in May is 160 * $15 = $2400.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so the number of employees left is 40 - (1/4 * 40) = 40 - 10 = 30 employees. Each employee still worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, so the total hours worked by each employee in June is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in June is 160 * $15 = $2400.

The total amount paid to all employees in May is 40 * $2400 = $96,000. The total amount paid to all employees in June is 30 * $2400 = $72,000.

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000.

"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. Since she bought 2 pounds and the sale is ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off,"" we can consider it as a 2-pound purchase with a discount on the second pound. The first pound costs $3, and the second pound is half off, which is $3 * 0.5 = $1.5. So, the total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.5 = $4.5.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the magnets. She bought 4 magnets at $0.25 each, so the total cost of the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items: $4.5 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1 (magnets) = $7.

Sally started with $10, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from the initial amount: $10 - $7 = $3.

"To find the total amount spent by Tim, we first need to calculate the cost of the two packages of fireworks and the finale firework.

The first package of fireworks costs $400. The second package costs twice as much, so it's 2 * $400 = $800.

The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Tim gets a 20% discount on the two packages. To find the discount amount, we multiply the total cost by 20% (or 0.20). The discount is $1200 * 0.20 = $240.

The discounted cost of the two packages is $1200 - $240 = $960.

Adding the cost of the finale firework, the total amount spent by Tim is $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To determine how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we first need to calculate how many cookies she eats in 30 days. 

Since Shannon eats 2 cookies a night, we multiply the number of cookies she eats per night by the number of nights in 30 days. There are 30 nights in 30 days. 

2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies

Since Shannon wants to have enough cookies for 30 days, we need to make 60 cookies. However, her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies at a time. 

To find out how many dozens of cookies she needs to make, we divide the total number of cookies needed by the number of cookies made per batch. 

60 cookies / 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozen cookies

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozen cookies to have enough for 30 days. 

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. 

First, let's find the number of candles that smell like wet dog. Since 5% of the candles have this defect, we can calculate it as follows:

Number of candles that smell like wet dog = Total number of candles * (Percentage of candles with the defect / 100)
= 50000 * (5 / 100)
= 2500

Now, we need to find the number of candles that are both defective and explode. Since Marcy guarantees that 99% of the candles will not explode, the percentage of candles that will explode is 1% (100% - 99%). However, this 1% is out of the total number of candles, not the candles with the defect. 

To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to find 1% of the candles that smell like wet dog:

Number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode = Number of candles that smell like wet dog * (Percentage of candles that will explode / 100)
= 2500 * (1 / 100)
= 25

"Let's break down the information given:

- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so her sister gathers 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.
- Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees as she does from the tallest trees, so she gathers 30 / 2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees.
- Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so her sister gathers 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.
- The combined total of apples gathered from the tallest and shortest trees is 30 + 60 + 15 + 45 = 150 apples.
- Since the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, the number of apples gathered from the average trees is 500 - 150 = 350 apples.
- Since Joanne gathers some apples from the average trees, we need to find out how many apples she gathered from the average trees. Let's denote the number of apples she gathered from the average trees as 'x'.
- The total number of apples gathered by Joanne is 30 (from the tallest trees) + 15 (from the shortest trees) + x (from the average trees) = 45 + x.
- The total number of apples gathered by her sister is 60 (from the tallest trees) + 45 (from the shortest trees) = 105 apples.
- The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, so 45 + x + 105 = 500.
- Solving for x, we get x = 500 - 150 = 350.

However, this is the total number of apples gathered from the average trees by both sisters. Since the problem asks for the number of apples gathered by Joanne from the average trees, we need to find out how many apples she gathered from the average trees. Let's denote the number of apples she gathered from the average trees as 'y'. We already know that the total number of apples gathered from the average trees is 350, so y = 350.

"Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D. We know that camels have two humps each and dromedaries have one hump each. 

We are given two pieces of information: 
1. The total number of heads is 180. Since each animal has one head, we can write this as C + D = 180.
2. The total number of bumps is 304. Since camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump, we can write this as 2C + D = 304.

Now, we have a system of two linear equations with two variables. We can solve this system by subtracting the first equation from the second equation to eliminate D.

2C + D - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find the number of dromedaries.

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

"To find the total distance traveled by Tom, we need to calculate the distance traveled in the first week and the second week separately and then add them together.

In the first week, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day for the first 4 days. So, the total distance traveled in the first 4 days is 200 * 4 = 800 kilometers.

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. 30% of 800 kilometers is 0.3 * 800 = 240 kilometers. So, the total distance traveled in the first week is 800 + 240 = 1040 kilometers.

In the second week, Tom made 300 kilometers every day for 7 days. So, the total distance traveled in the second week is 300 * 7 = 2100 kilometers.

The total distance traveled by Tom during his two-week-long trip is 1040 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.

"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to work backwards from Peter's locker size. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, Zack's locker must be 4 times as big as Peter's locker. 

Given that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, Zack's locker is 4 * 5 = 20 cubic inches.

Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, Timothy's locker must be twice as big as Zack's locker. 

So, Timothy's locker is 2 * 20 = 40 cubic inches.

"To find the number of cats left on the rock, we first need to determine the number of cats taken away by the boats and then subtract that from the initial number of cats. 

Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each. So, the total number of cats taken away by the boats is 4 * 5 = 20.

Now, we subtract the number of cats taken away from the initial number of cats: 50 - 20 = 30.

After the boats left, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find the number of cats that ran after the mouse, we multiply the remaining cats by 3/5: 30 * (3/5) = 18.

Now, we subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats: 30 - 18 = 12.

So, the number of cats left on the rock is 12.

"To find the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into the different periods and calculate the cost for each period.

The first 6 months are $8 a month, so the cost for this period is 6 * $8 = $48.

The next 8 months are $12 a month, so the cost for this period is 8 * $12 = $96.

After that, the price increased to $14 a month. Since 2 years is 24 months, and we've already accounted for 14 months, there are 24 - 14 = 10 months left. The cost for this period is 10 * $14 = $140.

Now, let's add up the costs for each period: $48 + $96 + $140 = $284.

The total cost for 2 years of the service is $284.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let the cost of the jogger jeans be x. Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, the cost of the tattered jeans is x + $6.

The total savings is $6, and Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. This means he saved 1/3 * $6 = $2 from the jogger jeans and the rest, $6 - $2 = $4, from the tattered jeans.

Since he saved $2 from the jogger jeans, the cost of the jogger jeans is $2 less than the total savings, so x = $6 - $2 = $4.

Now, we know the cost of the jogger jeans is $4 and the cost of the tattered jeans is $4 + $6 = $10.

The difference in cost between the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is $10 - $4 = $6.

The jogger jeans originally cost $6 more than the tattered jeans.

The final answer is: $6"
"To find the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and add them together.

The capacity of the 4 buses is 4 x 60 = 240 employees.
The capacity of the 6 minibusses is 6 x 30 = 180 employees.
The capacity of the 10 minivans is 10 x 15 = 150 employees.

Now, we add the capacities together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

The final answer is: 570"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many birds each type of feeder attracts and then add them up.

Lillian made 3 bird feeders, and each of them attracts 20 + 10 = 30 birds. So, the homemade feeders attract 3 * 30 = 90 birds.

She bought 3 bird feeders, and each of them attracts 20 birds. So, the store-bought feeders attract 3 * 20 = 60 birds.

In total, Lillian can expect to see 90 + 60 = 150 birds in her garden each day.

The final answer is: 150"
"To find the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The bagel costs $4. 
The soup costs 25% more than the bagel, which is 4 + (4 * 0.25) = 4 + 1 = $5.
The cake costs half the price of the bagel, which is 4 / 2 = $2.

Now, let's add the costs of all the items together: 
4 (bagel) + 5 (soup) + 2 (cake) = 11

The total cost of Aleksandra's dinner is $11."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cards Kenny sold to get the remaining $50. Since he sold the cards for $1.5 each, we can divide the remaining money by the price per card to find the number of cards sold.

Let's denote the total number of cards as 'x'. Since Kenny kept 1/3 of the cards, he sold 2/3 of the cards. The number of cards sold is 2/3 * x.

The money he got from selling the cards is equal to the number of cards sold multiplied by the price per card, which is $1.5. So, the equation becomes:

(2/3 * x) * 1.5 = 50

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3/2 to get:

x = 50 * (3/2)
x = 75

So, Kenny started with 75 cards. 

The final answer is: 75"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, the caterer prepared enough hot dogs for half of the guests to have two hot dogs. Since there are 36 guests, half of them would be 36 / 2 = 18 guests. 

For these 18 guests, the caterer prepared 2 hot dogs each, so the total number of hot dogs prepared for these 18 guests is 18 * 2 = 36 hot dogs.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hot dog. This means that the caterer had to provide an additional 40 - 36 = 4 hot dogs to the 22 guests who were not initially prepared for two hot dogs.

Since the caterer had already prepared 36 hot dogs for the 18 guests who were initially prepared for two hot dogs, and now he had to provide an additional 4 hot dogs to the remaining 22 guests, it means that the 18 guests who were initially prepared for two hot dogs got their second hot dogs, and the remaining 22 guests got an extra hot dog each.

So, the 18 guests who were initially prepared for two hot dogs got their second hot dogs, and the 22 guests who were not initially prepared for two hot dogs got an extra hot dog each.

Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hot dog is 18.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the number of letters in Indras' sister's name, we first need to find half of the letters in Indras' name. 

Indras has 6 letters in her name. Half of 6 is 3. 

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name, so it has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

The total number of letters in both names is 6 (Indras) + 7 (her sister) = 13.

The final answer is: 13"
"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the total cost of the items before the discount and then apply the 20% discount.

The total cost of the items before the discount is:
- Pot and pans: $120.00
- Mixing bowls: $20.00
- 5 separate utensils: 5 * $5.00 = $25.00
Total cost before discount: $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

Now, we need to apply the 20% discount to the total cost. To do this, we multiply the total cost by 0.20 (which is the decimal equivalent of 20%).
Discount: $165.00 * 0.20 = $33.00

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final cost of the order.
Final cost: $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

The final answer is: $132.00"
"To find out how much more money Dora needs, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy and subtract the amount of money she already has.

The total cost of the items is: $6 (skipping rope) + $11 (board game) + $2 (playground ball) = $19

Dora has a total of $2 (her allowance) + $16 (from her mother) = $18

Now, let's subtract the amount of money Dora has from the total cost of the items: $19 (total cost) - $18 (Dora's money) = $1

So, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball.

The final answer is: $1"
"To find out how many dragons Prince Bruce has slain, we need to first determine how many dragons Prince Arthur and Prince Walter have slain.

Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, who slew 100 dragons. Three quarters of 100 is 75. So, Prince Arthur slew 75 dragons.

Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, who slew 75 dragons. Twice of 75 is 150. So, Prince Walter slew 150 dragons.

Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, who slew 150 dragons. One-fifth of 150 is 30. So, Prince Bruce slew 30 dragons.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we first need to determine how much gas was in one container. Since 15 gallons were equally divided into 5 containers, we divide 15 gallons by 5.

15 gallons / 5 = 3 gallons per container

Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we multiply the number of gallons per container by 8 to find out how many pints are in one container.

3 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 24 pints per container

Josey needed 1/4 of a container to run her lawnmower. To find out how many pints she needed, we multiply the number of pints per container by 1/4.

24 pints/container * 1/4 = 6 pints

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money George had initially. Since he had 1% of his money left after spending $5, we can set up an equation to find the initial amount.

Let's assume the initial amount of money George had is 'x'. Since he had 1% of his money left after spending $5, we can write the equation as:

x - 5 = 0.01x

To solve for x, we can add 5 to both sides of the equation:

x = 5 / (1 - 0.01)
x = 5 / 0.99
x = 5.05

So, George had $5.05 initially.

Now, let's find out how much he spent on chips. He bought 3 bags of chips for 40 cents each, so the total amount spent on chips is:

3 * 0.40 = $1.20

Since he spent $5 in total, the amount spent on candy bars is:

5 - 1.20 = $3.80

Now, we can find out how many candy bars he bought by dividing the amount spent on candy bars by the cost of each candy bar:

3.80 / 0.75 = 5.07

Since we can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can buy 5 candy bars for $3.75 and still have $0.05 left, which is not enough to buy another candy bar. Therefore, George bought 5 candy bars.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many lollipops each of Ray's friends received, we first need to determine how many lollipops he shared with them. 

Ray had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself, so he shared 25 - 5 = 20 lollipops with his friends.

Since he shared the lollipops equally among his four friends, we need to divide the total number of lollipops shared (20) by the number of friends (4).

20 lollipops / 4 friends = 5 lollipops per friend.

So, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the remaining weight of the cake, we first need to determine how much of the cake was eaten. Since Rory and her mom each had a piece, that's 2 pieces in total. 

The cake was cut into 8 pieces, and 2 pieces were eaten. To find the weight of the remaining cake, we need to subtract the weight of the 2 pieces eaten from the total weight of the cake.

Each piece of cake weighs 20 ounces / 8 pieces = 2.5 ounces per piece.

The weight of the 2 pieces eaten is 2.5 ounces * 2 = 5 ounces.

Now, we subtract the weight of the 2 pieces eaten from the total weight of the cake: 20 ounces - 5 ounces = 15 ounces.

The remaining cake weighs 15 ounces.

15"
"To find out how many oranges each person will get, we first need to calculate the total number of oranges Sitti and Juris have. 

Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges. 

Total oranges = 34 + 22 = 56

Since they are sharing the oranges with 6 other friends, including themselves, the total number of people sharing the oranges is 8 (Sitti, Juris, and 6 friends).

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people.

Oranges per person = Total oranges / Total people
= 56 / 8
= 7

So, everyone will get 7 oranges. 

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the cost per serving, we first need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients. 

Antoine wants to double the amount of onions, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The cost of onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, which costs 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

Since the soup serves 6 people, the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's break down the information given. 

Since it takes Wayne 4 minutes to be driven to the theater, and Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's, Bernadette's drive will take 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, so she needs to leave 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, Bernadette needs to leave 4 + 5 = 9 minutes before Wayne.

The final numerical answer is: 9"
"To find the perimeter of Billie's room, we first need to find the width of the room. Since we know the area and the length, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle: Area = Length * Width.

Given that the area is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. There are 3 feet in a yard, so 3 yards is equal to 3 * 3 = 9 feet.

Now we can use the formula to find the width: 360 = 9 * Width. To find the width, we divide both sides by 9: Width = 360 / 9 = 40 feet.

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter using the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width). Plugging in the values, we get Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40) = 2 * 49 = 98 feet.

The final answer is: 98"
"To find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we need to calculate the total number of beads each sister has.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
1 pack of red beads = 1 x 20 = 20 beads
2 packs of clear beads = 2 x 20 = 40 beads
Total beads Elizabeth has = 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
3 packs of blue beads = 3 x 20 = 60 beads
4 packs of red beads = 4 x 20 = 80 beads
Total beads Margareth has = 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, let's find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth:
Margareth's beads - Elizabeth's beads = 140 - 60 = 80

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the final temperature of the house, we need to calculate the temperature increase due to the oven and the temperature decrease due to the open window.

First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to the oven. The oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour, and Marcus bakes for 3 hours. So, the total temperature increase due to the oven is 5 * 3 = 15 degrees.

Now, let's calculate the temperature decrease due to the open window. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open, and the window is open for 30 minutes. So, the total temperature decrease due to the open window is (2 * 3) = 6 degrees.

Now, let's calculate the final temperature of the house. The initial temperature of the house is 40 degrees. The temperature increase due to the oven is 15 degrees, and the temperature decrease due to the open window is 6 degrees. So, the final temperature of the house is 40 + 15 - 6 = 49 degrees.

The final answer is: 49"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it took James to complete each segment of the triathlon. 

Let's start with the swim. Since James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon, we need to find 10% of Jon's swim time and subtract it from Jon's swim time. 

10% of 40 minutes is 0.1 x 40 = 4 minutes. So, James' swim time is 40 - 4 = 36 minutes.

Next, we know that James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. Jon's bike time is 1 hour and 20 minutes, which is 80 minutes. So, James' bike time is 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Now, we know that Jon won by 10 minutes. This means that the difference between James' total time and Jon's total time is 10 minutes. We can set up an equation to represent this:

Jon's total time - James' total time = 10 minutes

We know Jon's total time is 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes. We also know James' swim time (36 minutes) and bike time (85 minutes). Let's call James' run time 'x'. Then, James' total time is 36 + 85 + x.

So, the equation becomes:
170 - (36 + 85 + x) = 10

Simplifying the equation:
170 - 121 - x = 10
49 - x = 10
x = 39

Therefore, it took James 39 minutes to complete the run. 

The final answer is: 39"
"To find the length of Movie A, we need to first find the length of Movie B and then calculate one-fourth of that length.

Movie C is 1.25 hours, which is equal to 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes.

Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so Movie B is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes.

Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, so Movie A is 80 / 4 = 20 minutes.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay, we first need to calculate the total cost of the hay. 

First, let's find out how many miles the horse runs in 30 minutes. Since the horse runs at 32MPH, we can use the formula: distance = speed * time. However, the time needs to be in hours. 

30 minutes is 0.5 hours. 

distance = speed * time
distance = 32 * 0.5
distance = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile, and it ran 16 miles, the total hay consumed is:
16 miles * 1/2 bail/mile = 8 bails

Each bail costs $3, so the total cost of the hay is:
8 bails * $3/bail = $24

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of:
6 * $5 = $30

To find the change, we subtract the cost of the hay from the total amount of money Michael has:
$30 - $24 = $6

The final answer is: $6"
"To find out how many eggs Rozanne has in total, we need to calculate the number of eggs from the cases and the loose eggs separately. 

4 dozen eggs is equal to 4 x 12 = 48 eggs. 
Adding the 2 loose eggs, Rozanne has a total of 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Since each glass needs 5 eggs, we can divide the total number of eggs by 5 to find out how many glasses of eggnog Rozanne can make. 
50 eggs / 5 eggs per glass = 10 glasses.

Each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog, so we can divide the total number of glasses by 5 to find out how many trays Rozanne can put out. 
10 glasses / 5 glasses per tray = 2 trays.

The final answer is: 2"

"To find the salesman's profit, we first need to calculate the total revenue from the flash sale and the department store sales.

The salesman sold 17 sneakers for $20 each at the flash sale, so the total revenue from the flash sale is:
17 * $20 = $340

The salesman sold the remaining 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers to the department store for $25 each. The total revenue from the department store sales is:
31 * $25 = $775

The total revenue from both sales is:
$340 + $775 = $1115

The cost of the case of 48 sneakers is $576. To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the total revenue:
$1115 - $576 = $539

The salesman's profit is $539.

6 packets * 8 crayons/packet = 48 crayons

Next, let's calculate the total number of crayons in the four packets with sixteen pieces each:
4 packets * 16 crayons/packet = 64 crayons

Now, let's add the total number of crayons from both types of packets:
48 crayons + 64 crayons = 112 crayons

So, Beatrice bought a total of 112 crayons for her Art class.

The final answer is: 112"
"Let's break down the information given. 

If you buy a super ticket for $20, you get one popcorn and a soda for $1 extra. This means the total cost for the super ticket, popcorn, and soda is $20 + $1 = $21. 

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the cost of the movie ticket, popcorn, and soda without the super ticket is $21 - $2 = $19.

The cost of the movie ticket is $12. So, the cost of the popcorn and soda without the super ticket is $19 - $12 = $7.

The cost of the soda is $3. So, the cost of the popcorn is $7 - $3 = $4.

The final answer is: $4"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the cost of filling one balloon before the price increase. 

Let's denote the original cost of filling one balloon as 'x'. Since the total cost of filling 20 balloons was $900, we can set up the equation:

20x = 900

To find the value of 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 20:

x = 900 / 20
x = 45

So, the original cost of filling one balloon was $45.

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost of filling one balloon is:

New cost = Original cost + Increase
New cost = 45 + 20
New cost = 65

Now, we need to find the total cost of filling 170 balloons at the new rate:

Total cost = New cost per balloon * Number of balloons
Total cost = 65 * 170
Total cost = 11050

The final answer is: 11050"
"To find the average speed of the car during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled at 60 mph for 2 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 60 mph x 2 hours
Distance = 120 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled at 30 mph for 1 hour:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 30 mph x 1 hour
Distance = 30 miles

Now, let's find the total distance traveled:
Total Distance = 120 miles + 30 miles
Total Distance = 150 miles

The total time taken for the trip is 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours.

To find the average speed, we divide the total distance by the total time:
Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
Average Speed = 150 miles / 3 hours
Average Speed = 50 mph

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total value of Jenna's jewels, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires and rubies separately and then add them together.

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. Each sapphire is worth $800, so the total value of her sapphires is 8 * $800 = $6400.

She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. This means she now has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left. 

The value of the 3 sapphires she traded is 3 * $800 = $2400. 

The value of the 2 rubies she received is 2 * $1200 = $2400.

The total value of her jewels is the value of the remaining sapphires plus the value of the rubies. So, the total value is $6400 + $2400 - $2400 = $6400.

The total value of Jenna's jewels is $6400."
"To find the total number of apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of apples they eat per day and then multiply it by 30.

Marin and Nancy each eat 4 apples a day. So, together they eat 4 + 4 = 8 apples per day.

Now, we multiply the total number of apples they eat per day by 30 to find the total number of apples they eat in 30 days: 8 * 30 = 240.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the total volume of soil needed, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed and then multiply it by the total number of beds.

The volume of one raised bed is calculated as length * width * height. 
Volume = 2 feet * 8 feet * 2 feet = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:
Total Volume = 32 cubic feet/bed * 10 beds = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. To find the total number of bags needed, we divide the total volume by the volume of one bag:
Number of bags = Total Volume / Volume per bag = 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet/bag = 160 bags.

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:
Total Cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag = 160 bags * $12/bag = $1920.

The final answer is: $1920"
"To find the total number of cards, we first need to determine the number of green cards. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:

Number of red cards = 15
60% of 15 = 0.6 * 15 = 9
Number of green cards = 15 + 9 = 24

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards:
Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
= 15 + 24
= 39

To find the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards:
Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
= 15 + 24 + 39

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies.

After 20 minutes, one of her friends saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the fairies that were there. This means her friend saw 50 / 2 = 25 fairies. So, the total number of fairies now is 50 + 25 = 75.

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. To find the remaining number of fairies, we subtract 30 from 75: 75 - 30 = 45.

"To find the total weight of the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and add them together.

The farmer buys 2 boxes of sugar cubes, each weighing 1 pound, so the total weight of sugar cubes is 2 * 1 = 2 pounds.

He buys 4 bags of carrots, each weighing 12 pounds, so the total weight of carrots is 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.

He buys 42 bales of hay, each weighing 75 pounds, so the total weight of hay is 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.

He buys 20 sacks of oats, each weighing 65 pounds, so the total weight of oats is 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

The total weight of all the feed is 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3400 pounds.

Since the farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, we need to divide the total weight of the feed by the truck's capacity to find the number of trips needed.

3400 / 2250 = 1.511 (round up to the nearest whole number since we can't make a fraction of a trip)

So, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To find out how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate her earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles separately and then add them together.

Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans of soda a week. Since an aluminum can is worth 2 cents, her weekly earnings from aluminum cans are 3 * 2 = 6 cents.

Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles of water a week. Since a plastic bottle is worth 3 cents, her weekly earnings from plastic bottles are 5 * 3 = 15 cents.

In a four-week month, Grayson's total earnings from aluminum cans would be 6 * 4 = 24 cents.

In a four-week month, Grayson's total earnings from plastic bottles would be 15 * 4 = 60 cents.

Now, let's add her earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles together: 24 + 60 = 84 cents.

"To find out how many plants Shondra has, we first need to determine how many plants Toni has. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, and Frederick has 10 plants, we can calculate Toni's plants as follows:

Toni's plants = Frederick's plants + (60% of Frederick's plants)
Toni's plants = 10 + (0.6 * 10)
Toni's plants = 10 + 6
Toni's plants = 16

Now that we know Toni has 16 plants, we can find out how many plants Shondra has. Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni, so:

Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
Shondra's plants = 16 - 7

"To find the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man, we first need to find 1/5 of the cost of the pizza. 

1/5 of $15 is calculated as: $15 * (1/5) = $15 * 0.2 = $3.

Since Ashley wants to give a tip equal to 1/5 of the amount she ordered, we add the tip to the cost of the pizza: $15 + $3 = $18.

The final numerical answer is: $18"
"To find Finley's final position, let's break down the changes in her position.

Initially, Finley was in 1st place. 
She fell back 5 spots, so she was in 1st - 5 = 6th place.
Then, she moved ahead 2 spots, so she was in 6th + 2 = 8th place.
Next, she fell behind 3 spots, so she was in 8th - 3 = 11th place.
Lastly, she jumped ahead 1 spot, so she was in 11th + 1 = 12th place.

Finley finished the race in 12th place.

"To find out how many students Miss Maria has, we first need to calculate the total number of cards she has. 

She has 6 decks of basketball cards with 25 cards in each deck, so the total number of basketball cards is 6 * 25 = 150.

She has 5 boxes of baseball cards with 40 cards in each box, so the total number of baseball cards is 5 * 40 = 200.

The total number of cards is the sum of basketball and baseball cards, which is 150 + 200 = 350.

Since Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, the number of cards she gives to her students is 350 - 50 = 300.

Each student gets 10 cards, so the number of students is 300 / 10 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we first need to calculate the total cost for each of them.

Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each and received a $1 discount. 
First, we find the total cost before the discount: 20 * 0.45 = $9. 
Then, we subtract the discount: $9 - $1 = $8.

Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each and received a 10 percent discount. 
First, we find the total cost before the discount: 20 * 0.50 = $10.
Then, we calculate the discount: 10% of $10 is 0.1 * $10 = $1.
Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost: $10 - $1 = $9.

Now, we compare the costs: Kelly paid $9 and Becky paid $8. 
The difference is $9 - $8 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"

"To find the total number of shoes Fireman Frank has on Sunday, we need to calculate the total number of shoes he has after gaining new pairs and then subtract the shoes he gets rid of on Saturday.

First, let's find the total number of shoes he has after gaining new pairs. 

Initially, Fireman Frank has 200 shoes. 

On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes. Since each pair has 2 shoes, he gets 5 * 2 = 10 shoes. 
Now, he has 200 + 10 = 210 shoes.

On Wednesday, he gains 15 new pairs of shoes. Again, each pair has 2 shoes, so he gets 15 * 2 = 30 shoes. 
Now, he has 210 + 30 = 240 shoes.

On Friday, he gains 30 new pairs of shoes. Each pair has 2 shoes, so he gets 30 * 2 = 60 shoes. 
Now, he has 240 + 60 = 300 shoes.

On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes. 
Now, he has 300 - 180 = 120 shoes.

So, on Sunday, Fireman Frank will have 120 shoes.

Initially, there are 30 students, each with 10 pencils. So, the total number of pencils is 30 * 10 = 300.

After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used. This means 1/5 * 300 = 60 pencils were used.

So, the remaining pencils after two months are 300 - 60 = 240.

At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. This means 1/3 * 240 = 80 pencils were left.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let's say the number of carrot sticks Matt eats is 'x'. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, which is x/2. He also gets two extra cookies for cleaning his room. So, the total number of cookies he gets is x/2 + 2.

We are given that Matt wants to eat five cookies in total. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x/2 + 2 = 5.

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. First, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: x/2 = 5 - 2, which simplifies to x/2 = 3.

Next, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction: x = 3 * 2, which simplifies to x = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the combined length of the remoras, we need to convert their individual lengths to feet and then add them together. 

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the length of each remora is 6 inches / 12 = 0.5 feet. 

The combined length of the remoras is 2 * 0.5 = 1 foot.

Now, we need to find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy. 

The percentage is (combined length of remoras / length of shark) * 100 = (1 / 10) * 100 = 10%.

"To find out how many books each child got, we first need to find out the total number of books Sarah bought. Since each book costs $15 and she spent $300, we can divide the total amount spent by the cost of each book.

Total amount spent = $300
Cost of each book = $15

Total number of books = Total amount spent / Cost of each book
Total number of books = $300 / $15
Total number of books = 20

Since Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, we can divide the total number of books by 4 to find out how many books each child got.

Number of books each child got = Total number of books / 4
Number of books each child got = 20 / 4
Number of books each child got = 5

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we need to first find the total number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts. 

We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find this. The formula is Total = A + B - Both, where A is the number of kids allergic to dairy, B is the number of kids allergic to peanuts, and Both is the number of kids allergic to both.

A = 9 (kids allergic to dairy)
B = 6 (kids allergic to peanuts)
Both = 3 (kids allergic to both)

Total allergic = A + B - Both = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12

Now, we know that there are 32 kids in the class. To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we subtract the total number of kids allergic from the total number of kids in the class.

Kids not allergic = Total kids - Total allergic = 32 - 12 = 20

"To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we first need to find the weight of the 2010 penny. 

Since the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can calculate its weight by multiplying the weight of the 1959 penny by 3/4.

Weight of 1959 penny = 48 grains
Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * 48 grains
Weight of 2010 penny = 36 grains

Now, we can find the combined weight of the two pennies by adding their individual weights.

Combined weight = Weight of 1959 penny + Weight of 2010 penny
Combined weight = 48 grains + 36 grains
Combined weight = 84 grains

Number of oranges eaten = (2/5) * 60
= (2 * 60) / 5
= 120 / 5
= 24

Now that we know Stetson ate 24 oranges, we can find the total amount of money he gave up by multiplying the number of oranges eaten by the amount he gave up for each orange, which is $10.

Total amount given up = Number of oranges eaten * Amount per orange

"To determine the total amount of oats needed, we first need to calculate the daily consumption of oats by Uncle Ben's horses. 

Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and there are two meals per day. So, the daily consumption per horse is 5 pounds * 2 = 10 pounds.

Since Uncle Ben has four horses, the total daily consumption is 10 pounds * 4 horses = 40 pounds.

For five days, the total consumption would be 40 pounds * 5 days = 200 pounds.

Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats. To find out how many bags are needed, we divide the total consumption by the weight of each bag: 200 pounds / 50 pounds per bag = 4 bags.

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days.

"To find the cost per individual razor after the discount, we need to first calculate the total cost of 2 packs of razors with the sale and the coupon.

Since the razors are buy one get one free, Heather will only pay for 1 pack of razors. The cost of 1 pack is $4.00. 

Heather also has a $2.00 coupon, so she will get a discount of $2.00.

The total cost of 1 pack of razors after the coupon is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since there are 4 razors in a pack, the cost per individual razor is $2.00 / 4 = $0.50.

"To find the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car, we need to calculate the cost of the morning rides and the cost of the afternoon rides separately and then add them together.

The cost of the morning rides is the cost per ride multiplied by the number of rides. Since Paul drives twice a day for 14 days, he drives a total of 2 * 14 = 28 rides in the morning. The cost per ride is $6, so the total cost of the morning rides is 28 * $6 = $168.

The cost of the afternoon rides is also the cost per ride multiplied by the number of rides. Since Paul drives twice a day for 14 days, he drives a total of 2 * 14 = 28 rides in the afternoon. The cost per ride is $2, so the total cost of the afternoon rides is 28 * $2 = $56.

To find the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car, we add the cost of the morning rides and the cost of the afternoon rides: $168 + $56 = $224.

"Let's break down the costs for each venue. 

For the first venue, the cost is a flat fee of $200, plus $5 per guest. If there are x guests, the total cost for the first venue is $200 + $5x.

For the second venue, the cost is $25 per guest. If there are x guests, the total cost for the second venue is $25x.

Since we want the two venues to be equal in cost, we can set up the equation:

$200 + $5x = $25x

To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting $5x from both sides:

$200 = $20x

Now, we can divide both sides by $20 to solve for x:

x = $200 / $20
x = 10

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Let's denote the number of insects David found as D, the number of insects Bodhi found as B, and the number of insects Lily found as L. 

From the given information, we have the following equations:

1. L = D + 7 (Lily found 7 more than David)
2. D = B/2 (David found half of what Bodhi found)
3. L + D + B = 43 (Together they collected 43 insects)

We can substitute equation (2) into equation (1) to get L in terms of B:
L = (B/2) + 7

Now, substitute L and D in terms of B into equation (3):
(B/2) + 7 + (B/2) + B = 43

Combine like terms:
(2B/2) + 7 + B = 43
B + 7 + B = 43
2B + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:
2B = 36

Divide both sides by 2:
B = 18

Now that we know B, we can find D:
D = B/2
D = 18/2
D = 9

Now that we know D, we can find L:
L = D + 7
L = 9 + 7
L = 16

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, and there are 364 yards in a skein. To find 1/4 of 364, we multiply 364 by 1/4. 

364 * (1/4) = 364 * 0.25 = 91 yards

Mariah's grandma used 1/2 of a skein. To find 1/2 of 364, we multiply 364 by 1/2.

364 * (1/2) = 364 * 0.5 = 182 yards

"Let's break down the information given. Suzie bought 4 packs of gum in total. She bought 2 packs of strawberry gum, 1 pack of grape gum for $2, and 1 pack of green apple gum. 

Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as 'x'. Since she paid half as much for the green apple gum as the grape gum, the cost of the green apple gum is $2 / 2 = $1.

The total cost of all the gum is $7. So, the total cost of the strawberry gum and the green apple gum is $7 - $2 = $5. 

Since there are 2 packs of strawberry gum, the total cost of the strawberry gum is 2x. The total cost of the green apple gum is $1. Therefore, 2x + $1 = $5.

To find the cost of each pack of strawberry gum, we need to solve for x. Subtracting $1 from both sides of the equation gives us 2x = $4. Dividing both sides by 2 gives us x = $2.

The cost of each pack of strawberry gum is $2. 

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to determine which type of wood gives him the most sticks per dollar spent. 

Let's calculate the cost per stick for each type of wood:

For a 2 x 4 piece of wood, Frederick can get 200 sticks for $4. 
Cost per stick = $4 / 200 sticks = $0.02 per stick

For a 2 x 8 piece of wood, Frederick can get 400 sticks for $6. 
Cost per stick = $6 / 400 sticks = $0.015 per stick

Since the 2 x 8 piece of wood gives him the most sticks per dollar, we should prioritize buying this type of wood. 

Now, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces of wood Frederick can buy with his $24:

Number of 2 x 8 pieces of wood = $24 / $6 = 4

Since each 2 x 8 piece of wood gives him 400 sticks, the total number of sticks he can make is:

Total sticks = 4 * 400 = 1600

The final answer is: 1600"
"To find the total cost of snowshoes for Mario's dogs, we first need to determine the total number of snowshoes required. Since each dog has 4 legs and Mario has 6 dogs, the total number of legs is 6 * 4 = 24.

Since each dog needs a pair of snowshoes, and each pair covers 4 legs, we need to divide the total number of legs by 4 to get the total number of pairs of snowshoes required. However, since each dog needs a pair, we simply need to know how many dogs there are, which is 6.

The total cost will be the number of dogs multiplied by the cost of each pair of snowshoes. 

6 dogs * $12.00 per pair = $72.00

The final answer is: $72.00"
"To find out how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we first need to calculate how much she spends on bus trips in a week. 

Janet takes two bus trips a day, five days a week. So, the total number of bus trips in a week is 2 * 5 = 10 trips.

Each bus trip costs $2.20, so the total cost of bus trips in a week is 10 * $2.20 = $22.

Now, if Janet buys a weekly bus pass for $20, she would save $22 - $20 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's break down the information given:

- The farm has 30 cows.
- The zoo has 20 sheep.
- The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does, so the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.
- The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.
- The zoo has 20 sheep and 60 cows, so the zoo has a total of 20 + 60 = 80 animals.
- The farm has 30 cows and 10 sheep, so the farm has a total of 30 + 10 = 40 animals.

To find the total number of animals in both the farm and the zoo, we add the number of animals in the farm and the zoo: 40 + 80 = 120.

The final answer is: 120"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can represent the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought as x.

The total number of onions and potatoes Rose bought is 12 + 4 = 16. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can set up the equation 4x = 16.

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4: x = 16 / 4 = 4.

So, Sophia bought 4 onions and 4 potatoes. 

The total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is 4 + 4 = 8."
"To determine the calorie deficit Andy needs each day, we first need to calculate the total number of days he has to reach his goal. 

Since Andy's birthday is on July 19th and today is December 31st, we can calculate the number of days as follows:

December has 31 days, January has 31 days, February has 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year), March has 31 days, April has 30 days, May has 31 days, June has 30 days, and July has 19 days. 

Total days = 31 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 211 days

Now, we know Andy wants to lose 30 pounds and that he needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound. 

Total calories to burn = 30 pounds * 3500 calories/pound = 105,000 calories

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories to burn by the total number of days:

Daily calorie deficit = Total calories to burn / Total days
= 105,000 calories / 211 days
= approximately 497 calories per day

So, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of approximately 497 calories to reach his goal. 

497"
"To find out how much Gerald has left, we need to first calculate how much he earned in a week. Since he works 7 days a week and earns $30 per day, we can multiply the number of days by his daily earnings.

7 days * $30/day = $210

Now, we know Gerald spent a total of $100. To find out how much he has left, we subtract the amount he spent from the amount he earned.

$210 (earned) - $100 (spent) = $110

So, Gerald has $110 left."
"To find out how many milliliters of water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total distance she will run. Since each lap is 0.25 km and she needs to run 8 laps, we multiply the number of laps by the distance per lap.

Total distance = 8 laps * 0.25 km/lap = 2 km

Since Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs, we multiply the total distance by the amount of water needed per kilometer.

Total water needed = 2 km * 60 ml/km = 120 ml

Therefore, Hannah will need to drink 120 milliliters of water.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find out how much money Julie had left, we need to calculate the amount she spent on clothes and CDs, and then subtract that from the initial amount.

First, let's calculate the amount she spent on clothes. 20% of $500 is 0.2 x $500 = $100.

Now, let's subtract the amount spent on clothes from the initial amount: $500 - $100 = $400.

Next, let's calculate the amount she spent on CDs. 25% of $400 is 0.25 x $400 = $100.

Now, let's subtract the amount spent on CDs from the remaining amount: $400 - $100 = $300.

So, Julie had $300 left.

The final answer is: $300"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. We also know that the house cost three times as much as the lot. 

Let's represent the cost of the lot as 'x'. Since the house cost three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house can be represented as 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write the equation: x + 3x = 120,000.

Combining like terms, we get 4x = 120,000.

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 4: x = 120,000 / 4 = 30,000.

Since the cost of the lot is $30,000, the cost of the house is 3 times that amount, which is 3 * 30,000 = 90,000.

The final answer is: $90,000."
"To find the profit, we first need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

The total cost is the cost of the canvas bags, which is 8 packs * 5 bags per pack * $4 per bag = 8 * 5 * 4 = $160.

The total revenue is the selling price of the bags, which is 8 bags * $8 per bag = 8 * 8 = $64.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $64 - $160 = -$96.

However, since profit cannot be negative, it seems there might be an error in the given information. If the selling price is less than the cost, it's not possible to earn a profit."
"To find the total number of punches Joe threw, we need to calculate the total time of the fight and then multiply it by the average punches thrown per minute.

The fight lasts for 5 rounds of 3 minutes each, so the total time is 5 * 3 = 15 minutes.

Since Joe throws 25 punches per minute, the total number of punches thrown is 15 * 25 = 375.

The final answer is: 375"
"To find out how many cookies Kelsie made, we first need to determine how many cookies Josh made. Since Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, and Suzanne made 36 cookies, we can calculate Josh's cookies as follows:

Josh's cookies = Suzanne's cookies / 4
Josh's cookies = 36 / 4
Josh's cookies = 9

Now, we know that Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. So, we can calculate Kelsie's cookies as follows:

Kelsie's cookies = 2 * Josh's cookies
Kelsie's cookies = 2 * 9
Kelsie's cookies = 18

The final answer is: 18"
"To solve this problem, we first need to find the total amount of money Ali has. 

Ali has four $10 bills, which is 4 * $10 = $40. 
He also has six $20 bills, which is 6 * $20 = $120. 
So, the total amount of money Ali has is $40 + $120 = $160.

Now, Ali gives his sister half of the total money, which is $160 / 2 = $80. 
After giving his sister $80, Ali has $160 - $80 = $80 left.

Next, Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount to buy dinner. 3/5 of $80 is (3/5) * $80 = $48. 
So, the amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is $80 - $48 = $32.

The final answer is: $32"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it takes Rob to shingle a house in minutes. Since Rob takes 2 hours, we need to convert this to minutes. 

1 hour = 60 minutes
2 hours = 2 * 60 = 120 minutes

Now, we know that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time it takes Rob. Let's first find out what double the time it takes Rob is. 

Double the time it takes Rob = 2 * 120 = 240 minutes

Now, we add 40 minutes to this to find out how long it takes Royce. 

Time taken by Royce = 240 + 40 = 280 minutes

"To find the total number of skeins of wool needed, we need to calculate the total for each item and then add them together.

For each child, Martha needs:
- 2 skeins for a hat
- 4 skeins for a scarf
- 12 skeins for a sweater
- 1 skein for a pair of mittens
- 2 skeins for a pair of socks

Total skeins for each child = 2 + 4 + 12 + 1 + 2 = 19 skeins

Since there are 3 children, we multiply the total skeins for each child by 3:
Total skeins needed = 19 * 3 = 57

So, Martha will need 57 skeins of wool to make winter wear for her grandchildren.

The final answer is: 57"
"Let's break down Chris's progress step by step.

On Monday, Chris completes 12 problems. 
So, the remaining problems after Monday = 100 - 12 = 88.

On Tuesday, Chris completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, which is 3 * 12 = 36 problems.
So, the remaining problems after Tuesday = 88 - 36 = 52.

On Wednesday, Chris completes one-quarter of the remaining math problems, which is 52 / 4 = 13 problems.
So, the remaining problems after Wednesday = 52 - 13 = 39.

Therefore, Chris has 39 math problems left to complete on Thursday.

"To find the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Kathy, and Ricky can pick per hour, we need to calculate the individual rates of each person and then add them together.

Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Bobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony, so Bobby can pick 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.

Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy can pick 2 * 5 = 10 quarts per hour.

Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy, so Ricky can pick 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

Now, let's add the individual rates together to find the total number of quarts of strawberries that they can pick per hour: 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29.

First, let's calculate the total number of loaves sold: 
93 (morning) + 39 (afternoon) = 132 loaves sold

Now, let's subtract the number of loaves sold and returned from the total number of loaves baked:
200 (total loaves) - 132 (loaves sold) - 6 (loaves returned) = 62 loaves

The bakers had 62 loaves of bread left."
"To find the number of rows of red tulips, we need to divide the total number of red tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row. 

Number of red tulips = 36
Number of tulips per row = 6

Number of rows of red tulips = 36 / 6 = 6

To find the number of rows of blue tulips, we need to divide the total number of blue tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row.

Number of blue tulips = 24
Number of tulips per row = 8

Number of rows of blue tulips = 24 / 8 = 3

Since we can't have a fraction of a row, we can plant 6 rows of red tulips and 3 rows of blue tulips. 

The total number of rows of flowers Jackson can plant is 6 + 3 = 9.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we first need to determine how many cups of raisins she has available for the oatmeal cookies. 

Since she divides the raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, each of these will get 27 / 3 = 9 cups of raisins. 

However, the question asks for the number of batches of oatmeal cookies, and each batch requires 3/4 of a cup of raisins. To find out how many batches she can make, we need to divide the total raisins available for oatmeal cookies by the amount needed per batch. 

First, let's find out how many cups of raisins are available for oatmeal cookies: 9 cups (for oatmeal cookies) - 3 cups (for granola) - 3 cups (for snack mix) = 3 cups. However, this is incorrect as the total raisins available for oatmeal cookies is 9 cups. 

So, the correct calculation is 9 cups (for oatmeal cookies) - 0 cups (for granola and snack mix) = 9 cups. 

Now, we divide the total raisins available for oatmeal cookies by the amount needed per batch: 9 cups / (3/4 cup) = 9 / (3/4) = 9 * (4/3) = 12.

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we first need to calculate her daily and weekly consumption before and after adding the new device.

Before adding the new device, Ada's daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. Since there are 24 hours in a day, her daily consumption in dollars is:
12 kilowatts/hour * $1.50/kilowatt/hour = $18/day

Her weekly consumption before adding the new device is:
$18/day * 7 days/week = $126/week

After adding the new device, her daily consumption will be:
12 kilowatts/hour + 2 kilowatts/hour = 14 kilowatts/hour

Her daily consumption in dollars after adding the new device is:
14 kilowatts/hour * $1.50/kilowatt/hour = $21/day

Her weekly consumption after adding the new device is:
$21/day * 7 days/week = $147/week

The difference in her weekly electric bill is:
$147/week - $126/week = $21/week

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how long it would take one person to paint a whole house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, it would take them 10 days to paint a whole house (since it's twice the amount of work).

Now, let's calculate the total hours it would take one person to paint a whole house. There are 24 hours in a day, so 10 days would be 10 x 24 = 240 hours.

Since we have 5 people working together, we can divide the total hours it would take one person to paint a whole house by 5 to find the number of hours it would take 5 people to paint a whole house. 

240 hours / 5 people = 48 hours

4. Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Now, let's calculate the total number of sofas and chairs they have:

Ophelia has 20 sofas and 22 chairs.
Jenna has 64 sofas and 66 chairs.

Total number of sofas = 20 + 64 = 84
Total number of chairs = 22 + 66 = 88

"To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought, we first need to determine the cost of the headphone set. 

Let's subtract the cost of the CD from the total amount Tom paid: $48 - $4 = $44. 

This $44 is the cost of the headphone set. 

Now, we can find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with the money he saved by not buying the headphone set. 

The cost of one CD is $4. 

To find out how many CDs Tom could have bought, we divide the cost of the headphone set by the cost of one CD: $44 / $4 = 11.

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we need to consider the weeks where he spent 4 hours, 5 hours, and 6 hours. 

First, let's find the total hours spent in the weeks where he spent 4 hours each. There are 6 weeks where he spent 4 hours, so the total hours spent in these weeks is 6 * 4 = 24 hours.

Next, let's find the total hours spent in the weeks where he spent 5 hours each. There are 2 weeks where he spent 5 hours, so the total hours spent in these weeks is 2 * 5 = 10 hours.

Finally, let's find the total hours spent in the week where he spent 6 hours. There is 1 week where he spent 6 hours, so the total hours spent in this week is 1 * 6 = 6 hours.

Now, let's add up the total hours spent in all the weeks: 24 + 10 + 6 = 40 hours.

However, we need to consider that Josh spent 4 hours each in the remaining 2 weeks. So, the total hours spent in these weeks is 2 * 4 = 8 hours.

Now, let's add the hours spent in the remaining weeks to the total hours spent in the other weeks: 40 + 8 = 48 hours.

"To find the number of passengers after the second stop, we need to calculate the number of passengers at each step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is:
48 - 8 = 40

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (which is 8) get into the bus. So, 5 * 8 = 40 people get in.
Now, the total number of passengers is:
40 (left) + 40 (got in) = 80

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is:
80 - 21 = 59

Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on. Since 21 got off, 3 times fewer would be 21 / 3 = 7 passengers who get in.
Now, the total number of passengers is:
59 (left) + 7 (got in) = 66

The final number of passengers after the second stop is 66."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, so his current age is 27 - 5 = 22 years.
2. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. 
   Let's denote Jame's age in 8 years as J8 and his cousin's age in 8 years as C8. 
   We know that C8 = 2 * J8 - 5.
3. Since Jame's age in 8 years will be 22 + 8 = 30, we can substitute J8 = 30 into the equation from step 2.
   C8 = 2 * 30 - 5 = 55.
4. Now, we need to find Jame's cousin's current age. Since his age in 8 years will be 55, his current age is 55 - 8 = 47.
5. The difference in their ages is 47 - 22 = 25.

"To find the cost of one monitor, we first need to determine the cost of the printer. Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, and the computer cost $1,100, the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700.

The total cost of the computer and the printer is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800. 

Since Errol bought 2 monitors, the cost of the two monitors is $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.

To find the cost of one monitor, we divide the total cost of the two monitors by 2: $600 / 2 = $300.

"To solve this problem, we first need to find out how many shells the boys brought in total. Since there are 10 boys (half of 20 kids) and each brought 60 shells, the total number of shells brought by the boys is 10 * 60 = 600.

Now, we know that the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 600 + 4 * 60 shells.

First, we calculate 4 times the number of shells brought by the boys: 4 * 60 = 240.

Then, we add this to the number of shells brought by the boys: 600 + 240 = 840.

Since there are 10 girls (half of 20 kids), we need to find out how many shells each girl brought. To do this, we divide the total number of shells brought by the girls by the number of girls: 840 / 10 = 84.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, let's assume the number of candies George had before eating 5 candies is 'x'. Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, the number of candies Nick had is 2x.

George ate 5 candies, so the number of candies George has left is x - 5. We are given that George has 3 candies left, so we can set up the equation:

x - 5 = 3

To solve for x, we add 5 to both sides of the equation:

x = 3 + 5
x = 8

Now that we know George had 8 candies initially, we can find the number of candies Nick had, which is 2x:

Number of candies Nick had = 2x
= 2 * 8

"To find out how many vlogs Emma needs to make to complete 72 vlogs per month, we first need to calculate how many vlogs she has already made in the first three weeks.

In the first week, Emma made 18 vlogs.
In the second week, Emma made 21 vlogs.
In the third week, Emma made 15 vlogs.

Total vlogs made in the first three weeks = 18 + 21 + 15 = 54 vlogs

Since Emma's target is to make 72 vlogs per month, we subtract the vlogs she has already made from the target to find out how many more vlogs she needs to make.

Vlogs needed to be made = 72 - 54 = 18 vlogs

So, Emma should make 18 vlogs to complete her target of 72 vlogs per month.

$50 (bill) + $10 (tip) = $60

So, you ended up paying $60."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, $18 is shared among 3 boys. This means each boy gets $18 / 3 = $6.

The eldest boy added $5 to his share, so he now has $6 + $5 = $11.

The following day, he added another $10, making his total $11 + $10 = $21.

Then, he spent $8 from his total, leaving him with $21 - $8 = $13.

"To solve this problem, we first need to find out how much Elvis needs to save in the first half of the month. 

Let's assume the number of days in the first half of April is x. Since April has 30 days, the number of days in the second half will also be x. 

The total number of days in April is 30, so x + x = 30. 
Solving for x, we get 2x = 30, x = 15. 

So, the first half of April has 15 days and the second half also has 15 days.

Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half as in the first half. Let's assume he saves y dollars in the first half. Then, he will save 2y dollars in the second half.

The total savings for the month is the sum of the savings in the first and second half, which is equal to the target savings of $1125. 

So, y + 2y = 1125. 
Combining like terms, we get 3y = 1125. 
Dividing both sides by 3, we get y = 375.

Now that we know Elvis saves $375 in the first half, we can find out how much he needs to save in the second half. Since he needs to save twice as much in the second half, he will save 2y = 2 * 375 = 750 dollars in the second half.

Jenny gets $0.5 for each task, so for 20 tasks, she will get 20 * $0.5 = $10.

Now, to find out how much more Jairus will get than Jenny, we subtract Jenny's total from Jairus's total: $16 - $10 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, and the total amount they have to divide is $100.

Let's represent the amount Brad gets as 'x'. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, the amount Jeff gets is 4x.

The total amount they have to divide is $100, so we can set up the equation: x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms: 5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5: x = 20

Since x represents the amount Brad gets, and Jeff gets 4 times as much, Jeff gets 4x = 4(20) = 80

The final answer is: $80"
"To find the total miles Jeff walks in a week, we need to calculate the total miles he walks in a day and then multiply it by the number of days he works in a week.

Since Jeff walks to work and back each day, the total miles he walks in a day is 2 times the distance to work, which is 2 * 3 miles = 6 miles.

Now, we multiply the daily miles by the number of days he works in a week: 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to break down the process step by step.

1. Elise writes the alphabet in full twice, which means she writes 26 letters each time. So, in this step, she writes 26 * 2 = 52 letters.
2. Then, she writes half of the alphabet once. Half of the alphabet is 26 / 2 = 13 letters.
3. So, in this step, she writes 13 letters.
4. Finally, she re-writes everything she has already written. This means she re-writes 52 (from the first two steps) + 13 (from the third step) = 65 letters.

Now, let's add up all the letters she has written: 52 (first two steps) + 13 (third step) + 65 (re-writing everything) = 130 letters.

The final answer is: 130"
"This problem can be solved using the concept of exponential growth. In the first round, Ali calls 3 families. In the second round, each of those 3 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 3 * 3 = 9 new families being notified. 

In the third round, each of the 9 families (from the second round) calls 3 other families, resulting in 9 * 3 = 27 new families being notified. 

Now, let's calculate the number of families notified in the fourth round. In the third round, there were 9 families who made calls. Each of these 9 families will call 3 other families, resulting in 9 * 3 = 27 new families being notified. However, we also need to consider the families that were notified in the previous rounds. 

In the first round, 3 families were notified. In the second round, 9 families were notified. In the third round, 27 families were notified. So, the total number of families notified before the fourth round is 3 + 9 + 27 = 39. 

In the fourth round, each of the 27 families from the third round will call 3 other families, resulting in 27 * 3 = 81 new families being notified. However, we also need to consider the 39 families that were notified in the previous rounds. 

So, the total number of families notified in the fourth round is 81 + 39 = 120.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find Mark's initial weight, we need to calculate the total weight he lost and then add that to his final weight.

Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, so the total weight he lost is:
10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds

Now, we add the total weight lost to his final weight to find his initial weight:
Initial weight = Final weight + Total weight lost
Initial weight = 70 pounds + 30 pounds
Initial weight = 100 pounds

The final answer is: 100"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many toys Jonathan needs to have a play set five times larger than James's. Since James's play set has 80 toys, a play set five times larger would have 5 * 80 = 400 toys.

Since Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have enough toys to make a play set five times larger than James's, let's denote the number of toys Jonathan currently has as 'x'. This means that x + 2 = 400.

To find the number of toys Jonathan currently has, we need to solve for 'x'. Subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation, we get x = 400 - 2.

x = 398

The final answer is: 398"
"To find the total cost of the items Daniel wants to buy, we first need to calculate the cost of each item without the discount. 

The cost of 5 notebooks at $1.50 each is 5 * $1.50 = $7.50.
The cost of 2 pens at $0.25 each is 2 * $0.25 = $0.50.
The cost of 1 calculator at $12 each is $12.
The cost of 1 geometry set at $10 each is $10.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items: $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30.

Since the shop gives a 10% discount on all the purchased items, we need to calculate the discount amount. 
10% of $30 is 0.1 * $30 = $3.

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total cost: $30 - $3 = $27.

So, Daniel has to spend $27 on all the items he wants to buy.

The final answer is: $27"
"To find the total cost of the items, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of five hamburgers at $4 each is 5 x $4 = $20.
The cost of ten packs of potato fries at $0.30 each is 10 x $0.30 = $3.
The cost of five cans of fruit drinks at $2 each is 5 x $2 = $10.

Now, let's add the costs together: $20 + $3 + $10 = $33.

Carly pays with a $50 bill, so the change she gets back is $50 - $33 = $17.

The final answer is: $17"
"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we need to break down her sales into two parts: the first $1000 and the sales above $1000.

For the first $1000, she earns a 30% commission:
$1000 * 0.30 = $300

For the sales above $1000, which is $2500 - $1000 = $1500, she earns an additional 10% commission:
$1500 * 0.10 = $150

Now, let's add the two amounts together to find her total earnings:
$300 + $150 = $450

The final answer is: $450"
"To determine how many additional bottles Bill needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles he already has. Since he started with 2 cases of water, each case having 24 bottles, we multiply the number of cases by the number of bottles per case.

2 cases * 24 bottles/case = 48 bottles

Next, we need to calculate the total number of bottles Bill needs for his party. He wants 2 bottles of water for each of his 70 guests.

70 guests * 2 bottles/guest = 140 bottles

Now, we subtract the number of bottles Bill already has from the total number of bottles he needs to find out how many more he needs to buy.

140 bottles (needed) - 48 bottles (already has) = 92 bottles

So, Bill needs to buy 92 additional bottles of water for his party.

The final answer is: 92"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. 

When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as in cold water. Since it takes Ray 16 minutes to swim a mile in cold water, twice that time is 2 * 16 = 32 minutes. Adding 2 minutes to that gives us 32 + 2 = 34 minutes.

Now, we know it takes Ray 34 minutes to swim a mile in warm water. To find out how long it takes him to swim 3 miles in warm water, we multiply 34 minutes by 3, which gives us 34 * 3 = 102 minutes.

Next, we need to find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in cold water. Since it takes him 16 minutes to swim a mile in cold water, we multiply 16 minutes by 3, which gives us 16 * 3 = 48 minutes.

Now, we can find the difference in time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day (warm water) and a cold day. The difference is 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

The final answer is: 54"
"To find out how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we need to calculate his weekly earnings and then divide the target savings by his weekly earnings.

First, let's calculate John's daily earnings: 
$2 per hour * 5 hours per day = $10 per day

Next, let's calculate his weekly earnings: 
$10 per day * 4 days per week = $40 per week

Now, let's divide the target savings by his weekly earnings to find out how many weeks it will take him to save $80:
$80 / $40 per week = 2 weeks

"To solve this problem, let's first determine how many cups of coffee Octavia drinks. Since she drinks half the daily recommended amount, and assuming the daily recommended amount is 8 cups (a common recommendation), Octavia drinks 8 / 2 = 4 cups of coffee.

Since Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, Juan drinks 10 * 4 = 40 cups of coffee.

Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. To find out how many cups he must reduce, we subtract the recommended amount from his current intake: 40 - 4 = 36 cups.

"To find the average weight of the three friends, we first need to find their individual weights. 

Mark's weight is given as 150 pounds. 
Susan's weight is 20 pounds less than Mark's, so Susan's weight is 150 - 20 = 130 pounds. 
Bob's weight is twice as much as Susan's, so Bob's weight is 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, we have the weights of all three friends: Mark (150 pounds), Susan (130 pounds), and Bob (260 pounds). 

To find the average weight, we add their weights and divide by 3. 
Average weight = (150 + 130 + 260) / 3 
Average weight = 440 / 3 
Average weight = 146.67

"To find the final angle of the sun from the ground, we need to calculate the total angle the sun moves in 10 hours. 

The sun moves 5 degrees per hour, so in 10 hours, it will move 5 * 10 = 50 degrees.

Since the pyramids are initially at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground, we need to add the angle the sun moves to this initial angle.

So, the final angle from the ground to the sun will be 32 + 50 = 82 degrees.

The final answer is: 82"
"To find out how many packs of candles James needs to buy, we first need to determine the total number of candles required. Since James has two sons, one 12 years old and the other 4 years younger, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Typically, birthday candles are used in the number equal to the age of the person. So, James will need 12 candles for the older son and 8 candles for the younger son, making a total of 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we need to find out how many packs James needs to buy. To do this, we divide the total number of candles needed (20) by the number of candles in a pack (5). 

20 / 5 = 4

So, James needs to buy 4 packs of candles. 

The cost of 4 packs of candles is 4 * $3 = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To find out how many pages Judy read in the first week, we need to calculate the total minutes she read in the first week and then convert that to pages. 

In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night. Since there are 7 nights in a week, she read for a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes in the first week.

Given that she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we can find out how many pages she read in 105 minutes. First, let's find out how many 1.5 minute intervals are in 105 minutes. We can do this by dividing 105 by 1.5, which equals 70. 

Now, we know that she can read 2 pages in each 1.5 minute interval. So, in 70 intervals, she can read 70 * 2 = 140 pages in the first week.

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages. 

To find the total number of pages she read in two weeks, we add the pages read in the first week and the second week: 140 + 100 = 240 pages.

In 7 years, the nephew's age will be x + 7.

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, we can set up the equation: 
51 = 3(x + 7)

Now, let's solve for 'x'. 
51 = 3x + 21
51 - 21 = 3x
30 = 3x
x = 30 / 3
x = 10

"To find the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we need to calculate the amount for each set of teeth and add them together.

For the first tooth, the tooth fairy left $5.00.

For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy left $1.00 each, so the total for these teeth is 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.

For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy left half the amount of the previous three teeth, which is $1.00 / 2 = $0.50 per tooth. So, the total for these teeth is 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up the amounts for all the teeth: $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that Richie scored 80 goals. We also know that Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark and 45 more goals than Anna.

Let's denote Mark's goals as M and Anna's goals as A. We can set up two equations based on the given information:

1. Richie's goals = Mark's goals + 20
   80 = M + 20
   M = 60

2. Richie's goals = Anna's goals + 45
   80 = A + 45
   A = 35

Now that we know Mark scored 60 goals and Anna scored 35 goals, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers.

Total goals = Richie's goals + Mark's goals + Anna's goals
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35
Total goals = 175

"To find out how many action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we first need to determine how much money he has left after buying the wooden action figures and then calculate how many plastic action figures he can buy with the remaining money.

Peter spent $5 each day for 4 days (Sunday through Wednesday) on wooden action figures. So, the total amount spent on wooden action figures is 4 * $5 = $20.

He started with $70 and spent $20 on wooden action figures, so he has $70 - $20 = $50 left.

For the rest of the week (Thursday through Saturday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. There are 4 days left in the week, so he can buy 4 * $2 = $8 worth of plastic action figures.

However, Peter only has $50 left, and he can only spend $8 on plastic action figures. This means he will not be able to buy any plastic action figures with the remaining money.

So, Peter will have 4 wooden action figures (one for each day from Sunday to Wednesday) and 0 plastic action figures.

The total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is 4.

"To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we first need to calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week and then per month.

The total number of roses ordered per week is 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered per month is 65 * 4 = 260 roses.

Ford grows 40 roses every week, so the total number of roses he grows per month is 40 * 4 = 160 roses.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the total number of roses he grows per month from the total number of roses ordered per month: 260 - 160 = 100.

"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

The cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is $3.00 per loaf, and since each loaf makes 10 sandwiches, the cost per sandwich is $3.00 / 10 = $0.30 per sandwich. 

The cost of cheese and condiments for 10 sandwiches is $30.00. So, the cost per sandwich for cheese and condiments is $30.00 / 10 = $3.00 per sandwich.

The total cost per sandwich is the sum of the cost of bread and cheese/condiments, which is $0.30 + $3.00 = $3.30 per sandwich.

The revenue per sandwich is $7.00.

The net profit per sandwich is the revenue per sandwich minus the total cost per sandwich, which is $7.00 - $3.30 = $3.70 per sandwich.

Since they sell 10 sandwiches, the total revenue is $7.00 * 10 = $70.00, and the total cost is $3.30 * 10 = $33.00.

The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00.

The final answer is: $37.00"

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the area of the bedroom and then calculate the cost of the new carpet, padding, and installation.

The area of the bedroom is 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet.

The cost of the new carpet is $12 per square foot, so the total cost of the carpet is 216 * $12 = $2592.

The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot, so the total cost of the padding is 216 * $2 = $432.

The cost of removing the old carpet is $4 per square foot, so the total cost of removing the old carpet is 216 * $4 = $864.

The cost of installing the new carpet is $34 per square foot, so the total cost of installing the new carpet is 216 * $34 = $7344.

The total cost of replacing the carpet is the sum of the cost of the new carpet, padding, removing the old carpet, and installing the new carpet: $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344 = $11332.

"To find the percentage by which the oven is off, we need to calculate the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature, and then divide it by the set temperature.

The difference between the actual and set temperature is 468 - 450 = 18 degrees.

The percentage by which the oven is off is (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%.

Since the oven is off by 4% for any recipe, we need to find the temperature that is 4% less than 520 degrees.

To do this, we can calculate 4% of 520 and subtract it from 520.

4% of 520 is (4/100) * 520 = 20.8.

Now, subtract 20.8 from 520 to get the temperature Maggie should set her oven to: 520 - 20.8 = 499.2.

"To find the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to convert the time of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time as follows:
1 hour = 60 minutes
Adding the 30 minutes, we get:
60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting the time to minutes:
2 hours = 2 * 60 minutes = 120 minutes
Adding the 5 minutes, we get:
120 minutes + 5 minutes = 125 minutes

Now, we add the time of both movies together:
90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes

Therefore, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies.

"Let's break down the information given. Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

To find the total number of utensils brought by the two, we need to add the number of cups and dishes from both Judy and her friend. 

Judy brought 12 + 24 = 36 utensils (cups + dishes). 
Her friend brought 40 + 44 = 84 utensils (cups + dishes).

The total number of utensils brought by the two is 36 + 84 = 120.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the cost per pair of contacts, we first need to determine the total number of contacts in 2 boxes and the total cost of 2 boxes with the discount.

Since 90 contacts last Pete 45 days, we can find the number of contacts he uses per day. 

90 contacts / 45 days = 2 contacts per day

Now, let's find the total number of contacts in 2 boxes. 

2 boxes * 90 contacts per box = 180 contacts

Since Pete uses 2 contacts per day, the total number of days the 2 boxes will last is:

180 contacts / 2 contacts per day = 90 days

The total cost of 2 boxes with a 10% discount is:

Original price of 2 boxes: 2 * $100 = $200
Discount: 10% of $200 = 0.1 * $200 = $20
Discounted price: $200 - $20 = $180

Now, let's find the cost per pair of contacts. 

Total number of contacts: 180
Total cost: $180

Cost per pair of contacts: $180 / 180 pairs = $1 per pair

The final answer is: $1"
"To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we first need to calculate the total hours each of them worked and then their total earnings.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so her total hours worked is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 hours. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, which is 3 * 1 = 3 hours. So, John's total hours worked is 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

Since they both earn $10 an hour, Jill's total earnings are 3 * $10 = $30, and John's total earnings are 7 * $10 = $70.

The difference in their earnings is $70 - $30 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find out how much water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total calories she burns during her activities. 

She spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories/hour. So, the total calories burned during aerobics = 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories.

She also spends 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories/hour. So, the total calories burned during running = 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories.

The total calories burned = calories burned during aerobics + calories burned during running = 1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns, we need to find out how many sets of 200 calories are there in 1600 calories. 

To do this, we divide the total calories by 200: 1600 calories / 200 calories = 8.

Since she needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, she needs to drink 8 * 100 ml = 800 ml of water.

The final answer is: 800"
"Let's break down the information given. 

Let's assume the number of blue jelly beans is B. 
Since there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans, the number of red jelly beans is B - 0.01B = 0.99B.
Since there are 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans, the number of green jelly beans is B + 0.01B = 1.01B.

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500. So, the sum of red, blue, and green jelly beans is 4500. 
0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500
Combine like terms: 2.99B = 4500
Divide both sides by 2.99: B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans.
Number of red jelly beans: 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
Number of green jelly beans: 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

To find the difference between the number of green and red jelly beans, subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans: 1515 - 1485 = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the average of the three measurements, we need to first find the third measurement. Jared's initial speed is 47 WPM, and it increased to 52 WPM. If he increases it by 5 WPM again, his new speed will be 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

Now, we have the three measurements: 47, 52, and 57. To find the average, we add them up and divide by 3.

Average = (47 + 52 + 57) / 3
Average = 156 / 3
Average = 52

"To find the difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks, we need to calculate the weight change for each option and then find the difference.

If Martin eats Cheerios every day for breakfast, he'll lose 1.25 pounds/week. After 5 weeks, he'll lose 1.25 * 5 = 6.25 pounds.

If Martin eats donuts every day for breakfast, he'll gain 1.75 pounds/week. After 5 weeks, he'll gain 1.75 * 5 = 8.75 pounds.

The difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options is 8.75 - 6.25 = 2.5 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2.5}$"
"To find the total number of people attending the event, we need to calculate the number of people invited via email, the number of friends Alex's friends will bring, and the number of Alex's friends and their spouses.

First, let's calculate the number of people invited via email. Each of the 100 people invited will bring 2 friends, so the total number of people invited via email is 100 + (100 * 2) = 300.

Next, Alex calls 10 friends and 8 of them will bring their spouses, so the total number of Alex's friends and their spouses is 10 + 8 = 18.

Now, we add the number of people invited via email and the number of Alex's friends and their spouses to get the total number of people attending the event. 

Total number of people = 300 + 18 = 318

However, we also need to include Alex herself, so the total number of people attending the event is 318 + 1 = 319.

Therefore, Alex will need 319 seats for the event.

The final answer is: 319"
"To find the weight of the Mastiff, we need to start from the Papillon's weight. The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund. Since the Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, the Dachshund's weight is 2 * 10 pounds = 20 pounds. 

The Papillon's weight is one-fourth of the Dachshund's weight, so it is 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.

The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff's weight is 44 * 5 pounds = 220 pounds.

The final answer is: 220"
"To find the total cost of the boots on eBay, we need to add the cost of the boots and the shipping cost. The shipping cost on eBay is twice as much as on Amazon, which is $4. So, the shipping cost on eBay is 2 * $4 = $8.

The total cost of the boots on eBay is $13 (boots) + $8 (shipping) = $21.

The total cost of the boots on Amazon is $16 (boots) + $4 (shipping) = $20.

To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we subtract the cost on Amazon from the cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, which is 20 feet off the ground. The beanstalk starts out 4 feet tall and doubles in height every day.

Let's calculate the height of the beanstalk for each day:

Day 1: 4 feet
Day 2: 4 * 2 = 8 feet
Day 3: 8 * 2 = 16 feet
Day 4: 16 * 2 = 32 feet

As we can see, on the 4th day, the beanstalk will be taller than Mark's window, which is 20 feet off the ground.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we first need to find out how many grams of protein he gets per day. 

Since a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein, we can find the protein percentage in a cup of mushrooms by dividing the protein by the weight: 3 grams / 100 grams = 0.03 or 3%.

Now, we know that John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day. To find out how many grams of protein he gets per day, we multiply the weight of mushrooms he eats by the protein percentage: 200 grams * 0.03 = 6 grams of protein per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7 to find the weekly protein intake: 6 grams/day * 7 days = 42 grams of protein per week.

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's break down the information given. If Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can represent his current age as 'x'. 

Five years ago, Jerry's age would be 'x - 5'. According to the given information, Jerry's current age is twice his age 5 years ago, so we can write the equation as x = 2(x - 5).

Simplifying the equation, we get x = 2x - 10. Subtracting 2x from both sides, we get -x = -10. Multiplying both sides by -1, we get x = 10.

So, Jerry's current age is 10 years. 

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age: 10 + 3 = 13.

The final answer is: 13"
"To find out how many hours George needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the dental work. 

The base price for two implants is 2 * $2000 = $4000. 
For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain, which costs an extra $500. So, the total cost for the implants with the crown is $4000 + $500 = $4500. 

However, George has already put down a deposit of $600. So, the remaining amount he needs to pay is $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since George makes $15 per hour at work, we can find out how many hours he needs to work by dividing the remaining amount by his hourly wage: $3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

The final answer is: 260"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let the smallest angle be x. 

Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, it will be 2x. 

And since one angle is three times the smallest angle, it will be 3x.

We know that the sum of all three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So, we can write the equation: x + 2x + 3x = 180.

Combine like terms: 6x = 180.

Now, divide both sides by 6: x = 30.

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles. One angle is 2x, which is 2 * 30 = 60 degrees. The other angle is 3x, which is 3 * 30 = 90 degrees.

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has in cents. 

First, let's convert the quarters to cents: 8 quarters * 25 cents = 200 cents
Next, let's convert the dimes to cents: 6 dimes * 10 cents = 60 cents
Then, we already have the number of nickels in cents: 14 nickels * 5 cents = 70 cents
Lastly, let's convert the pennies to cents: 15 pennies * 1 cent = 15 cents

Now, let's add up the total amount of money Colby has: 200 cents + 60 cents + 70 cents + 15 cents = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs a nickel (5 cents), we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball: 345 cents / 5 cents = 69

Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

Birds have 2 legs each, so 10 birds will have 10 x 2 = 20 legs.

Now, let's add the total number of legs together: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the weight Jamaal uses after increasing the 8-pound weight by 50%, we first need to calculate 50% of 8 pounds. 

50% of 8 pounds is 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds. 

Now, we add this to the original weight: 8 pounds + 4 pounds = 12 pounds. 

However, Jamaal finds this weight too heavy, so he uses a weight two pounds lighter than this. 

The weight he now uses is 12 pounds - 2 pounds = 10 pounds.

"Let's break down Steve's game collection over the three years.

In the first year, Steve gets 5 games as a birthday gift and 5 games as Christmas gifts, totaling 10 games. He also buys 1 game per month for 12 months, which is 12 games. So, in total, he has 10 + 12 = 22 games at the end of the first year.

In the second year, Steve gets 5 games as birthday and Christmas gifts, totaling 10 games. He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, which is 24 games. So, in total, he has 10 (gifts) + 24 (bought) = 34 games at the end of the second year.

In the third year, Steve gets 5 games as birthday and Christmas gifts, totaling 10 games. He buys 4 games per month for 12 months, which is 48 games. So, in total, he has 10 (gifts) + 48 (bought) = 58 games at the end of the third year.

To find the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we add the games from each year: 22 (first year) + 34 (second year) + 58 (third year) = 114 games.

"To find the rate at which the plane is traveling, we need to divide the distance it traveled by the time it took. 

Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Rate = 400 miles per hour

Now, we need to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this rate.

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

Since the question asks for the additional hours it would take, we need to subtract the initial 3 hours from the total time.

Additional time = Total time - Initial time
Additional time = 5 hours - 3 hours
Additional time = 2 hours

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much Marissa makes in an hour, we need to first find out how much Ruiz makes in an hour. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, we divide 120 by 2 to get the amount made in an hour. 

Ruiz makes 120 / 2 = 60 pounds in an hour.

Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in 2 hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, we multiply 120 by 3/4 to find out how much Marissa makes in an hour.

Marissa makes (3/4) * 120 = 90 pounds in an hour.

Now, we know that both Ruiz and Marissa work for 12 hours a day. To find the total amount of chocolates they make together in a day, we add the amount made by Ruiz and Marissa in an hour and multiply it by 12.

Total amount made by Ruiz in a day = 60 * 12 = 720 pounds
Total amount made by Marissa in a day = 90 * 12 = 1080 pounds

Total amount made by both in a day = 720 + 1080 = 1800 pounds

The total revenue from the first four hours is:
60 cups * $0.50/cup = $30

Next, let's calculate the total number of cups sold in the next two hours:
10 cups/hour * 2 hours = 20 cups

The total revenue from the next two hours is:
20 cups * $0.60/cup = $12

Now, let's add the revenue from both time periods to find the total amount of money Patrick earned:
$30 + $12 = $42

"To find out how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we first need to calculate the total number of rotations the tire can handle in a month. 

Since each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations, and Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, we need to find out how many miles the tire can handle before it needs to be replaced. 

Given that every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times, we can find the total number of miles the tire can handle by dividing the total number of rotations by the number of rotations per 2 miles. 

725 rotations per 2 miles * 2 miles = 1450 miles per 725 rotations

Now, we can divide the total number of rotations by the number of rotations per 1450 miles to find the total miles the tire can handle:

10,440,000 rotations / 725 rotations per 1450 miles = 14,310 miles

Now that we know the tire can handle 14,310 miles, we can divide the total miles the tire can handle by the miles Jeremy drives in a month to find out how many months the tire can last:

14,310 miles / 400 miles per month = 35.775 months

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can divide the total months by 12 to find the total years:

35.775 months / 12 months per year = 2.98125 years

"To find out how much money Joe will have left after the purchase, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items he wants to buy. 

The shirt costs $25 and the shorts cost $35. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount: 
$25 (shirt) + $35 (shorts) = $60

Since there's a 30% off sale, we need to calculate the discount amount. 
Discount = 30% of $60 = 0.3 * $60 = $18

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final price Joe will pay: 
$60 - $18 = $42

Since sales tax is included, we don't need to calculate it separately. Joe will pay $42 for the items.

To find out how much money Joe will have left, we subtract the final price from the initial amount he had: 
$50 - $42 = $8

The final answer is: $8"
"To find out how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we first need to calculate the total number of croissants he wants to make in a week. Since he wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day, and there are 7 days in a week, we multiply 4 dozen by 7.

4 dozen/day * 7 days = 28 dozen

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, we can convert 28 dozen to individual croissants by multiplying by 12.

28 dozen * 12 = 336 croissants

Now, we know it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. To find out how much butter is needed for 336 croissants, we need to multiply the number of croissants by the amount of butter needed per dozen.

336 croissants * (1/4 pound/croissant) = 336 * 0.25

To calculate this, we multiply 336 by 0.25.

336 * 0.25 = 84

So, Juan will need 84 pounds of butter to make 336 croissants.

Cost to repave Lewis' street = $194 * 490
Cost to repave Lewis' street = $95,060

Now, to find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's, we need to calculate the cost of repaving Monica's street and then subtract it from the cost of repaving Lewis' street.

Cost to repave Monica's street = Cost per meter * Length of Monica's street
Cost to repave Monica's street = $194 * 150
Cost to repave Monica's street = $29,100

Now, let's find the difference in cost:
Difference in cost = Cost to repave Lewis' street - Cost to repave Monica's street

"To find the total cost of John's research, we first need to determine the total number of months his research took. Since it took 10 times longer than the initial 5 months, it took 5 * 10 = 50 months.

The initial 5 months cost $100,000. After that, the funding increased by 50% each month. This means the cost for each of the remaining 45 months (50 - 5 = 45) is 1.5 times the initial cost.

The cost for the first 5 months is $100,000. The cost for the remaining 45 months is 45 * $100,000 * 1.5 = $6,750,000.

The total cost is the sum of the cost for the first 5 months and the cost for the remaining 45 months: $100,000 + $6,750,000 = $6,850,000.

"To find the total cost of the physical therapy, we need to calculate the total number of hours John attended therapy and then multiply it by the cost per hour.

John went to physical therapy for 6 weeks, and each week he went twice for 2 hours at a time. So, the total number of hours he attended therapy is:
6 weeks * 2 sessions per week * 2 hours per session = 24 hours

The cost per hour is $125. Therefore, the total cost of the physical therapy is:
24 hours * $125 per hour = $3000

The final answer is: $3000"
"To find out how many pieces of gum Jim chews during school, we need to calculate how many 2-hour intervals are in an 8-hour school day. 

8 hours / 2 hours per interval = 4 intervals

Since Jim chews 1 piece of gum per 2-hour interval, he chews 4 pieces of gum during school.

He also chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner, so that's 2 more pieces.

In total, Jim chews 4 (during school) + 2 (on the way home and after dinner) = 6 pieces of gum.

Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

When his sister asks for gum, he gives her half of the remaining gum. Half of 14 is 7.

So, Jim gives his sister 7 pieces of gum, leaving him with 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find Charmaine's age 4 years from now, we first need to determine her current age. Since she will be 16 in 12 years, we subtract 12 from 16 to find her current age.

16 (future age) - 12 (years until future age) = 4 (current age)

Now, we add 4 years to her current age to find her age 4 years from now.

4 (current age) + 4 (years from now) = 8

So, Charmaine will be 8 years old 4 years from now.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach, we need to calculate the total amount spent by each coach and then find the difference.

The baseball coach bought 9 new baseballs for $3 each, so the total amount spent by the baseball coach is 9 x $3 = $27.

The basketball coach bought 8 new basketballs for $14 each, so the total amount spent by the basketball coach is 8 x $14 = $112.

Now, let's find the difference in the amount spent by the basketball coach and the baseball coach: $112 - $27 = $85.

The final answer is: $85"
"To find the total number of flowers that have bloomed, we first need to find the total number of flowers in the garden. Since there are 10 rows with 20 flowers in each row, the total number of flowers is 10 * 20 = 200.

Since only 4/5 of the flowers have bloomed, we can find the number of bloomed flowers by multiplying the total number of flowers by 4/5. 

Number of bloomed flowers = (4/5) * 200
= 0.8 * 200
= 160

The final answer is: 160"
"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we first need to convert her speed from kb/s to Mb/s. Since 1 Mb has 1000 kb, we can convert 20 kb/s to Mb/s by dividing by 1000.

20 kb/s / 1000 = 0.02 Mb/s

Now, we need to find out how many seconds are in an hour. There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour.

To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we multiply her speed in Mb/s by the number of seconds in an hour.

0.02 Mb/s * 3600 s/h = 72 Mb/h

The final answer is: 72"
"To find the total number of cars towed, we need to calculate the number of cars towed in the first three days and the remaining days separately and then add them together.

In the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day. So, the total number of cars towed in the first three days is 3 * 10 = 30.

In the remaining days, there are 7 - 3 = 4 days. On each of these days, the tow truck pulled 10 - 4 = 6 cars. So, the total number of cars towed in the remaining days is 4 * 6 = 24.

Now, we add the total number of cars towed in the first three days and the remaining days: 30 + 24 = 54.

The final answer is: 54"
"To find out how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to calculate the difference between the required height (4 feet) and Adam's current height (40 inches), and then divide that by his growth rate (2 inches per year).

First, let's convert the required height to inches: 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches.

Now, let's calculate the difference between the required height and Adam's current height: 48 inches - 40 inches = 8 inches.

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we can divide the difference by his growth rate to find out how many years it will take for him to reach the required height: 8 inches / 2 inches/year = 4 years.

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how much James made, we first need to calculate the profit from each car. 

The cost price of each car is $25,000. The company paid 30% of this price to acquire the cars, so the cost price for James is 70% of $25,000. 

70% of $25,000 = 0.7 * $25,000 = $17,500

The selling price of each car is $25,000. The profit from each car is the selling price minus the cost price.

Profit from each car = $25,000 - $17,500 = $7,500

Since James sold 10 cars, the total profit is 10 times the profit from each car.

Total profit = 10 * $7,500 = $75,000

James got a 10% commission on the profits. 

Commission = 10% of $75,000 = 0.1 * $75,000 = $7,500

So, James made $7,500."
"To find the number of men who can stay upright, we first need to find the total number of riders who can stay upright. 

Given that 25% of the riders can stay upright, and there are 100 riders, we can calculate the number of riders who can stay upright as follows:

25% of 100 = 0.25 * 100 = 25

Now, we know that 60% of these 25 riders are women. To find the number of women, we can calculate:

60% of 25 = 0.6 * 25 = 15

Since the remaining riders who can stay upright are men, we can find the number of men by subtracting the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:

25 - 15 = 10

Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total price for all three jewels, we first need to find the prices of the gold and silver jewels.

Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, we know that the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of a diamond jewel. 

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * Price of diamond jewel
Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * $2000
Price of gold jewel = $1600

The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold. 

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
Price of silver jewel = $1600 - $400
Price of silver jewel = $1200

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels.

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
Total price = $2000 + $1600 + $1200
Total price = $4800

The final answer is: $4800"
"To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to calculate the number of each type of stamp and add them together.

Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.

He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

To find the total number of stamps, we add the number of each type of stamp together: 16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45.

The final answer is: 45"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the relative speed between Bob and Tom. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract Tom's speed from Bob's speed to get the relative speed.

Relative speed = Bob's speed - Tom's speed
Relative speed = 55 mph - 70 mph
Relative speed = -15 mph

However, since we are dealing with a time problem, we need to consider the absolute value of the relative speed. The negative sign indicates that Tom is actually gaining on Bob, so we take the absolute value.

Absolute relative speed = 15 mph

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed

The distance between Bob and Tom is 75 miles. We want to find the time it takes for Tom to catch up, so we use the absolute relative speed.

Time = Distance / Absolute relative speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob. 

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many fish Tommy caught, we need to first determine how many fish Darren caught. Since Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish, we can calculate Darren's catch by subtracting 6 from Naomi's total.

Darren's catch = Naomi's catch - 6
Darren's catch = 17 - 6
Darren's catch = 11

Now that we know Darren caught 11 fish, we can find out how many Tommy caught by adding 3 to Darren's total.

Tommy's catch = Darren's catch + 3
Tommy's catch = 11 + 3
Tommy's catch = 14

The final answer is: 14"
"To find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to determine the maximum number of classes he can attend without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Let's assume the cost per class is $10. If Manny attends all 10 classes, the total cost would be 10 classes * $10 per class = $100. However, he signed up for classes for $60, so he has a remaining balance of $40.

Since he has a remaining balance of $40, he can miss classes without exceeding the $10 per class limit. To find out how many classes he can miss, we need to divide the remaining balance by the cost per class.

$40 (remaining balance) / $10 (cost per class) = 4 classes

So, Manny can miss 4 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

The final answer is: $4"
"To find the total weekly production, we first need to determine the daily production of Julie and Jewel, and then multiply it by 7 (the number of days in a week).

Jewel processes 50 customers per day. Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, Julie processes 2 * 50 = 100 customers per day.

The combined daily production of Julie and Jewel is 50 (Jewel's production) + 100 (Julie's production) = 150 customers per day.

To find the total weekly production, we multiply the combined daily production by 7: 150 * 7 = 1050.

The final answer is: 1050"
"To find out how many miles Lynn ran, we need to first determine how many miles Reggie ran. We know Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, and Paisley ran 4 miles. So, Reggie ran 5 * 4 = 20 miles.

We also know Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. This means Reggie's distance is Lynn's distance plus 3 miles. So, Lynn's distance can be found by subtracting 3 miles from Reggie's distance. Lynn's distance = Reggie's distance - 3 miles = 20 - 3 = 17 miles.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges, we first need to find the cost of one apple and one orange. 

The cost of 4 apples is $5.20, so the cost of one apple is $5.20 / 4 = $1.30. 

The cost of 3 oranges is $3.30, so the cost of one orange is $3.30 / 3 = $1.10.

Now, we can find the cost of 5 apples: 5 apples * $1.30/apple = $6.50.

Next, we can find the cost of 5 oranges: 5 oranges * $1.10/orange = $5.50.

Finally, we can add the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges to find the total cost: $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To find the volume of the hole, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth. 

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Since it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we can multiply the volume by the time it takes to shovel one cubic foot.

Time = Volume * time per cubic foot
Time = 72 * 3
Time = 216 seconds

Therefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add it to the base price.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade costs $7,500.

The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of the leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of the running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the features and the base price:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"To find out how much Tim will make in a year, we first need to calculate his new monthly salary and the bonus.

His new monthly salary is a 5% raise on his current $20,000 salary. 
5% of $20,000 is 0.05 * $20,000 = $1,000. 
So, his new monthly salary is $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000.

The bonus is half a month's salary, which is $21,000 / 2 = $10,500.

Now, let's calculate his total monthly income. 
His new monthly salary is $21,000 and the bonus is $10,500. 
So, his total monthly income is $21,000 + $10,500 = $31,500.

To find out how much he will make in a year, we multiply his total monthly income by 12. 
$31,500 * 12 = $378,000.

"To find the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley, we need to calculate the distance each of them biked and then add them together.

Alisa biked at 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours. To find the distance she biked, we multiply her speed by the time: 
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 12 miles/hour * 4.5 hours
Distance = 54 miles

Stanley biked at 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours. To find the distance he biked, we multiply his speed by the time:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour * 2.5 hours
Distance = 25 miles

Now, we add the distances biked by Alisa and Stanley to find the total distance:
Total Distance = Distance biked by Alisa + Distance biked by Stanley
Total Distance = 54 miles + 25 miles
Total Distance = 79 miles

"To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost for each day and then subtract the two amounts.

On the first day, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, but she got a $2 discount. So, the total cost for the first day is:
20 pomegranates * $20 = $400
Discount: $2
Total cost for the first day = $400 - $2 = $398

On the second day, the price per pomegranate is $30, and there's a 10% discount on the total cost. So, the total cost for the second day is:
20 pomegranates * $30 = $600
Discount: 10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
Total cost for the second day = $600 - $60 = $540

Now, let's find the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days:

"Let's break down the information given. 

First, we know it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice. Since it took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, it took her 30 + 20 = 50 minutes to cook pork.

We are also told that beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. Half of 80 minutes is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

Now, we have the cooking times for all three foods: rice (30 minutes), pork (50 minutes), and beans (40 minutes). To find the total cooking time, we add these times together: 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes.

"Let's denote the number of sheep as S and the number of geese as G. Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, we can set up the following equation based on the total number of legs:

4S + 2G = 70

We are also given that the total number of animal heads is 20. Since each sheep and goose has one head, we can set up another equation:

S + G = 20

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve for S by first solving the second equation for G:

G = 20 - S

Substituting this expression for G into the first equation, we get:

4S + 2(20 - S) = 70

Expanding and simplifying the equation, we get:

4S + 40 - 2S = 70

Combine like terms:

2S + 40 = 70

Subtract 40 from both sides:

2S = 30

Divide both sides by 2:

S = 15

Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day and wants a week's worth, which is 7 days. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, but his favorite brand is sold out, so he buys the more expensive brand. The more expensive brand costs 20% more than the normal brand. 

20% of $5 is 0.2 * $5 = $1. So, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

The total cost of the coffee is 7 pounds * $6 per pound = $42.

He also buys a donut for $2. 

The total cost is $42 (coffee) + $2 (donut) = $44.

The final answer is: $44"
"To find the cost of the apple pie, we need to subtract the total cost of the items Gus bought from the total amount he spent. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Gus bought:
2 bags of chips for $2.00 each = 2 x $2.00 = $4.00
Adding the cost of the bucket of fried chicken: $4.00 + $8.00 = $12.00
Adding the cost of the bottle of soda: $12.00 + $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's subtract the total cost of the items from the total amount Gus spent:
$20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

The apple pie cost $7.00."

Total newspapers delivered = 600
Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers delivered - (Newspapers delivered to District A + Newspapers delivered to District C)
= 600 - (198 + 209)
= 600 - 407
= 193

"To find out how many recipes John learns, we need to calculate the total class time and then divide it by the time it takes to learn a new recipe.

The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time, so the total class time per week is 4 * 2 = 8 hours.

Since the class lasts for 6 weeks, the total class time is 8 hours/week * 6 weeks = 48 hours.

John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time. To find out how many recipes he learns, we need to divide the total class time by 1.5 hours.

Total recipes learned = Total class time / Time to learn a new recipe
= 48 hours / 1.5 hours
= 32

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the number of math teachers, we first need to find the number of history teachers and then subtract that from the total number of teachers. 

60% of 150 teachers are history teachers. To find 60% of 150, we multiply 150 by 0.6. 

150 * 0.6 = 90

So, there are 90 history teachers. To find the number of math teachers, we subtract the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers.

150 - 90 = 60

There are 60 math teachers. 

Each math teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. To find the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day, we multiply the number of math teachers by the number of hours they sleep per day.

60 * 6 = 360

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Aurelia has $120.
2. Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia. 
   So, Kassidy's money = (3/4) * 120 = 90 dollars.
3. Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy. 
   So, Rayna's money = 90 + 60 = 150 dollars.

Now, let's find the total money they have together: 
Total money = Aurelia's money + Kassidy's money + Rayna's money
Total money = 120 + 90 + 150
Total money = 360 dollars

If they decide to share this money equally among themselves, each person will get:
Money per person = Total money / 3
Money per person = 360 / 3
Money per person = 120 dollars

The final answer is: $120"

"Let's break down the information given. Christina recorded her mood every day for thirty days. The first eight days were good, the next eight days were bad, and the next eight days were neutral. This accounts for 8 + 8 + 8 = 24 days.

Since there are 30 days in total, the remaining days are 30 - 24 = 6 days.

We are also given that the next three days were good, neutral, and good. This means that out of the remaining 6 days, 2 are good. 

So, the total number of good days in the month is the sum of the good days in the first 8 days and the 2 good days in the last 3 days. The total number of good days is 8 + 2 = 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. We know that Janey has 21 books and that she has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. 

Let's represent the number of books Sally has as 'x'. According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has, so we can write an equation to represent this relationship:

Janey's books = 2 * Sally's books + 3
21 = 2x + 3

Now, we need to solve for 'x' to find out how many books Sally has. To do this, we'll subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

21 - 3 = 2x + 3 - 3
18 = 2x

Next, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 2 to isolate 'x':

18 / 2 = 2x / 2
9 = x

So, Sally has 9 books. 

9"
"To find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches, we need to first convert the initial height from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so we multiply 20 feet by 12 inches per foot.

20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now, we know the bamboo grows 30 inches a day and it's currently 240 inches tall. To find out how many days it will take to reach 600 inches, we subtract the current height from the target height and divide by the daily growth rate.

600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Now, we divide the remaining height by the daily growth rate.

360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

So, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to reach 600 inches.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs. This means each dog has 1 toy. When 8 more dogs arrive, James needs 8 more toys to bring the total to 12 dogs with 1 toy each. So, he buys 8 more toys.

Now, there are 12 dogs, and James goes back to find that there are twice as many more dogs, which means there are 2 * 8 = 16 more dogs. This makes the total number of dogs 12 + 16 = 28. Since each dog needs 1 toy, James needs 28 more toys.

However, when James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs 3 toys. This means he needs 28 - 3 = 25 more toys.

Initially, James had 4 toys. He bought 8 more toys, then 28 more toys, and finally, he needs 25 more toys. So, the total number of toys he needs is 4 + 8 + 28 + 25 = 65.

The final answer is: 65"
"To find out how much money Skyler invested, we first need to calculate the amount invested by Dylan and Frances.

Dylan's investment is 2/5 of the total amount, which is 2/5 * $1200 = $480.

The remaining amount after Dylan's investment is $1200 - $480 = $720.

Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount, which is 2/3 * $720 = $480.

The remaining amount after Frances' investment is $720 - $480 = $240.

So, Skyler's investment is $240.

The final answer is: $240"
"To find out how many signatures the sisters need to collect, we first need to determine how many signatures they currently have in total. Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44 signatures. 

Total signatures currently = 20 (Carol's signatures) + 44 (Jennifer's signatures) = 64 signatures.

Since they want to reach a total of 100 signatures by the end of the summer, we need to find out how many signatures they need to collect in the remaining three weeks.

Signatures needed = Total signatures required - Total signatures currently collected
= 100 - 64
= 36

So, the sisters need to collect 36 signatures in the remaining three weeks to reach their goal.

"To find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes, we need to determine the ratio of potatoes to hash browns. 

Given that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, we can calculate the ratio as follows: 

36 hash browns / 6 potatoes = 6 hash browns per potato

Now, we can multiply this ratio by the total number of potatoes to find the total number of hash browns that can be made:

6 hash browns per potato * 96 potatoes = 576 hash browns

Therefore, 96 potatoes can make 576 hash browns.

576"
"To find out how much the elevator will exceed its maximum load, we first need to calculate the total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults. 

Jack's weight is not given, but we know that an adult weighs an average of 80 kg. Since there are 8 other adults, their total weight is 8 * 80 = 640 kg. 

We don't know Jack's weight, but we can represent it as 'x'. The total weight of Jack and the 8 adults is x + 640 kg.

The maximum load of the elevator is 700 kg. To find out how much they will exceed the maximum load, we need to subtract the maximum load from the total weight of Jack and the 8 adults.

Let's represent the excess weight as 'e'. The equation for the excess weight is e = (x + 640) - 700.

However, we are not given Jack's weight, so we cannot find a numerical answer."
"To find the total number of cookies, we need to determine the number of cookies each person has. 

We know Katarina has 68 cookies. 

Since Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.

Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so the Cookie Monster has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.

Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Now, we can find the total number of cookies by adding the number of cookies each person has: 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298.

The final answer is: 298"
"To find the original length of the dress, we need to consider the two changes made to the dress. 

First, the dress is extended by 50% of its original length. If we let the original length be 'x', then the extended length would be x + 0.5x = 1.5x.

Next, 20cm is added to the bottom of the dress. So, the final length is 1.5x + 20.

We are given that the final length is 140cm. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

1.5x + 20 = 140

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. Subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

1.5x = 120

Now, divide both sides by 1.5:

x = 80

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes to mow half the lawn in each mode and then add them together.

First, let's find the time it takes to mow half the lawn in turtle mode. Since it takes 1 hour to mow the entire lawn in turtle mode, it will take 1/2 hour or 30 minutes to mow half the lawn in turtle mode.

Next, let's find the time it takes to mow half the lawn in rabbit mode. Since it takes 40 minutes to mow the entire lawn in rabbit mode, it will take 40/2 = 20 minutes to mow half the lawn in rabbit mode.

Now, we add the time it takes to mow half the lawn in each mode: 30 minutes (turtle mode) + 20 minutes (rabbit mode) = 50 minutes.

"To find out how many cookies are in the box, we first need to determine the total number of cookies baked by both Greta and Celinda. 

Greta bakes 30 cookies. 
Celinda bakes twice as many as Greta, so she bakes 2 * 30 = 60 cookies.

The total number of cookies baked is 30 (Greta's cookies) + 60 (Celinda's cookies) = 90 cookies.

After eating 10 cookies, the number of cookies left is 90 - 10 = 80 cookies.

So, there are 80 cookies in the box.

"Let's denote the age of the younger twin as 'x'. Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, the age of the older twin is 'x + 7'. The age of the other triplet is 'x - 7' (since the difference between the twin and the triplet is 7 years).

The combined ages of the twins and the triplets are 44. We can write the equation as: x + (x + 7) + (x - 7) = 44

Combine like terms: 3x = 44

Divide both sides by 3: x = 44 / 3
x = 14.67

Since age cannot be a fraction, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we need to find the age of one of the twins, which is x + 7. 

One of the twins is 14.67 + 7 = 21.67. However, since age cannot be a fraction, we'll round down to the nearest whole number."
"To find out how many minutes John has to nap, we first need to calculate the total time he spends on his homework. 

John has 20 minutes of math homework, 40 minutes of reading homework, and 20 minutes of history homework. 

Total homework time = 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes

John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we need to convert 3 hours to minutes.

3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Now, we subtract the total homework time from the total available time to find out how many minutes John has to nap.

Time available for nap = 180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes

So, John has 100 minutes to nap. 

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we first need to find the cost of one candy. 

We know that Manolo bought 5 lollipops and 4 candies for $3.20. The cost of 5 lollipops is 5 * $0.40 = $2. 

Now, we subtract the cost of 5 lollipops from the total cost to find the cost of 4 candies: $3.20 - $2 = $1.20. 

The cost of one candy is $1.20 / 4 = $0.30.

Now, we can find the total cost of 10 lollipops: 10 * $0.40 = $4.

The total cost of 10 candies is 10 * $0.30 = $3.

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $4 + $3 = $7.

"To find out how many coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years, we first need to calculate their monthly savings and then their total savings over 10 years.

Rong saves 20 coins every month. 

Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, so we need to find 2/5 of 20, which is (2/5) * 20 = 8. Then, we add this to Rong's savings to get Neil's monthly savings: 20 + 8 = 28 coins.

Now, let's calculate their total savings over 10 years. There are 12 months in a year, so 10 years will have 10 * 12 = 120 months.

Rong's total savings = 20 * 120 = 2400 coins
Neil's total savings = 28 * 120 = 3360 coins

"To find the total bill, we first need to calculate the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check. The cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40. 

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, which means the remaining 40% is the cost of the vaccines. So, the cost of the vaccines is 40% of the total bill. Let's call the total bill 'x'. Then, 40% of x is $40. 

We can write this as an equation: 0.4x = 40. To find x, we divide both sides by 0.4: x = 40 / 0.4 = 100. 

So, the total bill is $100. The heartworm check is 60% of $100, which is 0.6 * 100 = $60. 

The total cost is $100 (vaccines and heartworm check) + $60 (heartworm check) = $160. 

John brought $125 with him. To find out how much he leaves with, we subtract the total cost from the amount he brought: $125 - $160 = -$35. However, since we can't leave with a negative amount, this means John doesn't have enough money to pay the total bill.

Final answer: $-35"
"To find the price of the crate, we first need to determine the cost of each fruit. 

Since one banana costs twice as much as an apple, and one apple costs $0.5, a banana costs 2 * $0.5 = $1.

Oranges cost three times as much as a banana, so the cost of one orange is 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, we know the cost of each fruit: 
- 1 banana = $1
- 1 apple = $0.5
- 1 orange = $3

The crate contains 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges. 

The total cost of the bananas in the crate is 5 * $1 = $5.
The total cost of the apples in the crate is 12 * $0.5 = $6.
The total cost of the oranges in the crate is 7 * $3 = $21.

To find the total cost of the crate, we add the cost of all the fruits together: $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

The price for such a crate of fruit is $32."
"To find the total number of square feet in Brittany's comforter, we need to calculate the total number of squares and multiply it by the area of each square, which is 1 square foot.

We know that there are 14 red squares. 
There are 4 more blue squares than red squares, so the number of blue squares is 14 + 4 = 18.
There are 6 more green squares than blue squares, so the number of green squares is 18 + 6 = 24.
There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so the number of white squares is 24 - 12 = 12.

Now, let's add up the total number of squares: 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68 squares.

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

The final answer is: 68"
"To find out how many chairs Mia needs, we first need to determine the total number of chairs she has. Since there are 8 high chairs and the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs, we can calculate the number of regular chairs by multiplying 8 by 5.

8 high chairs * 5 = 40 regular chairs

Now, we add the number of high chairs and regular chairs to find the total number of chairs.

8 high chairs + 40 regular chairs = 48 chairs

Since there will be 42 adults and 15 babies attending the function, we need to find the total number of chairs required. Babies will use high chairs, so we add the number of adults and babies.

42 adults + 15 babies = 57 people

Since each person needs a chair, we need 57 chairs in total. To find out how many more chairs Mia needs, we subtract the total number of chairs she has from the total number of chairs required.

57 chairs required - 48 chairs available = 9 chairs

Therefore, Mia needs 9 more chairs.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Adam has 50 points.
2. Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. 
   To find Betty's points, we need to calculate 30% of Adam's points and add it to Adam's points.
   30% of 50 = 0.3 * 50 = 15
   Betty's points = Adam's points + 15 = 50 + 15 = 65
3. Tom has 30 points less than Betty. 
   Tom's points = Betty's points - 30 = 65 - 30 = 35
4. Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom.
   Marta's points = 3 * Tom's points = 3 * 35 = 105

Now, let's calculate the total points collected by the class:
Total points = Adam's points + Betty's points + Tom's points + Marta's points
Total points = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255

Since the minimum threshold to go on the trip is 400 points, the class is missing:
Points missing = Minimum threshold - Total points
Points missing = 400 - 255
Points missing = 145

"To find out how much money Greta has left to spend, we first need to calculate the amount she puts into her retirement account and her car payment.

Greta's paycheck is $2400.00. She puts 50% of her pay into her retirement account. 
50% of $2400.00 is 0.5 * $2400.00 = $1200.00.

She then uses 20% of her paycheck to make her monthly car payment.
20% of $2400.00 is 0.2 * $2400.00 = $480.00.

Now, let's subtract the amount she put into her retirement account and her car payment from her total paycheck.
$2400.00 - $1200.00 - $480.00 = $720.00.

"To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we first need to find out how many fireworks will be set off in total and then calculate 40% of that number.

The city is setting off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks set off by the city is 15 * 20 = 300.

Hannah will also set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each in her backyard, so the total number of fireworks she will set off is 3 * 5 = 15.

The total number of fireworks set off is 300 (city) + 15 (Hannah's backyard) = 315.

Now, we need to find 40% of 315. To do this, we multiply 315 by 0.4 (which is the decimal form of 40%).

0.4 * 315 = 126.

So, Hannah will see 126 fireworks in total.

Aiden and his 12 friends make 13 people. When they meet up with 7 more friends, the total number of people becomes 13 + 7 = 20.

Since each seat can hold one person, two drinks, and three snacks, the total number of drinks and snacks bought will be the same as the total number of people, which is 20.

The total number of drinks and snacks is 20. Each drink and snack costs $2. So, the total cost of drinks and snacks is 20 * 2 = 40.

The final answer is: $40"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel.
2. Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so Gordy's truck can haul 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds of gravel.
3. The combined capacity of all three trucks is 11,600 pounds.

To find the capacity of Gary's truck, we need to subtract the combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity of all three trucks.

Combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks = 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds
Capacity of Gary's truck = Total capacity - Combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks
= 11,600 - 8,800
= 2,800 pounds

The final answer is: 2800"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many dumplings each male ate. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, and each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

There are 8 males in the group, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32.

There are 6 females in the group, and each female ate 3 dumplings, so the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.

The total number of dumplings eaten by both males and females is 32 + 18 = 50.

Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is equal to the total number of dumplings eaten by the group, which is 50.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how much money Gerald had initially, we need to determine the total parts in the ratio and Gerald's share. The ratio is 3:2, so the total parts are 3 + 2 = 5.

Gerald's share is 3 out of 5 parts, so we can find his initial amount by multiplying the total amount ($100) by his share (3/5).

Gerald's initial amount = (3/5) * $100 = $60

Now, we know Gerald spent $10 on a book. To find out how much he has left, we subtract the amount spent from his initial amount.

Gerald's remaining amount = $60 - $10 = $50

The final answer is: $50"
"To find the speed of the turtle, we need to divide the speed of the cat by 5, since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle. 

Speed of the cat = 15 feet/second
Speed of the turtle = Speed of the cat / 5
Speed of the turtle = 15 / 5
Speed of the turtle = 3 feet/second

Now, we can find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds by multiplying its speed by the time.

Distance = Speed of the turtle * Time
Distance = 3 feet/second * 40 seconds
Distance = 120 feet

The final answer is: 120"
"To find out how many hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we need to first determine how much they need to raise per hour to reach their goal. 

The total amount they need to raise is $6300, and they have already raised $2100 in 3 hours. 

The amount they need to raise in total is $6300 - $2100 = $4200.

Since they need to raise $4200 in total and they have already raised $2100 in 3 hours, we can find the amount they need to raise per hour by dividing the remaining amount by the number of hours they have already worked.

$4200 / 3 hours = $1400 per hour.

Now, we can find the total number of hours they need to fundraise by dividing the total amount they need to raise by the amount they need to raise per hour.

Total hours = Total amount / Amount per hour
Total hours = $4200 / $1400
Total hours = 3 hours

However, this is the number of hours they need to raise the remaining amount. Since they have already worked for 3 hours, we need to add this to the total hours.

Total hours = 3 hours (already worked) + 3 hours (remaining)
Total hours = 6 hours

So, the firefighters need to fundraise for a total of 6 hours to reach their goal.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we first need to find the percentage of water used by the city and then subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes.

The city uses 40% of the river's water. 

80% of the water used by the city is used for industrial purposes, so the percentage of water used for industrial purposes is 40% * 80% = 0.4 * 0.8 = 0.32 or 32%.

To find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes from the total percentage used by the city: 40% - 32% = 0.4 - 0.32 = 0.08 or 8%.

"To find the total number of quarts made in 48 hours, we need to calculate the production rate of each type of ice cream and then add them together.

The factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours. To find the production rate, we divide the total quarts by the time:

100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts per hour (chocolate)

The factory makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours. To find the production rate, we divide the total quarts by the time:

50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts per hour (vanilla)

Now, we need to find the total production in 48 hours for each type of ice cream:

Chocolate: 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts
Vanilla: 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts

Adding the total production of both types of ice cream:

2400 quarts (chocolate) + 600 quarts (vanilla) = 3000 quarts

The final answer is: 3000"
"To find Marcus' total bill, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items he ordered and then apply the 10% discount.

First, let's calculate the total cost of each type of item:

- 5 croissants at $3.00 apiece: 5 x $3.00 = $15.00
- 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each: 4 x $2.50 = $10.00
- 3 mini quiches at $4.00 apiece: 3 x $4.00 = $12.00
- 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 apiece: 13 x $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
$15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Since Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him 10% off his purchase, we need to calculate the discount amount:
10% of $50.00 = 0.10 x $50.00 = $5.00

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total cost:
$50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

The final answer is: $45.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many scoops Erin can buy with her $6.00. Since each scoop costs $1.50, we can divide the total amount of money Erin has by the cost of each scoop.

$6.00 ÷ $1.50 = 4

This means Erin can buy 4 scoops of ice cream. However, the deal is buy 2 scoops get 1 free, so we need to consider this in our calculation.

If Erin buys 2 scoops, she will get 1 free, which is a total of 3 scoops. Since she has $6.00, she can buy 2 sets of 3 scoops (2 scoops + 1 free).

2 sets of 3 scoops = 6 scoops

So, Erin should buy 6 scoops of ice cream.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how much more candy Amy has after two weeks, we need to calculate the total amount of candy each of them eats in two weeks and then subtract the difference from Amy's initial amount.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces.

Initially, both Ginger and Amy had 100 pieces of candy. After two weeks, Ginger has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces left, and Amy has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces left.

The difference in the amount of candy Amy has compared to Ginger is 58 - 44 = 14.

"To find out how much James saved, we first need to calculate the total cost of picking the blueberries and then compare it to the cost of buying them at the store.

The cost of picking blueberries is $20 (initial cost) + $1.5 per pound * 30 pounds (total weight picked). 

Cost of picking = $20 + $1.5 * 30
Cost of picking = $20 + $45
Cost of picking = $65

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying the blueberries at the store. The cost is $2.5 per pound * 30 pounds.

Cost at store = $2.5 * 30
Cost at store = $75

To find out how much James saved, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost at the store.

Amount saved = Cost at store - Cost of picking
Amount saved = $75 - $65
Amount saved = $10

"To find the total amount of rice Goldy gave to her cousin and brother, we need to first find out how many sacks she gave away in total. 

Goldy bought 20 sacks of rice and gave 3 sacks to her cousin and 4 sacks to her brother. So, the total number of sacks she gave away is 3 + 4 = 7 sacks.

Since each sack contains 25 kilograms of rice, we can find the total amount of rice given away by multiplying the number of sacks given away by the weight of each sack. 

Total rice given away = 7 sacks * 25 kg/sack = 175 kg.

Therefore, Goldy gave 175 kilograms of rice to her cousin and brother.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that there are 6 people in total (Bryce and his 5 friends). Each pizza has 12 slices, and there are a total of 6 people, so the total number of slices is 6 * 12 = 72.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 5 people who ate 2/3 of their pizzas (Bryce and 2 friends), we can calculate the total number of slices they ate as follows:

(2/3) * (5 * 12) = (2/3) * 60 = 40

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 people who ate ¾ of their pizzas, we can calculate the total number of slices they ate as follows:

(3/4) * (2 * 12) = (3/4) * 24 = 18

Now, let's add the total number of slices eaten by all the friends:

40 + 18 = 58

To find the number of slices left, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices:

72 - 58 = 14

So, there are 14 slices of pizza left.

"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to first convert the length of Topher's shoe into inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 8 feet into inches by multiplying 8 by 12, which equals 96 inches. Adding the 4 inches to this gives us a total of 100 inches for the length of one of Topher's shoes.

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's represent the length of one of Bobby's shoes as 'x'. We can write the equation as 9x + 10 = 100.

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us 9x = 90. Now, we can divide both sides by 9 to find the value of 'x'. 

x = 90 / 9
x = 10

At 8:00, 2/5 of 5000 people had voted by midday. 
2/5 * 5000 = 2000 people voted by midday.

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. 
The remaining people after midday are 5000 - 2000 = 3000.
2/3 * 3000 = 2000 people voted by 16:00.

The number of people who voted by 16:00 is the sum of those who voted by midday and those who voted between midday and 16:00.
2000 (voted by midday) + 2000 (voted between midday and 16:00) = 4000 people voted by 16:00.

The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is the total number of people minus the number of people who voted by 16:00.

Now, we can find the number of students who like to play video games by subtracting the number of students who like to play music from the number of students who like to play video games or music.

Number of students who like to play video games = 35 - 10 = 25

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the number of birds that were scared away, we need to calculate 1/3 of 12. 

1/3 of 12 is 12 / 3 = 4.

So, Jeremy scared away 4 birds. 

Now, we subtract 4 from the initial number of birds: 12 - 4 = 8.

Then, 20 more birds joined the fearless birds. 

So, the total number of birds now is 8 + 20 = 28.

The final answer is: 28"
"To find the number of boys in each class, we first need to find the total number of girls in both classes. Since 40% of the students in each class are girls, and there are 80 students in total, we can set up an equation to find the number of students in each class.

Let x be the number of students in each class. Then, 2x = 80 (since there are two classes with the same number of students).

Solving for x, we get x = 80 / 2 = 40.

Now that we know there are 40 students in each class, we can find the number of girls in each class. 40% of 40 is 0.4 * 40 = 16 girls in each class.

Since there are 40 students in each class and 16 are girls, the number of boys in each class is 40 - 16 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Mara had 2 slices of cake on the plate. 

1. Mara added 3 slices to the plate, so now she has 2 + 3 = 5 slices.
2. Mara tripled the number of slices she currently has, so she now has 5 * 3 = 15 slices.
3. Mara ate 2 slices, so she now has 15 - 2 = 13 slices.
4. Her friend stole 5 slices off her plate, so she now has 13 - 5 = 8 slices.

The final number of cake slices remaining on the plate is 8."
"To find out how many animals Melissa will groom each day, we need to calculate the total number of animals and then divide it by the number of days in a week, which is 7.

Total number of animals = 8 (dogs) + 5 (cats) + 3 (birds) + 12 (horses) = 28

Now, let's divide the total number of animals by the number of days in a week:
28 / 7 = 4

So, Melissa will groom 4 animals each day of the week.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total profit Mark made, we first need to calculate the total cost of the packs and the total value of the cards he got.

The cost of 3 packs is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

The total value of the two high-value cards is $4000 + $1000 = $5000.

The total value of the 30 cards worth $50 each is 30 * $50 = $1500.

The total value of all the cards is $5000 + $1500 = $6500.

The total value of the cards is greater than the cost of the packs, so Mark made a profit. The profit is the difference between the total value of the cards and the cost of the packs: $6500 - $5400 = $1100.

The final answer is: $1100"
"To find the total cost for each amusement park, we need to calculate the cost for adults and children separately and then add them together.

For the first amusement park:
- Cost for adults: 2 adults * $26 = $52
- Cost for children: 2 children * $12 = $24
- Total cost for the first amusement park: $52 + $24 = $76

For the second amusement park:
- Cost for adults: 2 adults * $14 = $28
- Cost for children: 2 children * $10 = $20
- Total cost for the second amusement park: $28 + $20 = $48

Now, let's find the difference in cost between the two amusement parks:
Difference in cost = Total cost of the first amusement park - Total cost of the second amusement park
= $76 - $48
= $28

The family will be able to save $28 if they choose the second amusement park over the first."
"To find out how much money the tomato vendor saves a week, we first need to calculate the daily savings. 

The vendor used to buy 500 tomatoes at $.5 each, so his daily cost was 500 * $.5 = $250.

With the new vendor, he buys the same 500 tomatoes at $.4 each, so his new daily cost is 500 * $.4 = $200.

The daily savings is the difference between the old cost and the new cost: $250 - $200 = $50.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the weekly savings is the daily savings multiplied by 7: $50 * 7 = $350.

The final answer is: $350"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that Sean has 56 marbles. Since Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, we can find the number of marbles Cal has by multiplying Sean's marbles by 2.

Cal's marbles = 2 * Sean's marbles
Cal's marbles = 2 * 56
Cal's marbles = 112

We also know that Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. So, we can find the number of marbles Carl has by multiplying Sean's marbles by 4.

Carl's marbles = 4 * Sean's marbles
Carl's marbles = 4 * 56
Carl's marbles = 224

Now, we need to find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined. We can do this by adding the number of marbles Carl and Cal have.

Total marbles = Carl's marbles + Cal's marbles
Total marbles = 224 + 112
Total marbles = 336

The final answer is: 336"
"To find out how many groups are needed, we first need to determine the number of students per group. Since there are 54 students and they are to be separated into 6 groups of equal size, we divide 54 by 6.

54 ÷ 6 = 9

So, each group should have 9 students. However, the activity requires 12 groups. To find out how many students are needed in total for 12 groups, we multiply 9 by 12.

9 * 12 = 108

Since we already have 54 students, we need to find out how many more students are needed to make up the 108 students required for 12 groups.

108 - 54 = 54

So, 54 more students are needed to form the required 12 groups.

The final answer is: 54"
"To find the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the number of chairs rented in a week and then multiply it by 8 (2 months * 4 weeks/month).

First, let's calculate the number of chairs rented in a week. 

There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days in a week. 
- Weekdays: 5 days * 60 chairs/day = 300 chairs
- Weekends: 2 days * 100 chairs/day = 200 chairs
- Total chairs rented in a week: 300 + 200 = 500 chairs

Now, let's calculate the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months:

The final answer is: 4000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, Gunther had 48 bananas.

Arnold stole half of the bananas, so the number of bananas left is 48 / 2 = 24.

The next day, Gunther added 25 bananas, so the total number of bananas is 24 + 25 = 49.

Later that evening, Arnold stole 12 bananas, so the number of bananas left is 49 - 12 = 37.

On the third day, Gunther added 6 bananas, so the total number of bananas is 37 + 6 = 43.

Therefore, when Gunther began counting bananas, he found 43 bananas in the pile.

The final answer is: 43"
"To find out how much each roommate will pay per year, we first need to find out the total cost of electricity per year. Since the electricity bill is $100 per month, we multiply this by 12 to get the yearly cost.

Yearly electricity cost = $100/month * 12 months/year = $1200/year

Since there are 4 roommates, we divide the yearly cost by 4 to find out each roommate's share.

Each roommate's share = $1200/year / 4 roommates = $300/year

The final answer is: $300"
"To find out how many glasses and plates Jeff has now, we need to first calculate the total number of glasses and plates he initially sent. 

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, Jeff initially sent 8 dozen glasses, which is 8 * 12 = 96 glasses, and 4 dozen plates, which is 4 * 12 = 48 plates.

When they were returned, 10 glasses and 6 plates were broken. To find out how many glasses and plates Jeff has now, we need to subtract the broken items from the initial total.

Glasses: 96 - 10 = 86
Plates: 48 - 6 = 42

So, Jeff has 86 glasses and 42 plates now.

The final answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, Lorraine has 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

First, she trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers. 
Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons from trading 27 small stickers.

Now, she has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

Next, she trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers. 
Since each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons, she gets 20 large buttons from trading 20 large stickers.

Now, she has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

She trades the rest of her large stickers (20) for small buttons. 
Since each large sticker is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons from trading 20 large stickers.

Now, let's calculate the total number of buttons she has. 
She has 27 small buttons from trading small stickers, 20 large buttons from trading large stickers, and 60 small buttons from trading large stickers. 
So, the total number of buttons she has is 27 + 20 + 60 = 107 buttons.

"Let's break down the information given. We know that the total number of votes is 33, and the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it. 

Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as 'x'. Then, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 2x.

Since the total number of votes is 33, we can set up the equation: x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms: 3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3: x = 11

Now that we know the number of votes against the new regulation is 11, we can find the number of votes in favor of the new regulation by multiplying 11 by 2.

The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 2 * 11 = 22.

Number of playlists = 20
Total number of songs = Number of songs in one playlist * Number of playlists
Total number of songs = 300 * 20
Total number of songs = 6000

Since each song is 10 hours long, we can find the total number of hours by multiplying the total number of songs by the length of each song.

Total number of hours = Total number of songs * Length of each song
Total number of hours = 6000 * 10
Total number of hours = 60000

"To find the total number of puppies Jana has, we first need to determine the total number of Pomeranians. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls and there are 6 Pomeranian girls, we can set up the equation:

1/3 * Total Pomeranians = 6

To find the total number of Pomeranians, we can multiply both sides by 3:

Total Pomeranians = 6 * 3
Total Pomeranians = 18

Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can set up the equation:

2/3 * Total Puppies = Total Pomeranians
2/3 * Total Puppies = 18

To find the total number of puppies, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

Total Puppies = 18 * (3/2)
Total Puppies = 27

"Let's break down the information given. 

Let's denote the number of cases of shingles the second house needs as 'x'. Since the first house needs 1/2 of what the second house needs, the first house needs x/2 cases of shingles. 

The third house needs double the first house, so it needs 2 * (x/2) = x cases of shingles.

We know that the total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. So, we can set up the equation: x + x/2 + x = 250.

To solve for x, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 2x + x + 2x = 500.

Combine like terms: 5x = 500.

Now, divide both sides by 5: x = 100.

Since the third house needs x cases of shingles, the third house needs 100 cases of shingles.

"To find the total time Tatiana has available for soccer, video games, and reading, we need to add the hours she has on Saturday and Sunday. 

Total time available = 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

She reads for 3 hours, so the remaining time for soccer and video games is:
Remaining time = Total time available - Time spent reading
Remaining time = 12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours

She plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time:
Time spent playing video games = 1/3 * 9 hours = 3 hours

Now, we can find the time spent playing soccer:
Time spent playing soccer = Remaining time - Time spent playing video games
Time spent playing soccer = 9 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours

To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we need to divide the time spent playing soccer by the total time available and multiply by 100:

"To find the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection, we need to calculate the cost of the movies in series, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the remaining movies.

First, let's find the number of movies in series. A third of the movies are in series, so the number of movies in series is 600 / 3 = 200.

The cost of the movies in series is 200 * $6 = $1200.

Next, let's find the number of older movies. 40% of the remaining movies are older movies. The remaining movies are 600 - 200 = 400. 40% of 400 is 0.4 * 400 = 160. So, the number of older movies is 160.

The cost of the older movies is 160 * $5 = $800.

Now, let's find the number of remaining movies. We already know that 200 movies are in series and 160 are older movies. So, the number of remaining movies is 600 - 200 - 160 = 240.

The cost of the remaining movies is 240 * $10 = $2400.

"To find the distance to their vacation spot, we first need to calculate the distance they covered while driving and hiking. 

The Llesis family drove at an average speed of 50 miles per hour for 6 hours. So, the distance covered while driving is speed * time = 50 * 6 = 300 miles.

They hiked at an average speed of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Half of their driving speed is 50 / 2 = 25 miles per hour. So, their hiking speed is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour. They hiked for 1.5 hours, so the distance covered while hiking is speed * time = 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

The total distance to their vacation spot is the sum of the distance covered while driving and hiking, which is 300 + 30 = 330 miles.

"To find the difference in their scores, we need to calculate the points each of them gets from enemies, berries, and the timer.

Let's assume Emma's score from enemies is x. Since Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, Ava's score from enemies will be x + 8.

Emma's score from berries is 3 (since she collects 3 berries). Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, so Ava's score from berries is 3 + 3 = 6.

Now, let's consider the timer. The points from the timer are calculated based on the time left when they finish the level. Let's assume Emma finishes the level in t seconds. Then, Ava finishes the level in t + 4 seconds.

The points from the timer for Emma are 30t, and for Ava are 30(t + 4).

Now, let's write the equation for the total score of each of them:

Emma's total score = x + 3 + 30t
Ava's total score = x + 8 + 6 + 30(t + 4)

Simplifying Ava's total score equation:
Ava's total score = x + 14 + 30t + 120

Now, let's find the difference between their scores:
Difference = Ava's total score - Emma's total score
Difference = (x + 14 + 30t + 120) - (x + 3 + 30t)

"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we first need to determine the total cost of the two pizzas that are already known. Since two pizzas cost 30 dollars each, the total cost of these two pizzas is 2 * 30 = 60 dollars.

Now, we subtract the cost of these two pizzas from the total cost of all four pizzas to find the total cost of the other two pizzas. The total cost of all four pizzas is 64 dollars, so the total cost of the other two pizzas is 64 - 60 = 4 dollars.

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we can find the cost of each pizza by dividing the total cost of the other two pizzas by 2. The cost of each of the other two pizzas is 4 / 2 = 2 dollars.

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Chase and Rider ride their bikes 3 times a day for 5 days, which is a total of 3 * 5 = 15 times.

On the two other days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, which means they ride 2 * 3 = 6 times each day.

So, for these two days, they ride a total of 6 * 2 = 12 times.

Now, let's add the total number of times they ride on the usual days and the extra days: 15 + 12 = 27.

Therefore, Chase and Rider ride their bikes a total of 27 times in a week.

"Let's break down the information given. Initially, Bob had 7 fish in his pond, with 3 being orange and 4 being white. 

Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as 'w' and the number of orange fish he bought as 'o'. 

When Bob added the fish to his pond, he had a total of 7 + w + o fish. The number of orange fish in the pond became 3 + o, and the number of white fish became 4 + w.

We are given that after adding the fish, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish. This can be represented as:

3 + o = 2 * (4 + w)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3 + o = 8 + 2w

Subtracting 3 from both sides:

o = 5 + 2w

We also know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17, which is the sum of the white and orange fish he bought. This can be represented as:

w + o = 17

Substituting the expression for o from the previous equation:

w + (5 + 2w) = 17

Combine like terms:

3w + 5 = 17

Subtract 5 from both sides:

3w = 12

Divide both sides by 3:

w = 4

So, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

The final answer is: 4"
"To calculate the weekly fuel consumption, we need to first calculate the daily fuel consumption. 

The one-way distance between home and office is 5 miles, so the round-trip distance is 5 * 2 = 10 miles. 

Since Andy drives to work from Monday to Friday, he drives 10 miles * 5 days = 50 miles per week.

Given that Andy's car fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, we can calculate the weekly fuel consumption in gallons as follows:

Weekly fuel consumption (gallons) = Total weekly miles / Fuel efficiency (MPG)
= 50 miles / 10 MPG
= 5 gallons

Now, we can calculate the weekly fuel cost by multiplying the weekly fuel consumption by the price of gas per gallon:

Weekly fuel cost = Weekly fuel consumption (gallons) * Price per gallon
= 5 gallons * $3/gallon
= $15

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the total amount of money Carrie spent, we first need to calculate the amount she spent from the quarters and the twenties separately.

Carrie was given 10 twenties, and she spent 3/5 of them. To find 3/5 of 10, we multiply 10 by 3 and then divide by 5.

(10 * 3) / 5 = 30 / 5 = 6 twenties

Since each twenty is worth $20, the amount she spent from the twenties is:
6 * $20 = $120

Carrie was also given 140 quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount she spent from the quarters is:
140 * $0.25 = $35

Now, we add the amount she spent from the twenties and the quarters to find the total amount she paid for lunch:
$120 + $35 = $155

The final answer is: $155"
"To find the total number of fruits, we need to calculate the total number of tomatoes and eggplants separately and then add them together.

"To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we first need to find the total percentage of smart TVs and analog TVs sold. 

One-fourth of the TVs are smart TVs, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 TVs. 
One-eighth of the TVs are analog TVs, which is 1/8 * 40 = 5 TVs.

The total number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold is 10 + 5 = 15 TVs.

Since the rest of the TVs are OLED, we subtract the total number of smart and analog TVs from the total number of TVs sold: 40 - 15 = 25.

So, Samwell sold 25 OLED TVs.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how much money John is missing, we first need to determine how much the school will cover. Since the school is covering half the cost of the trip, we can calculate this as:

Total cost of the trip: $300
School's contribution: $300 / 2 = $150

Now, we know that John has $50 and the school is covering $150. To find out how much John is missing, we subtract the amount he has from the total amount he needs to cover:

Amount John needs to cover: $300 - $150 (school's contribution) = $150
Amount John has: $50
Amount John is missing: $150 - $50 = $100

The final answer is: $100"
"To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we first need to determine the temperature at night. Since it's 33 degrees colder during the night, we subtract 33 from the day's temperature.

Night temperature = Day temperature - 33
Night temperature = 45 - 33
Night temperature = 12 degrees

Since the pipes will freeze at 32 degrees, we need to find out how many degrees the temperature needs to be raised to prevent freezing. 

Temperature to be raised = Night temperature - Freezing temperature
Temperature to be raised = 12 - 32
Temperature to be raised = -20 degrees

However, since we can't burn a negative number of logs, we need to find the difference between the current temperature and the freezing temperature.

Temperature difference = Freezing temperature - Night temperature
Temperature difference = 32 - 12
Temperature difference = 20 degrees

Now, we can find out how many logs Carson needs to burn to raise the temperature by 20 degrees.

Number of logs = Temperature difference / Temperature per log
Number of logs = 20 / 5
Number of logs = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total number of seashells brought back, we first need to determine the number of groups formed and then calculate the number of groups that brought back seashells.

Since 90 people were split into 9-person groups, we can find the total number of groups by dividing 90 by 9.

Total number of groups = 90 / 9 = 10

Now, we know that 3/5 of the groups brought back seashells. To find the number of groups that brought back seashells, we multiply the total number of groups by 3/5.

Number of groups with seashells = 10 * (3/5) = 6

Each group that brought back seashells had 2 seashells. To find the total number of seashells, we multiply the number of groups with seashells by 2.

Total seashells = 6 * 2 = 12

"To find the number of people on the train after the two stops, we need to calculate the changes at each stop and then add or subtract the number of people accordingly.

Initially, there are 172 people on the train.

At the first stop, 47 people get off, so we subtract 47 from 172:
172 - 47 = 125

Then, 13 people get on the train, so we add 13 to 125:
125 + 13 = 138

At the next stop, 38 people get off, so we subtract 38 from 138:
138 - 38 = 100

Therefore, there are 100 people on the train.

"To find out how much money Mike will have left over, we first need to calculate the discounted price of the jeans. 

The original price of the jeans is $40, and they are 25% off. To find the discount amount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage (25% or 0.25).

Discount = Original Price * Discount Percentage
Discount = $40 * 0.25
Discount = $10

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the discounted price.

Discounted Price = Original Price - Discount
Discounted Price = $40 - $10
Discounted Price = $30

Since Mike pays with a $50 bill, we subtract the discounted price from the $50 bill to find out how much money he will have left over.

Money Left Over = $50 - $30
Money Left Over = $20

"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to first find the total number of employees after three months. 

The company initially has 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. So, after one month, the total number of employees will be 200 + 20 = 220. 
After two months, the total number of employees will be 220 + 20 = 240. 
After three months, the total number of employees will be 240 + 20 = 260.

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months. Each employee is paid a $4000 salary per month. So, the total amount of money paid to 260 employees for one month is 260 * 4000 = $1040000.

"To find out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we first need to calculate their total earnings after working 20 hours.

Billy's initial hourly wage was $10. After 2 months, he got a raise of $0.50 per hour, making his new hourly wage $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. After another year, he got a raise of $1.00 per hour, making his final hourly wage $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50.

Billy's total earnings for 20 hours of work at $11.50 per hour is 20 * $11.50 = $230.

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary, which was $10. So, Sally's starting salary is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. 

Sally's total earnings for 20 hours of work at $10.50 per hour is 20 * $10.50 = $210.

"To find the total number of trees planted by the students, we need to calculate the total number of students and multiply it by 1 (since each student plants 1 tree). 

The total number of students is the product of the number of classes and the average number of students per class: 
40 classes * 25 students/class = 1000 students

Now, we multiply the total number of students by 1 to find the total number of trees planted by the students:
1000 students * 1 tree/student = 1000 trees

To find the total number of trees planted by the teachers, we need to calculate the total number of teachers and multiply it by 2 (since each teacher plants 2 trees). 

The total number of teachers is the product of the number of classes and the average number of teachers per class: 
40 classes * 3 teachers/class = 120 teachers

Now, we multiply the total number of teachers by 2 to find the total number of trees planted by the teachers:
120 teachers * 2 trees/teacher = 240 trees

To find the total number of trees planted at the end of the campaign, we add the total number of trees planted by the students and the teachers:

"To find out how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we first need to find the total number of stuffed animals she currently has. 

She has 3 puppies, 5 koalas, 2 zebras, and 4 frogs. 

Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Now, we need to find 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. 

30% of 14 = 0.3 * 14 = 4.2

Since we can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, we'll round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we'll consider the context of the problem. If Bubbles buys 5 stuffed goats, the percentage of stuffed goats will be 5/19, which is approximately 26.32%. Since 4.2 is less than 5, we can buy 4 stuffed goats to get a percentage close to 30%. 

However, to get exactly 30%, we need to find the number of stuffed goats that will make the total number of stuffed animals a multiple of 10 (since 30% of a multiple of 10 is a whole number). 

Let's find the next multiple of 10 that is greater than 14. The next multiple of 10 is 20. 

To get a total of 20 stuffed animals, Bubbles needs to buy 20 - 14 = 6 stuffed goats.

"To find out how many hours Kris has played, we first need to calculate the total hours she played in the first 2 weeks and the additional week.

In 2 weeks, there are 14 days. If Kris plays for half an hour every day, she plays 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours in the first 2 weeks.

In the additional week, she plays for 2 hours every day, so she plays 7 * 2 = 14 hours in the additional week.

Total hours played so far is 7 + 14 = 21 hours.

Since Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours, she still needs to play 30 - 21 = 9 hours to earn the achievement.

"To find the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time.

The first car travels at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel:
Distance = Speed x Time = 60 miles/hour x 2 hours = 120 miles

The second car travels at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel:
Distance = Speed x Time = 70 miles/hour x 2 hours = 140 miles

Since the second car was initially passing the first car, we need to find the distance between them after 2 hours. The second car has traveled 140 miles, and the first car has traveled 120 miles. The distance between them is the difference between the two distances:
Distance = 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school.

First, let's find the number of students who passed in each grade:

- Third-graders: 340 passed out of 500
- Fourth-graders: 40 passed out of 100
- Fifth-graders: The pass rate is twice the fourth-graders', so it's 2 * 40 = 80 out of 400

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who passed:
340 (third-graders) + 40 (fourth-graders) + 80 (fifth-graders) = 460

Next, let's calculate the total number of students in the school:
500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000

Now, we can find the overall pass rate by dividing the total number of students who passed by the total number of students in the school:

"To find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we first need to determine how many square inches of mosaic he can make with the glass chips he has. 

Since it takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic, and each bag holds 72 chips, we can calculate the total number of chips Milo has: 2 bags * 72 chips per bag = 144 chips.

Now, we need to find out how many square inches of mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make 1 square inch, we divide the total number of chips by 12: 144 chips / 12 chips per square inch = 12 square inches.

Since the mosaic is three inches tall, and we know the area of the mosaic (12 square inches), we can find the length by dividing the area by the height: 12 square inches / 3 inches = 4 inches.

So, Milo can make a mosaic that is 4 inches long.

"To find the total amount of tea consumed, we first need to calculate the total amount of tea drank by the 4 students who had 1.5 quarts each and the 16 students who had 2 quarts each.

The 4 students who had 1.5 quarts each drank a total of 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts of tea.
The 16 students who had 2 quarts each drank a total of 16 * 2 = 32 quarts of tea.

The total amount of tea consumed is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we can convert the total amount of tea consumed from quarts to gallons by dividing by 4. However, we are asked to find the initial amount of tea, so we need to add the remaining tea to the total amount consumed.

The remaining tea is 10 quarts. 

The total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is 38 (consumed) + 10 (remaining) = 48 quarts.

To convert quarts to gallons, we divide by 4: 48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

"To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we first need to determine the total number of candies he has. 

Initially, Dale had 100 candies. He sold 150, so he was left with 100 - 150 = -50 candies. However, this is not possible since you can't have a negative number of candies. This means he must have sold more than he had initially. 

Let's recalculate: Dale initially had 100 candies, but he sold 150, which is more than he had. This means he must have sold some of the additional candies he ordered later. 

Since he ordered 100 more candies, let's assume he sold x candies from the initial 100 and (150 - x) candies from the additional 100. We know that the total number of candies sold is 150. 

We can set up the equation: x + (150 - x) = 150.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students at the end of each month and then subtract the initial number of students from it.

At the beginning of the year, there are 10 students.

- At the end of January, the number of students doubles, so there are 10 * 2 = 20 students.
- At the end of February, the number of students doubles again, so there are 20 * 2 = 40 students.
- At the end of March, the number of students doubles again, so there are 40 * 2 = 80 students.
- At the end of April, the number of students doubles again, so there are 80 * 2 = 160 students.
- At the end of May, the number of students doubles again, so there are 160 * 2 = 320 students.

Now, let's subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May to find the additional students: 320 - 10 = 310.

The final answer is: 310"
"To find the total number of branches Felix climbed, we need to divide the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch. 

Total money made = $105
Cost per branch = $0.25

Total branches climbed = Total money made / Cost per branch
Total branches climbed = $105 / $0.25
Total branches climbed = 420

Since Felix worked during the week, which has 5 days, we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day.

Average branches per day = Total branches climbed / Number of days
Average branches per day = 420 / 5
Average branches per day = 84

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the total number of petals, we need to calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers and then subtract the petals that were dropped.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers:

- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 * 5 = 15 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 * 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 * 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 * 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add up the total number of petals: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 petal from each set of flowers, we need to subtract 4 petals (1 from each set) from the total: 101 - 4 = 97 petals

The final answer is: 97"
"To find out how many marshmallows are left in the bag, we need to subtract the total number of marshmallows used and the ones dropped from the initial number of marshmallows.

Initially, there were 35 marshmallows. 
John and DeSean each made 9 S'mores, so together they made 9 + 9 = 18 S'mores. 
Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, they used 18 marshmallows. 
They also dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground. 
So, the total number of marshmallows used or dropped is 18 + 3 = 21. 
Now, subtracting the total number of marshmallows used or dropped from the initial number of marshmallows: 35 - 21 = 14 marshmallows left.

Since there are 14 marshmallows left and 2 kids, we need to divide the remaining marshmallows by 2 to find out how many each kid can have: 14 / 2 = 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time each person plays and then determine how many quarters they use.

Jack can play for 20 minutes. His two friends who are worse can play for half as long, which is 20 / 2 = 10 minutes. The friend who is better can play for 1.5 times as long, which is 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes.

Since they play for 4 hours, we need to convert this to minutes. 4 hours is equal to 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the total time each person plays:

- Jack: 240 minutes
- Two worse friends: 2 * 10 minutes = 20 minutes each, so 2 * 20 = 40 minutes total
- Better friend: 240 minutes

Now, let's calculate how many quarters each person uses:

- Jack: 240 minutes / 20 minutes per quarter = 12 quarters
- Two worse friends: 40 minutes / 20 minutes per quarter = 2 quarters each, so 2 * 2 = 4 quarters total
- Better friend: 240 minutes / 20 minutes per quarter = 12 quarters

Now, let's calculate the total number of quarters used:

12 (Jack) + 4 (two worse friends) + 12 (better friend) = 28 quarters

Since each quarter costs $0.25, the total amount of money used is:

28 quarters * $0.25 = $7

The final answer is: $7"
"Let's break down the information given. 

Let's denote the amount of citrus zest as Z, the amount of fragrance as F, the amount of salt as S, the amount of sugar as S (since it's the same as salt), and the amount of oil as O.

We know that Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, so F = Z.

We also know that she uses twice as much salt as zest, so S = 2Z.

Since she uses twice as much oil as salt, O = 2S.

Substituting S = 2Z into O = 2S, we get O = 2(2Z) = 4Z.

We also know that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, and it's a combination of Z, F, S, S, and O. Since F = Z and S = 2Z, we can write the total amount as Z + Z + 2Z + 2Z + 4Z = 10.

Combining like terms, we get 10Z = 10.

Dividing both sides by 10, we get Z = 1.

Now that we know Z = 1, we can find O. Since O = 4Z, O = 4(1) = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total amount John spent, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows separately and then add them together.

The cost of the goats is 3 * $500 = $1500.
The cost of the cows is 2 * $1500 = $3000.

Now, we add the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows to find the total amount spent: $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

The final answer is: $4500"
"To find out how many more cupcakes Paul needs to buy, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs.

Paul needs 63 cupcakes in total. He already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes, so the total number of cupcakes he has is 8 + 40 = 48.

Now, let's subtract the number of cupcakes he has from the total number of cupcakes he needs: 63 - 48 = 15.

So, Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes.

The final answer is: 15"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

2. Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find 20% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.2. 
   40 * 0.2 = 8 cars sold.

3. Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

4. Now, let's calculate the total number of cars Joe gave away or sold. 
   Total given away or sold = 8 (sold) + 16 (given away) = 24 cars.

5. To find the number of cars Joe remains with, we subtract the total number of cars given away or sold from his initial number of cars.
   Cars remaining = 40 (initial) - 24 (given away or sold) = 16 cars.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to first determine the total amount raised by the students. Since the charity raised a total of $175,000 and $50,000 came from organizations, the amount raised by the students is $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000.

Now, we know that there are 20 students and they all raised the same amount. To find out how much each student raised, we can divide the total amount raised by the students ($125,000) by the number of students (20).

$125,000 / 20 = $6,250

Each student raised $6,250."
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we first need to find the time she walked on the second day. 

Since Sandy walked half as many hours on the second day as she walked on the first day, and she walked 8 hours on the first day, she walked 8 / 2 = 4 hours on the second day.

Now, we need to add the time she walked on both days to find the total time. 
Total time = Time walked on the first day + Time walked on the second day
Total time = 8 hours + 4 hours
Total time = 12 hours

Since we need the total time in minutes, we need to convert the total time from hours to minutes. 
1 hour = 60 minutes
Total time in minutes = 12 hours * 60 minutes/hour
Total time in minutes = 720 minutes

The final answer is: 720"
"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to first determine the total number of cars in the parking lot when he got out of class for the lunch break.

Initially, Hunter counted 50 cars when entering class. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, making the total 50 + 20 = 70 cars.

When he got out of class for the lunch break, 1/2 the number of cars in the parking lot had gone. This means that 1/2 of 70 cars left, and the remaining 1/2 stayed. 

To find the number of cars that left, we multiply 70 by 1/2: 70 * 1/2 = 35 cars left the parking lot.

So, the number of cars that remained in the parking lot when Hunter got out of class for the lunch break is 70 - 35 = 35 cars.

Now, we need to find the total number of cars he counted during the lunch break. Since 35 cars remained in the parking lot, and 35 cars left, the total number of cars he counted during the lunch break is 35 (remaining) + 35 (left) = 70 cars.

The final answer is: 70"
"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of tasks he completes in a day and then multiply it by the number of days he works in a week.

John does 30 cycles of work a day, and each cycle has 5 different tasks. So, the total number of tasks he completes in a day is:
30 cycles/day * 5 tasks/cycle = 150 tasks/day

Since each task pays $1.20, the total amount John makes in a day is:
150 tasks/day * $1.20/task = $180/day

John works a full 7-day week, so the total amount he makes in a week is:
$180/day * 7 days/week = $1260/week

The final answer is: $1260"
"To find the total points scored by Sasha, we first need to determine her points in both games. 

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. 

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points in the first game. 

Now, we know Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game, so Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

To find the total points scored by Sasha, we add her points from both games: 14 + 4 = 18.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the total number of tins of cat food, we multiply the number of packages of cat food by the number of tins per package: 8 * 11 = 88 tins of cat food.

To find the total number of tins of dog food, we multiply the number of packages of dog food by the number of tins per package: 6 * 6 = 36 tins of dog food.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of tins of cat food and dog food: 88 - 36 = 52.

The final answer is: 52"
"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as 'x'. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is 341, which is the sum of the cards Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have. We can write the equation as x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341.

Combine like terms: 7x + 12 = 341.

Subtract 12 from both sides: 7x = 329.

Divide both sides by 7: x = 47.

Since PJ has x cards, PJ has 47 cards. Smendrick has 3x cards, so Smendrick has 3 * 47 = 141 cards. Becca has 3x + 12 cards, so Becca has 3 * 47 + 12 = 147 cards.

The final answer is: 147"
"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color of eggs and then add them together.

Cindy had 5 green eggs. 
She had twice as many blue eggs as green ones, so she had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.
She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.
She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add the number of eggs of each color together: 5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"To find out how much Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total cost of shipping the book and subtract the refund amount from the purchase price.

First, let's calculate the shipping cost. The book weighs 4 pounds and the shipping company charges $0.35 per pound, so the weight-based shipping cost is 4 * $0.35 = $1.40. The book needs to be returned 20 miles away, and the shipping company charges $0.08 per mile, so the distance-based shipping cost is 20 * $0.08 = $1.60. The total shipping cost is $1.40 + $1.60 = $2.99.

Now, let's calculate the refund amount. Amazon will refund 75% of the book's purchase price, which is 0.75 * $32 = $24.

The total cost of shipping is $2.99, and the refund amount is $24. To find out how much Milly will lose, we subtract the refund amount from the shipping cost: $2.99 - $24 = -$21.91. However, since we can't lose a negative amount of money, we need to recalculate the refund amount as the difference between the shipping cost and the refund amount.

"To find out how much money Mulan has left, we need to calculate the total amount of money she spent and subtract it from the initial amount she had, including the money her father gave her.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Mulan had initially: $40 (initial money) + $100 (money from her father) = $140.

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money she spent: 2 pairs of jeans at $30 each = 2 x $30 = $60, and a bag for $20. So, the total amount spent is $60 + $20 = $80.

Now, let's subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $140 - $80 = $60.

So, Mulan has $60 left.

The final answer is: $60"
"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the production for the first three weeks and then determine the pattern.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.
In the second week, he produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.
In the third week, he produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Now, let's add up the production for the first three weeks: 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in a month, we can find out how much he produces in the fourth week by subtracting the production of the first three weeks from the total monthly production: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

The final answer is: 14,000"
"To find the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends on TikTok in a week and then multiply it by 4.

First, let's calculate the time she spends on TikTok in a week:

- Time spent recording videos: 18 videos * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes
- Time spent writing songs: 2 hours = 120 minutes
- Time spent doing makeup: 15 minutes * 6 days = 90 minutes

Total time spent on TikTok in a week = 72 + 120 + 90 = 282 minutes

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly time by 4:
282 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 1128 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:
1128 minutes / 60 = 18.8 hours

The final answer is: 18.8"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the initial installation and the cost of the additional items.

The initial installation includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. The cost of the initial installation is $129.00.

Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures that she needs installed. Since the initial installation already includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, and 1 chandelier, we need to calculate the cost of the additional items.

Additional mirrors: 6 - 4 = 2 mirrors (cost: 2 * $15.00 = $30.00)
Additional chandeliers: 2 - 1 = 1 chandelier (cost: 1 * $15.00 = $15.00)
Additional pictures: 20 - 10 = 10 pictures (cost: 10 * $15.00 = $150.00)

Total cost of additional items: $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00

Total cost = Initial installation + Total cost of additional items
Total cost = $129.00 + $195.00
Total cost = $324.00

The final answer is: $324.00"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Eva has saved $20.00.
2. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, so Anthony has saved $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.
3. Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we multiply $30.00 by 0.4: $30.00 * 0.4 = $12.00.
4. To find the total amount Roy has saved, we add the 40% more to Anthony's savings: $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

The final answer is: $42.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain in relation to Pompei's lifting capacity. 

First, we know that Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, and Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch. So, Saskay can lift a mountain 12 * 1 = 12 inches.

Next, Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Finally, Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 since there are 12 inches in a foot. 

480 / 12 = 40 feet.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the total distance traveled by Mason, we need to calculate the distance covered in the first 4 hours and the distance covered in the next 6 hours, and then add them together.

Distance = Speed x Time

For the first 4 hours:
Distance = 8 miles/hour x 4 hours = 32 miles

For the next 6 hours:
Distance = 8 miles/hour x 6 hours = 48 miles

Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the time it takes for one kangaroo to travel across the highway. Since three kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, one kangaroo would take three times as long, which is 18 * 3 = 54 hours.

Now, we know that the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo. So, if one kangaroo takes 54 hours to travel across the highway, four turtles traveling at half the speed would take twice as long, which is 54 * 2 = 108 hours.

The final answer is: 108"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Kora made 20 dishes. 
Rory made 20 more clay dishes than Kora, so Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes. 
Jada made twice as many clay dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

To find the total number of clay dishes they all made together, we need to add the number of dishes each person made. 
Total = Kora's dishes + Rory's dishes + Jada's dishes 
Total = 20 + 40 + 80 
Total = 140

The final answer is: 140"
"Let's break down the information given. Erika's total savings needed for the laptop is $600. However, she gets a discount of $200 for trading in her old laptop, so the new price becomes $600 - $200 = $400. 

She already has some savings in her purse, let's call it x. She also earned $150 from her part-time job and received $80 from her mom. So, the total amount she has is x + $150 + $80.

We are told that after getting this total amount, she only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop. This means the total amount she has is $400 (the price after the discount) + $50 (the extra she needs) = $450.

Now, we can set up an equation to find the amount she had in her purse: x + $150 + $80 = $450. 

Simplifying the equation, we get x + $230 = $450. 

Subtracting $230 from both sides, we get x = $220.

So, Erika has $220 in her purse. 

The final answer is: $220"
"To find out how many slices Adam has left, we first need to calculate the total number of slices he has. 

3 large apples can be sliced into 3 * 5 = 15 slices. 
5 small apples can be sliced into 5 * 3 = 15 slices. 

So, in total, Adam has 15 + 15 = 30 slices. 

Since Adam eats 15 slices, we subtract the number of slices he ate from the total number of slices: 
30 - 15 = 15

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how many cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to calculate the total amount of milk the farmer currently produces. 

The farmer extracts 5 liters of milk a day from each cow, and he has 3 cows. So, the total amount of milk he currently produces is 5 liters/cow * 3 cows = 15 liters/day.

Now, we need to find out how many more cows he needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day. To do this, we subtract the current milk production from the target milk production: 25 liters/day - 15 liters/day = 10 liters/day.

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, we need to find out how many cows are required to produce 10 liters of milk a day. We can do this by dividing the required milk production by the milk production per cow: 10 liters/day / 5 liters/cow = 2 cows.

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the unused portion of each glue stick and add them together.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, which means 5/6 is used. Since the original length is 12 mm, the used portion is (5/6) * 12 = 10 mm. The unused portion is 12 - 10 = 2 mm.

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, which means 1/3 is used. The used portion is (1/3) * 12 = 4 mm. The unused portion is 12 - 4 = 8 mm.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, which means 1/2 is used. The used portion is (1/2) * 12 = 6 mm. The unused portion is 12 - 6 = 6 mm.

Now, let's add the unused portions together: 2 mm + 8 mm + 6 mm = 16 mm.

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 16 mm."
"To find out how much money Gabriel still needs, we need to calculate the total amount he has and subtract it from the total amount he wants to spend.

Gabriel has $5000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200, so he has a total of $5000 + $200 = $5200.

The total amount he wants to spend is $10000 (car) + $800 (phone) = $10800.

Now, let's subtract the amount he has from the total amount he wants to spend: $10800 - $5200 = $5600.

So, Gabriel still needs $5600."

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. Since Jack has an unknown number of socks, let's call it 'x'. Then, Peter has 2x socks.
4. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so the number of socks Jack has is 60 / 2 = 30.

Now we know Jack has 30 socks and Peter has 2x socks. Since Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, we can set up the equation 2x = 30. Solving for x, we get x = 15. So Jack has 15 socks and Peter has 2x = 2 * 15 = 30 socks.

The total number of socks is 15 (Jack's socks) + 30 (Peter's socks) = 45 socks.
The total number of dishes is 30 (Jack's dishes) + 30 (Peter's dishes) = 60 dishes.

The total number of socks and dishes together is 45 + 60 = 105."
"To find the number of students good at math, we need to consider the total number of students and the number of students good at both subjects. 

Let's denote the number of students good at both math and English as 'x'. We know that the total number of students is 20, and the number of students good at math only is 5, and the number of students good at English only is 8.

We can set up an equation based on the total number of students: 
5 (math only) + 8 (English only) + x (both) = 20

Simplifying the equation, we get:
13 + x = 20

Subtracting 13 from both sides, we get:
x = 7

However, we are asked to find the number of students good at math. Since 'x' represents the number of students good at both subjects, we need to add the number of students good at math only (5) to 'x' to get the total number of students good at math.

Total number of students good at math = 5 (math only) + 7 (both) = 12

- Farm Y: 45 - 20 = 25 goats

To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the number of goats in Farm X and Farm Y:
45 (Farm X) + 25 (Farm Y) = 70 goats

The final answer is: 70"
"To find the average cost of each pair of shoes, we need to divide the total amount spent on shoes in a year by the number of pairs bought in a year.

First, let's find the number of pairs James buys in a year. Since he buys 2 pairs a month, he buys 2 * 12 = 24 pairs in a year.

Now, let's divide the total amount spent on shoes in a year ($2640) by the number of pairs bought in a year (24).

Average cost per pair = Total amount spent in a year / Number of pairs bought in a year
= $2640 / 24
= $110

The final answer is: $110"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food, then subtract the discount for the red baskets.

The cost of 3 baskets of green food is 3 * $25 = $75.

The cost of 3 baskets of red food is 3 * $18 = $54.

The total cost before discount is $75 + $54 = $129.

Since you get $2 off for each basket of red food, the total discount is 3 * $2 = $6.

The total cost after discount is $129 - $6 = $123.

The final numerical answer is: $123"
"To find the time it takes to clean one-half of the rooms, we first need to determine the number of rooms that is half of 90. 

90 / 2 = 45 rooms

Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, we multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room.

45 rooms * 20 minutes/room = 900 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total number of homes built over the next three years, we need to calculate the number of homes built each year and then add them together.

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will count the total number of homes built in the first two years and double it. The total number of homes built in the first two years is 12 + 36 = 48. Doubling this amount gives 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

Now, let's add the number of homes built each year: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144.

The final answer is: 144"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. I am three years younger than my brother, so if my age is x, my brother's age is x + 3.
2. I am 2 years older than my sister, so my sister's age is x - 2.
3. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so my mom's age is 3(x + 3) - 1.
4. When you add all our ages, you get 87: x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + 3(x + 3) - 1 = 87.

Combine like terms: 
x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 9 - 1 = 87
Combine x terms: 
6x + 9 = 87

Subtract 9 from both sides: 
6x = 78

Divide both sides by 6: 
x = 13

So, I am 13 years old.

"To find out how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs, we first need to determine the total number of glue sticks required for the students. Since each student needs 2 glue sticks and there are 27 students, the total number of glue sticks needed is 27 * 2 = 54.

Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks required by the number of glue sticks per pack to find out how many packs are needed. However, since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs and expects to have some extra glue sticks left over, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.

To do this, we can divide 54 by 8, which gives us 6.75. Since we can't buy a fraction of a pack, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 7.

Therefore, Mr. Jackson will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water passing through the river at the given point over the three days.

On the first day, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

On the second day, the amount of water passing through the river doubles, so it becomes 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.

On the third day, the amount of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons, so it becomes 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

To find the total amount of water passing through the river at that point over the three days, we need to add the amounts from each day: 4000 + 8000 + 14000 = 24000 gallons.

The total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 24000 gallons.

The final answer is: 24000"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of exponential growth. Since each infected person infects six others, the number of new infections each day will be six times the number of infected people from the previous day.

Day 1: 10 people are initially infected. They infect 6 * 10 = 60 new people, making a total of 70 people infected.

Day 2: The 10 initial people are still infected, and they infect 6 * 10 = 60 new people. However, the 60 people infected on Day 1 are also still infected and will infect 6 * 60 = 360 new people. So, the total number of new infections on Day 2 is 60 + 360 = 420. Adding the 10 people from Day 1, we have a total of 70 + 420 = 490 people infected.

Day 3: The 10 initial people are still infected, and they infect 6 * 10 = 60 new people. The 60 people infected on Day 1 are still infected and will infect 6 * 60 = 360 new people. The 420 people infected on Day 2 are also still infected and will infect 6 * 420 = 2520 new people. So, the total number of new infections on Day 3 is 60 + 360 + 2520 = 2840. Adding the 490 people from Day 2, we have a total of 490 + 2840 = 3330 people infected.

The final answer is: 3330"
"To find out how much money Julieta received, we need to calculate 10% of Rafaela's total tips and subtract that from Rafaela's total tips. 

Rafaela received 40 * $20 = $800 in tips. 

10% of $800 is 0.1 * $800 = $80. 

So, Julieta received $800 - $80 = $720 in tips.

Now, to find the total amount of money they received altogether, we add Rafaela's and Julieta's tips: $800 + $720 = $1520.

The final answer is: $1520"
"To find out how many oranges Jennifer remained with, we first need to calculate the total number of oranges given to her children. 

Jennifer gave her 3 daughters 2 oranges each, so the total number of oranges given to her daughters is 3 * 2 = 6 oranges. 

Her son received 3 oranges. 

So, the total number of oranges given to her children is 6 (to daughters) + 3 (to son) = 9 oranges.

Jennifer bought 12 oranges initially. To find out how many oranges she remained with, we subtract the total number of oranges given to her children from the initial number of oranges. 

12 (initial oranges) - 9 (oranges given to children) = 3 oranges.

The final answer is: 3"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Claire earns 1 badge per month.
- Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge than Claire, so Amber earns 1/2 badge per month.
- Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so Wendy earns 3 badges per month.

In a 1-year time frame (12 months), the number of badges earned by each girl would be:
- Claire: 1 badge/month * 12 months = 12 badges
- Amber: 1/2 badge/month * 12 months = 6 badges
- Wendy: 3 badges/month * 12 months = 36 badges

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a 1-year time frame, we subtract the number of badges earned by Amber from the number of badges earned by Wendy:
36 badges (Wendy) - 6 badges (Amber) = 30 badges

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how much Paige raised, we first need to determine the total number of slices she baked. 

Since Paige bakes 2 loaves per hour and she baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is 5 hours, we multiply the number of loaves per hour by the number of hours: 2 loaves/hour * 5 hours = 10 loaves.

Since each loaf is cut into 8 slices, we multiply the total number of loaves by the number of slices per loaf: 10 loaves * 8 slices/loaf = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, so we multiply the total number of slices by the price per slice: 80 slices * 0.50 dollars/slice = 40 dollars.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find the total number of coins Gretchen has, we first need to determine the number of silver coins she has. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, and she has 70 gold coins, we can set up an equation to find the number of silver coins.

Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins can be represented as 'x + 30'. We know that the number of gold coins is 70, so we can set up the equation:

x + 30 = 70

To solve for 'x', we subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:

x = 70 - 30
x = 40

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins. To find the total number of coins, we add the number of gold coins and silver coins:

Total coins = Number of gold coins + Number of silver coins
Total coins = 70 + 40
Total coins = 110

The final answer is: 110"
"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we first need to determine the total number of burritos consumed. 

There were 50 students at the picnic, and each student was given 10 burritos. So, the total number of burritos given to the students is 50 * 10 = 500.

Mr. George also ate 20 burritos. 

The total number of burritos consumed is 500 (given to students) + 20 (eaten by Mr. George) = 520.

Since there were 600 burritos ordered initially, the total number of leftover burritos is 600 - 520 = 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the number of yellow cars, we first need to determine the number of green and blue cars. 

We know there are 12 red cars. The rink has 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so the number of green cars is 12 - 2 = 10.

The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars, so the number of blue cars is 3 * 10 = 30.

Now, we know the total number of red, green, and blue cars: 12 (red) + 10 (green) + 30 (blue) = 52.

Since the rink has 75 cars in total, the number of yellow cars is 75 - 52 = 23.

The final answer is: 23"
"Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as F, the number of books Anne has as A, and the number of books Sofie has as S. 

We are given that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so we can write this as S = A + 25.

We are also given that Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so we can write this as A = F - 12.

We are also given that together, Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have 85 books, so we can write this as S + A + F = 85.

Now, we can substitute the first two equations into the third equation to solve for F.

S + A + F = 85
(A + 25) + (F - 12) + F = 85
A + F + 25 + F - 12 = 85
A + 2F + 13 = 85

Now, substitute A = F - 12 into the equation:
(F - 12) + 2F + 13 = 85
F - 12 + 2F + 13 = 85
3F + 1 = 85

Now, solve for F:
3F = 85 - 1
3F = 84
F = 84 / 3
F = 28

"To find the weight of the carrots, we first need to find the weight of the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, the sweet potatoes weigh 2 * 5 = 10 pounds.

The carrots weigh 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes, so the weight of the carrots is 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

The weight of the carrots is 7 pounds."
"To find out how much Greg will spend on Jello, we first need to determine how many Jello cups he needs to buy. Since there will be 30 kids and each kid will have 4 Jello cups, the total number of Jello cups needed is 30 * 4 = 120.

Since one 3-ounce box of Jello makes 10 small Jello cups, we need to find out how many boxes of Jello Greg needs to buy. To do this, we divide the total number of Jello cups needed by the number of Jello cups one box makes: 120 / 10 = 12.

Now that we know Greg needs 12 boxes of Jello, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of boxes by the cost per box: 12 * $1.25 = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the total cost of the phones, we multiply the number of phones by the cost per phone: 5 phones * $700/phone = $3500.

The seller gives the electronics seller $4000 in dollar bills. To find the change, we subtract the total cost of the phones from the amount given: $4000 - $3500 = $500.

The seller will give back $500 in change."
"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we first need to find out how much Keenan spends in a month. Since Madeline pays 60% of the total cost, Keenan pays 40% of the total cost. 

40% of $400 is calculated as 0.4 * 400 = $160. 

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we can find out how much Keenan spends per week by dividing the monthly cost by 4. 

$160 / 4 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find out how many pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he ate on each day and add them up.

On the first day, he ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces. To find 2/5 of 60, we multiply 60 by 2 and divide by 5: 
(60 * 2) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

So, on the first day, he ate 24 pieces.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces. To find the remaining pieces after the first two days, we subtract the pieces eaten on the first two days from the total: 
60 - 24 - 10 = 26

Now, we need to find 7/13 of 26. To do this, we multiply 26 by 7 and divide by 13: 
(26 * 7) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14

So, on the third day, he ate 14 pieces.

Now, we add up the pieces eaten on each day: 
24 + 10 + 14 = 48

Therefore, Tobias has eaten 48 pieces so far.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water, we first need to find the cost of one bottle of soda and one bottle of water.

The cost of 7 bottles of soda is $21.00, so the cost of one bottle of soda is $21.00 / 7 = $3.00.

The cost of 4 bottles of water is $8.00, so the cost of one bottle of water is $8.00 / 4 = $2.00.

Now, we can find the total cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water by multiplying the cost of one bottle of soda by 3 and the cost of one bottle of water by 2, then adding the results together.

Cost of 3 bottles of soda = 3 * $3.00 = $9.00
Cost of 2 bottles of water = 2 * $2.00 = $4.00
Total cost = $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00

The total cost will be $13.00."
"To find out how much money David has left after buying the bolts, we need to calculate the total cost of the bolts and subtract that from the initial amount of money he has.

The cost of each bolt is $0.03, and David wants to buy 16 bolts. 

Total cost of bolts = Number of bolts * Cost per bolt
Total cost of bolts = 16 * $0.03
Total cost of bolts = $0.48

Now, let's subtract the total cost of the bolts from the initial amount of money David has:

Initial amount of money = $12.48
Total cost of bolts = $0.48
Money left = Initial amount of money - Total cost of bolts
Money left = $12.48 - $0.48
Money left = $12.00

"To find out how much Ella would earn after 12 hours, we need to determine her hourly rate of pay. We can do this by dividing the amount she earned ($33) by the number of hours she worked (3).

Hourly rate = Total earnings / Number of hours worked
Hourly rate = $33 / 3
Hourly rate = $11

Now that we know her hourly rate, we can multiply it by the total number of hours she will work (12) to find her total earnings.

Total earnings = Hourly rate * Total hours worked
Total earnings = $11 * 12
Total earnings = $132

So, Ella would earn $132 after 12 hours of dog walking.

"To find out how many marbles Paul has left, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, Paul has 52 marbles. His friend gave him 28 marbles, so now he has 52 + 28 = 80 marbles.

Then, he lost 1/4 of his marbles. To find out how many marbles he lost, we need to calculate 1/4 of 80. 

1/4 of 80 is 80 * 1/4 = 20.

So, Paul lost 20 marbles. Now, we need to subtract 20 from the total number of marbles he had after receiving the gift from his friend.

80 - 20 = 60.

Therefore, Paul has 60 marbles left.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find Amy's total score, we need to calculate the points she scores from each type of question and add them together.

First, let's calculate the points from the multiple-choice questions. Amy correctly answers 80% of the 10 multiple-choice questions, so she answers 0.8 * 10 = 8 questions correctly. Since each multiple-choice question is worth 1 point, she scores 8 points from the multiple-choice questions.

Next, let's calculate the points from the true/false questions. Amy correctly answers 90% of the 20 true/false questions, so she answers 0.9 * 20 = 18 questions correctly. Since each true/false question is worth 1 point, she scores 18 points from the true/false questions.

Finally, let's calculate the points from the long-answer questions. Amy correctly answers 60% of the 5 long-answer questions, so she answers 0.6 * 5 = 3 questions correctly. Since each long-answer question is worth 5 points, she scores 3 * 5 = 15 points from the long-answer questions.

Now, let's add up the points from each type of question to find Amy's total score: 8 + 18 + 15 = 41.

"To find out how much money Isaias bought the chickens for, we first need to determine how many chickens he plans to sell. Since he has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them, we can calculate the number of chickens he plans to sell as follows:

Number of chickens to sell = 300 * (3/5)
= 300 * 0.6
= 180 chickens

Now, we know that Isaias needs to make a profit of $2000 by selling these chickens at $50 each. To find the total revenue, we multiply the number of chickens by the selling price:

Total revenue = Number of chickens to sell * Selling price
= 180 * $50
= $9000

Since Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000, we can find the total cost by subtracting the profit from the total revenue:

Total cost = Total revenue - Profit
= $9000 - $2000
= $7000

Therefore, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for sale for $7000.

The final answer is: $7000"
"To find out how many glasses Micah and Mitchell sold, we need to divide the total number of glasses sold by 2, since they sold an equal number. 

Total glasses sold = 32
Number of people who sold an equal number of glasses = 2 (Micah and Mitchell)
Glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell = Total glasses sold / 2 = 32 / 2 = 16

Since Julie sold 14 glasses, we need to find the difference between the number of glasses Julie sold and the number of glasses Micah sold.

Glasses sold by Julie = 14
Glasses sold by Micah = 16
Difference = Glasses sold by Julie - Glasses sold by Micah = 14 - 16 = -2

"To find out how much money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope, we need to first calculate how much money she will make from selling the old rope. 

The length of the rope is 20 meters, and her friend is buying it for $2 a meter. So, the total amount she will get from selling the rope is 20 * $2 = $40.

Now, she plans to use this money to buy a new rope that costs $1.5 a meter. To find out how many meters of the new rope she can buy, we divide the total amount she has by the cost per meter of the new rope: $40 / $1.5 = 26.67 meters.

Since she can't buy a fraction of a meter of rope, we'll round down to 26 meters. 

The cost of the new rope will be 26 * $1.5 = $39.

Now, to find out how much money she will have left over, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the amount she got from selling the old rope: $40 - $39 = $1.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find Melanie's current age. Since in 10 years, she will be 18 years old, we can subtract 10 from 18 to find her current age.

Current age = 18 - 10 = 8 years

Now, we need to find the number of years it will take for her age to be thrice her current age. Let's call this number 'x'. In 'x' years, her age will be her current age plus 'x', which should be equal to three times her current age.

8 + x = 3 * 8

Simplifying the equation, we get:

8 + x = 24

Subtracting 8 from both sides:

x = 16

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

16"
"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's find the cost of the chicken. Since each pack of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, and the 5 packs of bacon cost $10, the cost of one pack of bacon is $10 / 5 = $2. Therefore, the cost of one pack of chicken is $2 * 2 = $4. Since Kelly has 6 packs of chicken, the total cost of the chicken is 6 * $4 = $24.

Next, let's find the cost of the strawberries. Each pack of strawberries costs $4, and Kelly has 3 packs, so the total cost of the strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.

Now, let's find the cost of the apples. Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is $4 / 2 = $2. Since Kelly has 7 packs of apples, the total cost of the apples is 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items in Kelly's cart: $10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60.

Finally, let's subtract the total cost of the items from Kelly's budget: $65 - $60 = $5.

"Let's break down the information given. Elaina's final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, and the total runtime of the final concert, including the encore, is 65 minutes. 

Let's denote the runtime of her usual concert as 'x'. Since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concert, its runtime is 2x. Adding the 15-minute encore, the total runtime of the final concert is 2x + 15 = 65 minutes.

Now, we can solve for 'x'. 

2x + 15 = 65

Subtract 15 from both sides:
2x = 50

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 25

So, her usual concerts run for 25 minutes.

To find the total number of petals on the daisies, we multiply the number of daisies by the number of petals each daisy has: 4 daisies * 10 petals/daisy = 40 petals.

Now, we subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies to find the difference: 40 petals (daisies) - 25 petals (orchids) = 15 petals.

The daisies have 15 more petals compared to the orchids."
"To find the percentage of flowering plants, we first need to determine the number of flowering plants. 

There are 100 plants in total. One-fourth of them are indoor plants, which is 100 * (1/4) = 25 plants. 

The remaining plants are 100 - 25 = 75 plants. Two-thirds of these remaining plants are outdoor plants, which is 75 * (2/3) = 50 plants. 

The rest of the remaining plants are flowering plants, which is 75 - 50 = 25 plants.

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100: (25/100) * 100 = 25%.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to first find the speed of the thingamabob. Since the whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob, and the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, we can find the speed of the thingamabob by dividing the speed of the whatchamacallit by 11.

Speed of thingamabob = Speed of whatchamacallit / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 121 / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 11 meters per second

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig by multiplying the speed of the thingamabob by 5.

Speed of whirligig = Speed of thingamabob * 5
Speed of whirligig = 11 * 5
Speed of whirligig = 55 meters per second

The final answer is: 55"
"Let's break down the information given. Ellen eats two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day. The salad costs $6, and the yogurt is half the price of the salad. 

Since the yogurt is half the price of the salad, and the salad costs $6, the price of the yogurt is $6 / 2 = $3.

The total cost of the salad and the yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9. 

Since Ellen pays a total of $11 for her daily goods, the cost of two carrots is $11 - $9 = $2.

To find the cost of one carrot, we divide the cost of two carrots by 2. 

Cost of one carrot = $2 / 2 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To find out how much Mark makes a week, we need to calculate his new hourly wage and then multiply it by the number of hours he works in a week.

Mark used to make $10 an hour, but his pay was raised by $2 per hour. So, his new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12 per hour.

Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so the total number of hours he works in a week is 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week.

Now, we can multiply his new hourly wage by the number of hours he works in a week to find his weekly earnings: $12/hour * 40 hours/week = $480/week.

The final answer is: $480"
"Let's break down the information given. 

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. 

Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, the number of times she mowed Kamala's lawn is 3x. 

The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's, so the number of times she mowed Alba's lawn is 5x.

The total number of lawns she mowed is x (Joe's) + 3x (Kamala's) + 5x (Alba's) = 9x.

We know that she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn. Since she mowed 9x lawns in total, the total amount she made from mowing lawns is 9x * 6 = 54x.

We are given that she made a total of $80 from both lemonade sales and mowing lawns. So, the amount she made from lemonade sales is 80 - 54x.

However, we don't know the value of x. But we do know that she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn, and that's the only lawn we know the price for. Since she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn, and that's the only lawn we know the price for, we can assume that the price for each lawn is $6. 

Since she mowed 9x lawns, the total amount she made from mowing lawns is 9x * 6 = 54x. We know that 54x = 54, so x = 1.

Now that we know x = 1, we can find the amount she made from lemonade sales. The amount she made from lemonade sales is 80 - 54x = 80 - 54(1) = 80 - 54 = 26.

"To find Harry's weight, we need to calculate the weights of Carl and Christian first. 

Martin's weight is 55 kg. 
Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so Carl's weight = 55 + 16 = 71 kg.
Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight = 71 + 8 = 79 kg.
Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight = 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

"To find John's total monthly income from renting out his car, we need to calculate the total number of hours he rents his car and multiply it by his hourly rate.

He rents his car 10 times a month for 3 hours each time, so the total number of hours is 10 * 3 = 30 hours.

His hourly rate is $25, so his total monthly income is 30 hours * $25/hour = $750.

To find his profit, we need to subtract his car payment from his total monthly income. 

Profit = Total monthly income - Car payment
Profit = $750 - $500
Profit = $250

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Martha initially had some notebooks, but we don't know the exact number. However, we do know that after buying 5 more, she had a total of 7 notebooks. This means she initially had 7 - 5 = 2 notebooks.

Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, and Martha initially had 2 notebooks, Joseph had 3 * 2 = 6 notebooks.

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph. Martha has 7 notebooks, and Joseph has 6 notebooks. So, Martha has 7 - 6 = 1 more notebook than Joseph.

"To find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we first need to determine the distance rowed by Anis. 

Dijana rowed 50 miles. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. To find 1/5 of Dijana's distance, we multiply 50 by 1/5, which is 10 miles. 

So, Anis rowed 50 + 10 = 60 miles. 

Now, to find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we add their individual distances: 50 (Dijana) + 60 (Anis) = 110 miles.

"To find out how many cookies each of Susan's nephews will get, we first need to determine the total number of cookies left after her husband took some. 

Initially, Susan had 100 cookies. Her husband took 4 cookies, so the remaining number of cookies is 100 - 4 = 96.

Now, we need to divide the remaining cookies equally among her 6 nephews. To do this, we'll divide 96 by 6.

96 / 6 = 16

So, each of Susan's nephews will get 16 cookies.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we first need to determine how many pages each of them read in total. 

Denise read 10 pages yesterday and 5 more than Daniel's yesterday's reading today. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read 13 + 5 = 18 pages today. 

So, Denise's total reading is 10 + 18 = 28 pages. Daniel's total reading is 13 pages (yesterday) + 0 pages (today) = 13 pages.

The difference in their total reading is 28 - 13 = 15 pages.

The final answer is: 15"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of bowls that can be filled with the leftover soup after dinner. 

Since the pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls, and there are 3 adults (Calvin, his wife, and himself) and 2 children, the total number of bowls used for dinner will be 3 (adults) + 2 (children) = 5 bowls.

Since the pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls, we can assume that the pot can fill 5 adult bowls (as 5 is less than 8). 

Now, let's calculate the number of child bowls that can be filled with the leftover soup. If 5 adult bowls can be filled, then 10 child bowls can be filled (since 5 adult bowls = 10 child bowls). 

Since there are 2 children, and 10 child bowls can be filled with the leftover soup, each child can have 10 / 2 = 5 bowls of soup for lunch. 

The final numerical answer is: 5"

"To find out how much material Jo needs, we first need to determine the amount of material required for each type of mask and then multiply it by the number of masks she wants to make.

For small masks, Jo needs 2 yards of material to make 4 masks. To find out how much material is needed for one small mask, we divide 2 yards by 4 masks: 2 / 4 = 0.5 yards per small mask.

For large masks, Jo needs 2.25 yards of material to make 3 masks. To find out how much material is needed for one large mask, we divide 2.25 yards by 3 masks: 2.25 / 3 = 0.75 yards per large mask.

Now, we multiply the amount of material needed for each type of mask by the number of masks Jo wants to make:

For small masks: 0.5 yards/mask * 20 masks = 10 yards
For large masks: 0.75 yards/mask * 8 masks = 6 yards

To find the total amount of material needed, we add the material required for small and large masks: 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards.

"To find out Harold's free time, we need to calculate the total hours in a day and subtract the time he spends sleeping, working, and walking his dog.

There are 24 hours in a day. 

Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night. 
He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for 10 - 2 = 8 hours a day.
He walks his dog for 1 hour a day.

Total time spent = 10 (sleep) + 8 (work) + 1 (walk) = 19 hours

Free time = Total hours in a day - Total time spent
Free time = 24 - 19
Free time = 5 hours

"To find out how many red shoeboxes Tim used, we need to calculate 1/3 of the total number of red shoeboxes. 

Total red shoeboxes = 9
1/3 of red shoeboxes = 9 / 3 = 3

So, Tim used 3 red shoeboxes for fishing.

Now, let's find out how many blue shoeboxes are left. 
Total blue shoeboxes = 7
Blue shoeboxes used = 3
Blue shoeboxes left = 7 - 3 = 4

Now, let's find out how many red shoeboxes are left. 
Total red shoeboxes = 9

"To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we first need to calculate how many marbles he gave away. 

Dean gives 1/5 of his marbles to Jamie. Since he has 30 marbles, we can calculate 1/5 of 30 as (1/5) * 30 = 6 marbles. 

So, Dean gave 6 marbles to Jamie. 

Then, he gave 10 marbles to Donald. 

In total, Dean gave away 6 + 10 = 16 marbles.

Now, to find out how many marbles Dean has left, we subtract the marbles he gave away from the total number of marbles he had: 30 - 16 = 14.

So, Dean has 14 marbles left.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Adam's age four years ago as 'x'. Since Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, we can write an equation:

Duncan's age eight years ago = 2 * Adam's age four years ago
Duncan's age eight years ago = 2x

We know that Duncan's current age is 60. To find his age eight years ago, we subtract 8 from his current age:

Duncan's age eight years ago = 60 - 8
Duncan's age eight years ago = 52

Now we can equate this to 2x:

52 = 2x

To find x, we divide both sides by 2:

x = 52 / 2
x = 26

This means Adam's age four years ago was 26. To find Adam's current age, we add 4 to x:

Adam's current age = 26 + 4
Adam's current age = 30

Finally, to find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8
Adam's age in 8 years = 38

Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice that. 

Twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm is 2 * 200 = 400 acres. 
100 acres more than that is 400 + 100 = 500 acres.

Now, we add the size of both farms to find the total. 
200 (Farmer Brown's farm) + 500 (Farmer Smith's farm) = 700 acres.

"To find out how much Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday, we need to first determine how many packages he completes in that time. 

Colby completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, so we can express this as 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

Since he works for 8 hours, we multiply the number of packages he completes per hour by the number of hours he works: 40 * 8 = 320 packages.

Now, we know that Colby gets paid $0.20 for every package he completes. To find out his total earnings, we multiply the number of packages he completes by his pay per package: 320 * $0.20 = $64.

"To find out how many bottles of water John drinks, we need to calculate the time it takes to solve both a normal and an extreme sudoku puzzle, and then determine how many half-hour intervals fit into that time.

A normal sudoku puzzle takes 45 minutes, and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long, which is 4 * 45 = 180 minutes.

Now, let's convert the time for both puzzles into half-hour intervals. 
- Normal sudoku: 45 minutes / 30 minutes per interval = 1.5 intervals
- Extreme sudoku: 180 minutes / 30 minutes per interval = 6 intervals

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we need to add the number of intervals for both puzzles. 
1.5 (normal sudoku) + 6 (extreme sudoku) = 7.5 intervals

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we need to convert 7.5 intervals into the number of bottles. 
7.5 intervals * 1 bottle per interval = 7.5 bottles

However, since you can't drink a fraction of a bottle, we'll round up to the nearest whole number. But in this case, we can also consider that John will drink a bottle at the end of the 7.5 intervals, so we can just take the whole number part and add 1 to it.

7 (whole number part) + 0.5 (fractional part) = 7.5 

7.5 bottles

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many pieces of bologna were thrown at the red balloons and then subtract that from the total number of bologna pieces to find out how many were thrown at the yellow balloons.

Since Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and there are 20 red balloons, the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons is 2 * 20 = 40.

Now, we know that Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna at the bundle of balloons. To find out how many pieces were thrown at the yellow balloons, we subtract the number of pieces thrown at the red balloons from the total: 58 - 40 = 18.

Since Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, we can find the number of yellow balloons by dividing the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons by 3: 18 / 3 = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 yellow balloons in the bundle.

"To find out how many tune-ups Jon needs, we need to calculate the total miles he drives in 30 days. 

Since Jon drives 100 miles a day, the total miles driven in 30 days is 100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles.

Since Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we can divide the total miles driven by 1000 to find out how many tune-ups he needs.

3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3 tune-ups.

Therefore, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in that time.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount of money Julia and Nadine had, and then divide it by 2 to find out how much each of them received as allowance.

First, let's find the cost of the balloons. 1 dozen balloons is equal to 12 balloons. Since 2 balloons cost $0.5, 1 balloon costs $0.5 / 2 = $0.25. So, 12 balloons cost 12 * $0.25 = $3.

The total cost of the cake and the balloons is $11 + $3 = $14. They also bought 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each, so the total cost of the ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14. The total cost of all the items is $14 + $14 = $28.

Since they spent $28, and they had the same amount of allowance, the total amount of allowance they received is $28. To find out how much each of them received, we divide the total allowance by 2: $28 / 2 = $14.

"To find the total profit made by the class, we first need to find the total number of lollipops sold and the total cost of the lollipops.

Each student sold 10 lollipops, and there are 30 students. So, the total number of lollipops sold is 10 * 30 = 300.

The cost of each lollipop is $0.5, and the total number of lollipops sold is 300. So, the total cost of the lollipops is 0.5 * 300 = $150.

The selling price of each lollipop is $0.8, and the total number of lollipops sold is 300. So, the total revenue from selling the lollipops is 0.8 * 300 = $240.

The profit made by the class is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost, which is 240 - 150 = $90.

Therefore, the class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops.

He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.

He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 * 7 = 21 fish.

He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

Now, let's add up the total number of pets: 3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many cups of tea are in each row. Since Lana divides the 27 cups into 3 rows, we can divide 27 by 3 to get the number of cups in each row.

27 cups / 3 rows = 9 cups per row

Since Lana creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, the number of mint tea cups in each row will be half of the total cups in each row.

9 cups per row / 2 = 4.5 cups of mint tea per row

However, since we can't have a fraction of a cup, we can assume that Lana will make whole cups of tea. This means that she will make 4 cups of mint tea in each row and 5 cups of chamomile tea in each row, as the total number of cups in each row is 9.

4 cups of mint tea per row"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip. 

Let's break down the information given:

- The sloth takes 4 hours to make a round trip (down and back up) to collect berries.
- The sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

Since the sloth takes 4 hours for a round trip, in 8 hours, he can make 8 / 4 = 2 round trips.

If he makes 2 round trips, he will collect a total of 2 * x berries, where x is the number of berries he picks up per trip.

We want this total to be 24 berries, so we can set up the equation:

2 * x = 24

To find the minimum number of berries he can pick up per trip, we need to solve for x:

x = 24 / 2
x = 12

So, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip is 12.

"To find the total calories of the pastries Andrew baked, we first need to find the calories of a mini cinnamon roll and a mini blueberry muffin. 

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories. 

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, we can find the total calories of the mini cinnamon rolls: 200 mini cinnamon rolls * 200 calories = 40,000 calories.

Next, we can find the total calories of the mini blueberry muffins: 300 mini blueberry muffins * 150 calories = 45,000 calories.

Finally, we can find the total calories of all the pastries: 40,000 calories + 45,000 calories = 85,000 calories.

"To find out how far each vehicle traveled, we need to multiply their speeds by the time they traveled.

The bus traveled 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so the distance it covered is 60 * 5 = 300 miles.

The car traveled 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so the distance it covered is 30 * 8 = 240 miles.

To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus. 

300 - 240 = 60 miles.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the number of bouncy balls, we need to subtract the total number of toys Sophie had before buying the bouncy balls from the total number of toys she has now. 

The total number of toys before buying the bouncy balls is the sum of blocks, stuffed animals, and stacking rings. 

Total toys before = 31 (blocks) + 8 (stuffed animals) + 9 (stacking rings) = 48

Now, we subtract this from the total number of toys after buying the bouncy balls to find the number of bouncy balls.

Number of bouncy balls = Total toys after - Total toys before
= 62 - 48
= 14

The final answer is: 14"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old.
2. Paul is 10 years older than John.
3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age.

Let's denote John's age as 'x'. Since Paul is 10 years older than John, Paul's age is 'x + 10'.

From the third point, we know that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age, which is (x + 10) + x = 2x + 10.

The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old, so we can write the equation: Peter + Paul + Jean = 100. 

Since Peter's age is 2x + 10 and Paul's age is x + 10, we can substitute these values into the equation: (2x + 10) + (x + 10) + Jean = 100.

However, we don't have any information about Jean's age. But we can simplify the equation by combining like terms: 3x + 20 + Jean = 100.

To find the value of x, we need to know Jean's age. But we can't find Jean's age from the given information. However, we can express the combined age of Peter and Paul as 2x + 10 + x + 10 = 3x + 20.

"To find the total number of balloons, we first need to calculate the initial number of balloons each person had and then add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, Maria and her 4 friends each had 2 water balloons. So, the total number of balloons initially is (1 + 4 * 2) = 9.

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people (including Maria), the total number of additional balloons is 5 * 3 = 15.

Now, we add the initial number of balloons to the additional balloons: 9 + 15 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find out how many tables they need, we first need to calculate the total number of boxes of stuff they have. 

10 people donate 5 boxes each, so they have 10 * 5 = 50 boxes from donations. 
They already have 10 boxes, so the total number of boxes is 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

Since they can fit 2 boxes per table, they will need 60 / 2 = 30 tables.

They already own 15 tables, so they need 30 - 15 = 15 more tables.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the average total distance spat, we need to calculate the total distance spat by each person and then divide it by the total number of seeds spat.

Zoey spits 40 seeds, each 10 feet, so the total distance spat by Zoey is 40 * 10 = 400 feet.

Sydney spits 35 seeds, each 12 feet, so the total distance spat by Sydney is 35 * 12 = 420 feet.

The total distance spat by both Zoey and Sydney is 400 + 420 = 820 feet.

The total number of seeds spat is 40 + 35 = 75.

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the total distance spat by the total number of seeds spat: 820 / 75 = 10.93 (rounded to two decimal places).

The final answer is: 10.93"
"To determine which widget maker is more profitable, we need to calculate the total number of widgets each machine can produce in a month and then multiply that by the selling price of each widget.

First, let's calculate the total number of widgets each machine can produce in a month. The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour and runs 24 hours a day. 

60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = 1440 widgets/day
1440 widgets/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets/month

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour and runs 24 hours a day.

45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = 1080 widgets/day
1080 widgets/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets/month

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from each machine in a month. Each widget sells for $6.

Revenue from Widgeteer 3000: 43,200 widgets/month * $6/widget = $259,200
Revenue from WidgetMaster 9000: 32,400 widgets/month * $6/widget = $194,400

To find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the WidgetMaster 9000, we subtract the revenue from the WidgetMaster 9000 from the revenue from the Widgeteer 3000.

$259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

The final answer is: $64,800"
"To find out how much Cameron would save, we first need to calculate the cost of his stay with the option of adding on 70 pesos for every hour after the 12-hour mark and then compare it to the cost of a 24-hour stay.

Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours. Since the first 12 hours are already included in the initial charge, he needs to pay for the additional 5 hours. 

The cost for the additional 5 hours is 5 * 70 = 350 pesos.

The total cost for Cameron's stay would be 1000 (for the initial 12 hours) + 350 (for the additional 5 hours) = 1350 pesos.

Now, let's compare this to the cost of a 24-hour stay, which is 1600 pesos. 

The amount Cameron would save is 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

The final answer is: $250"
"To find out how much hay Nate needs, we first need to determine the amount each sheep needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds, and each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, we can calculate the amount each sheep needs as follows:

Twice the amount each goat needs: 2 * 5 = 10 pounds
3 pounds less than that: 10 - 3 = 7 pounds

Now, we know each goat needs 5 pounds and each sheep needs 7 pounds. We can multiply the number of goats and sheep by their respective amounts to find the total amount of hay needed for each:

For goats: 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds
For sheep: 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds

To find the total amount of hay Nate needs, we add the amount needed for goats and sheep:

Total hay needed = 75 pounds + 84 pounds = 159 pounds

The final answer is: 159"
"To find out how much money John has left after buying gas and depositing money in the bank, we first need to calculate his total earnings for the week. 

John's total earnings = 50 dollars/hour * 6 hours = 300 dollars.

Now, let's subtract the cost of gas from his total earnings: 
300 dollars - 50 dollars = 250 dollars.

Next, let's calculate how much money he has left after depositing 100 dollars in the bank: 
250 dollars - 100 dollars = 150 dollars.

Now, let's calculate the cost of 5 pencils: 
5 pencils * 10 dollars/pencil = 50 dollars.

Now, let's subtract the cost of pencils from his remaining money: 
150 dollars - 50 dollars = 100 dollars.

Finally, let's calculate how many 25 dollar pens he can buy with the remaining money: 
100 dollars / 25 dollars = 4.

"To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has left, we first need to determine the total number of bottles she has initially and then subtract the number of bottles given to the students.

The teacher has 9 coupons, each redeemable for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles she has initially is 9 * 100 = 900 bottles.

Each of the 29 students gets 2 bottles of apple juice, so the total number of bottles given to the students is 29 * 2 = 58 bottles.

To find out how many bottles the teacher has left, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles she initially had: 900 - 58 = 842.

"To find the total amount Patty charged, we need to calculate the labor cost and add it to the cost of parts and the initial visit fee.

The labor cost is $35 per hour, and the job took 2.25 hours. Since the labor is charged per hour or part thereof, we need to round up to the nearest hour for the labor cost. However, in this case, 2.25 hours is less than 3 hours, so we can calculate the labor cost as $35 * 2 = $70.

The total cost is the sum of the labor cost, the cost of parts, and the initial visit fee: $70 (labor) + $60 (parts) + $40 (visit fee) = $170.

"To find out how much James spent on the CDs, we first need to calculate the original price of the CDs and then subtract the discount. 

The original price of 10 CDs is 10 * $15 = $150. 

Since James gets a 40% discount, we need to find 40% of $150. 
40% of $150 = 0.4 * $150 = $60.

Now, subtract the discount from the original price: $150 - $60 = $90.

James spent $90 on the CDs.

Next, we need to find out how much he got back from selling 5 CDs. 
He sold each CD for $40, so he got 5 * $40 = $200.

Now, we need to find out how much money James was out. 
To do this, we subtract the amount he got back from the amount he spent: $90 - $200 = -$110.

However, since James can't be out a negative amount of money, this means he actually lost money. He spent more than he got back. 

The final answer is: -$110"

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find the time James took to swim 60% of the distance. 
Distance covered = 20 miles * 0.6 = 12 miles
Time taken to swim 12 miles = Distance / Speed = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours

Since he rests for half as long as the swimming time, he rests for 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

Now, let's find the remaining distance to be covered = 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles
Time taken to swim the remaining distance at half the speed = 8 miles / (2 miles per hour / 2) = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours

Total time taken = Time taken to swim 12 miles + Time taken to rest + Time taken to swim the remaining distance
Total time taken = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the number of loaves of bread the bakery has, we first need to calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had last Friday. 

Seven times the number of loaves Sam had is 7 * 70 = 490.

The bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had last Friday, so we need to subtract 40 from 490.

490 - 40 = 450.

The bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

The final answer is: 450"
"To find out how many stickers Jasmine has at the end, we need to calculate the total number of stickers she has after receiving and losing some.

First, Jasmine was given 15 stickers for participating in class. 
Then, she lost 7 stickers during playtime. 
So, the number of stickers she has after losing some is 15 - 7 = 8.

After that, her teacher gave her another 5 stickers for helping her classmates. 
So, the total number of stickers she has now is 8 + 5 = 13.

Therefore, Jasmine has 13 stickers at the end.

"To find the total commission earned by Cayley, we need to calculate the commission from the sales of the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal separately and then add them together.

Commission from New York Times:
- Number of copies sold: 6
- Price per copy: $5
- Commission rate: 10%
- Commission per copy: 10% of $5 = 0.1 * $5 = $0.5
- Total commission from New York Times: 6 * $0.5 = $3

Commission from Wall Street Journal:
- Number of copies sold: 10
- Price per copy: $15
- Commission rate: 8%
- Commission per copy: 8% of $15 = 0.08 * $15 = $1.2
- Total commission from Wall Street Journal: 10 * $1.2 = $12

Total commission earned by Cayley: $3 + $12 = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

We know Deanna's age is 26. Since Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, we can calculate Marcus's age by subtracting 5 from Deanna's age.

Marcus's age = Deanna's age - 5
Marcus's age = 26 - 5
Marcus's age = 21

We also know that Marcus is half of Leo's age. To find Leo's age, we can multiply Marcus's age by 2.

Leo's age = 2 * Marcus's age
Leo's age = 2 * 21
Leo's age = 42

The final answer is: 42"
"To find out how many points Azibo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Bahati and Dinar. 

Let's denote the points scored by Dinar as 'x'. Since Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, Bahati's points can be represented as 'x + 10'. 

We also know that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so Azibo's points can be represented as '(x + 10) - 20' or 'x - 10'.

The total points scored by the team is 45, which is the sum of the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar. We can write this as an equation:

x + (x + 10) + (x - 10) = 45

Combine like terms:

3x = 45

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 15

Now that we know Dinar scored 15 points, we can find Azibo's points by subtracting 10 from Bahati's points. However, we first need to find Bahati's points. Since Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, and we know Dinar scored 15 points, we can represent Bahati's points as '15 + 20' or '35'. 

Azibo's points can be found by subtracting 20 from Bahati's points: 35 - 20 = 15.

However, we know that Azibo's points can also be represented as 'x - 10'. Since we found that x = 15, we can confirm that Azibo's points are indeed 15 - 10 = 5.

The points scored by Azibo is 5."
"To find the total number of pages in the book, we need to calculate the total number of pages per inch and then multiply it by the thickness of the book in inches.

Since each paper is 100 pages to the inch and each paper is printed on both sides, we have 200 pages per inch (100 pages per side).

Given that the book is 1.5 inches thick, we can multiply the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book:

200 pages/inch * 1.5 inches = 300 pages

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the total number of reports Vince stapled, we need to calculate the total time he spent stapling reports and then multiply it by the rate at which he staples reports.

First, let's find the total time Vince spent stapling reports. He stapled from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is a total of 15 hours.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 15 hours by 60 to get the total minutes:
15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Now, we know that Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find the total number of reports he stapled, we need to multiply the total minutes by the rate at which he staples reports and then divide by the time it takes him to staple 30 reports.

First, let's find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes:
900 minutes / 15 minutes = 60 intervals

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we multiply the number of intervals by 30:
60 intervals * 30 reports/interval = 1800 reports

The final answer is: 1800"
"To find out how many minutes Kim slept on her bed, we first need to determine her total sleep time. 

Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m., which is a total of 8 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, her usual sleep time is 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, that day she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 5:55 a.m. instead of 6 a.m. We need to find out her actual sleep time that day.

She was sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 a.m. This is a total of 23 minutes. 

To find her total sleep time that day, we need to subtract the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up earlier from her usual sleep time. 

Her usual sleep time is 480 minutes. She woke up 5 minutes earlier, so we subtract 5 minutes from her usual sleep time: 480 - 5 = 475 minutes. 

Then, we subtract the time she was sleepwalking: 475 - 23 = 452 minutes.

So, Kim slept on her bed for 452 minutes that day. 

The final answer is: 452"
"To solve this problem, we first need to find out how many measuring spoons Jonathan has initially. 

Since Jonathan has two dozen cups, and one dozen is equal to 12, he has 2 * 12 = 24 measuring cups.

It is given that Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. So, the number of measuring spoons he has is 2/3 * 24 = 16.

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, Jonathan is left with 16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons.

Now, to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we need to add the number of measuring cups and measuring spoons he has left. 

Total number of utensils = 24 (measuring cups) + 10 (measuring spoons) = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we first need to find the number of occupied beds and then subtract it from the total capacity.

The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 of them are occupied. 

1/5 of 1000 is 100. So, the number of occupied beds is 100.

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, we need to find the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks have 14 days.

The total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks is 50 * 14 = 700.

Now, we add the initial occupied beds and the beds occupied in 2 weeks: 100 + 700 = 800.

The number of unoccupied beds is the total capacity minus the occupied beds: 1000 - 800 = 200.

The final answer is: 200"
"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we first need to determine the number of non-work emails she sends. 

She sends 16 emails a day, and 7 of them are work emails. So, the number of non-work emails is 16 - 7 = 9.

Two-thirds of the remainder (non-work emails) are to her family. Two-thirds of 9 is (2/3) * 9 = 6. This means she sends 6 emails to her family.

Now, we need to find out how many emails are left after sending to her family. This would be 9 - 6 = 3.

One-third of the remaining emails are to her boyfriend. One-third of 3 is (1/3) * 3 = 1.

So, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

The final answer is: 1"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

We know that Aliya is 3 years old. We also know that Shawna is three times as old as Aliya. 

So, Shawna's age = 3 * Aliya's age = 3 * 3 = 9 years.

We also know that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. 

So, Shawna's father's age = 5 * Shawna's age = 5 * 9 = 45 years.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number reported by Courtney and subtract it from her total.

Let's assume the number of people reported by Courtney is 100%. 
20% of 100 is 20. 

Now, subtract 20 from 100 to find the actual percentage of people who attended the concert: 100 - 20 = 80%.

Since Courtney reported 48 people, we need to find 80% of 48 to get the actual number of people who attended the concert.

80% of 48 = (80/100) * 48 = 0.8 * 48 = 38.4

So, approximately 38 people attended the concert.

The final answer is: 38"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. We know that Jason carried 2 balls, and Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey. This means Jeffrey carried half the number of balls Jason carried, which is 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried 2 balls, Jordan carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls carried by each of them: 1 (Jeffrey) + 2 (Jason) + 4 (Jordan) = 7 balls.

However, this is the number of balls carried by the boys, not the total number of balls the coach brought to practice. Since the boys carried all the balls in one trip, the total number of balls the coach brought to practice is equal to the number of balls the boys carried.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of holes dug on the first day as H1 = 10, on the second day as H2 = 13, and on the third day as H3 = 8. However, they filled in 2 holes, so the total number of holes at the end of the third day is H1 + H2 + H3 - 2 = 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29.

The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. This means the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 4 * H1 = 4 * 10 = 40.

Since we know the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 40, and we know the number of holes at the end of the third day is 29, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is 40 - 29 = 11.

The final answer is: 11"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and the third person got 15 more than each of them. 

Let's denote the number of corn chips the third person got as x. Since the third person got 15 more than Amora and Lainey, we can write an equation:

x = 70 + 15
x = 85

So, the third person got 85 corn chips. 

Now, we know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and the third person got 85 corn chips. To find the total number of corn chips, we add the number of corn chips each person got:

Total corn chips = 70 + 70 + 85
Total corn chips = 225

The final answer is: 225"
"To find the total cost of travel, we first need to determine the cost of the supplies, which is given as $400. 

Since the tickets for travel cost 50% more than the supplies, we need to calculate 50% of $400 and add it to the cost of the supplies.

50% of $400 is calculated as 0.5 * $400 = $200.

Now, we add this to the cost of the supplies: $400 + $200 = $600.

So, the total cost of travel is $600.

The final answer is: $600"
"Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, Stan as S, and Alex as X. 

We know that X = S + 5 (Alex has caught 5 more than Stan). 

We also know that S = 4A - 13 (Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe).

We can substitute the value of S from the second equation into the first equation: X = (4A - 13) + 5.

We also know that the total number of Pokémon caught is 339, so A + S + X = 339.

Substituting the value of X from the first equation into the total equation: A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 13 + 5) = 339.

Combine like terms: 9A - 21 = 339.

Add 21 to both sides: 9A = 360.

Divide by 9: A = 40.

Now that we know A, we can find S: S = 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147.

The final answer is: 147"
"To find the total number of episodes, we need to find half of the number of minutes per episode. Since each episode is 20 minutes long, there are 20 minutes per episode. Half of 20 is 10. 

So, there are 10 episodes in total. 

To find the total time John will spend watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode: 10 episodes * 20 minutes per episode = 200 minutes.

The final answer is: 200"
"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in the southerly direction and then add it to the distance traveled in the northerly direction.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled in the southerly direction for the first 10 hours:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 10 hours
Distance = 300 miles

Then, the bird flies towards the north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 36 miles

Since this distance is in the opposite direction, we need to subtract it from the initial distance to find the net distance traveled in the southerly direction:
Net distance = 300 miles - 36 miles
Net distance = 264 miles

Finally, the bird flies towards the south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours
Distance = 110 miles

To find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we add the net distance traveled in the southerly direction and the distance traveled in the final southerly direction:
Total distance = Net distance + Distance
Total distance = 264 miles + 110 miles
Total distance = 374 miles

"To find the total number of brownies Greta had left over, we need to calculate the total number of brownies she received and subtract the number of brownies eaten.

Greta made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies for herself, which is 12 brownies. 
She received 1/2 a dozen brownies from her office, which is 6 brownies. 
Her friends brought 4 dozen brownies, which is 48 brownies. 
So, the total number of brownies she received is 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies.

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies.

To find the number of brownies left over, we subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies received: 66 - 18 = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the total age of all three family members, we first need to find the age of Nani's brother and sister.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 2 * 8 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means her age is 75% of Nani's age. To find 75% of Nani's age, we multiply his age by 0.75. So, Nani's sister's age is 8 * 0.75 = 6 years.

Now, we add up the ages of all three family members: Nani's age (8 years) + his brother's age (16 years) + his sister's age (6 years) = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

The total age of all three family members is 30 years."
"To find the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time it takes for each type of stringing and then add them up.

For synthetic gut, it takes 15 minutes per racquet, and there are 3 racquets. So, the total time for synthetic gut is 3 * 15 = 45 minutes.

For polyester string, it takes 22 minutes per racquet, and there are 5 racquets. So, the total time for polyester string is 5 * 22 = 110 minutes.

For hybrid sets, it takes 18 minutes per racquet, and there are 4 racquets. So, the total time for hybrid sets is 4 * 18 = 72 minutes.

Now, we add up the time for each type of stringing: 45 + 110 + 72 = 227 minutes.

The final answer is: 227"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first two phones and the remaining phones. 

The first two phones cost the full price of $600 each, so the total cost for the first two phones is 2 * $600 = $1200.

The remaining phones are 2 (for the kids and his wife), and each of these phones is half the price of the first two. So, the price of each of these phones is $600 / 2 = $300.

The total cost for the remaining phones is 2 * $300 = $600.

Now, we add the cost of the first two phones and the remaining phones to get the total cost. Total cost = $1200 + $600 = $1800.

"To find the total number of players in both teams, we first need to determine the number of players in Zeke's team. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, and Carlton's team has 13 players, we can calculate the number of players in Zeke's team by adding 7 to 13.

Zeke's team = Carlton's team + 7
Zeke's team = 13 + 7
Zeke's team = 20

Now, to find the total number of players in both teams, we add the number of players in Zeke's team to the number of players in Carlton's team.

Total players = Zeke's team + Carlton's team
Total players = 20 + 13
Total players = 33

"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is 2 * (length + width).

Perimeter = 2 * (15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2 * 25
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2.

Total slats needed = Perimeter * 2
Total slats needed = 50 * 2
Total slats needed = 100

"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we first need to determine how many boxes she had left after giving some to her mom and sister. 

Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges. She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, so she gave away a total of 2 + 2 = 4 boxes. 

Now, we subtract the number of boxes she gave away from the total number of boxes she bought: 12 - 4 = 8 boxes.

Each box contains 20 oranges, so the total number of oranges in 8 boxes is 8 * 20 = 160 oranges.

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges, which is 1/4 * 160 = 40 oranges. 

To find out how many oranges she sold, we subtract the number of oranges she kept from the total number of oranges: 160 - 40 = 120 oranges.

The USA has 50 states. 

Half of 50 is 25. 

India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, so it has 25 + 4 = 29 states.

Now, we add the number of states in the USA and India to get the total number of states in both countries: 50 (USA) + 29 (India) = 79.

The final answer is: 79"
"To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books. 

The total cost of the books is the sum of the cost of the dictionary, the dinosaur book, and the children's cookbook. 

Total cost = $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39

Since Tyler has already saved $14 from his allowance, we need to subtract this from the total cost to find out how much more he needs to earn.

Amount needed to earn = Total cost - Amount saved = $39 - $14 = $25

Now, we can find out how many hours Tyler needs to work by dividing the amount he needs to earn by his hourly wage.

Hours needed to work = Amount needed to earn / Hourly wage = $25 / $5 = 5 hours

So, Tyler needs to work for 5 hours to afford his books.

"Let's break down the information given:

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread. 
On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday.

On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. 
On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie. 
So, on Saturday, he sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each day:

On Saturday, the total earnings from gingerbread = 10 * $6 = $60
The total earnings from apple pie = 11 * $15 = $165
Total earnings on Saturday = $60 + $165 = $225

On Sunday, the total earnings from gingerbread = 15 * $6 = $90
The total earnings from apple pie = 15 * $15 = $225
Total earnings on Sunday = $90 + $225 = $315

Total earnings for two days = $225 + $315 = $540

The final answer is: $540"
"To determine the total number of bottles Pamela will need, we first need to calculate the total amount of sunscreen she will use. 

Since Pamela reapplies sunscreen every hour and she will be outside for 4 hours a day, she will reapply sunscreen 4 times a day. 

Over 8 days, she will reapply sunscreen 4 times a day * 8 days = 32 times.

Since each application is 1 ounce, she will use 32 ounces of sunscreen in total.

Each bottle of sunscreen contains 8 ounces. To find out how many bottles she will need, we divide the total amount of sunscreen she will use (32 ounces) by the amount in each bottle (8 ounces).

32 ounces / 8 ounces per bottle = 4 bottles.

So, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen.

"Let's break down the information given. 

Emil is 19 years old now. When he turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad and twice as old as his brother. 

Let's denote Emil's current age as E, his dad's age as D, and his brother's age as B. 

We know that E = 19. 

When Emil turns 24, his age will be 24. 

We are given two conditions: 
1. 24 = 0.5D (since Emil will be half the age of his dad)
2. 24 = 2B (since Emil will be twice as old as his brother)

From condition 1, we can find D: 
D = 24 * 2 = 48

From condition 2, we can find B: 
B = 24 / 2 = 12

Now, we need to find the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now. 
Dad's current age = D - (24 - E) = 48 - (24 - 19) = 43
Brother's current age = B - (24 - E) = 12 - (24 - 19) = 7

Sum of their ages = 43 + 7 = 50

Adrianne's mother gave her 20 beads.
Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the beads together: 20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

"To find the number of students who are football players, we first need to calculate 20% of 30. 

20% of 30 = 0.20 * 30 = 6

So, there are 6 football players in the class. 

Now, we need to find the number of students who are not football players. 

Total students - football players = 30 - 6 = 24

Out of these 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. 

25% of 24 = 0.25 * 24 = 6

So, there are 6 students who are either cheerleaders or part of the band.

The total number of students leaving early is the sum of football players and the students who are either cheerleaders or part of the band.

"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we first need to determine Charlie's shoe size. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size five boots, we can calculate Charlie's size as follows:

Charlie's size = 5 * Sophie's size
Charlie's size = 5 * 5
Charlie's size = 25

Now, to find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we add their sizes and divide by 2:

Average size = (Sophie's size + Charlie's size) / 2
Average size = (5 + 25) / 2
Average size = 30 / 2
Average size = 15

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to calculate the total space available for plants. Since Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between every plant, we'll subtract the space taken by the plants and the space between them from the total length of the flower bed.

First, let's convert the length of the flower bed to inches: 111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches.

Now, let's calculate the total space taken by the plants and the space between them. Let's assume the number of plants is 'n'. The total space taken by the plants is 12n inches, and the total space between the plants is 1.5n feet * 12 inches/foot = 18n inches.

The total space available for plants is 1332 inches - 18n inches - 12n inches = 1320 - 30n inches.

Since Pat already owns 17 flowers, she needs to buy (n - 17) more flowers. The total number of plants will be n = 17 + (n - 17) = n.

Now, we can set up an equation to find the maximum number of plants that can fit in the flower bed:

1320 - 30n = 0

Solving for n, we get:
30n = 1320
n = 1320 / 30
n = 44

So, Pat can fit 44 plants in her flower bed. Since she already owns 17 flowers, she needs to buy 44 - 17 = 27 more flowers.

The cost of each flower is $6, so the total cost will be:
27 * 6 = $162

The final answer is: $162"
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day, we need to calculate 1/2 of the number of pretzels Edgar eats in a day. 

Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day. 
1/2 of 18 is 18 / 2 = 9 pretzels.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we need to multiply the number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day by 7.

9 pretzels/day * 7 days = 63 pretzels

The final answer is: 63"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of petunias: 
5 baskets * 3 petunias per basket = 15 petunias
Cost of 15 petunias = 15 * $3.00 = $45.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of sweet potato vines:
5 baskets * 2 sweet potato vines per basket = 10 sweet potato vines
Cost of 10 sweet potato vines = 10 * $2.50 = $25.00

Now, let's add the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines together:
Total cost = $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00

The total amount Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets is $70.00."
"To find out how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we first need to determine how much soil is left after planting the sunflowers and carnations.

First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations. 
4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds
Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations = 12 pounds + 15 pounds = 27 pounds

Now, let's subtract the amount of soil used from the total amount of soil they bought.
30 pounds (total soil) - 27 pounds (used soil) = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, we can plant 3 roses with the remaining soil.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we first need to calculate how much she saves each month. 

Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month and sets 25% of her paycheck aside for shoes. To find 25% of $2,000.00, we multiply $2,000.00 by 0.25.

$2,000.00 * 0.25 = $500.00

So, Jessica saves $500.00 each month for shoes. 

To find out how many shoes she can buy in a year, we need to multiply the monthly savings by 12 (the number of months in a year).

$500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00

Now, we need to find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy with $6,000.00. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00.

$6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6

So, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how long it takes Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp. 

First, let's find out how long it takes her to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp a minute, we can divide 90 by 6 to get the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp. 

90 / 6 = 15 minutes

Now, let's find out how long it takes her to cook 90 shrimp. Since she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we can divide 90 by 30 to find out how many batches she needs to cook. 

90 / 30 = 3 batches

Since each batch takes 10 minutes, we can multiply the number of batches by the time it takes to cook each batch. 

3 batches * 10 minutes/batch = 30 minutes

However, this is the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp, but we also need to add the time it takes to peel the shrimp. 

So, the total time it takes to peel and cook 90 shrimp is the sum of the time it takes to peel and the time it takes to cook. 

15 minutes (peeling) + 30 minutes (cooking) = 45 minutes

The final answer is: 45"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour on low and 3 degrees per hour on high. The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour without the air conditioner.

2. The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, so it cooled the room by 2 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 6 degrees.

3. Then, it was turned up to high for 4 hours, so it cooled the room by 3 degrees/hour * 4 hours = 12 degrees.

4. The total cooling effect of the air conditioner is 6 degrees (low) + 12 degrees (high) = 18 degrees.

5. However, the room also warmed up for 2 hours without the air conditioner, so it warmed up by 2 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 4 degrees.

6. The net cooling effect of the air conditioner is 18 degrees (cooling) - 4 degrees (warming) = 14 degrees.

7. Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

The final answer is: 14"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time. 

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. 
2. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. 
   Since Bill's dad was 30 years old when he saw the comet, Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time.

Now, we need to find out how long it took for the comet to orbit the sun again. The comet orbits the sun every 75 years. 

Since Bill saw the comet for the second time when he was 90 years old, and the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, we can assume that the comet will orbit the sun again when Bill is 90 + 75 = 165 years old.

Now, we need to find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time. Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, and Bill saw the comet for the second time when he was 165 years old, we can subtract 75 years from 165 to find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time.

165 - 75 = 90

However, this is the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time. We need to find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time. 

Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, and Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old, we can assume that the comet will orbit the sun again when Bill's dad is 30 + 75 = 105 years old.

Now, we need to find out how old Bill was when his dad was 105 years old. Since Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time, we can subtract 90 from 105 to find out how old Bill was when his dad was 105 years old.

105 - 90 = 15

However, this is the age difference between Bill and his dad. We need to find out how old Bill was when his dad was 30 years old. 

Since Bill was 15 years younger than his dad when his dad was 105 years old, we can add 15 to 30 to find out how old Bill was when his dad was 30 years old.

30 + 15 = 45

However, this is the age of Bill when his dad was 30 years old. We need to find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time. 

Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, and Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old, we can assume that the comet will orbit the sun again when Bill is 45 - 75 = -30 years old.

However, this is not possible since age cannot be negative. We need to find another way to solve this problem.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. 

Since Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet, we can assume that Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time is 3 times the age of his father when he saw the comet.

Let's call the age of Bill's father when he saw the comet 'x'. Then, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time is 3x.

We know that the comet orbits the sun every 75 years. 

Since Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old, we can assume that the comet will orbit the sun again when Bill's dad is 30 + 75 = 105 years old.

Now, we need to find out how old Bill was when his dad was 105 years old. Since Bill was 3x years old when he saw the comet for the second time, we can set up an equation to solve for x.

3x = 90 (since Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time)

x = 90 / 3
x = 30

Now that we know x, we can find out how old Bill was when his dad was 30 years old. 

Since Bill's dad was 30 years old when he saw the comet, we can assume that the comet will orbit the sun again when Bill is 30 + 75 = 105 years old.

However, this is the age of Bill when his dad is 105 years old. We need to find out how old Bill was when his dad was 30 years old.

Since Bill was 30 years younger than his dad when his dad was 105 years old, we can subtract 30 from 105 to find out how old Bill was when his dad was 30 years old.

"To find the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks for each category and then add them up.

1. Checks for the electric bill: Since Buford writes a check once per month, and there are 12 months in a year, he writes 12 checks for the electric bill per year.
2. Checks for the gas bill: Similarly, he writes a check once per month for the gas bill, so he also writes 12 checks for the gas bill per year.
3. Checks to the church: Buford writes a check twice per month to the church, so in a year, he writes 2 * 12 = 24 checks to the church.
4. Checks to the pest and lawn service: He writes a check quarterly, which means 4 times a year, so he writes 4 checks to the pest and lawn service per year.

Now, let's add up the total number of checks: 
12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn service) = 52

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume the total number of flights made by the first plane in a day is 'x'. Since the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, the number of flights to Greece is (3/4)x. The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of flights to France is (1/4)x.

We are given that the second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes in a day. So, the total number of flights made by the first plane in a day is 2 * 44 = 88.

Now, we can equate the total number of flights made by the first plane to 88 and solve for x:
x = 88

Since the number of flights to France is (1/4)x, we can substitute the value of x to find the number of flights to France:
Flights to France = (1/4) * 88
Flights to France = 22

The final answer is: 22"
"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the individual howling times and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. 
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, let's add the individual howling times together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

"Let's break down the information given. Adam's mother gave him $6, and his father gave him twice as much as his mother, which is 2 * $6 = $12. 

So, the total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Since Adam bought the trousers for $30, he must have contributed the remaining amount from his savings. 

To find out how much Adam contributed, we subtract the total amount received from his parents from the cost of the trousers: $30 - $18 = $12.

Therefore, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings.

"Let's denote the age of Wilfred as 'W'. Since Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group, we can express this as:

Helene's age = 2 * (Average age of the group)

We know that the total age of the children is 20, and there are 4 children. So, the average age of the group is:

Average age = Total age / Number of children
= 20 / 4
= 5

Now, we can express Helene's age in terms of the average age:

Helene's age = 2 * Average age
= 2 * 5
= 10

We also know that Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old. So, the sum of their ages is:

Akbar's age + Alessandro's age = 3 + 4 = 7

The total age of the group is the sum of the ages of all four children:

Total age = Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age + Wilfred's age
20 = 7 + 10 + W

Now, we can solve for W:

20 = 17 + W
W = 20 - 17
W = 3

"To find out how much Walter's lawyer will contribute, we first need to calculate the total amount collected from Walter's neighbors and the online fund. 

Walter collects $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. So, the total amount collected is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Walter's lawyer will donate three times as much as everyone else donates. Since everyone else (Walter's neighbors and the online fund) donated $2000, Walter's lawyer will donate 3 * $2000 = $6000.

However, the question states that Walter is going to tell his lawyer about his neighbors and the online fund until his friend gives him $200. This implies that the friend's contribution is not included in the amount that Walter's lawyer will donate three times. Therefore, we should not include the friend's contribution in the calculation.

So, the final amount that Walter's lawyer will contribute is 3 * $2000 = $6000."
"To find out the number of people in the church next door, we first need to find out the total number of cookies. Since each guest brought 15 cookies and there were 100 guests, the total number of cookies is 100 * 15 = 1500.

The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door. So, the number of cookies given to the church is 1500 * 1/2 = 750.

Since each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, the number of people in the church next door is 750 / 15 = 50.

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, let's assume the total number of slices the watermelon is divided into is 'x'. Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices is 6. 

Let's say each kid gets 'k' slices. Since each adult gets twice as big a slice as each kid, each adult gets 2k slices. 

We know that the total number of slices is 6, so we can set up the equation: 2k + 4k = 6. 

Combine like terms: 6k = 6.

Divide both sides by 6: k = 1.

Now that we know each kid gets 1 slice, each adult gets 2 slices. 

The total number of slices the adults get is 2 * 2 = 4.

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to find the fraction of the total number of slices they get. The fraction is 4/6, which simplifies to 2/3.

To convert this fraction to a percentage, we multiply by 100: (2/3) * 100 = 66.67%.

The final answer is: 66.67"
"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones has left to update his records, we first need to calculate the total time he spends on rounds and appointments.

Time spent on rounds: 
- Number of inpatients: 9
- Time per inpatient: 20 minutes
- Total time spent on rounds: 9 * 20 = 180 minutes

Time spent on appointments: 
- Number of appointments: 10
- Time per appointment: 30 minutes
- Total time spent on appointments: 10 * 30 = 300 minutes

Total time spent on rounds and appointments: 180 + 300 = 480 minutes

Since Doctor Jones works for 9 hours at the clinic, we need to convert this to minutes: 
- 9 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 540 minutes

Now, we subtract the total time spent on rounds and appointments from the total time he works: 
- 540 minutes - 480 minutes = 60 minutes

To convert this back to hours, we divide by 60: 
- 60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

So, Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records.

"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake. 

First, let's add the time it takes to make the cake batter (20 minutes) and bake the cake (30 minutes): 20 + 30 = 50 minutes.

Next, we add the time it takes to cool the cake (2 hours, which is 120 minutes) and the time it takes to frost the cake (10 minutes): 120 + 10 = 130 minutes. 

Now, we add the time it takes to make the cake batter and bake the cake (50 minutes) to the time it takes to cool and frost the cake (130 minutes): 50 + 130 = 180 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 180 minutes to hours by dividing by 60: 180 / 60 = 3 hours.

Now, we add the 3 hours to the time at which Jordan wants to serve the cake (5:00 pm) to find the latest time she can start making the cake: 5:00 pm + 3 hours = 8:00 pm.

The final answer is 8."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we need to first find the total number of boxes sold by both Lisa and Peter. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so together they sold 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

Since they sold 64 chocolate bars together and they sold 8 boxes, we can find the number of chocolate bars in a box by dividing the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes.

Number of chocolate bars in a box = Total number of chocolate bars / Total number of boxes
= 64 / 8
= 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total earnings per week and then multiply it by 4 (since there are 4 weeks in a month).

First, let's calculate the total earnings per session:

- Studio rental cost per session: $25
- Student cost per session: $1.50 per student * 10 students = $15
- Total cost per session: $25 + $15 = $40

Since the studio is rented 3 days a week, the total number of sessions per week is 3. 

Total earnings per week: $40 * 3 sessions = $120

Now, let's calculate the total earnings per month:

Total earnings per month: $120 * 4 weeks = $480

The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is $480."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box for both Peter and Martha, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes.

For Peter: 64 chocolate bars / 4 boxes = 16 chocolate bars per box
For Martha: 56 chocolate bars / 7 boxes = 8 chocolate bars per box

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter and Martha. 
Difference = 16 - 8 = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the number of female porcupines, we multiply the total population by 3/5. 

Number of female porcupines = 50 * (3/5) = 30

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, the total number of babies born in a month is 30 * 4 = 120.

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is 120 * 12 = 1440.

The total number of porcupines after a year will be the sum of the initial population and the number of babies born in a year. 

Total porcupines after a year = 50 + 1440 = 1490

The final answer is: 1490"
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth of the pool. 

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the gallons of water needed, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. There are 7.48 gallons in a cubic foot, so:

Volume in gallons = 1400 * 7.48
Volume in gallons = 10472 gallons

Now, we multiply the volume in gallons by 5.9 to get the total gallons of water needed:
Total gallons = 10472 * 5.9
Total gallons = 61851.28 gallons

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon, so we multiply the total gallons by the cost per gallon:
Cost = 61851.28 * 0.10
Cost = 6185.128

The final answer is: $6185.13"
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to calculate the number of blue and yellow sticks first. 

We know there are 9 red sticks and 5 more blue sticks than red. So, the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14.

The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is 14 - 3 = 11.

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks: 9 (red) + 14 (blue) + 11 (yellow) = 34.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the distance traveled by Matteo, we multiply his speed by the time he traveled: 55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles.

To find the distance traveled by Shandy, we multiply his speed by the time he traveled: 45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles.

Now, we subtract the distance traveled by Matteo from the distance traveled by Shandy to find the difference: 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles.

The final answer is: 230"
"To find the number of female students, we first need to find the total number of male and female students over 16 and under 16.

Total students = 3000

Half of the students are over 16 years old: 3000 / 2 = 1500
One-fourth of the students over 16 are male: 1500 / 4 = 375 male students over 16
So, the number of female students over 16 = 1500 - 375 = 1125

The remaining half of the students are under 16 years old: 3000 / 2 = 1500
One-half of the students under 16 are male: 1500 / 2 = 750 male students under 16
So, the number of female students under 16 = 1500 - 750 = 750

Now, we can find the total number of female students by adding the number of female students over 16 and under 16: 1125 + 750 = 1875

The final answer is: 1875"
"To find out how many laps each person can run, we need to calculate their individual lap counts.

Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.

Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.

Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.

Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract Quinn's lap count from Bethany's lap count: 10 - 5 = 5.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, let's find out how much water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the first day. 

Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. 
Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. 
Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

Now, let's find the total amount of water pumped on the first day: 4500 (Wanda) + 3375 (Ms. B) = 7875 gallons.
And the total amount of water pumped on the second day: 3000 (Wanda) + 1125 (Ms. B) = 4125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped in two days is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.

Since the tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, the remaining amount of water needed to fill the tank is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is: 6000"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the first part where the power bank loses 9% of its capacity per hour for 5 hours, and the second part where it loses 7% of its capacity per hour for 3 hours.

Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is x.

In the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining is 0.91x (since 100% - 9% = 91%).

Now, in the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining is 0.91x * 0.93 (since 100% - 7% = 93%).

We are given that the final charge remaining is 28%. So, we can set up the equation:

0.91x * 0.93 = 0.28

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.8463 (which is 0.91 * 0.93):

x = 0.28 / 0.8463
x = 0.33

So, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 33%.

The final answer is: 33"
"To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work, we first need to calculate her total weekly earnings. 

Her hourly wage is $10, and she works 40 hours a week, so her weekly wage is 10 * 40 = $400.

She also earns $15 an hour from tips, so her total weekly earnings from tips is 15 * 40 = $600.

Her total weekly earnings is the sum of her wage and tips, which is 400 + 600 = $1000.

Now, we need to find out how much Janet needs to save for the down payment. She wants to save 20% of the cost of the car, which is 0.2 * 10000 = $2000.

To find out how many weeks she needs to work, we divide the amount she needs to save by her total weekly earnings: 2000 / 1000 = 2.

"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of money he has spent so far. 

3 peaches at $0.5 each will be 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
4 pears at $0.5 each will be 4 * $0.5 = $2
2 kiwis at $1 each will be 2 * $1 = $2
5 apples at $0.75 each will be 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Adding these amounts together, Jamaar has spent $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9 so far.

Since Jamaar has $10, he has $10 - $9 = $1 left.

Plums cost $0.25 each, so we can divide the remaining amount by the cost of one plum to find out how many plums he can buy: $1 / $0.25 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many pieces of sweets each of her friends received, we first need to find out how many packs Anne gave to her friends. Since she kept 2 packs for herself, she gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs.

Now, we need to divide the total number of packs given away (13) by the number of friends (10) to find out how many packs each friend received. 

13 packs / 10 friends = 1.3 packs per friend.

Since each pack has 60 pieces, we multiply the number of packs each friend received by the number of pieces in each pack to find out the total number of pieces each friend received.

1.3 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 78 pieces.

So, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets.

"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the increase in price each year and add it to the original price.

Year 1: 
Original price = $120
Increase in price = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Original price = $126
Increase in price = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Original price = $132.30
Increase in price = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many pictures Olivia put into each album. Since she put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide the total number of pictures by 8.

Total pictures = 72
Pictures per album = Total pictures / Number of albums
Pictures per album = 72 / 8
Pictures per album = 9

Since 3 albums were selfies only and 2 albums were portraits, the remaining 3 albums must be a mix of both selfies and portraits. However, we are not given any information about the mix of selfies and portraits in these 3 albums. 

But we can still find the total number of selfies and portraits. Since 3 albums were selfies only, the total number of selfies is 3 * 9 = 27. Similarly, 2 albums were portraits only, so the total number of portraits is 2 * 9 = 18.

The final answer is:

"To find out how long James spends reading, we need to determine how many sets of 3 pages he reads and then multiply that by the time it takes him to read one set of 3 pages.

Since James reads 18 pages, we can divide 18 by 3 to find out how many sets of 3 pages he reads: 18 / 3 = 6.

Now, we know it takes James 10 minutes to read one set of 3 pages. Since he reads 6 sets, we multiply 10 minutes by 6: 10 * 6 = 60.

James spends 60 minutes reading his book."
"To find the current number of guests in the hotel, we need to calculate the number of guests who checked in and subtract the number of guests who checked out.

Initially, the hotel had 100 guests.

24 guests checked out early, so the remaining guests are 100 - 24 = 76.

15 guests opted for a late checkout, so the number of guests who have checked out is 24 (early checkouts) + 15 (late checkouts) = 39.

The number of guests who have not checked out is 76 - 39 = 37.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout, which is 2 * 15 = 30.

So, the total number of guests who have checked in is 30 (in the afternoon) + 7 (after dinner) = 37.

Now, we add the number of guests who have checked in to the number of guests who have not checked out: 37 (guests who have not checked out) + 37 (guests who have checked in) = 74.

"To find out how many points Aries is sure to get, we first need to determine the number of questions in each category. 

There are 60 questions in total. 40% of them are easy, so the number of easy questions is 40% of 60, which is 0.4 * 60 = 24 questions. 

The rest of the questions are equally divided between average and difficult, so there are (60 - 24) / 2 = 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, which is 0.75 * 24 = 18 easy questions. She is also sure to get half of the average and difficult questions, which is 0.5 * 18 = 9 average questions and 0.5 * 18 = 9 difficult questions.

So, the total number of questions Aries is sure to get is 18 + 9 + 9 = 36.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's assume the number of large stuffed animals sold is 'x'. Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, the number of small stuffed animals sold is 2x.

The price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal, which is $4. So, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.

The total earnings from the sales are $120. The earnings from the large stuffed animals are $12x, and the earnings from the small stuffed animals are $4 * 2x = $8x.

The total earnings can be represented as the sum of earnings from large and small stuffed animals: $12x + $8x = $20x.

Since the total earnings are $120, we can set up the equation $20x = $120.

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 20: x = $120 / $20 = 6.

Since the number of small stuffed animals sold is 2x, we multiply x by 2: 2 * 6 = 12.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe and then multiply it by 40 dwarves and 30 days.

First, let's find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with an iron pickaxe. Since he can mine twice as much with an iron pickaxe as with his bare hands, he can mine 2 * 12 = 24 pounds of ore per day with an iron pickaxe.

Now, let's find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe. He can mine 50% more with a steel pickaxe than with an iron pickaxe. 50% of 24 pounds is 0.5 * 24 = 12 pounds. So, he can mine 24 + 12 = 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe.

Now, let's find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day with steel pickaxes. 40 dwarves can mine 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds of ore per day.

"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to determine the ratio of the price to the number of sandwiches for the first two packages. 

The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3, so the price per sandwich is $3 / 2 = $1.5 per sandwich. 

The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6, so the price per sandwich is $6 / 4 = $1.5 per sandwich. 

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is consistent across all packages. Therefore, the price per sandwich is $1.5.

To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we multiply the price per sandwich by the number of sandwiches: $1.5 * 8 = $12.

Initial cost of the bedroom set: $3000
Amount Tom gets from selling his old bedroom: $1000
Remaining amount owed: $3000 - $1000 = $2000

Since Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month, we need to calculate 10% of $2000.

10% of $2000 = 0.1 * $2000 = $200

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month.

"To find the number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons after each event.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

First, 40% of the red balloons burst. 40% of 25 is 0.4 * 25 = 10. So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

Next, Sally released half of the yellow balloons. Half of 12 is 12 / 2 = 6. So, 6 yellow balloons were released, leaving 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.

Then, she found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch. 75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6. So, she added 6 blue balloons to her clutch.

"To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to consider the scenarios where he won't get an extension. 

First, let's consider the scenario where the substitute teacher is present. In this case, there's a 50% chance of the substitute teacher being present, and since the homework won't be collected in this scenario, the probability of having to turn in the homework is 0.

Next, let's consider the scenario where the normal teacher is present. In this case, there's a 60% chance (100% - 40% extension chance). Within this 60%, there's a 80% chance (100% - 20% chance of getting a personal extension) that Marcus won't get an extension.

Now, we can calculate the probability of having to turn in the homework:

Probability of substitute teacher: 50% * 0 = 0
Probability of normal teacher and no extension: 60% * 80% = 0.6 * 0.8 = 0.48
Total probability of having to turn in the homework: 0 + 0.48 = 0.48 or 48%

"To solve this problem, we need to find the relationship between the number of small beans and the number of large beans. 

First, we know that eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. This means that the number of small beans is 3 times the number of medium beans. 

Since Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, the number of medium beans is 2 times the number of large beans. 

Let's denote the number of large beans as L. Then, the number of medium beans is 2L, and the number of small beans is 3 * 2L = 6L.

We are given that it takes 75 large beans to fill Grandpa up. So, L = 75.

Now, we can find the number of small beans by substituting L = 75 into the equation for the number of small beans: 6L = 6 * 75 = 450.

"To find out how much Melissa makes per hour after expenses, we need to first calculate her total earnings and total expenses. 

Melissa spends 6 hours a day for 3 days, so her total hours worked is 6 * 3 = 18 hours. 

Her total earnings are $15 per day for 3 days, which is 15 * 3 = $45.

Her total expenses for parking are $3 per day for 3 days, which is 3 * 3 = $9.

Now, we subtract her total expenses from her total earnings to find her net earnings: 45 - 9 = $36.

To find out how much she makes per hour after expenses, we divide her net earnings by her total hours worked: 36 / 18 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of the books and the cost of the pencils separately and then add them together.

The cost of the books is 3 * 16 = 48 dollars.
The cost of the pencils is 3 * 6 = 18 dollars.

Now, we add the cost of the books and the pencils together: 48 + 18 = 66 dollars.

So, Ted spent a total of 66 dollars.

The final answer is: 66"
"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we first need to determine the total number of soda bottles he will place along the driveway. 

The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. To find the total number of bottles, we divide the total width of the driveway by the spacing between the bottles:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Since it takes Richard 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, we multiply the number of bottles by the time it takes to set off each one:

8 bottles * 5 seconds per bottle = 40 seconds

Therefore, it will take Richard 40 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find out how many packs Uncle Franky can make, we first need to determine the total number of apples he has. Since he ordered two boxes and each box has 40 apples, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of apples in each box.

Total apples = 2 boxes * 40 apples/box = 80 apples

Next, we need to find out how many packs he can make with 80 apples. Since each pack has 8 apples, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples in each pack.

Number of packs = Total apples / apples per pack = 80 / 8 = 10

So, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples.

"To find out how much money Amor will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she bought and subtract that from the initial amount of money she had.

The cost of 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese is 2 * $11 = $22.
The cost of 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese is 3 * $6 = $18.
The total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40.

Amor starts with $50, so subtracting the total cost of the cheese from that, we get $50 - $40 = $10.

The final answer is: $10"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim lost due to loans and lost income while in college. 

First, let's calculate the total amount of loans he took: 
4 years * $50,000/year = $200,000

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money he lost due to not working while in college. 
His income before college was $25,000/year. 
His income after college is $25,000 * 3 = $75,000/year. 
The difference in income is $75,000 - $25,000 = $50,000/year. 
The total amount of money he lost due to not working while in college is $50,000/year * 4 years = $200,000.

The total amount of money he needs to earn is the sum of the loans and the lost income: 
$200,000 (loans) + $200,000 (lost income) = $400,000.

Now, let's calculate how long it will take him to earn this amount at his new income of $75,000/year:
Time = Total amount / Annual income
Time = $400,000 / $75,000
Time = 5.33 years

The final answer is: 5.33"
"To find the total area of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the two pieces of fabric. 

The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Since Jim needs the fabric to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, the dimensions of each piece of fabric will be (6 + 2) feet by (8 + 2) feet, which is 8 feet by 10 feet.

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we need to calculate the area of one piece and then multiply it by 2. The area of one piece is 8 feet * 10 feet = 80 square feet. 

Now, we multiply the area of one piece by 2 to get the total area of fabric Jim needs: 80 square feet * 2 = 160 square feet.

The final answer is: 160"
"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then add them up.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. 
One-fifth of 425 is 425 / 5 = 85. 
So, they delivered 85 + 17 = 102 letters on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. 
Twice as many as Tuesday is 102 * 2 = 204. 
So, they delivered 204 + 5 = 209 letters on Wednesday.

Now, let's add up the number of letters delivered each day: 
425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736

The final answer is: 736"

The cost of the pasta salad is 6 people * $6 per person = $36.

Now, let's add the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad together: $65 + $36 = $101.

The total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $101."
"To find the average loss, we first need to calculate the total loss and the total number of races. 

In the first race, Johnny's dad lost $5. 
In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost, so he won 2 * $5 + $1 = $11. 
In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race, so he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.5.

Now, let's calculate the total loss. The total loss is the sum of the losses in the first and third races, which is $5 + $16.5 = $21.5. 

The total number of races is 3.

To find the average loss, we divide the total loss by the total number of races: $21.5 / 3 = $7.166666666666666."
"To find the total population of South America, we need to calculate the total number of people living in all the cities across all the countries.

First, let's find the total number of people living in one country. There are 5 cities in each country, and each city has 1000 people. 

Total people in one country = 5 cities * 1000 people per city = 5000 people

Since there are 26 countries in South America, we multiply the total number of people in one country by the number of countries.

Total people in South America = 5000 people per country * 26 countries = 130,000 people

The final answer is: 130000"
"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we first need to calculate their current heights. 

Xavier's initial height was 4 feet, which is equal to 48 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches). He grew 3 inches over the summer, so his current height is 48 + 3 = 51 inches.

Cole's initial height was 50 inches, and he grew 2 inches over the summer, so his current height is 50 + 2 = 52 inches.

Now, we need to find the difference between their current heights. The difference is 52 - 51 = 1 inch.

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the share of the first person, we need to determine the amounts taken by the second and third people first. 

Let's assume the amount taken by the first person is x. 
The second person took $80 more than the first, so the second person took x + 80. 
The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person took 2(x + 80).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the equation: 
x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms: 
x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920
Combine like terms: 
4x + 240 = 1920

Subtract 240 from both sides: 
4x = 1680

Divide both sides by 4: 
x = 420

The share of the first person is $420. 

The final answer is: $420"
"To find the total hours worked by each painter, we first need to calculate the total hours worked in 3 weeks. 

There are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks have 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Since the painters worked 3/8ths of a day every day, we need to find out how many hours that is. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3/8 * 24 = 9 hours.

Now, we multiply the hours worked per day by the number of days to get the total hours worked: 9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours.

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4 to get the hours worked by each painter: 189 hours / 4 = 47.25 hours.

The final answer is: 47.25"
"Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as 'x'. 

Since Rory retrieved four more balls in the first set than in the second, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set, which is given as 19. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for x, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Expanding the equation:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

Number of balls in the first set = x + 4
= 6 + 4

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year from 2007 to 2010.

The initial price of the car is $20,000.

In 2008, the price depreciates by 21% of $20,000, which is 0.21 * $20,000 = $4,200. So, the price in 2008 is $20,000 - $4,200 = $15,800.

In 2009, the price depreciates by 21% of $15,800, which is 0.21 * $15,800 = $3,318. So, the price in 2009 is $15,800 - $3,318 = $12,482.

In 2010, the price depreciates by 21% of $12,482, which is 0.21 * $12,482 = $2,623.22. So, the price in 2010 is $12,482 - $2,623.22 = $9,858.78.

The price of the car in 2010 is $9,858.78."

"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we first need to calculate how many cups of water she drinks in 30 days. 

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. To find out how many cups she drinks in 30 days, we multiply the number of cups she drinks per day by 30.

8 cups/day * 30 days = 240 cups

Now, we need to convert the total number of cups to gallons. There are 16 cups in a gallon. To find out how many gallons, we divide the total number of cups by 16.

240 cups / 16 cups/gallon = 15 gallons

So, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days.

"To find the total amount Alison spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

1. The tank top costs $10.
2. The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $10 + $5 = $15.
3. The tennis shoes were originally $48, but they were on sale for half price. Half of $48 is $48 / 2 = $24.
4. The athletic socks cost $8, and she had a coupon for $2 off, so she paid $8 - $2 = $6 for the socks.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items:

"To find out how many loads of laundry Greg does in a week, we need to calculate the total number of sheets he puts on the beds and then divide it by the number of sheets he can wash at a time.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. Since a twin bed has 1 set of sheets and a king size bed has 1 set of sheets, the total number of sheets he puts on the beds is 4 + 1 = 5.

Since a twin set of sheets is washed at a time, and there are 4 twin beds, Greg needs to wash 4 sets of twin sheets. Additionally, he needs to wash 1 king set of sheets. So, in total, he needs to wash 4 + 1 = 5 sets of sheets every week.

Since his laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 2 and 1, which is 2. This means he can wash 2 sets of sheets at a time.

To find out how many loads of laundry he does in a week, we divide the total number of sets of sheets he needs to wash (5) by the number of sets he can wash at a time (2). 5 / 2 = 2.5. However, since we can't have half a load, we round up to the nearest whole number. So, he does 3 loads of laundry every week.

To find out how many loads of laundry he does in a year, we multiply the number of loads he does in a week (3) by the number of weeks in a year (52). 3 * 52 = 156.

"To find out how many days the cat food will last, we need to divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the amount of cat food each cat eats per day (60 grams).

First, we need to calculate the total amount of cat food Imma's 3 cats eat per day. Since each cat eats 60 grams of food twice a day, we multiply 60 grams by 2 to get the daily consumption per cat, which is 120 grams. Then, we multiply this by the number of cats, which is 3.

Daily consumption per cat: 60 grams * 2 = 120 grams
Total daily consumption for 3 cats: 120 grams * 3 = 360 grams

Now, we divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the total daily consumption (360 grams) to find out how many days it will last.

720 grams / 360 grams = 2

So, the cat food will last for 2 days.

"Let's denote the time Donovan took as 'x'. Since Betsy took 18 minutes longer than Donovan, the time Betsy took is 'x + 18'. 

The total time taken to make the meal is the sum of the time taken by both Betsy and Donovan, which is given as 98 minutes. So, we can write the equation as x + (x + 18) = 98.

Combine like terms: 2x + 18 = 98.

Subtract 18 from both sides: 2x = 80.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 40.

Since x is the time Donovan took, and Betsy took 18 minutes longer, Betsy's time is x + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58.

"To calculate the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to calculate the cost of the cast, the visit, the painkillers, and the parking separately and then add them together.

The cost of the cast is $200.

The cost of the visit is $300/hour for 0.5 hours (since it's a 30-minute visit). So, the cost of the visit is $300 * 0.5 = $150.

The cost of the painkillers is $4/pill for 30 pills. So, the cost of the painkillers is $4 * 30 = $120.

The cost of parking is $6/hour for 2 hours. So, the cost of parking is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, let's add all these costs together to get the total cost of the doctor's visit.

Total cost = cost of cast + cost of visit + cost of painkillers + cost of parking
Total cost = $200 + $150 + $120 + $12
Total cost = $482

"To find the total number of pizzas left, we first need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club and the football team.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. 
70% of 20 is 0.7 * 20 = 14 pizzas eaten by the glee club.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. 
They ate 80% of them, which is 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas eaten by the football team.

The total number of pizzas eaten is 14 (by the glee club) + 32 (by the football team) = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered is 20 (by the glee club) + 40 (by the football team) = 60 pizzas.

The number of pizzas left is the total number of pizzas ordered minus the total number of pizzas eaten, which is 60 - 46 = 14 pizzas.

"To find the total cost of postage, we first need to determine the number of small and big coupons Anthony is sending out. 

He wants to send out 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons, so the number of big coupons is 2 * 700 = 1400.

The total number of coupons is 700 (small) + 1400 (big) = 2000.

The cost of mailing small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents.
The cost of mailing big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

The total cost of postage is 3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24600 cents.

Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, so Sidney ordered 10 - 3 = 7 meatball sub sandwiches. 

Each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, so Sidney initially had 7 * 4 = 28 meatballs.

Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, which means he ate 4 * 4 = 16 meatballs.

After Mark ate 4 sub sandwiches, Sidney had 7 - 4 = 3 sub sandwiches left. 

Sidney then ordered 3 more sub sandwiches, so he had a total of 3 + 3 = 6 sub sandwiches left.

The total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is 6 * 4 = 24.

"To find the total cost of the butter, we first need to determine how much Dennis needs to buy. Since he needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants and he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter.

Since the grocery store has a promotion for buy one pound of butter get one half off, we can calculate the cost as follows:

- For the first pound of butter, the cost is $4.00.
- For the second pound of butter, the cost is $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00 (since it's half off).
- For the third pound of butter, the cost is $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00 (since it's half off).
- For the fourth pound of butter, the cost is $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00 (since it's half off).
- For the fifth pound of butter, the cost is $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00 (since it's half off).
- For the sixth pound of butter, the cost is $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00 (since it's half off).

The total cost of the butter is $4.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 = $12.00.

First, let's find the total number of guests. Kayla invited 25 classmates, 7 dance class girls, and 13 family members, but 4 people said they couldn't come. So, the total number of guests is 25 + 7 + 13 - 4 = 41.

Since the theater can accommodate 20 guests for $125, and there are 41 guests, we need to calculate the additional guests. The additional guests are 41 - 20 = 21.

The fee for the additional guests is $6 per person, so the total fee for the additional guests is 21 * 6 = $126.

Now, we add the rental fee and the fee for the additional guests to get the total cost. The total cost is $125 (rental fee) + $126 (fee for additional guests) = $251.

The final answer is: $251"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which means she has 3/4 of her money left. Since she had $60, we can set up the equation:

3/4 * x = 60

To find the total amount of money Maggie had, we can multiply both sides by 4/3:

x = 60 * (4/3)
x = 80

So, Maggie had $80 initially.

Riza spent one-third of her money, which means she has 2/3 of her money left. Since she also had $60, we can set up the equation:

2/3 * y = 60

To find the total amount of money Riza had, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

y = 60 * (3/2)
y = 90

So, Riza had $90 initially.

Now, let's find the total amount of money they had initially:

Maggie's initial money: $80
Riza's initial money: $90
Total initial money: $80 + $90 = $170

Since they spent a portion of their money, we need to find the total amount they spent. Maggie spent 1/4 of her money, which is $20, and Riza spent 1/3 of her money, which is $30. The total amount they spent is:

$20 + $30 = $50

Now, let's subtract the total amount they spent from the total initial money to find the amount they have left:

Total initial money: $170
Total spent: $50
Money left: $170 - $50 = $120

The final answer is: $120"
"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we first need to determine how many bananas the first and second monkeys eat each day. 

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day.

Since there are three monkeys in total, the total number of bananas they eat each day is 10 + 14 + x, where x is the number of bananas the third monkey eats. However, we know that the total number of bananas is 315, and they last for a week, which is 7 days. 

So, the total number of bananas eaten in a week is 315 * 7 = 2205. 

Since they eat the same amount each day, we can divide 2205 by 7 to get the total number of bananas eaten each day, which is 315. 

Now, we know that the first and second monkeys eat 10 + 14 = 24 bananas each day. So, the third monkey eats 315 - 24 = 291 bananas each day.

The final answer is: 291"
"To find out how many puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we need to determine how many pieces he placed in total and then subtract the pieces he placed before the hour. 

Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, which means he placed 500 / 2 = 250 pieces before the hour. 

Then, he finished another 500 piece puzzle within the hour. 

So, the total number of pieces he placed during the hour is 500 (from the second puzzle) + 250 (from the first puzzle) = 750 pieces.

The final answer is: 750"
"To find out how much Jenny paid for the roses, we need to determine if she bought the roses by the dozen or individually. Since she bought 15 roses, it's more cost-effective for her to buy a dozen (12 roses) and 3 individual roses. 

A dozen roses cost $15, and 3 individual roses cost 3 * $2 = $6. So, the total cost is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny arrived with five $5 bills, which is a total of 5 * $5 = $25. 

To find out how much change she gets, we subtract the cost of the roses from the amount she paid with: $25 - $21 = $4.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the $4 into quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so there are 4 * 4 = 16 quarters in $4.

Jenny leaves with 16 quarters.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to calculate the revenue from each item and then add them together.

The revenue from milkshakes is 6 * $5.50 = $33.
The revenue from burger platters is 9 * $11 = $99.
The revenue from sodas is 20 * $1.50 = $30.

Now, let's add the revenue from all items together: $33 + $99 + $30 = $162.

The final answer is: $162"
"To find out how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the time intervals between the trains and the time Paul has to wait for his train.

The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the first train leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. The third train leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it leaves at 125 minutes.

The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes. Since Paul is at the station at time 0, he will wait for 145 minutes for his train.

The final answer is: 145"
"To find out how many more weeks Melanie needs to save toothpicks, we first need to determine how many toothpicks she has saved so far. 

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week and has been doing so for 12 weeks. 

Number of toothpicks saved so far = 10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks.

Since Melanie needs 200 toothpicks in total, we need to find out how many more toothpicks she needs to save. 

Number of toothpicks needed = 200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks.

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to save 80 toothpicks at the rate of 10 toothpicks per week.

Number of weeks needed = 80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we first need to find the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch and the price at which he sold it to his friend.

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price, so the price he paid is 75% of $2000, which is 0.75 * $2000 = $1500.

Then, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, which is 1.2 * $1500 = $1800.

To find the discount percentage, we need to find the difference between the original price and the price at which Mr. Rogers' friend bought the watch, and then divide it by the original price and multiply by 100.

The discount percentage is (($2000 - $1800) / $2000) * 100 = (200 / 2000) * 100 = 10%.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours and then multiply it by the rate at which the springs create jellyfish.

There are 60 minutes in an hour and 60 seconds in a minute. So, the total number of seconds in 4 hours is:

60 minutes/hour * 60 seconds/minute * 4 hours = 14400 seconds

Since each spring creates a new jellyfish every second, the total number of jellyfish created by one spring in 14400 seconds is 14400.

Now, if we have 5 springs working at the same rate, the total number of jellyfish created in 14400 seconds is:

14400 * 5 = 72000

So, 5 springs working at the same rate would create 72000 jellyfish in 4 hours.

The final answer is: 72000"
"To find Frankie's score, we need to first calculate twice Binkie's score. Binkie's score is 90, so twice that would be 2 * 90 = 180.

Since Frankie's score is 15 better than twice Binkie's, we need to add 15 to the result. So, Frankie's score would be 180 + 15 = 195.

The final answer is: 195"
"To find the total time James took to reach the store, we need to consider the round trip. 

First, let's find the total distance James walked. Since he walked halfway to the store and then back home, the total distance is 2 * 4 miles = 8 miles.

Next, we need to find the time it took him to walk this distance. We know James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour. 

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 2 hours

However, this is the total time for the round trip. Since James walked to the store and then back home, we need to find the time it took him to reach the store initially. 

The time it took him to reach the store is half of the total time, which is 2 hours / 2 = 1 hour.

The final answer is: 1"
"To find out how much money Jenny saved, we first need to calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually and then compare it to the cost of buying them in bunches.

If Jenny buys 10 bunches with 4 bananas per bunch, she gets a total of 10 * 4 = 40 bananas.

The cost of buying 40 bananas individually would be 40 * $0.80 = $32.00.

The cost of buying 10 bunches is $3.00 per bunch, so the total cost would be 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

To find the savings, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

So, Jenny saved $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much fence each person gets. Let's say Sam gets x feet of fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets x + 60 feet of fence.

We know that the total amount of fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence. 

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we need to determine the rate at which it grows per year. 

The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. To find the annual growth rate, we divide the total growth by the number of years: 8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches per year.

Now, we can multiply the annual growth rate by the number of years to find the total growth: 2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches.

The final answer is: 26"
"To find out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply it by its price.

First, let's find the number of each type of bike sold:

- Total bikes sold: 300
- Trekking bikes: 300 / 2 = 150
- BMX bikes: 300 * 0.15 = 45
- MTB bikes: 300 - (150 + 45) = 105

Now, let's calculate the revenue from each type of bike:
- Revenue from Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500
- Revenue from BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250 (since BMX is half the price of MTB, which is $500, so BMX is $500 / 2 = $250)
- Revenue from MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500

Now, let's add up the revenue from all types of bikes:
$67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250

The final answer is: $131,250"
"To find out how many bales of hay are left in the field, we need to calculate the total number of bales made by the farmer and the total number of bales picked up by the truck, and then subtract the latter from the former.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the farmer will make 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck will pick up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

Now, to find the number of bales left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the total number of bales made by the farmer: 30 - 18 = 12.

The number of bales of hay left in the field is 12."
"To find the total time John spends learning, we need to calculate the time spent in classes and the extra time spent on Saturday and Sunday.

First, let's calculate the time spent in classes. John takes 2 extra classes, each 40 minutes long, 5 days a week. So, the total time spent in classes per week is:
2 classes/day * 40 minutes/class * 5 days/week = 400 minutes/week

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time spent in classes to hours:
400 minutes/week / 60 minutes/hour = 6.67 hours/week

Next, let's calculate the extra time spent on Saturday and Sunday. John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on extra learning time. There are 7 days in a week, so the total minutes in a week is:
7 days/week * 24 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour = 1680 minutes/week

John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on extra learning time:
(1/16) * 1680 minutes/week = 105 minutes/week

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the extra time to hours:
105 minutes/week / 60 minutes/hour = 1.75 hours/week

Now, we add the time spent in classes and the extra time spent on Saturday and Sunday to find the total time spent learning:
6.67 hours/week + 1.75 hours/week = 8.42 hours/week

The final answer is: 8.42"
"To find the height of the ball on its second bounce, we need to first find the initial height from which it is dropped. Since the third floor is 24 feet high, the initial height is 3 * 24 = 72 feet.

The ball bounces to 2/3rds of its starting height with each bounce. So, on the first bounce, it will reach a height of 2/3 * 72 = 48 feet.

On the second bounce, it will again reach 2/3 of the height it reached on the first bounce, which is 2/3 * 48 = 32 feet.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the height of each child in inches. 

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the first child's height in inches is 6 * 12 = 72 inches.

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child's height is 72 + 2 = 74 inches.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child's height is 74 - 5 = 69 inches.

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child's height is 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

The final answer is: 72"
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to determine the number of bags sold and then multiply it by the price per bag.

Since the orchard sold a total of 2000 apples and each bag contains 10 apples, we can find the number of bags sold by dividing the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag:

Number of bags sold = Total apples / Apples per bag
= 2000 / 10
= 200

Now, we can find the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags sold by the price per bag:

Total earnings = Number of bags sold * Price per bag
= 200 * $5
= $1000

The final answer is: $1000"
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the amount of meat left after the Allosaurus ate. 

The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat. Before that, the velociraptors scavenged half of what was left. So, the amount of meat left after the velociraptors ate was twice the amount the Allosaurus ate, which is 2 * 270 = 540 kilograms.

Now, the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, which means the velociraptors scavenged half of the remaining half. So, the amount of meat left after the T-Rex ate was twice the amount the velociraptors ate, which is 2 * 540 = 1080 kilograms.

Since the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, the original amount of meat on the triceratops was twice the amount the T-Rex ate, which is 2 * 1080 = 2160 kilograms.

The final answer is: 2160"
"To find the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted and then divide it by the coverage of a gallon of paint to find out how many gallons are needed. 

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so their total area is 2 x (10 x 8) = 160 square feet. The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so their total area is 2 x (5 x 8) = 80 square feet. The total area of all the walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons. 

Each gallon costs $12, so the total cost of painting the room is 12 gallons x $12 per gallon = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To find the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to determine the probability of her choosing a shaken can out of the remaining cans.

Initially, there were 12 sodas. Ellen shook 3 of them, so 3 were shaken and 9 were unshaken. She took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 11 sodas. Her brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 2 shaken and 7 unshaken sodas.

The total number of sodas left is 2 + 7 = 9. The number of shaken sodas left is 2. 

The probability of Ellen's friend choosing a shaken can is the number of shaken cans divided by the total number of cans: 2/9.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (2/9) * 100 = 22.22%."
"To find the distance between the two trains after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled and then add those distances together.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, we add the distances they've traveled to find the total distance between them: 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

The final answer is: 270"
"To find out how many people Billy can help, we first need to determine the total number of days he works. 

March has 31 days, and April has 19 days (since April 19th is the last day he works). So, the total number of days in this period is 31 + 19 = 50 days.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, we need to find 20% of 50. To do this, we multiply 50 by 0.2 (which is the decimal form of 20%). 

20% of 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10 days off.

Now, we subtract the number of days off from the total number of days to find the number of days he works: 50 - 10 = 40 days.

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so we need to find out how many hours he works in a day. 

3 hours/day * 2 people/hour = 6 people/day.

Now, we multiply the number of people he can help per day by the number of days he works: 6 people/day * 40 days = 240 people.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the total number of people inside the church, we first need to calculate the total number of people that were transported by the buses and the cars. 

The number of people transported by the buses is the number of buses multiplied by the number of people each bus can carry. 
Number of buses = 12
Number of people per bus = 35
Total people transported by buses = 12 * 35 = 420

The number of people transported by the cars is the number of cars multiplied by the number of people each car can carry. 
Number of cars = 20
Number of people per car = 3
Total people transported by cars = 20 * 3 = 60

The total number of people transported is the sum of the people transported by the buses and the cars. 
Total people transported = 420 + 60 = 480

Since the question asks for the number of people inside the church, we need to subtract the total number of people transported from the total number of people present (which is the sum of the number of buses, cars, and the people inside the church). However, the question does not provide the number of people inside the church. It only provides the number of private cars and buses. 

To find the number of people inside the church, we need to assume that the number of people inside the church is the total number of people present minus the total number of people transported. However, we do not have the total number of people present. 

However, we can assume that the total number of people present is the sum of the number of buses, cars, and the people inside the church. 

Let's denote the number of people inside the church as 'x'. 
Total people present = Number of buses + Number of cars + x
Total people present = 12 + 20 + x
Total people present = 32 + x

The total number of people transported is 480. 
So, the equation becomes: 
32 + x - 480 = 0

Solving for x, we get:
x = 448

The final answer is: 448"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jeff is 10 years older than Martha.
2. Martha is 4 years younger than Mike.
3. Mike is 24 years old.

Since Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, we can calculate Martha's age by subtracting 4 from Mike's age:
Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
Martha's age = 24 - 4
Martha's age = 20

Now that we know Martha's age, we can calculate Jeff's age by adding 10 to Martha's age:
Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
Jeff's age = 20 + 10
Jeff's age = 30

"To find the total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks, we need to calculate the total time spent per day and then multiply it by 5.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 x 15-minute breaks per day. 
Total time spent per day = 30 minutes (lunch) + 2 x 15 minutes (breaks) = 30 + 30 = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60. 
60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Bobby spends 1 hour per day on lunch and breaks. 
Total time spent in 5 days = 1 hour/day x 5 days = 5 hours

The total time spent on lunch and breaks after 5 days is 5 hours."
"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we first need to determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can multiply 8 by 3.5 to find out how many miles Micah ran.

8 * 3.5 = 28 miles

Now that we know Micah ran 28 miles, we can subtract the total miles run by Amber and Micah from the total miles run by all three to find out how many miles Ahito ran.

Total miles run by all three = 52 miles
Miles run by Amber = 8 miles
Miles run by Micah = 28 miles
Miles run by Ahito = Total miles run by all three - (Miles run by Amber + Miles run by Micah)
Miles run by Ahito = 52 - (8 + 28)
Miles run by Ahito = 52 - 36
Miles run by Ahito = 16 miles

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total amount she spent after returning the item and then add that to the initial charge minus the returned item.

First, let's calculate the amount Sheila got back after returning the item:
$85.00 (initial charge) - $15.00 (returned item) = $70.00

Now, let's calculate the cost of the frying pan:
The frying pan was on sale for 20% off $20.00. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage:
$20.00 * 0.20 = $4.00
Now, subtract the discount from the original price:
$20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of the set of towels:
The set of towels was 10% off $30.00. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage:
$30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00
Now, subtract the discount from the original price:
$30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Now, let's add the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels to the amount Sheila got back after returning the item:
$70.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $113.00

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"Let's break down the information given:

- A fifth of the jellyfish are large.
- A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light.
- The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue.
- When a UV light turned on, 6 jellyfish changed color.

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is x/5.

A third of the large jellyfish change color, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (x/5) * (1/3) = x/15.

The remaining large jellyfish do not change color, so the number of large jellyfish that do not change color is (x/5) - (x/15) = 2x/15.

Since the other jellyfish are small and always stay blue, the number of small jellyfish is x - x/5 = 4x/5.

We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color. This includes the large jellyfish that change color, which is x/15. So, we can set up the equation:

x/15 = 6

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 15:

x = 6 * 15
x = 90

The final answer is: 90"
"To find Caroline's age, we need to first find Ben's age, and then multiply it by 3.

We know Chris is 4 years old. Since Ben is two times older than Chris, we can find Ben's age by multiplying Chris's age by 2.

Ben's age = 2 * Chris's age
Ben's age = 2 * 4
Ben's age = 8

Now that we know Ben's age, we can find Caroline's age by multiplying Ben's age by 3.

Caroline's age = 3 * Ben's age
Caroline's age = 3 * 8
Caroline's age = 24

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate Lauren's total savings required for retirement and then determine how many years she needs to work to achieve that.

First, let's calculate Lauren's annual expenses in retirement. Since she plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary, her annual expenses will be 0.4 * $100,000 = $40,000.

Next, we need to calculate the total amount Lauren needs to save for retirement. Assuming she will live for 20 years in retirement, we can use the formula for the present value of an annuity to calculate the total amount she needs to save:

Total Amount = Annual Expenses * Number of Years
Total Amount = $40,000 * 20
Total Amount = $800,000

However, this is the amount she needs to have at the start of retirement. Since she will be saving 20% of her salary each year, we need to calculate the present value of her future savings. We can use the formula for the present value of a growing annuity:

Present Value = Total Amount / (1 + r)^n

However, since we are trying to find the number of years, we will use the formula for the future value of a growing annuity instead:

FV = PMT * (((1 + r)^n - 1) / r)

Where:
FV = Future Value (Total Amount)
PMT = Annual Savings (20% of $100,000) = $20,000
r = Annual Interest Rate (we will assume 0% for simplicity, as we are not given any interest rate)
n = Number of Years

However, we are trying to find the number of years, so we will rearrange the formula to solve for n:

n = ln(FV / PMT) / ln(1 + r)

Since we are not given an interest rate, we will assume 0% interest rate for simplicity. However, this is not a realistic assumption, as it would mean that Lauren's savings would not grow over time. A more realistic assumption would be to use an interest rate that reflects the average return on her investments. However, for the sake of this problem, we will use 0% interest rate.

n = ln($800,000 / $20,000) / ln(1 + 0)
n = ln(40) / ln(1)
n = ln(40)

However, this is not correct, as we are trying to find the number of years it will take to save $800,000, not the number of years it will take to save $40,000. We need to use the formula for the future value of a growing annuity again, but this time, we will solve for n:

FV = PMT * (((1 + r)^n - 1) / r)
$800,000 = $20,000 * (((1 + 0)^n - 1) / 0)

This is not a valid equation, as it would result in division by zero. We need to use a different approach.

Let's try a different method. We can use the formula for the future value of a series:

FV = PMT * (((1 + r)^n - 1) / r)

However, we are trying to find the number of years, so we will rearrange the formula to solve for n:

n = ln(FV / PMT) / ln(1 + r)

However, this is not a valid equation, as it would result in division by zero. We need to use a different approach.

Let's try a different method. We can use the fact that Lauren will save 20% of her salary each year, and we can calculate the total amount she will save each year:

Year 1: $20,000
Year 2: $20,000 + $20,000 * 0.20 = $24,000
Year 3: $24,000 + $24,000 * 0.20 = $28,800
...
Year n: $20,000 * (1 + 0.20)^(n-1)

We can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series to calculate the total amount she will save:

Total Amount = $20,000 * ((1 - (1 + 0.20)^n) / (1 - 1))
Total Amount = $20,000 * ((1 - (1.20)^n) / (-0.20))

We can set this equal to $800,000 and solve for n:

$20,000 * ((1 - (1.20)^n) / (-0.20)) = $800,000

We can simplify the equation:

(1 - (1.20)^n) / (-0.20) = 40

We can multiply both sides by -0.20:

1 - (1.20)^n = -8

We can add (1.20)^n to both sides:

1 = (1.20)^n - 8

We can add 8 to both sides:

9 = (1.20)^n

We can take the logarithm of both sides:

ln(9) = n * ln(1.20)

We can divide both sides by ln(1.20):

n = ln(9) / ln(1.20)

n ≈ 14.21

"To find the total population of the school, we need to use the information given about the boys. Since 40% of the school population is 240 boys, we can set up the equation:

40% of total population = 240

To find the total population, we can convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100:

0.4 * total population = 240

Now, we can solve for the total population by dividing both sides by 0.4:

total population = 240 / 0.4
total population = 600

Now that we know the total population, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total population:

number of girls = total population - number of boys
number of girls = 600 - 240
number of girls = 360

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad needs to hike, we first need to calculate the total number of days in June. June has 30 days.

Since Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in 30 days, we can calculate her daily target by dividing the total miles by the number of days:

9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

Soledad is planning to hike 125 miles twice a day, which is a total of 250 miles per day. To find out how many more miles per day she needs to hike, we subtract her planned daily miles from her target daily miles:

310 miles per day - 250 miles per day = 60 miles per day

So, Soledad needs to hike 60 more miles per day to complete her journey on time.

"To find out how much money Raymond has left, we need to first calculate the total amount of money he spent. He spent $5 on a comic book and $19 on a puzzle, so the total amount spent is $5 + $19 = $24.

Now, let's subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money Raymond had. He had $21 initially and spent $24, so the amount left is $21 - $24. However, since you can't have a negative amount of money, this means that Raymond doesn't have enough money to cover the expenses. 

In this case, we need to find the difference between the amount spent and the initial amount. The difference is $24 - $21 = $3. This means Raymond is short $3.

However, the question asks for the amount of money Raymond has left, not the amount he is short. Since he can't afford the expenses, we can say that he has $0 left.

The final answer is: $0"
"To find out how much each book cost, we need to first determine how much Anna spent on the books. Since she had a budget of $16 and has $2 left, she spent $16 - $2 = $14 on the books.

10 miles/day * 7 days = 70 miles

Since Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days, we can set up an equation where Brian's distance is half of Sofie's distance. 

Let x be Brian's distance in 7 days. 
x = 70 miles / 2

x = 35 miles

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers and then find out how many toys the fifth worker must produce to meet the remaining demand.

First, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the 2 workers who produce 6 toys an hour. Since they work for 10 hours, they produce a total of 2 * 6 * 10 = 120 toys.

Next, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the other 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour. Since they work for 10 hours, they produce a total of 2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys.

Now, let's add the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers: 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to meet the order, the total number of toys needed is 400. Therefore, the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers is 400 - 20 = 380 toys.

Now, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers: 200 toys. To find out how many toys the fifth worker produced, we subtract the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers from the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers: 380 - 200 = 180 toys.

Since the fifth worker works for 10 hours, we can find out how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces by dividing the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours worked: 180 / 10 = 18 toys per hour.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so we multiply 60 by 1/4 to find the weight of Elijah's first dog: 60 * (1/4) = 15 pounds.

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so we multiply 60 by 1/2 to find the weight of Elijah's second dog: 60 * (1/2) = 30 pounds.

Now, we add the weights of Elijah's two dogs to find the total weight of his dogs: 15 + 30 = 45 pounds.

To find the total weight of all three dogs, we add the weight of Kory's dog to the total weight of Elijah's dogs: 60 + 45 = 105 pounds.

The final answer is: 105"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's assume Seth had 'x' stickers initially.

Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received x/2 stickers.

Luis used half of the stickers he received, which is (x/2)/2 = x/4 stickers. He gave the rest to Kris, so Kris received x/2 - x/4 = x/4 stickers.

Kris kept 9 stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. This means Kris had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers.

Since Kris received x/4 stickers from Luis, we can set up the equation x/4 = 16 to find the initial number of stickers Seth had.

x/4 = 16
x = 16 * 4
x = 64

So, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning.

The final answer is: 64"
"To find the total number of M&M's John has, we need to calculate the total weight of the M&M's and then multiply it by the number of M&M's per ounce. 

First, let's find the total weight of the M&M's: 3 large bags * 10 ounces = 30 ounces.

Since an ounce of M&M's has 30 M&M's, the total number of M&M's is 30 ounces * 30 M&M's/ounce = 900 M&M's.

Now, we need to find out how many small bags John can make. Each small bag contains 10 M&M's, so we divide the total number of M&M's by 10: 900 M&M's / 10 M&M's/small bag = 90 small bags.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we first need to calculate half of the earth's circumference. 

Half of the earth's circumference is 40,000 km / 2 = 20,000 km.

Since Alfie flies 400 km every day, we can find the number of days it will take him to fly 20,000 km by dividing the total distance by the daily distance.

20,000 km / 400 km/day = 50 days

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the speed of the fastest car, we first need to find the speed of the 2nd fastest car. We know that the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, which is 120 miles per hour. 

Speed of the 2nd fastest car = 5 * 120 miles per hour = 600 miles per hour.

Now, we know that the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. 

Speed of the fastest car = 1.25 * 600 miles per hour = 750 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 750"
"To find Vince's current age, we first need to find Liam's age two years ago. Since Liam is 16 now, two years ago he was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.

Two years ago, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince, so we can set up the equation: 14 = 2 * Vince's age two years ago.

To find Vince's age two years ago, we divide both sides of the equation by 2: Vince's age two years ago = 14 / 2 = 7.

Since we want to find Vince's current age, we need to add 2 to his age two years ago: Vince's current age = 7 + 2 = 9.

The final answer is: 9"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so let's call this number 'x'. 
- Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. Let's call the number of eggs Sarah painted 'y'. Then, Camden painted y + 12 eggs.
- Since Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, we can write the equation: y + (y + 12) = 30.
- Simplifying the equation, we get 2y + 12 = 30.
- Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get 2y = 18.
- Dividing both sides by 2, we get y = 9. So, Sarah painted 9 eggs.
- Since Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.
- We know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs. So, the total number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline is 56 - 30 = 26.
- Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, each of them painted 26 / 2 = 13 eggs.
- Now, we need to find the difference between the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold. Camden painted 21 eggs, and Arnold painted 13 eggs. The difference is 21 - 13 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we first need to find the total number of boxes Nik will need. Since each box can hold 8 crayons and Nik has 200 crayons, we can divide 200 by 8 to find the number of boxes.

200 / 8 = 25

So, Nik will need 25 boxes. Since each box weighs 8 ounces, the total weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, and Nik has 200 crayons, so the total weight of the crayons is 200 * 1 = 200 ounces.

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 200 ounces (boxes) + 200 ounces (crayons) = 400 ounces.

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we can convert the total weight from ounces to pounds by dividing by 16.

400 / 16 = 25

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how much John makes, we first need to determine how many logs he can make from the tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, we calculate 80% of 80 feet.

80% of 80 feet = 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet

Since each log is 4 feet long, we divide the total length of the usable tree by the length of each log to find out how many logs he can make.

64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs

From each log, he cuts 5 planks. So, we multiply the number of logs by the number of planks per log.

16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks

He sells each plank for $1.2. To find the total amount he makes, we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank.

80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96

The final answer is: $96"
"To find the total amount of money they all have together, we first need to determine the monthly earnings of Valerie's brother and their mother.

Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is half of what her brother earns. So, her brother's monthly earnings are 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, which is 2 * ($5000 + $10,000) = 2 * $15,000 = $30,000.

Now, we add up their monthly earnings to find the total amount of money they all have together: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The final answer is: $40,000."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the speed at which Grandma walks on the beach and the sidewalk. 

Let's assume the speed on the beach is x miles per minute. Since she walks at twice the rate on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.

We know that she spends 40 minutes on the beach, and the distance covered on the beach is 2 miles. So, we can use the formula: distance = speed * time. 

For the beach: 2 = x * 40
x = 2 / 40
x = 0.05 miles per minute (speed on the beach)

Now, we know her speed on the beach is 0.05 miles per minute. Since she walks at twice the rate on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2 * 0.05 = 0.1 miles per minute.

Now, let's find the time taken to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk: 
time = distance / speed
time = 1 / 0.1
time = 10 minutes

Since she walks 1 mile on the sidewalk, it takes her 10 minutes. 

Now, let's find the total time taken for the entire 3-mile walk:
Time on the beach = 40 minutes
Time on the sidewalk = 10 minutes
Total time = 40 + 10 = 50 minutes

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how many more weeks it will take Jane to save a total of $60, we first need to calculate how much she has saved so far. 

She has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so the total amount saved is 4 * 8 = $32.

Now, we need to find out how much more she needs to save to reach $60. This is 60 - 32 = $28.

Since she saves $4 per week, we can find out how many weeks it will take her to save $28 by dividing 28 by 4. 

28 / 4 = 7.

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total number of blue birds, we need to calculate the number of blue birds in each group of trees and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of blue birds in the 3 trees with 7 blue birds each:
3 trees * 7 blue birds/tree = 21 blue birds

Next, let's find the number of blue birds in the 2 trees with 4 blue birds each:
2 trees * 4 blue birds/tree = 8 blue birds

Now, let's add the blue birds from the first group, the second group, and the last tree:
21 blue birds + 8 blue birds + 3 blue birds = 32 blue birds

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 * 12 = 24. 

So, initially, Bob had 60 - 24 = 36 marbles.

Now, if he loses 10 marbles, we need to subtract 10 from the initial number of marbles he had. 

36 - 10 = 26

Therefore, Bob will have 26 marbles.

The final answer is: 26"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum temperature of the second bottle of water. 

Let's denote the temperature of the second bottle as x degrees. 

When Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle into his water bottle, the total volume of water in the bottle is 5 ounces. 

Since the temperature of the mixture is at least 40 degrees, we can set up the following equation:

(33 * 4 + x * 1) / 5 >= 40

Simplifying the equation:

132 + x >= 200

Subtracting 132 from both sides:

x >= 68

So, the second bottle must be at least 68 degrees.

The final answer is: 68"
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of cows. Melanie's father starts with 50 cows. Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, there are 21 days in three weeks. 

Number of cows added in three weeks = 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
Total number of cows = Initial number of cows + Number of cows added
Total number of cows = 50 + 420
Total number of cows = 470

Next, let's calculate the number of chickens. Melanie's father starts with 20 chickens. Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. 

Number of chickens added in three weeks = 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens
Total number of chickens = Initial number of chickens + Number of chickens added
Total number of chickens = 20 + 210
Total number of chickens = 230

Now, let's add the total number of cows and chickens to find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks.

Total number of animals = Total number of cows + Total number of chickens
Total number of animals = 470 + 230
Total number of animals = 700

The final answer is: 700"
"To find the cost of each single bagel, we first need to calculate the total cost of the 4 packs of bagels with the discount, and then divide that by the total number of bagels.

The cost of 4 packs of bagels without discount is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00.

Since Russell receives a 10% discount, the discount amount is 10% of $40.00, which is 0.1 * $40.00 = $4.00.

The total cost after the discount is $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Each pack has 9 bagels, so 4 packs have 4 * 9 = 36 bagels.

The cost of each single bagel is $36.00 / 36 = $1.00.

The final answer is: $1.00"
"To find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate, we first need to determine how many scoops 1 less than 3 scoops is. 3 - 1 = 2 scoops.

"To find the total number of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we need to calculate the number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately, and then add them together.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days is 3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs.

In the next 30 days, Chester increases his egg consumption to 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in the next 30 days is 5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs.

Now, we add the total number of eggs from both periods: 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens: 240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozen eggs.

So, the number of red jellybeans = 2 * 17 = 34.

Now, we know the total number of jellybeans is 60. We already know the number of green and red jellybeans, which is 17 + 34 = 51. 

To find the number of blue jellybeans, we subtract the total number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans: 
60 - 51 = 9.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade, we need to calculate the total number of lemons he collects in a year and then multiply it by 10.

First, let's find the total number of lemons he collects in a year. He has 5 trees and each tree gives him 6 lemons per year. 

Total lemons per year = Number of trees * Lemons per tree per year
Total lemons per year = 5 * 6
Total lemons per year = 30

Now, we need to find the total number of lemons he collects in a decade. A decade has 10 years.

Total lemons in a decade = Total lemons per year * Number of years in a decade
Total lemons in a decade = 30 * 10
Total lemons in a decade = 300

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the number of women who remained on the bus, we first need to find the total number of women on the bus initially. 

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, we can assume a common multiple for the ratio. Let's assume the common multiple is x. So, the number of men is 5x and the number of women is 9x.

We know the total number of passengers on the bus is 84. Therefore, the sum of men and women is 84. 

5x + 9x = 84
14x = 84
x = 6

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the number of women on the bus initially. 
Number of women = 9x = 9 * 6 = 54

After 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining is:
54 - 20 = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold, we first need to determine how many bouquets he sold. We know that each bouquet has 12 sunflowers and costs $8. 

Faraday earned $56 from the bouquet per day. To find out how many bouquets he sold, we divide the total earnings from bouquets by the cost of each bouquet: $56 / $8 = 7 bouquets per day.

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the total number of sunflowers sold from bouquets per day is 7 * 12 = 84 sunflowers.

We also know that Faraday earned $26 from the sunflowers per day. Since each sunflower costs $2, the number of sunflowers sold per day is $26 / $2 = 13 sunflowers.

To find the total number of sunflowers sold in a day, we add the sunflowers sold from bouquets and the sunflowers sold individually: 84 + 13 = 97 sunflowers per day.

Since we want to know the total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days, we multiply the daily sunflower sales by 3: 97 * 3 = 291 sunflowers.

The final answer is: 291"
"To find out how much money Adam loses, we first need to determine how many rocks he can buy with his $100. 

Since each rock costs $5, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of each rock: 

$100 / $5 = 20 rocks

Adam sells 60% of his inventory, which is 60% of 20 rocks. To find 60% of 20, we multiply 20 by 0.6:

20 * 0.6 = 12 rocks

Since Adam sells each rock for $7, we can find the total revenue by multiplying the number of rocks sold by the selling price:

12 rocks * $7/rock = $84

However, Adam's initial investment was $100, so we need to find out how much he would have made if he sold all the rocks. Since he sells each rock for $7 and has 20 rocks, we can find the total revenue by multiplying the number of rocks by the selling price:

20 rocks * $7/rock = $140

Now, we can find the total loss by subtracting the revenue from the initial investment:

$100 - $84 = $16

However, this is not the total loss. We need to find the loss from selling only 60% of the inventory. To do this, we need to find the revenue from selling 60% of the inventory and subtract it from the initial investment.

We already know the revenue from selling 60% of the inventory is $84. To find the loss, we subtract this from the initial investment:

Now, we can find the total loss by subtracting the revenue from the initial investment:

$100 - $140 = -$40

However, a loss of $40 is not possible since Adam started with a positive amount of money. This means that Adam's initial calculation was incorrect. We need to recalculate the total revenue from selling 100% of the inventory and subtract it from the initial investment.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of days it takes Lauren to complete each type of picture scene. 

First, let's find the number of days it takes Lauren to complete each type of picture scene:

- Large-sized picture scenes: 45 / 5 = 9 days
- Medium-sized picture scenes: 36 / 6 = 6 days
- Small-sized picture scenes: 49 / 7 = 7 days

Now, we need to find the LCM of 9, 6, and 7. 

The prime factorization of 6 is 2 * 3.
The prime factorization of 7 is 7.
The prime factorization of 9 is 3^2.

To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the numbers:
LCM(6, 7, 9) = 2 * 3^2 * 7 = 2 * 9 * 7 = 126

So, it will take Lauren 126 days to complete all the picture scenes. 

The final answer is: 126"
"To find out how many eggs each child receives, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of children. 

First, let's determine the total number of eggs. Chatty prepared three dozen eggs. Since one dozen is equal to 12, three dozen would be 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Now, we have 36 eggs and 4 children. To find out how many eggs each child receives, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of children: 36 / 4 = 9.

So, each child receives 9 eggs.

"To find out how much Jen spends on food for her fish in May, we need to calculate the total cost of food for a month. 

First, we need to determine the number of days in May. May has 31 days. 

Since each fish needs $1 worth of food a day, and Jen has 3 fish, the daily cost of food for all her fish is 3 * $1 = $3.

To find the total cost for the month, we multiply the daily cost by the number of days in May: $3 * 31 = $93.

So, Jen spends $93 on food for her fish in May.

"To find out how many roses Patricia has now, we need to first determine how many roses she had after giving some to her mother. 

Initially, Patricia had 30 roses. She gave 24 roses to her mother, so we subtract 24 from 30 to find out how many roses she had left. 

30 - 24 = 6

Now, Patricia bought 15 more roses. To find out the total number of roses she has now, we add the 15 new roses to the 6 she already had.

6 + 15 = 21

So, Patricia now has 21 roses.

"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken. 

The total distance traveled is 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles.

The total time taken is 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours.

The average speed is calculated by dividing the total distance by the total time. 

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
Average speed = 250 miles / 5 hours
Average speed = 50 miles per hour.

"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the individual probabilities of each ticket winning.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as a decimal: 0.20.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability is 3 times the probability of the first ticket: 3 * 0.20 = 0.60.

To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we multiply the individual probabilities: 0.20 * 0.60 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem.

1. Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected. So, if we let x be the number of seashells Carlos collected, then Jim collected x + 5 seashells. We know that Jim collected 27 seashells, so we can set up the equation x + 5 = 27.

2. To find the number of seashells Carlos collected, we need to solve the equation x + 5 = 27. Subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation gives us x = 22. So, Carlos collected 22 seashells.

3. Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. If we let y be the number of seashells Carrey collected, then we can set up the equation 2y = 22. To find the number of seashells Carrey collected, we need to solve for y. Dividing both sides of the equation by 2 gives us y = 11. So, Carrey collected 11 seashells.

4. Now that we know the total number of seashells each person collected, we can find the total number of seashells they gathered. Carlos collected 22 seashells, Jim collected 27 seashells, and Carrey collected 11 seashells. The total number of seashells is 22 + 27 + 11 = 60.

5. Since they divided the seashells equally among themselves, we need to divide the total number of seashells by 3 to find out how many each person got. 60 / 3 = 20.

"To find out how many carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and add the number of carrots he eats on the weekend.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday). So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is 4 * 5 = 20.

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is 5 + 5 = 10.

Now, let's add the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend: 20 + 10 = 30.

Therefore, Mason eats 30 carrots in a week.

"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song first. 

The first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. To find 60% of 5 minutes, we multiply 5 by 0.6. 

5 * 0.6 = 3 minutes

Now, we add the 60% increase to the original length of the first song to find the length of the second song. 

5 + 3 = 8 minutes

The second song is 8 minutes long. To find the total time of the cassette, we add the length of the first and second songs.

5 + 8 = 13 minutes

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes.

"To find the total profit, we first need to calculate the profit from each device. 

The cost price of one device is $20. 
The selling price of one device is twice the cost price, which is 2 * $20 = $40.

The profit from one device is the selling price minus the cost price, which is $40 - $20 = $20.

Linus bought 2 devices on Monday and 4 devices on Tuesday, so the total number of devices bought is 2 + 4 = 6.

The total profit is the profit from one device multiplied by the total number of devices, which is $20 * 6 = $120.

"To find the length of Carl's cane, we first need to determine Carl's height. We know that Isabel is 7 feet tall and Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel. 

Isabel's height = 7 feet
Ned's height = Isabel's height - 2 feet
Ned's height = 7 - 2
Ned's height = 5 feet

Since Carl is one foot taller than Ned, we can calculate Carl's height as follows:
Carl's height = Ned's height + 1 foot
Carl's height = 5 + 1
Carl's height = 6 feet

We are given that Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. To find the length of the cane, we can divide Carl's height by 2.
Cane's length = Carl's height / 2
Cane's length = 6 / 2
Cane's length = 3 feet

"To find out how many bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles required to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

Since each juice can cover 20% of one person's daily energy demand, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, we need 100 / 20 = 5 bottles.

For 2300 people, we need 2300 * 5 = 11500 bottles.

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, to find out how many more bottles it needs to produce, we subtract the number of bottles it can produce from the total number of bottles required: 11500 - 4200 = 7300.

The final answer is: 7300"
"To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we first need to determine the number of babies wearing purple and bows, and the total number of babies wearing bows.

Let's assume there are 8 babies in total since Carla gave birth to octuplets. 

3/4 of the babies are dressed in purple, which is (3/4) * 8 = 6 babies. 
1/4 of the babies are dressed in blue, which is (1/4) * 8 = 2 babies.

Now, we need to find the number of babies wearing bows. All 2 babies wearing blue also wear bows. Additionally, 1/3 of the purple babies wear bows, which is (1/3) * 6 = 2 babies. So, the total number of babies wearing bows is 2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4 babies.

The number of babies wearing purple and bows is 2.

To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we divide the number of babies wearing purple and bows by the total number of babies wearing bows, and then multiply by 100.

(2 / 4) * 100 = 50%

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the number of reports received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday, and then subtract that result from the total number of reports received last week.

Total reports received last week = 5168
Reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

First, let's find the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday. 

Reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

Now, let's find the total number of reports received on Wednesday by subtracting the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday. However, we need to subtract the reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total reports received last week to get the reports received on Wednesday.

Reports received on Wednesday = Total reports received last week - (Reports received on Monday and Tuesday + Reports received on Thursday and Friday)
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - (1907 + 2136)
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - 4043
Reports received on Wednesday = 1125

The final answer is: 1125"
"To find the total amount of money Abraham will earn, we need to calculate the amount of money he earned from each sale and add them together.

First, Abraham sold half of his land for $50. Since he owns 80 square meters, half of that is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters. 

Next, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. Since he owns 80 square meters, 1/4 of that is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters. 

Now, let's calculate the amount of land he has left. He started with 80 square meters, sold 40 square meters, and then sold 20 square meters. So, he has 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters left.

He sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, the amount of money he earned from selling the remaining land is 20 * 3 = $60.

Now, let's add up the money he earned from each sale: $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

The final answer is: $140"
"To find Geb's age, we need to first calculate half of Haley's age. Haley is 26 years old, so half of her age would be 26 / 2 = 13.

Since Geb is 10 less than half of Haley's age, we need to subtract 10 from 13. 

13 - 10 = 3

Geb is 3 years old."
"To find out how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to first find out how many face masks he uses in a day. 

Since Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out and he goes out three times a day, the total number of face masks he uses in a day is 2 * 3 = 6.

Now, to find out how many face masks he uses in 2 days, we multiply the number of face masks he uses in a day by 2. 

6 * 2 = 12

So, Tyrion uses 12 face masks every 2 days."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that Cole hid 3 dozen eggs. Since a dozen is 12, we can calculate the total number of eggs as 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs, Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 2 * 5 = 10 eggs. Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs. Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up the number of eggs found by each person: 5 (Lamar) + 10 (Stacy) + 8 (Charlie) + 4 (Mei) = 27 eggs.

To find the number of eggs still hidden in the yard, we subtract the number of eggs found from the total number of eggs: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the total amount John makes in a week, we first need to determine the number of apartments in each complex and the total number of collections he makes in a week.

The first two apartment complexes have 200 apartments each, so the total number of apartments in these two complexes is 2 * 200 = 400.

The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, which means it is 160% of the other two combined (100% + 60% = 160%). To find the number of apartments in the last complex, we multiply the total number of apartments in the first two complexes by 1.6 (which is the same as 160% or 160/100).

Number of apartments in the last complex = 400 * 1.6 = 640

Total number of apartments = 400 + 640 = 1040

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so the total number of collections he makes in a week is 3 * 1040 = 3120.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection for each apartment, so the total amount he makes in a week is 3120 * $0.40 = $1248.

The final answer is: $1248"
"To find the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree, we need to calculate the fruits produced each year and add them up.

In the 5th year, the tree produces 50 fruits.
In the 6th year, it produces 3 times the initial amount, which is 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
In the 7th year, it produces 7 times the initial amount, which is 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
In the 8th year, it produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. Since a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits, an 8-year-old tree produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.
In the 9th year, the tree doesn't produce any fruits.
In the 10th year, it produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now, let's add up the fruits produced each year: 
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350

The total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree during its 10 years of life is 2350."
"To find out how much money Jack has now, we need to calculate the amount Sophia gave him and add it to his initial amount.

Sophia gave Jack 1/5 of her $100. To find 1/5 of $100, we multiply $100 by 1/5, which is the same as dividing $100 by 5.

$100 / 5 = $20

So, Sophia gave Jack $20. 

Now, we add this amount to Jack's initial $100.

$100 + $20 = $120

Jack now has $120."
"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as B, the length of the yellow rope as Y, and the length of the red rope as R. We are given that R = 4B and B = Y - 7.

We can express Y in terms of B as Y = B + 7. 

Now, we can express R in terms of B as R = 4B. 

The total length of the three ropes is given as 37 centimeters, so we can write the equation: R + B + Y = 37.

Substituting the expressions for R and Y in terms of B into the equation, we get: 4B + B + (B + 7) = 37.

Combine like terms: 6B + 7 = 37.

Subtract 7 from both sides: 6B = 30.

Divide both sides by 6: B = 5.

Now that we know the length of the blue rope, we can find the length of the red rope: R = 4B = 4 * 5 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's assume Ronnie was given $5 initially. Since Rissa was given thrice as much, Rissa was given 3 * 5 = $15.

After giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, let's call the amount given to the little sister 'x'. So, both Ronnie and Rissa gave x dollars to their little sister.

Ronnie's remaining money = Initial money - Money given to the little sister
= 5 - x

Rissa's remaining money = Initial money - Money given to the little sister
= 15 - x

According to the problem, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. So, we can set up the equation:

15 - x = (4/5) * 15

Simplifying the equation, we get:
15 - x = 12

Now, let's solve for x:
x = 15 - 12
x = 3

So, both Ronnie and Rissa gave $3 to their little sister.

Now, let's find out how much money Ronnie has left:
Ronnie's remaining money = Initial money - Money given to the little sister
= 5 - 3
= 2

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that there are four colors of paint: red, white, purple, and yellow. We also know that there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint. Let's denote the amount of red, white, and purple paint as 'x'. 

Since half the mural is yellow, the amount of yellow paint is 12 / 2 = 6 pints.

The total amount of paint used is 12 pints, which is the sum of the amounts of red, white, purple, and yellow paint. We can write this as an equation: x + x + x + 6 = 12.

Combine like terms: 3x + 6 = 12.

Subtract 6 from both sides: 3x = 6.

Divide both sides by 3: x = 2.

Since x represents the amount of red, white, and purple paint, the amount of red paint used is x = 2 pints.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house, and then add them together.

First, let's find the area of one bedroom: 
Area of one bedroom = length * width = 20 * 12 = 240 square feet

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms = 4 * 240 = 960 square feet

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area = 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet

The rest of the house is given as 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas together: 
Total area of the house = area of bedrooms + area of living room + area of the rest of the house
Total area of the house = 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 square feet

The final answer is: 3160"
"To find the total number of clouds Alice counted, we need to calculate the number of clouds she saw each day and add them up.

On Monday, she saw 3 clouds.
On Tuesday, she saw double the number of clouds as Monday, which is 3 * 2 = 6 clouds.
On Wednesday, she saw double the number of clouds as Tuesday, which is 6 * 2 = 12 clouds.
On Thursday, she saw double the number of clouds as Wednesday, which is 12 * 2 = 24 clouds.
On Friday, she saw double the number of clouds as Thursday, which is 24 * 2 = 48 clouds.

Now, let's add up the number of clouds she saw each day:

"To find out how many dishwashing cycles you can run with the new box for $1, we first need to determine how many pods are in the new box. 

The new box has 20% more pods than the regular box. Since the regular box has 100 pods, we can calculate the number of pods in the new box as follows:

New box pods = 100 + (20% of 100)
New box pods = 100 + (0.2 * 100)
New box pods = 100 + 20
New box pods = 120

Now, we know that the new box costs $12 and has 120 pods. To find out how many dishwashing cycles you can run for $1, we need to divide the total number of pods by the cost of the box and then divide that by the number of pods per cycle (which is 1).

First, let's find out how many cycles you can run with the new box for $12:
Cycles per $12 = New box pods / $12
Cycles per $12 = 120 / 12
Cycles per $12 = 10

Now, to find out how many cycles you can run for $1, we divide the cycles per $12 by 12:
Cycles per $1 = Cycles per $12 / 12
Cycles per $1 = 10 / 12
Cycles per $1 = 0.8333

However, since we can't run a fraction of a cycle, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. 

The final answer is: 0"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. This means he has 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he is left with 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill, which is 40 / 2 = 20 bills. So, he is left with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

Thomas then triples his money, which means he triples the number of bills. So, he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since each bill is now worth $20, he has 60 * 20 = 1200 dollars in 5 dollar bills.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by both teams in the first and second halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

The total number of goals scored by team A is 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals. The total number of goals scored by team B is 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals.

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much chalk is left after Monday and then determine how many days it will last.

The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk. On Monday, he uses 45% of it. 

45% of 5 inches = 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches

So, after Monday, the teacher has 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches of chalk left.

Since the teacher will be using 20% of the chalk each day, we need to find out how many days it will last.

Let's assume the number of days it will last is 'x'. 

The total chalk used in 'x' days will be 20% of 2.75 * x = 0.20 * 2.75 * x = 0.55x inches.

Since the teacher will recycle the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches, we need to find the value of 'x' such that 2.75 - 0.55x < 2.

2.75 - 0.55x < 2
0.55x > 2.75 - 2
0.55x > 0.75
x > 0.75 / 0.55
x > 1.36

Since 'x' represents the number of days, it must be a whole number. Therefore, the teacher will have to recycle the chalk after 2 days.

"To find the number of students not on varsity, we first need to find the number of students on varsity. 

One-third of the girls are on varsity, so the number of girls on varsity is 12 * (1/3) = 4. 
One-fourth of the boys are on varsity, so the number of boys on varsity is 12 * (1/4) = 3.

The total number of students on varsity is 4 (girls) + 3 (boys) = 7.

Since there are 24 students in total (12 boys and 12 girls), the number of students not on varsity is 24 - 7 = 17.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Colin's current age as 'C' and Wendy's current age as 'W'.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:
W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:
C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now, we can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:
C + 25 = (5/3)(C + 7)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction:
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:
75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:
40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2:
20 = C

1. Initially, 2 apples fell out of the tree.
2. Newton picked up 2 apples, put 1 in his pocket, and threw 1 back into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. Now, he has 1 apple in his pocket and 6 new apples (5 from the tree + 1 he threw back). Total apples = 1 (in pocket) + 6 (new) = 7.
3. He put all but 1 of the 6 new apples in his pocket, so he has 1 apple left outside and 6 - 1 = 5 apples in his pocket. Total apples = 1 (outside) + 5 (in pocket) = 6.
4. He threw the remaining 1 apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out. Now, he has 6 apples (from the previous step) + 6 new apples = 12 apples. Total apples = 12.
5. He picked up all the remaining apples, which is 12.

"To find out how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of slices each type of pizza is needed for. 

For the cheese pizza, each friend eats 6 slices, and there are 6 friends, so the total number of cheese pizza slices needed is 6 friends * 6 slices = 36 slices. 

For the pepperoni pizza, each friend eats 4 slices, and there are 6 friends, so the total number of pepperoni pizza slices needed is 6 friends * 4 slices = 24 slices.

Since the cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices and the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, we need to find out how many whole pizzas of each type Kate needs to buy. 

For the cheese pizza, we need 36 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas. 

For the pepperoni pizza, we need 24 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas.

Since Kate needs 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas, she needs a total of 3 + 3 = 6 pizzas.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the net rate at which Jay is building snowballs. 

Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, which is equivalent to 20 / 60 = 1/3 snowballs per minute. 

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, so the rate at which snowballs melt is 2 / 15 = 2/15 snowballs per minute.

The net rate at which Jay is building snowballs is the rate at which he builds them minus the rate at which they melt: 1/3 - 2/15. 

To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 15. So we convert 1/3 to 5/15. 

Now we can subtract: 5/15 - 2/15 = 3/15 snowballs per minute.

Since Jay needs 60 snowballs, and he builds 3/15 snowballs per minute, we can find the time it takes him to build 60 snowballs by dividing 60 by 3/15. 

To divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal: 60 / (3/15) = 60 * (15/3) = 300 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Jay 300 minutes to have 60 snowballs.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as 'x'. 

On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50. So, the remaining bandages after the first day are x - 38.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. The remaining bandages after the second day are (x - 38) - 28.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, which is 2 * 50 = 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages. The remaining bandages after the third day are ((x - 38) - 28) - 25 + 100.

We are given that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. So, we can set up the equation:

((x - 38) - 28) - 25 + 100 = 78

Simplifying the equation:

x - 38 - 28 - 25 + 100 = 78
x - 91 + 100 = 78
x + 9 = 78
x = 69

The initial number of bandages they started with on the first day is 69.

"To find out how much Jason earned, we need to calculate the total amount he earned in a week and then multiply it by 2 since it's a two-week period.

In a week, Jason earns:
- $3.00 for doing his laundry
- $1.50 for cleaning his room
- $0.75 for taking the trash to the curb (twice) = $1.50
- $0.50 for emptying the dishwasher (6 times) = $3.00

Total earnings in a week = $3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 + $3.00 = $8.00

Since it's a two-week period, we multiply the weekly earnings by 2:
$8.00 * 2 = $16.00

Therefore, Jason earned $16.00 in a two-week period.

The final answer is: $16.00"
"To find the total amount of blood in ten sharks, we first need to find the amount of blood in one shark. Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and a whale has 40 gallons of blood, a shark has 3 * 40 = 120 gallons of blood.

Now, to find the total amount of blood in ten sharks, we multiply the amount of blood in one shark by 10. So, 120 * 10 = 1200 gallons.

The final answer is: 1200"
"To find the total number of people who entered the restaurant, we need to calculate the number of people who entered at each time and add them up.

First, 50 people entered in the morning. 
Then, 40 more people entered at 10:00. 
Next, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is 2 * 40 = 80 people. 
Finally, 3 times as many people as the number that came in first (50) entered by evening, which is 3 * 50 = 150 people.

Now, let's add up the number of people who entered at each time: 
50 (morning) + 40 (10:00) + 80 (lunch) + 150 (evening) = 320

The total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day is 320."
"To find the total number of pens Alain has, we first need to determine the number of red pens and black pens. 

Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens, and each pack has 5 pens. So, the total number of red pens is 5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 red pens.

Since Alain's mom bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens, the total number of black pens is 2 * 25 = 50 black pens.

To find the total number of pens Alain has, we add the number of red pens and black pens: 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens.

The final answer is: 75"
"To find the total amount John spent, we first need to determine the cost of the scotch and the cognac separately.

The cost of the scotch is $600 for 10 bottles. So, the cost per bottle of scotch is $600 / 10 = $60.

Since John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The cost of cognac per bottle is 50% more than the cost of scotch per bottle. 50% of $60 is $30, so the cost of cognac per bottle is $60 + $30 = $90.

The total cost of the cognac is 20 * $90 = $1800.

The total amount John spent is the sum of the cost of scotch and cognac: $600 + $1800 = $2400.

The final answer is: $2400"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees. He also planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which means he planted 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, making it a total of 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. For Lodgepole Pine, he planted 1/4 more than the first day, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees. So, the total Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is 40 + 10 = 50.

Now, let's calculate the total number of trees planted in two days. The total White Oak trees planted is 30, and the total Lodgepole Pine trees planted is 50. 

The total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 30 + 50 = 80."
"To find out how much root beer was available for each person to drink, we need to calculate the total amount of root beer remaining after all the incidents. 

Initially, Fred made 24 gallons of root beer. 

On the first day, 4 gallons were consumed by his children. So, the remaining amount is 24 - 4 = 20 gallons.

On the second day, 7 gallons were spilled. So, the remaining amount is 20 - 7 = 13 gallons.

On the third day, 5 gallons were consumed by Ronnie. So, the remaining amount is 13 - 5 = 8 gallons.

On the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party, and they shared the remaining root beer equally. To find out how much each person got, we need to divide the remaining amount by the number of people. 

8 gallons / 3 people = 2.67 gallons per person.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2.67}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge as 'x'. 

The problem states that eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be written as an equation: 4x + 8 = 40.

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate the variable 'x'. We can do this by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation: 4x = 40 - 8.

This simplifies to: 4x = 32.

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for 'x': x = 32 / 4.

x = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the number of fish with red stripes, we need to calculate one-third of the total number of fish. 

Total number of fish = 66
Number of fish with red stripes = (1/3) * 66 = 22

Now, we need to find the number of fish that do not have red stripes. 
Number of fish without red stripes = Total number of fish - Number of fish with red stripes
= 66 - 22
= 44

Next, we need to find the number of fish with blue stripes among the remaining fish. 
Number of fish with blue stripes = (5/11) * 44
= (5 * 4) 
= 20

Now, we need to find the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes. 
Total number of fish with red and blue stripes = Number of fish with red stripes + Number of fish with blue stripes
= 22 + 20
= 42

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's break down the information given. Amy initially had two eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each, so she had 2 * 4 = 8 eyeshadow colors from the palettes. 

She also had three makeup sets with 6 eyeshadow colors each, so she had 3 * 6 = 18 eyeshadow colors from the makeup sets.

In total, Amy had 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors.

Her sister stole one of the palettes, which means Amy lost 4 eyeshadow colors. So, she now has 26 - 4 = 22 eyeshadow colors.

Amy then used up half of the colors from one makeup set. Since each makeup set has 6 eyeshadow colors, half of that would be 6 / 2 = 3 eyeshadow colors.

So, Amy used up 3 eyeshadow colors from the makeup set. Now, she has 22 - 3 = 19 eyeshadow colors left.

The final answer is: 19"
"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we first need to find the total height of the house and the height of the first floor.

Mattison's height is 60 inches. The house is 7 times as high as he is, so the total height of the house is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.

The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison, so the height of the first floor is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

Since the total height of the house is 420 inches and the first floor is 180 inches, the height of the second floor is 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

The height of the roof from the second floor's floor is the same as the height of the first floor, which is 180 inches."
"To find the number of shells found by team Alphas, we need to calculate 40% of 700. 

40% of 700 = 0.4 * 700 = 280 shells.

Now, we know that team Alphas found 280 shells. The remaining shells are 700 - 280 = 420.

Team The finders found 60% of the remaining shells, which is 60% of 420.

60% of 420 = 0.6 * 420 = 252 shells.

Now, we know that team Alphas found 280 shells and team The finders found 252 shells. To find the number of shells found by team Gogetters, we subtract the total shells found by Alphas and The finders from the total number of shells.

Total shells found by Alphas and The finders = 280 + 252 = 532

Shells found by Gogetters = Total shells - Total shells found by Alphas and The finders
= 700 - 532
= 168

"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we first need to calculate the total miles all the dogs need to walk in a day. Since there are 4 dogs and they need to walk an average of 3 miles per day, the total miles they need to walk is 4 * 3 = 12 miles.

Now, let's add up the miles the first three dogs need to walk: 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles.

To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the miles the first three dogs need to walk from the total miles: 12 - 8 = 4 miles.

The last dog needs to walk 4 miles."
"To find out how much money John got from the loan, we need to calculate 40% of the value of his house. 

40% of $250,000 = 0.4 * $250,000 = $100,000

Now, John uses 60% of this amount to pay off his debts. 

60% of $100,000 = 0.6 * $100,000 = $60,000

This means John paid off $60,000 of his debt. To find out how much money he has leftover, we subtract this amount from the loan amount.

$100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000

So, John has $40,000 leftover after paying off his debt.

The final answer is: $40,000"
"To find the total earnings, we need to calculate the total weight of the tunas first. 

The total weight of the tunas is the sum of the weights of the three tunas: 
56 kg + 46 kg + 26 kg = 128 kg

Since a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, we multiply the total weight by the cost per kilogram to find the total earnings:
128 kg * $0.50/kg = $64

The final answer is: $64"
"To find Trinity's profit, we need to first find the selling price of the magazines. 

The cost price of the magazines is $72. Trinity sells the magazines at 11/8 of the cost price. 

To find the selling price, we multiply the cost price by 11/8. 

Selling price = (11/8) * 72
Selling price = (11 * 72) / 8
Selling price = 792 / 8
Selling price = 99

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the cost price from the selling price.

Profit = Selling price - Cost price
Profit = 99 - 72
Profit = 27

The final answer is: $27"
"To find the total amount of water removed, we need to calculate the amount of water removed by each setting and then add them together.

The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total water removed by the low setting is 1 * 3 = 3 liters.

The medium setting removes twice as much water as the low setting, which is 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total water removed by the medium setting is 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

The high setting removes twice as much water as the medium setting, which is 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 5 days, the total water removed by the high setting is 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

Now, let's add the total water removed by each setting: 3 (low) + 6 (medium) + 20 (high) = 29 liters.

"To find the total amount of the second medicine in one dose, we need to multiply 14 mL by 3. 

14 mL * 3 = 42 mL

Now, we know that one dose consists of 14 mL of the first medicine and 42 mL of the second medicine. To find the total amount of one dose, we add these two amounts together.

14 mL + 42 mL = 56 mL

Since we need to find the total amount of medicine in 8 doses, we multiply the amount of one dose by 8.

56 mL * 8 = 448 mL

The final answer is: 448"
"To find the combined capacity of both schools, we first need to find the capacity of John's school. 

Since each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, we can find the capacity of one of John's classes by multiplying Ali's class capacity by 1/8. 

Capacity of one of John's classes = 120 * (1/8) = 15 students

Since John has two classes, we multiply the capacity of one class by 2 to find the total capacity of John's school.

Capacity of John's school = 15 * 2 = 30 students

Now, we add the capacity of Ali's school (which is 120 students) to the capacity of John's school to find the combined capacity of both schools.

Combined capacity = 120 + 30 = 150

The final answer is: 150"
"To find the total amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we first need to calculate the total interest he owes his sister. 

The interest is 2% of the initial $300, which is 0.02 * 300 = $6. 

However, Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, which is a total of 11 * 25 = $275.

So, the remaining amount to be paid in the twelfth month is the initial $300 (the amount borrowed) plus the interest ($6) minus the total paid in the 11 months ($275). 

The total amount to be paid in the twelfth month is 300 + 6 - 275 = 31.

"To find the total number of jelly beans in the jar, we first need to calculate the volume of the jar. The jar has a square base with a side length of 6 inches and a height of 15 inches. 

The volume of the jar can be calculated as the area of the base times the height. The area of the base is 6 * 6 = 36 square inches. 

So, the volume of the jar is 36 * 15 = 540 cubic inches.

Since the jelly beans have an efficiency of 80%, we need to divide the volume of the jar by 0.8 to get the total volume that can be occupied by the jelly beans. 

The total volume occupied by the jelly beans is 540 / 0.8 = 675 cubic inches.

Since each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, we can find the total number of jelly beans by dividing the total volume occupied by the jelly beans by the volume of a single jelly bean.

The total number of jelly beans is 675 / 0.15 = 4500.

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we can find the number of red jelly beans by multiplying the total number of jelly beans by 0.3.

The number of red jelly beans is 4500 * 0.3 = 1350.

However, we are given that the true number of red jelly beans is 900. 

To find how far off Tim's guess was, we need to know what his guess was. Since we don't have that information, we can't calculate the exact difference."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, the bus had 20 people. 

At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus became 20 + 40 = 60.

At the second stop, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. Since 40 people entered at the first station, 3/4 of 40 is (3/4) * 40 = 30. So, 30 people entered the bus at the second stop. The total number of people on the bus became 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus became 2 * 90 = 180.

The bus has a capacity of 200 people. To find the remaining spaces, we subtract the current number of people from the capacity: 200 - 180 = 20.

"To find the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to calculate the cost of visits for the first 5 years and the cost of visits for the next 3 years.

For the first 5 years, the cost of one visit is $2. Since Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year, the annual cost is 3 * $2 = $6. For 5 years, the total cost is 5 * $6 = $30.

The cost of one visit increased by 150% after 5 years. A 150% increase means the new cost is 2.5 times the original cost. So, the new cost of one visit is $2 * 2.5 = $5. The annual cost for the next 3 years is 3 * $5 = $15. For 3 years, the total cost is 3 * $15 = $45.

The total cost for all 8 years is $30 (first 5 years) + $45 (next 3 years) = $75.

"To find out how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to determine the total number of groups required and then multiply that by the time it takes for each group to try the escape room.

There are 4 grades (4-7) with 10 students in each grade, so the total number of students is 4 * 10 = 40.

Since only the top 10 students in each grade get to try the escape room, we need to find the total number of students who will try the escape room. Since there are 4 grades, we need to find the total number of students who will try the escape room in each grade, which is 10 students per grade. So, the total number of students who will try the escape room is 4 * 10 = 40.

However, only 8 students can try the escape room at a time. To find the total number of groups, we divide the total number of students who will try the escape room by 8. 

40 / 8 = 5

Since each group takes 45 minutes to try the escape room, we multiply the number of groups by the time it takes for each group to try the escape room.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as 'x'. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length can be represented as 4x.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, and it is divided into two pieces. So, the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is equal to 40 feet. We can write this as an equation:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Now, divide both sides by 5 to solve for x:

x = 40 / 5
x = 8

Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, we can find its length by multiplying x by 4:

Longer piece = 4x
Longer piece = 4 * 8
Longer piece = 32

"To find out how much seasoning Aiden needs, we first need to determine how many pounds of ground beef he needs to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound to find the total pounds of meat needed.

Total meatballs needed = 80
Meatballs per pound = 16

Total pounds of meat needed = Total meatballs needed / Meatballs per pound
Total pounds of meat needed = 80 / 16
Total pounds of meat needed = 5

Now that we know Aiden needs 5 pounds of ground beef, we can find out how much seasoning he needs. He uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat.

Total pounds of meat needed = 5
Seasoning per pound = 2 tablespoons

Total seasoning needed = Total pounds of meat needed * Seasoning per pound
Total seasoning needed = 5 * 2
Total seasoning needed = 10

"Let's break down the information given. Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. If we let the number of cupcakes be 'c', then the number of brownies is 3c - 2.

Since each person gets 2 treats and there are 5 people in the class, the total number of treats is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, so we can write the equation: c + (3c - 2) = 10.

Combine like terms: 4c - 2 = 10.

Add 2 to both sides: 4c = 12.

Divide by 4: c = 3.

"To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the 20% discount. 

The original cost of the manicure and pedicure is $35 + $40 = $75. 

A 20% discount on $75 is 0.20 * $75 = $15. 

So, the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure is $75 - $15 = $60.

Since Karen wants to add nail art on each of her fingers, and there are 10 fingers in total (5 on each hand), the cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost for Karen would be the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure plus the cost of the nail art, which is $60 + $30 = $90.

"To find the price of the toy after the discount in January, we need to calculate the price after the increase in December and then apply the decrease in January.

The initial price of the toy in November is $40.

In December, the price increased by 80%. To find the new price, we multiply the initial price by 1.8 (100% + 80% = 180%, or 1 + 0.8 = 1.8).

Price in December = $40 * 1.8 = $72

In January, the price decreased by 50%. To find the new price, we multiply the price in December by 0.5 (100% - 50% = 50%, or 1 - 0.5 = 0.5).

Price in January = $72 * 0.5 = $36

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"To find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to calculate the amount he earns from the standard rate lessons and the reduced rate lessons separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the amount he earns from the standard rate lessons. He has 4 lessons at the standard rate of $80 per hour. So, the total amount from standard rate lessons is 4 * $80 = $320.

Next, let's calculate the amount he earns from the reduced rate lessons. He has 2 lessons at the reduced rate, which is 25% less than the standard rate. To find the reduced rate, we need to calculate 25% of $80 and subtract it from $80. 25% of $80 is 0.25 * $80 = $20. So, the reduced rate is $80 - $20 = $60 per hour. The total amount from reduced rate lessons is 2 * $60 = $120.

Now, let's add the amounts from the standard rate lessons and the reduced rate lessons to find the total amount Charlie will make for the day. $320 + $120 = $440.

"To find the total amount of money Walter received, we need to calculate the number of apples he had left after eating and giving some to his sister, and then multiply that by the price per apple.

First, Walter ate 2/5 of the 60 apples. To find 2/5 of 60, we multiply 60 by 2 and divide by 5:
60 * 2 = 120
120 / 5 = 24

So, Walter ate 24 apples. Now, we subtract 24 from the total number of apples to find the remaining number:
60 - 24 = 36

Walter then gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples. To find 25% of 36, we multiply 36 by 0.25:
36 * 0.25 = 9

So, Walter gave his sister 9 apples. Now, we subtract 9 from the remaining number to find the number of apples he had left:
36 - 9 = 27

Walter sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. To find the total amount of money he received, we multiply the number of apples by the price per apple:
27 * 3 = 81

The final answer is: $81"
"To find the total number of novels Regina wrote this year, we need to determine the total number of novels she wrote last year and then multiply it by 4 (since 3 quarters is equivalent to 3/4, and to find the whole, we multiply by 4/3).

Let's start by finding the total number of novels she wrote last year. We know she wrote 9 novels last year.

Now, we need to multiply 9 by 4/3 to find the total number of novels she wrote this year.

9 * (4/3) = 9 * 4 / 3 = 36 / 3 = 12

So, Regina wrote 12 novels this year. 

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the distance covered by Michael in 3 days, we need to calculate the total distance he travels in that time. 

First, let's convert the time from days to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3 days is equal to 3 * 24 = 72 hours.

Now, we can multiply the speed by the time to find the distance traveled: 
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 50 km/hr * 72 hr
Distance = 3600 km

Now, we can find the percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered:
Percentage = (Distance covered / Total distance) * 100
Percentage = (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100
Percentage = 0.6 * 100
Percentage = 60%

The final answer is: 60"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Madeline ate 6 grapes. Her brother used up 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make a full glass, so he used 5 * 6 = 30 grapes.

The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies. Each pie requires 12 grapes, so the total number of grapes used by their mother is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.

The total number of grapes used by all three is 36 + 48 = 84 grapes.

Since Madeline ate 6 grapes initially, the total number of grapes at the beginning is 84 + 6 = 90 grapes.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the total number of teachers at school that day, we need to add the number of teachers who were sick and the number of substitute teachers. 

First, let's find the number of teachers who were not sick. There were 82 teachers in total, and 13 were sick. So, the number of teachers who were not sick is 82 - 13 = 69.

Now, we add the number of teachers who were not sick and the number of substitute teachers. 69 (teachers who were not sick) + 9 (substitute teachers) = 78.

The final answer is: 78"
"To find out how much Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we first need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients for one batch. 

The cost of pasta is $1.00 per box. 
The cost of cheddar cheese is $3.00. 
The cost of gruyere cheese is twice the cost of cheddar cheese, which is 2 * $3.00 = $6.00.

The total cost of one batch of macaroni and cheese is $1.00 (pasta) + $3.00 (cheddar cheese) + $6.00 (gruyere cheese) = $10.00.

Since Bud makes homemade macaroni and cheese once a week, in a year (52 weeks), he will make 52 batches. 

The total cost of making macaroni and cheese in one year is 52 * $10.00 = $520.00.

The final answer is: $520.00"
"To find the total number of classrooms the custodian needs to clean, we already know that number is 80. 

The custodian has 5 days to clean the classrooms. We need to find out how many minutes they have to clean in total. Since they work 8 hours a day, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, they work 8 * 60 = 480 minutes per day.

In 5 days, they work a total of 5 * 480 = 2400 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how many minutes they spend cleaning per classroom. It takes them 15 minutes per classroom.

To find the total time spent cleaning, we multiply the number of classrooms by the time spent per classroom: 80 * 15 = 1200 minutes.

Now, we need to find the percentage of their day spent cleaning. To do this, we divide the total time spent cleaning by the total time available and multiply by 100: (1200 / 2400) * 100 = 50%.

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, let's first determine the capacity of each shelf. 

Let's assume the capacity of a middle shelf is x. 
Since the bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, its capacity is 2x. 
The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so its capacity is 2x - 5.

We know that each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books. So, we can set up the equation 2x = 10 to find the capacity of a middle shelf. 
Solving for x, we get x = 5.

Now that we know the capacity of a middle shelf, we can find the capacity of the bottom and top shelves. 
The bottom shelf can hold 2x = 2 * 5 = 10 books. 
The top shelf can hold 2x - 5 = 2 * 5 - 5 = 5 books.

The total capacity of the three shelves is 10 + 10 + 5 = 25 books.

Since Elly has 110 books, we need to find out how many sets of 25 books she needs to hold all of them. 
Dividing 110 by 25, we get 110 / 25 = 4.4. 

Since we can't have a fraction of a bookcase, Elly needs 5 bookcases to hold all of her books.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find Rose's profit, we first need to calculate the total cost price and the total selling price of the eggs.

Since Rose bought five dozens of eggs, we need to find the total number of eggs. One dozen is equal to 12 eggs, so five dozens will be 5 * 12 = 60 eggs.

The cost price of 60 eggs is $2.40 per dozen, so the total cost price is 5 * $2.40 = $12.

Now, let's find the total selling price. Rose will sell 3 eggs for $1, so the selling price of 60 eggs will be (60 / 3) * $1 = $20.

The profit is the difference between the total selling price and the total cost price, which is $20 - $12 = $8.

The final answer is: $8"
"To find the number of white hats, we first need to find the total number of red and blue hats. 

Half of the hats are red, which is 100 * 1/2 = 50 red hats.

The remaining hats are 100 - 50 = 50 hats.

3/5 of the remaining hats are blue, which is 50 * 3/5 = 30 blue hats.

The remaining hats are white, which is 50 - 30 = 20 white hats.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the cost of each stick of jerky, we first need to calculate the total cost of the bag after the discount. 

Original price per bag: $18.00
Discount: $3.00
Discounted price per bag: $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

Since there are 30 sticks in a bag, we can find the cost per stick by dividing the discounted price by the number of sticks.

Cost per stick: $15.00 / 30 sticks = $0.50 per stick

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100 (since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents).

Cost per stick in cents: $0.50 * 100 = 50 cents

The final answer is: 50"
"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to find out how many questions she needs to get right in total. 

First, let's find out how many questions she got right in the first test. Since she got 60% of 70 questions correct, we can calculate this as 0.6 * 70 = 42 questions.

Now, let's find out the total number of questions she needs to get right to pass. Since she needs to get 70% of the total questions correct, and there are 70 + 40 = 110 questions in total, we can calculate this as 0.7 * 110 = 77 questions.

Since she already got 42 questions right in the first test, she needs to get 77 - 42 = 35 questions right in the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as 's' and the number of blueberry cubes as 'b'. We are given that the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, so we can write this as:

b = 5s - 4

We are also given that the total number of ice cubes is 116, which is the sum of strawberry and blueberry cubes:

s + b = 116

Substituting the expression for b from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

s + (5s - 4) = 116

Combine like terms:

6s - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides:

6s = 120

Divide both sides by 6:

s = 20

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting s into the first equation:

b = 5s - 4
b = 5(20) - 4
b = 100 - 4
b = 96

The final answer is: 96"
"To find the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years, we need to calculate the total number of games she has played and then multiply it by her score per game.

Ara has been playing 40 games every year for 4 years. So, the total number of games she has played is:
40 games/year * 4 years = 160 games

Since her score for every game is 21 points, we can multiply the total number of games by her score per game to find the total points:
160 games * 21 points/game = 3360 points

The final answer is: 3360"
"To find out how many marbles Brendan ended up with, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, Brendan had 10 marbles.

He dropped half of them, so he had 10 / 2 = 5 marbles left.

He then found 3 more marbles, so now he had 5 + 3 = 8 marbles.

However, one of the marbles he picked up was a bead, not a marble, so he got rid of it. This means he had 8 - 1 = 7 marbles left.

Therefore, Brendan ended up with 7 marbles.

"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of flashlights and the number of candles separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of flashlights. There are 4 people in the family, and each person has a flashlight. So, the total number of flashlights is 4.

Next, let's calculate the number of candles. There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. 

Half of 8 rooms is 4 rooms. So, 4 rooms have 4 small candles each, which is 4 * 4 = 16 small candles. The other 4 rooms have 5 medium candles each, which is 4 * 5 = 20 medium candles. 

The total number of candles is 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles.

Now, let's add the number of flashlights and candles together. The total number of candles and flashlights is 4 (flashlights) + 36 (candles) = 40.

"To find the total time it takes to solve the Rubik's cube, we need to calculate the time taken for each side and add them up.

The first side takes 5 minutes. 
The second and third sides each take twice that long, so 2 * 5 = 10 minutes each. 
The last two sides each take half as long as the first, so 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes each.

Now, let's add up the time for all sides: 
5 (first side) + 10 (second side) + 10 (third side) + 2.5 (fourth side) + 2.5 (fifth side) = 30 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the total time it takes for Phineas to cover the distance on land and in water. 

First, we need to find the distance Phineas needs to cover on land and in water. Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, Phineas needs to cover 100 yards on land and 100 yards in water.

Time taken to cover 100 yards on land = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes

Time taken to cover 100 yards in water = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes

Total time taken = Time on land + Time in water = 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes

Therefore, it will take Phineas 15 minutes to return home.

"To find the total cost, we first need to determine how many boxes of popsicle sticks Bob needs to buy. Since he needs 56 popsicle sticks and each box contains 8 sticks, we can divide 56 by 8 to find the number of boxes needed.

56 ÷ 8 = 7

So, Bob needs 7 boxes of popsicle sticks. Since each box costs $2.00, we can multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box to find the total cost.

7 boxes * $2.00 per box = $14.00

Therefore, it will cost Bob $14.00 to build his project.

The final answer is: $14.00"
"To find the total cost of the phone plan, we first need to determine the cost of the additional phones. 

Let's assume the cost of each additional phone is x. Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of the main phone is 2x.

We know that the main phone costs $20, so we can set up the equation 2x = 20 to find the cost of each additional phone.

Solving for x, we get x = 20 / 2 = 10.

Now that we know the cost of each additional phone, we can find the total cost of the additional phones. There are 4 additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is 4x = 4 * 10 = 40.

The total cost of the phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones, which is 20 + 40 = 60.

"To find the new speaking speed of John after training, we need to multiply his original speed by 2.5. 

Original speed = 150 WPM
New speed = 2.5 * 150 WPM = 375 WPM

Now, we need to find the total number of words John needs to speak. Since each page has 450 words, and he needs to speak 10 pages, the total number of words is:

Total words = 10 pages * 450 words/page = 4500 words

Now, we can find the time it would take John to speak 4500 words at his new speed:

Time = Total words / New speed
Time = 4500 words / 375 WPM

To find the time in minutes, we need to divide the total words by the new speed and then convert the result to minutes.

Time = 4500 / 375 = 12 hours

However, we need to convert the result to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the total number of people he saw on the first three days and add it to the total number of people he saw on the remaining days.

On the first day, Conor saw 50 people.

On the second day, there were 20 more people than on the first day, so the number of people on the second day is 50 + 20 = 70.

On the third day, the number of people was twice the number on the second day, so the number of people on the third day is 2 * 70 = 140.

The total number of people on the first three days is 50 + 70 + 140 = 260.

Since there are 7 days in a week, and Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the remaining 4 days, the total number of people he saw on the remaining days is 60 * 4 = 240.

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 260 + 240 = 500.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop. 

In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount pop, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.

In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increases to four times the initial rate, which is 4 * 20 = 80 kernels.

In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slows down to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, which is 0.5 * 80 = 40 kernels.

So, the total number of kernels popped in the first 120 seconds is 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 kernels.

After Garrett takes the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat. This is 0.25 * 40 = 10 kernels.

The total number of kernels that popped is 200 + 10 = 210 kernels.

"To find out how many lemons Tim will need, we first need to calculate the total amount of lemonade he needs to make, including the extra gallon for Allen. Since he needs to make 4 gallons of regular lemonade and 1 extra gallon that is twice as tart, we can consider the extra gallon as 2 gallons of regular lemonade. 

So, in total, Tim needs to make 4 + 2 = 6 gallons of lemonade. 

Since each gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice, and 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the total number of lemons needed by multiplying the total gallons by the number of cups of juice per gallon and then by the number of lemons per cup of juice.

Total lemons needed = 6 gallons * 1 cup/gallon * 6 lemons/cup = 36 lemons.

"To find the distance Elvis traveled west and then east, we need to calculate the distance for each part of the journey. 

Distance = Speed * Time. 

For the westward journey: Distance = 18mph * 5 hours = 90 miles.
For the eastward journey: Distance = 18mph * 8 hours = 144 miles.

Since Elvis traveled 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, we need to find the net distance from his house. The eastward distance cancels out the westward distance, so we subtract the westward distance from the eastward distance: 
Net distance = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles.

"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year and subtract it from the initial value.

Initial value of the boat = $9000

Depreciation in the first year = 30% of $9000 = 0.3 * $9000 = $2700
Value after the first year = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Depreciation in the second year = 30% of $6300 = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890
Value after the second year = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Depreciation in the third year = 20% of $4410 = 0.2 * $4410 = $882
Value after the third year = $4410 - $882 = $3528

The final value of the boat after three years is $3528."
"To find the number of pink candies, we first need to determine the number of orange and yellow candies. 

We are given that there are 54 red candies. Since there are twice as many orange candies as red candies, the number of orange candies is 2 * 54 = 108.

We are also given that there are half as many yellow candies as red candies. So, the number of yellow candies is 54 / 2 = 27.

Now, we know the total number of candies is 232. We can find the total number of non-pink candies by adding the number of red, orange, and yellow candies: 54 + 108 + 27 = 189.

To find the number of pink candies, we subtract the total number of non-pink candies from the total number of candies: 232 - 189 = 43.

Since Mazie gave a total of 52 marbles to the twins, and Dallas received 25, we can find out how many marbles Darla received by subtracting the number of marbles Dallas received from the total number of marbles given.

Darla received 52 - 25 = 27 marbles.

"To find the total weight of the car, luggage, and children, we need to add the individual weights together. 

Total weight = weight of car + weight of luggage + weight of children
Total weight = 1200 + 250 + (2 * 75)
Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150
Total weight = 1600 pounds

Since the force required to move the car is 1% of the total weight, we need to find 1% of 1600.

Force required = 1% of 1600
Force required = (1/100) * 1600
Force required = 0.01 * 1600
Force required = 16 pounds

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total length of crepe paper James needs, we need to calculate the perimeter of the backyard fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides. 

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

Given the length of the backyard fence is 20 feet and the width is 15 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (20 + 15)
Perimeter = 2 * 35
Perimeter = 70

So, James needs 70 feet of crepe paper to hang around the backyard fence. 

The final answer is: 70"
"To find the average age of Mia and Emma, we first need to find Emma's age. Since Mia is 40 years old and they are 16 years apart in age, Emma's age would be 40 + 16 = 56 years.

Now, to find the average age, we add their ages and divide by 2. The sum of their ages is 40 + 56 = 96. 

The average age is 96 / 2 = 48.

"To find the total cost of the place settings, we need to calculate the cost of each type of plate and then add them together.

Avery needs 12 dinner plates, and each costs $6.00, so the total cost of dinner plates is 12 x $6.00 = $72.00.

She also needs 12 bowls, and each costs $5.00, so the total cost of bowls is 12 x $5.00 = $60.00.

For the salad plates, she needs 12 as well, and each costs $4.00, so the total cost of salad plates is 12 x $4.00 = $48.00.

Now, let's add the costs of all the plates together: $72.00 (dinner plates) + $60.00 (bowls) + $48.00 (salad plates) = $180.00.

The total amount Avery will spend on place settings is $180.00.

"To find out how much feed is left after a week, we first need to calculate how much feed the pigs eat in a day and then multiply it by 7 to get the weekly consumption.

Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, so the total feed consumed by one pig in a day is 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.

Since Dexter has 5 pigs, the total feed consumed by all pigs in a day is 8 * 5 = 40 pounds.

Now, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 to get the weekly consumption: 40 * 7 = 280 pounds.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, so to find out how much is left, we subtract the weekly consumption from the total ordered: 300 - 280 = 20 pounds.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many hot dogs John needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of hot dogs required for the party. 

Since each guest will eat 2 hot dogs and there are 20 guests, the total number of hot dogs needed is 20 * 2 = 40 hot dogs.

However, John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party. So, the total number of hot dogs he needs to buy is 40 - 4 = 36 hot dogs.

Since a pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs and costs $2, we need to find out how many packs John needs to buy. 

To do this, we divide the total number of hot dogs needed by the number of hot dogs in a pack: 36 / 6 = 6.

Since each pack costs $2, the total amount John needs to spend on hot dogs is 6 * $2 = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To find out how much money Frances has left, we need to calculate her total earnings and subtract her total expenses.

First, let's calculate her total earnings from selling cupcakes and cookies. She sells 20 cupcakes at $2 each, so her earnings from cupcakes are 20 * $2 = $40. She sells 40 cookies at $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are 40 * $1 = $40. Her total earnings are $40 + $40 = $80.

Next, let's calculate her total expenses. She buys 5 trays at $4 each, so her total expenses are 5 * $4 = $20.

Now, let's subtract her total expenses from her total earnings to find out how much money she has left. $80 - $20 = $60.

Now, we know that all the sisters are 16 years old. There are 3 sisters, so their total age is 16 * 3 = 48 years.

The total age of the brothers is 12 (younger brother) + 24 (older brother) = 36 years.

To find the total age of all the siblings, we add the total age of the brothers and the total age of the sisters: 36 (brothers) + 48 (sisters) = 84 years.

"To find the total time spent on meditation and yoga, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity separately and then add them together.

Meditation time per day: 15 minutes (morning) + 15 minutes (night) = 30 minutes
Since Charisma practices meditation every day, we multiply the daily meditation time by 7 (days in a week) and then by 4 (weeks):
30 minutes/day * 7 days/week = 210 minutes/week
210 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 840 minutes

Yoga time per week: 1 hour (60 minutes) * 5 days/week = 300 minutes/week
Since this is a weekly activity, we multiply the weekly yoga time by 4 weeks:
300 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 1200 minutes

Total time spent on meditation and yoga: 840 minutes (meditation) + 1200 minutes (yoga) = 2040 minutes

"To find the total number of seeds, we first need to determine the number of seeds in a large sunflower. 

A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, a small sunflower has 3 * 12 = 36 seeds.

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36, we multiply 36 by 0.5, which equals 18. 

Now, we add the 50% more seeds to the original 36 seeds: 36 + 18 = 54 seeds in a large sunflower.

To find the total number of seeds, we add the seeds from the small sunflower and the large sunflower: 36 + 54 = 90 seeds.

The total number of sunflower seeds is 90."

"To find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. The original price of each T-shirt is $8. Since Jake buys 2 T-shirts, the total cost of the T-shirts would be 2 * $8 = $16. However, since there's a buy one get one 50% off deal, Jake only pays for one T-shirt at the original price and the other one at 50% off. So, the cost of the first T-shirt is $8 and the cost of the second T-shirt is $8 * 0.5 = $4. The total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and Jake gets a 40% discount. The discount amount is $40 * 0.4 = $16. So, the cost of the shoes is $40 - $16 = $24.

Now, let's add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store. The total cost is $12 + $24 = $36.

"To find out how much money Ryan has, we need to calculate his total earnings from doing chores and then subtract the cost of the ice cream cones.

Ryan earns $6 each week for completing his chores, and he did his chores for 3 weeks. So, his total earnings are 6 * 3 = $18.

He bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends at $1.25 each. Since there are 4 people in total, the cost of the ice cream cones is 4 * $1.25 = $5.

Now, let's subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from Ryan's total earnings: $18 - $5 = $13.

The cost of a movie ticket is $6.50. To find out how many tickets Ryan can buy, we need to divide his remaining money by the cost of a ticket: $13 ÷ $6.50 = 2.

"To find the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars, we first need to calculate the cost of making one jar and then multiply it by 10.

The cost of making one jar of the mixture is the sum of the costs of passion fruit, jackfruit, and honey. 

Cost of passion fruit = 2 pounds * $6 per pound = $12
Cost of jackfruit = 1.5 pounds * $8 per pound = $12
Cost of honey = 2 pounds * $10 per pound = $20
Total cost of making one jar = $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

Now, we need to find the total cost of making 10 jars.
Total cost of making 10 jars = $44 * 10 = $440

The selling price of one jar is $50, so the total revenue from selling 10 jars is:
Total revenue = $50 * 10 = $500

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $500 - $440
Profit = $60

"Let's break down the information given. We know that Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, but Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron. This means that if Aaron runs a certain distance in a certain time, Vanessa will run twice that distance in the same time.

Let's denote the time it takes Aaron to run 1 mile as 't'. Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, the time it takes Vanessa to run 1 mile is 2t.

We are given that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, and since he runs twice as fast as Vanessa, the distance he covered is half of the distance Vanessa covered. Vanessa ran 4 miles, so Aaron ran 4/2 = 2 miles.

Since Aaron runs 2 miles in 16 minutes, the time it takes him to run 1 mile is 16/2 = 8 minutes. This means t = 8 minutes.

Now, we know that Vanessa runs 1 mile in 2t = 2 * 8 = 16 minutes.

Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

Now, let's find the difference in the number of oranges they can peel in an hour. 

Ana can peel 20 oranges in an hour, and Jane can peel 15 oranges in an hour. 

The difference is 20 - 15 = 5 oranges.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total amount Mark paid, we first need to calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount and then add the labor cost.

The original cost of the radiator is $400. Mark gets it for 80% off, which means he pays 20% of the original cost. To find 20% of $400, we multiply $400 by 0.20.

$400 * 0.20 = $80

So, Mark pays $80 for the radiator.

Next, we need to calculate the labor cost. The mechanic takes 3 hours to install the radiator at $50 an hour. To find the total labor cost, we multiply the number of hours by the hourly rate.

3 hours * $50/hour = $150

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the labor cost to find the total amount Mark paid.

$80 (radiator) + $150 (labor) = $230

The final answer is: $230"
"Let's denote the number of chickens as 'c' and the number of cows as 'w'. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write the equation: c + w = 20.

We also know that the total number of legs is 70. Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. So, we can write another equation: 2c + 4w = 70.

We can solve this system of equations by multiplying the first equation by 2 to get: 2c + 2w = 40.

Now, we can subtract this equation from the second equation to eliminate 'c': (2c + 4w) - (2c + 2w) = 70 - 40, which simplifies to 2w = 30.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get w = 15. Now that we know the number of cows, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find the number of chickens: c + 15 = 20, so c = 5.

Therefore, the number of chickens is 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

First, let's find the total number of slices. There are 7 pizzas, and each pizza is cut into 8 slices. 

Total number of slices = 7 pizzas * 8 slices/pizza = 56 slices

Now, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. There are 4 people in total, including Henry and his 3 friends.

Number of slices per person = Total number of slices / Number of people
= 56 slices / 4 people
= 14 slices per person

So, each person can have 14 slices.

The final answer is: 14"
