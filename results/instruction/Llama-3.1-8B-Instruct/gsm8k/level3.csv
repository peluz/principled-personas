"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to first determine how many eggs she has left after eating and baking. 

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast and bakes 4 for muffins, so she uses a total of 3 + 4 = 7 eggs. 

To find out how many eggs she has left, we subtract the number of eggs used from the total number of eggs laid: 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.

Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at $2 per egg. To find out how much she makes, we multiply the number of eggs sold by the price per egg: 9 * 2 = 18.

The final answer is: $18"
"To find the total number of bolts needed, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber first. Since it's half the amount of blue fiber, and there are 2 bolts of blue fiber, we can calculate the white fiber as follows:

White fiber = 2 bolts (blue fiber) / 2 = 1 bolt

Now, we add the blue fiber and white fiber together to get the total:

Total bolts = 2 bolts (blue fiber) + 1 bolt (white fiber) = 3 bolts

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the profit Josh made, we first need to determine the total value of the house after the repairs. 

The original value of the house was $80,000. Josh put in $50,000 in repairs, which increased the value of the house by 150%. 

Let's denote the total value of the house after repairs as x. We can set up the equation:

80,000 + 50,000 = x + 150% of x

Combine like terms:
130,000 = x + 1.5x

Combine like terms:
130,000 = 2.5x

Divide both sides by 2.5:
52,000 = x

So, the total value of the house after repairs is $52,000.

To find the profit, we subtract the original cost of the house and the repairs from the total value of the house after repairs:

Profit = Total value after repairs - (Original cost + Repairs)
Profit = 52,000 - (80,000 + 50,000)
Profit = 52,000 - 130,000
Profit = -78,000

However, this is not the profit Josh made, but rather the loss. Since Josh put in $50,000 in repairs, we need to add this to the original cost of the house to get the total investment:

Total investment = Original cost + Repairs
Total investment = 80,000 + 50,000
Total investment = 130,000

The profit is the difference between the total value of the house after repairs and the total investment:

Profit = Total value after repairs - Total investment
Profit = 52,000 - 130,000
Profit = -78,000

However, this is still a loss. To find the actual profit, we need to consider the original cost of the house and the repairs as the total investment. The total value of the house after repairs is $52,000, but this is not the selling price. The selling price is the total value of the house after repairs, which is $52,000.

To find the selling price, we need to consider the original cost of the house and the repairs as the total investment. The total investment is $130,000. 

The profit is the difference between the selling price and the total investment:

Profit = Selling price - Total investment
However, we do not know the selling price. We know the total value of the house after repairs, but we do not know the selling price. 

However, we can find the selling price by setting up an equation. Let's denote the selling price as x. We know that the total value of the house after repairs is 150% of the original cost plus the repairs. We can set up the equation:

x = 150% of 80,000 + 50,000

x = 1.5 * 80,000 + 50,000
x = 120,000 + 50,000
x = 170,000

So, the selling price is $170,000.

Now, we can find the profit:

Profit = Selling price - Total investment
Profit = 170,000 - 130,000
Profit = 40,000

The final answer is: $40,000"
"To find the total number of meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total number of meters he runs in one sprint, and then multiply it by the number of sprints he runs in a week.

First, let's find the total number of meters James runs in one sprint: 60 meters.

Since James runs 3 sprints 3 times a week, we need to multiply the number of meters he runs in one sprint by the number of sprints he runs in a week, and then by the number of times he runs in a week. 

So, the total number of meters James runs in a week is: 60 meters/sprint * 3 sprints/week * 3 times/week = 540 meters.

The final answer is: 540"
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to determine the total number of cups of feed she has given to her chickens so far. 

In the morning, she gave her chickens 15 cups of feed. In the afternoon, she gave her chickens 25 cups of feed. So, the total number of cups of feed she has given so far is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

Since Wendi has a flock of 20 chickens, and each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per meal, the total number of cups of feed needed for the entire day is 20 chickens * 3 cups/chicken = 60 cups.

Now, to find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we subtract the total number of cups of feed she has given so far from the total number of cups of feed needed for the entire day: 60 cups - 40 cups = 20 cups.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining glasses. 

The first glass costs $5. 
The remaining glasses are 16 - 1 = 15 glasses. 
Since every second glass costs 60% of the price, the cost of the remaining glasses is 5 * 0.6 = $3 per glass. 

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the remaining glasses: 15 * 3 = $45. 
The total cost is the sum of the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining glasses: 5 + 45 = $50.

The final answer is: $50"
"To find the number of sheep in Toulouse, we first need to find the number of sheep in Charleston. Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, and Seattle has 20 sheep, we can multiply 20 by 4 to find the number of sheep in Charleston.

20 * 4 = 80

Now that we know Charleston has 80 sheep, we can find the number of sheep in Toulouse. Since Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, we can multiply 80 by 2.

80 * 2 = 160

Now that we know Toulouse has 160 sheep and Charleston has 80 sheep, we can add these numbers to the number of sheep in Seattle to find the total number of sheep.

160 + 80 + 20 = 260

The final answer is: 260"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, let's calculate the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file. Since Carla can download 2 GB/minute, we need to find 40% of 200 GB. 

40% of 200 GB = 0.4 * 200 GB = 80 GB

Time taken to download 80 GB = 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes

Now, Carla has to restart the download from the beginning. The remaining 60% of the file is 120 GB (200 GB - 80 GB). 

Time taken to download the remaining 120 GB = 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes

However, we also need to add the 20 minutes it took to install the updates. 

Total time = 40 minutes (first 80 GB) + 20 minutes (updates) + 60 minutes (remaining 120 GB) = 120 minutes

The final answer is: 120"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and calculate the distance traveled in each segment.

1. John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles

2. He then spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so no distance is traveled during this time.

3. He drives for 0.5 hours (half an hour) at 30 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles

4. He then drives for the remaining 2 hours (4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours) at 80 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 1.5 = 120 miles

Now, let's add up the distances traveled in each segment:
Total distance = 180 + 0 + 15 + 120 = 315 miles

However, this is the total distance traveled from the point where he turned around. To find the distance from home, we need to subtract the distance traveled in the first segment (since he was driving away from home initially):
Distance from home = Total distance - Distance traveled away from home
= 315 - 180
= 135 miles

The final answer is: 135"
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to calculate her regular pay for the first 40 hours and her overtime pay for the additional 5 hours.

Regular pay for 40 hours = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400

Overtime pay rate = 1.2 * $10/hour = $12/hour

Overtime pay for 5 hours = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Total earnings = Regular pay + Overtime pay = $400 + $60 = $460

"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and then add them together.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the downloads were reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.30, which is 54. Then, we subtract 54 from 180 to get 126 downloads in the third month.

Now, we add the downloads from each month together: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The final answer is: 366"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then add them together.

3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen = 3 x $68 = $204

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes: 
2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen = 2 x $80 = $160

Now, let's calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes: 
6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen = 6 x $55 = $330

Now, let's add the costs together: 
$204 + $160 + $330 = $694

The total cost is $694."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the break-even point, which is the point at which the total cost of planting and maintaining the tree equals the total revenue from selling the lemons.

Let's denote the number of years as 'x'. The total cost of planting the tree is $90, and the annual cost of watering and feeding the tree is $3. The total revenue from selling the lemons is 7x * $1.5 = $10.5x.

The break-even point is when the total cost equals the total revenue:

90 + 3x = 10.5x

Subtract 3x from both sides:

90 = 7.5x

Divide both sides by 7.5:

x = 12

So, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

The final answer is: 12"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Melanie started with x vacuum cleaners.

At the green house, she sold a third of her vacuum cleaners, which is x/3.

At the red house, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners.

At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, which is (x - x/3 - 2)/2.

We know that after selling at all the houses, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the equation:

x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

To simplify the equation, let's first simplify the fraction (x - x/3 - 2)/2:

(x - x/3 - 2)/2 = (3x/3 - x/3 - 6/3)/2 = (2x/3 - 2)/2 = x/3 - 1

Now, let's rewrite the equation:

x - x/3 - 2 - (x/3 - 1) = 5

Combine like terms:

x - x/3 - 2 - x/3 + 1 = 5

Combine like terms:

x - 2x/3 - 1 = 5

To get rid of the fraction, multiply both sides by 3:

3x - 2x - 3 = 15

Combine like terms:

x - 3 = 15

Add 3 to both sides:

x = 18

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to find the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance and jazz dance.

20% of 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance:
20% of 20 = 0.20 * 20 = 4 students

The remaining students after contemporary dance is 20 - 4 = 16 students.

25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:
25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

The number of students who enrolled in jazz dance is 4, and the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance is 4. So, the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is 16 - 4 - 4 = 8 students.

To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100:
(8 / 20) * 100 = 40%

The final answer is: 40"
"To determine the profit, we need to calculate the potential increase in value for each option. 

For the jewelry, the potential increase is 2.5% of $5,000, which is 0.025 * $5,000 = $125. 

For the electronic gadgets, the potential increase is 1.2% of $8,000, which is 0.012 * $8,000 = $96.

Since the merchant wants to maximize profit, we need to choose the option with the higher potential increase. In this case, the jewelry option has a higher potential increase of $125.

However, to calculate the actual profit, we need to consider the initial cost of each option. The merchant will have to spend $5,000 for the jewelry or $8,000 for the electronic gadgets.

To maximize profit, the merchant should choose the option with the higher potential increase relative to its cost. 

The potential increase for the jewelry is $125, and the cost is $5,000, so the profit would be $125.

The potential increase for the electronic gadgets is $96, and the cost is $8,000, so the profit would be $96.

Comparing the two options, the jewelry option has a higher profit margin of $125 / $5,000 = 2.5% and the electronic gadgets option has a profit margin of $96 / $8,000 = 1.2%.

The merchant should choose the jewelry option to maximize profit.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance covered on the first day and the distance covered on the second day.

On the first day, both trains travel 80 miles westward. Since they are traveling in the same direction, the distance covered by each train is the same, which is 80 miles.

On the second day, they travel 150 miles northward. Again, since they are traveling in the same direction, the distance covered by each train is the same, which is 150 miles.

So, the total distance covered by each train in the two days is the sum of the distances covered on each day, which is 80 + 150 = 230 miles.

"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
She works 35 hours a week for 50 weeks a year, so the total hours she works as a teacher in a year is 35 * 50 = 1750 hours.
Her hourly wage is $20, so her annual earnings from teaching is 1750 * 20 = $35,000.

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:
She works 15 hours a week for 50 weeks a year, so the total hours she works as a coach in a year is 15 * 50 = 750 hours.
Her hourly wage is $30, so her annual earnings from coaching is 750 * 30 = $22,500.

Now, let's add her earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary:
$35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500

"To find out how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in 4 weeks. 

Since Claire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning, and there are 7 days in a week, she eats 3 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 21 eggs/week. 

In 4 weeks, she will eat 21 eggs/week * 4 weeks = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can convert the total number of eggs to dozens by dividing by 12: 84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozen eggs.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total time Marissa has taken to walk the first 6 miles. She took 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles and another hour to walk the next 2 miles, so the total time taken for the first 6 miles is 1 + 1 = 2 hours.

The total distance of the trail is 12 miles, and she has already walked 6 miles. So, the remaining distance is 12 - 6 = 6 miles.

Since Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail, and she has already walked 6 miles in 2 hours, we can find the total time she needs to take to walk the entire 12 miles. 

The total time = Total distance / Average speed = 12 miles / 4 mph = 3 hours.

Since she has already taken 2 hours, she has 3 - 2 = 1 hour left to walk the remaining 6 miles.

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance, we can use the formula: Speed = Distance / Time.

Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 mph.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To find the amount of water in the orange drink, we first need to calculate two-thirds of 10 liters. 

Two-thirds of 10 liters is (2/3) * 10 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters.

Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the amount of water in the orange drink is 6.67 liters.

Now, to find the amount of water in the pineapple drink, we need to calculate three-fifths of 15 liters.

Three-fifths of 15 liters is (3/5) * 15 = 45/5 = 9 liters.

Since the pineapple drink is three-fifths water, the amount of water in the pineapple drink is 9 liters.

Now, we need to subtract the 1 liter that was spilled from the orange drink. 

The remaining amount of water from the orange drink is 6.67 - 1 = 5.67 liters.

Now, we add the water from the orange and pineapple drinks to find the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters.

Total water = 5.67 + 9 = 14.67 liters.

However, we need to find the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters. Since 1 liter of the orange drink was spilled, the total amount of liquid in the remaining mixture is 24 - 1 = 23 liters.

To find the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to find the proportion of water in the remaining mixture.

The total amount of water in the remaining mixture is 14.67 liters, and the total amount of liquid in the remaining mixture is 23 liters.

The proportion of water in the remaining mixture is 14.67 / 23 = 0.637.

To find the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we multiply the proportion of water by the total amount of liquid in the remaining mixture.

Total water in the remaining 24 liters = 0.637 * 24 = 15.288 liters.

Rounding to two decimal places, the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 15.29 liters."
"To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to determine Raymond's current age and then subtract the age at which he had his son.

First, we know that Samantha is 31 years old, and Raymond was born 6 years before her. So, Raymond's current age is 31 - 6 = 25 years.

Since Raymond had his son at the age of 23, we need to find out how many years have passed since then. To do this, we subtract 23 from Raymond's current age: 25 - 23 = 2.

So, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago.

Original Price = Discounted Price / (1 - Discount Percentage)

Given that the discounted price is $19.50 and the discount percentage is 25% (or 0.25 as a decimal), we can plug these values into the formula:

Original Price = $19.50 / (1 - 0.25)
Original Price = $19.50 / 0.75
Original Price = $26

"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream, we need to calculate the total number of cartons she buys and then multiply it by the cost per carton.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she will go through 60 servings in 60 days. Each carton has 15 servings, so we need to divide 60 by 15 to find out how many cartons she buys:

60 servings / 15 servings per carton = 4 cartons

Now, we multiply the number of cartons by the cost per carton:

4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00

So, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream after 60 days.

The final answer is: $16.00"
"To find the distance traveled between Henry's first and second stops, we need to determine the distance between the two stops. 

First, we know that Henry's second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total trip was 60 miles, we can find the distance from the start to the second stop by subtracting 15 from 60. 

60 - 15 = 45 miles

However, this is the distance from the start to the second stop. To find the distance between the first and second stops, we need to subtract the distance traveled before the first stop (20 miles) from the distance from the start to the second stop (45 miles).

45 - 20 = 25 miles

So, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the cost of the boots as B and the cost of the more expensive pair of heels as H. Since the other pair of heels costs half as much as the more expensive pair, its cost can be represented as H/2.

We are given that the two pairs of heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. This can be written as an equation:

B = H + H/2 - 5

We are also given that one pair of heels costs $33. Since the other pair costs twice as much, its cost is 2 * 33 = 66.

Now we can substitute H = 66 into the equation:

B = 66 + 66/2 - 5

First, let's simplify the equation by calculating 66/2:

66/2 = 33

Now the equation becomes:

B = 66 + 33 - 5

Next, let's add 66 and 33:

66 + 33 = 99

Now the equation becomes:

B = 99 - 5

Finally, let's subtract 5 from 99:

99 - 5 = 94

"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given ratio. Let's assume Darrell's age is 7x and Allen's age is 11x, where x is a constant.

Since their total age is 162, we can write the equation:

7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms:

18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18:

x = 9

Now that we have the value of x, we can find Darrell's and Allen's current ages:

Darrell's age = 7x = 7(9) = 63
Allen's age = 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

"To find the average guess, we need to calculate the total number of guesses and divide by the number of friends.

The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.

The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first friend's guess: 
Half of 80 is 80 / 2 = 40
20 more than 40 is 40 + 20 = 60

The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend's guess:
25% of 80 is 0.25 * 80 = 20
80 + 20 = 100

Now, we have the three guesses: 80, 60, and 100.

To find the average, we add the guesses and divide by the number of friends:
Total guesses = 80 + 60 + 100 = 240
Number of friends = 3
Average guess = Total guesses / Number of friends = 240 / 3 = 80

"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of gold coins as G and the number of silver coins as S.

We are given two pieces of information:

1. The total number of coins is 110: G + S = 110
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins: G = S + 30

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for S:

S + 30 + S = 110
Combine like terms:
2S + 30 = 110
Subtract 30 from both sides:
2S = 80
Divide both sides by 2:
S = 40

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins by substituting S into the second equation:
G = S + 30
G = 40 + 30
G = 70

The final answer is: 70"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Raymond has 40 jewels.
2. Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. 
   Half of Raymond's jewels is 40 / 2 = 20.
   Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.
3. Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron.
   Siobhan has 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points he scored in the first 20 minutes and the points he scored in the second 20 minutes.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% of 4, we multiply 4 by 0.25 (which is the decimal equivalent of 25%): 4 * 0.25 = 1. 

So, in the second 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Now, we add the points scored in both periods: 4 + 5 = 9 points.

The total points Mike scored is 9."
"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to first find out the cost of one yogurt. 

Since they are on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00, we can divide the total cost by the number of yogurts to get the cost of one yogurt. 

Cost of one yogurt = $5.00 / 4 = $1.25

Now, we know that Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. To find out the total cost over 30 days, we multiply the cost of one yogurt by the number of yogurts he eats per day and then multiply by the number of days.

Total cost = (Cost of one yogurt * Number of yogurts per day) * Number of days
Total cost = ($1.25 * 2) * 30
Total cost = $2.50 * 30
Total cost = $75.00

The final answer is: $75.00"
"To find out how many Lego sets John still has, we first need to determine how much money he made from selling the Lego sets and then subtract the cost of the video games and the remaining money he has.

John sells 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount of money he made is:
13 * 15 = 195 dollars

He buys 8 video games for $20 each, so the total cost of the video games is:
8 * 20 = 160 dollars

John has $5 left after buying the video games, so the total amount of money he spent on video games and the remaining money is:
160 + 5 = 165 dollars

Now, we subtract the total amount of money he spent from the total amount of money he made:
195 - 165 = 30 dollars

However, this is the amount of money he has left, not the number of Lego sets. To find the number of Lego sets he still has, we need to divide the amount of money he has left by the price of each Lego set:
30 / 15 = 2

So, John still has 2 Lego sets left. 

The final answer is: 2"
"To find John's speed, we first need to calculate the total time he spends running in a week. 

He runs 3 hours on the first day. The other two days, he runs half as much, so he runs 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours each day. 

Total time spent running in a week = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours.

Since John runs 60 miles a week, we can use the formula: Speed = Distance / Time.

Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Dana's walking speed, running speed, and skipping speed. 

Given that Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, and her skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed, we can find her running speed by multiplying her skipping speed by 2. 

Running speed = 2 * Skipping speed
Running speed = 2 * 3
Running speed = 6 miles per hour

Since Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, we can find her walking speed by dividing her running speed by 4.

Walking speed = Running speed / 4
Walking speed = 6 / 4
Walking speed = 1.5 miles per hour

Now that we have Dana's walking and running speeds, we can calculate the distance she travels in six hours. 

Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. So, the time she spends running is 2 hours and the time she spends walking is 4 hours.

Distance traveled running = Speed * Time
Distance traveled running = 6 * 2
Distance traveled running = 12 miles

Distance traveled walking = Speed * Time
Distance traveled walking = 1.5 * 4
Distance traveled walking = 6 miles

Total distance traveled = Distance traveled running + Distance traveled walking
Total distance traveled = 12 + 6
Total distance traveled = 18 miles

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To find the age of Brandon's iPhone, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old.
2. Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, so Ben's iPhone is 2 * 1 = 2 years old.
3. Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, so Brandon's iPhone is 4 * 2 = 8 years old.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we need to calculate the total distance she can throw the javelin while holding the gemstone.

First, we know that Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone. When she holds the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther than that. 

So, the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone is 3 * 400 = 1200 feet.

Since the dragon's flames reach 1000 feet, Polly can stand 1000 feet away from the dragon and still hit it with the javelin. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach she can stand, we need to subtract the dragon's reach from the total distance she can throw the javelin.

So, the distance outside the dragon's reach is 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet.

The final answer is: 200"
"To find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we need to subtract the number of remaining pieces from the total number of pieces initially available.

First, let's calculate the total number of pieces initially available. Since Grandma Jones cut each pie into 8 pieces and she baked 5 pies, the total number of pieces is:

5 pies * 8 pieces per pie = 40 pieces

Now, we subtract the number of remaining pieces from the total number of pieces to find out how many pieces were taken by the guests:

40 pieces (initially available) - 14 pieces (remaining) = 26 pieces

The final answer is: 26"
"To find out how many calories are left in the daily calorie target, we subtract the calories already consumed from the total daily calorie target. 

2000 (daily calorie target) - 1800 (calories already consumed) = 200 calories left

Since each serving of the bag of chips has 250 calories, we need to find out how many servings can be consumed with the remaining calories.

200 (calories left) / 250 (calories per serving) = 0.8 servings

Since there are 5 servings in the 300g bag, we need to find out how many grams are in 0.8 servings.

First, we find the total weight of one serving by dividing the total weight of the bag by the number of servings: 
300g (total weight) / 5 (number of servings) = 60g per serving

Now, we multiply the weight of one serving by the number of servings that can be consumed:
60g (weight per serving) * 0.8 (number of servings) = 48g

The final answer is: 48"
"To calculate the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

First, let's calculate the cost of making 20 candles. Since it takes 1 pound of beeswax to make 10 candles, it will take 2 pounds of beeswax to make 20 candles. The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00. 

Cost per pound of beeswax is $5.00 (10.00 / 2). 
Cost of 2 pounds of beeswax is $10.00. 
Cost of wicks for 20 candles is $0.00 (assuming wicks are negligible or free).

Total cost = Cost of 2 pounds of beeswax + Cost of wicks
Total cost = $10.00 + $0.00
Total cost = $10.00

Now, let's calculate the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, and he makes and sells 20 candles.

Total revenue = Number of candles sold * Price per candle
Total revenue = 20 * $2.00
Total revenue = $40.00

Now, let's calculate the net profit.

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $10.00
Net profit = $30.00

The final answer is: $30.00"
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply it by the time it takes to write one article (4 hours).

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. To find 2/5 of 5, we multiply 5 by 2/5:
5 * (2/5) = 2
So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 7 * 2 = 14 articles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles she wrote in the three days:
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles

Since it takes 4 hours to write one article, the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours

The final answer is: 104"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many Post-it notes Candice had after placing one on each of the 220 cups of coffee. We know that she had 80 Post-it notes initially and 23 remaining after placing the notes on the cups. 

Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package as 'x'. The total number of Post-it notes Candice had after purchasing the package is 80 + x. After placing one note on each of the 220 cups, she had 80 + x - 220 = 23 remaining. 

Now, let's solve for 'x':

80 + x - 220 = 23
x - 140 = 23
x = 23 + 140
x = 163

The final answer is: 163"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of blue ties John bought and then the number of red ties. 

Since John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can find the number of blue ties by dividing the total amount spent by the cost per tie: 

200 / 40 = 5 blue ties.

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.

The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, so the cost of each red tie is 1.5 times the cost of each blue tie: 

1.5 * 40 = 60 dollars per red tie.

Now, we can find the total amount spent on red ties by multiplying the number of red ties by the cost per tie: 

10 * 60 = 600 dollars.

The total amount spent on ties is the sum of the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties: 

200 + 600 = 800 dollars.

The final answer is: 800"
"To find out how many pieces Tracy obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 4 feet to inches by multiplying 4 by 12.

4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Now, we know the wire is 48 inches long and it was cut into pieces 6 inches long. To find out how many pieces Tracy obtained, we can divide the total length of the wire (48 inches) by the length of each piece (6 inches).

48 inches / 6 inches/piece = 8 pieces

"To find the total number of occupied units, we need to first find the total number of units in the building and then multiply it by 3/4.

The total number of units in the building is the number of floors multiplied by the number of units per floor: 15 floors * 8 units/floor = 120 units.

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we multiply the total number of units by 3/4: 120 units * 3/4 = 90 occupied units.

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units: 120 units - 90 units = 30 units.

"To find out how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to calculate the total number of eggs produced per week and then multiply it by the price per dozen.

First, let's calculate the total number of eggs produced per week:
252 eggs per day * 7 days per week = 252 * 7 = 1764 eggs per week

Since Lloyd sells eggs by the dozen, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens:
1764 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 147 dozen eggs per week

Now, let's calculate the total amount Lloyd makes per week:
147 dozen eggs per week * $2 per dozen = 147 * 2 = $294 per week

"To find the total time Tom's ship takes to travel from 1 to 4 PM and back, we need to calculate the time taken for each leg of the journey separately.

First, let's find the time taken to travel from 1 to 4 PM. Since the time is given in a 12-hour format, we can assume that the time from 1 to 4 PM is 3 hours.

Now, let's find the distance traveled from 1 to 4 PM. Distance = Speed * Time. 
Distance = 10 miles/hour * 3 hours = 30 miles.

Now, let's find the time taken to travel back from 4 to 1 PM. We know the distance is 30 miles and the speed is 6 mph. 
Time = Distance / Speed. 
Time = 30 miles / 6 mph = 5 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much weight the comic books weigh in total. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and Uriah removes 30 comic books, we can multiply the weight of one comic book by the number of comic books:

Weight of comic books = (1/4) * 30
Weight of comic books = 30/4
Weight of comic books = 7.5 pounds

Since Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds in total, and the comic books weigh 7.5 pounds, the remaining weight that needs to be removed from the toys is:

Remaining weight to be removed from toys = 15 - 7.5
Remaining weight to be removed from toys = 7.5 pounds

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we can find the number of toys that need to be removed by dividing the remaining weight by the weight of one toy:

Number of toys to be removed = 7.5 / (1/2)
Number of toys to be removed = 7.5 * 2
Number of toys to be removed = 15

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total revenue for each day, we need to calculate the revenue from truck tires and car tires separately and then add them together.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. The revenue from truck tires is 6 * $60 = $360. The revenue from car tires is 4 * $40 = $160. The total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires. The revenue from car tires is 12 * $40 = $480. Since there are no truck tires, the total revenue on Friday is $480.

To find the day with higher revenue, we compare the revenues: $520 (Thursday) and $480 (Friday). Thursday has higher revenue.

Now, to find how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we subtract the lower revenue from the higher revenue: $520 - $480 = $40.

"To find out how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to calculate how many times he can afford the total cost of a movie outing, which is the sum of the ticket price and the popcorn price.

The total cost of a movie outing is $7 (ticket) + $7 (popcorn) = $14.

Now, we need to divide the total amount of money Peter has ($42) by the cost of a movie outing ($14) to find out how many times he can go to the movies.

$42 ÷ $14 = 3

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times."
"To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck, we need to first determine the remaining weight capacity of the bridge after the driver and the empty truck have passed over it.

The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. The weight limit of the bridge is 5000 pounds. 

Remaining weight capacity = Weight limit - Combined weight of driver and empty truck
Remaining weight capacity = 5000 - 3755
Remaining weight capacity = 1245 pounds

Since each box weighs 15 pounds, we can divide the remaining weight capacity by the weight of each box to find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded.

Maximum number of boxes = Remaining weight capacity / Weight of each box
Maximum number of boxes = 1245 / 15
Maximum number of boxes = 83

There are 1 bad oranges and 2 sour oranges. 

20% of 25 oranges are unripe. To find 20% of 25, we multiply 25 by 0.2 (which is the decimal form of 20%). 
25 * 0.2 = 5

So, the total number of unripe and bad oranges is 5 + 1 = 6.

Now, we subtract the total number of unripe and bad oranges from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges.
25 - 6 = 19

The number of good oranges is 19."

"To calculate Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to find the value of the pension after 20 years and then apply the 5% increase for the remaining 10 years.

The pension after 20 years is $50,000/year for 10 years, so we need to calculate the total value of the pension after 20 years. Since it's an annuity, we can use the formula for the future value of an annuity:

FV = PMT * (((1 + r)^n - 1) / r)

Where:
- FV = Future Value
- PMT = Annual payment = $50,000
- r = interest rate (in this case, the annual increase is 0%, so we'll use 0 for simplicity, but in reality, we'd use a more complex formula to account for the increase)
- n = number of years = 20

However, since the pension increases by 5% after 20 years, we'll use a different approach. We'll calculate the total value of the pension after 20 years as if it were a regular annuity, and then apply the 5% increase.

The total value of the pension after 20 years is:
FV = $50,000 * (((1 + 0)^20 - 1) / 0) = $0 (this is not correct, we'll use a different approach)

A more accurate way to calculate the total value of the pension after 20 years is to use the formula for the present value of an annuity:

PV = PMT * (((1 - (1 + r)^(-n)) / r)

However, since we're looking for the future value, we'll use the formula for the future value of an annuity with a growing annuity:

FV = PMT * (((1 + g)^(n) - 1) / g) * (1 + g)

Where:
- FV = Future Value
- PMT = Annual payment = $50,000
- g = growth rate = 0.05 (5% increase)
- n = number of years = 20

FV = $50,000 * (((1 + 0.05)^20 - 1) / 0.05) * (1 + 0.05)
FV ≈ $1,220,919.19

Now, we need to apply the 5% increase for the remaining 10 years. We'll use the same formula, but with n = 10:

FV = $1,220,919.19 * (((1 + 0.05)^10 - 1) / 0.05) * (1 + 0.05)
FV ≈ $2,144,919.19

However, this is the total value of the pension after 30 years. To find the annual pension, we need to divide by the number of years:

Annual pension = $2,144,919.19 / 10
Annual pension ≈ $214,491.92

The final answer is: $214,492"
"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to find the amount she paid for the first half of the year and the second half of the year separately, and then add them together.

The first half of the year is 6 months, and the second half of the year is also 6 months. 

The initial amount charged per month is $140. 

For the first half of the year, Aleena paid 6 * $140 = $840.

For the second half of the year, the company charged her 10% less than the initial amount. To find the amount charged for the second half, we need to calculate 10% of $140 and subtract it from the initial amount.

10% of $140 = 0.1 * $140 = $14.

The amount charged for the second half of the year is $140 - $14 = $126.

The total amount charged for the second half of the year is $126 * 6 = $756.

The total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $840 + $756 = $1596.

"To find out how far Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to determine the car's fuel efficiency. We can do this by dividing the distance traveled by the amount of gas used.

First, let's find out how much gas Sophia used to travel 100 miles. Since she filled up 4 gallons after traveling 100 miles, we can assume that the 4 gallons of gas she put in was the amount used to travel the 100 miles. 

Now, we can calculate the car's fuel efficiency by dividing the distance traveled (100 miles) by the amount of gas used (4 gallons). 

Fuel efficiency = Distance / Gas used
Fuel efficiency = 100 miles / 4 gallons
Fuel efficiency = 25 miles per gallon

Now that we know the car's fuel efficiency, we can find out how far Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas. Since the tank holds 12 gallons, we can multiply the fuel efficiency by the tank capacity.

Distance = Fuel efficiency * Tank capacity
Distance = 25 miles/gallon * 12 gallons
Distance = 300 miles

"To find the total number of people sent by the schools, we need to calculate the number of students and coaches.

Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys'), and each team has 5 players. So, the total number of students per school is 2 teams * 5 players/team = 10 students.

Each school also has 2 coaches (one for the girls' team and one for the boys' team). So, the total number of coaches per school is 2 coaches.

The total number of people per school is 10 students + 2 coaches = 12 people.

Since there are 4 schools, the total number of people sent by all the schools is 12 people/school * 4 schools = 48 people.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Bailey starts with x dollars. She receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks, so she receives a total of 5 * 8 = $40. At the end of 8 weeks, she has a total of $100. We can set up the equation:

x + 40 = 100

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. We can do this by subtracting 40 from both sides of the equation:

x = 100 - 40
x = 60

"To find out how much Judy makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of classes she teaches in a week and then multiply it by the number of students per class and the charge per student.

Judy teaches 5 classes a day for 5 weekdays, which is 5 * 5 = 25 classes. 
On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes. 
So, the total number of classes in a week is 25 + 8 = 33 classes.

Each class has 15 students, so the total number of students per week is 33 * 15 = 495 students.

Judy charges $15 per student, so the total amount she makes in a week is 495 * $15 = $7350.

The final answer is: $7350"
"To find the total number of instructions, we need to add the number of instructions in the first recipe to the number of instructions in the second recipe.

The first recipe has 20 instructions. 
The second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one, so it has 2 * 20 = 40 instructions.

Now, we add the number of instructions in both recipes: 20 + 40 = 60.

The final answer is: 60"

"To calculate the total amount Shiela will pay each month, we need to first calculate the total interest charged for the 3-month installment. 

The interest charged per unit is 2% of $150, which is 0.02 * $150 = $3. 

Since Shiela bought 5 units, the total interest charged is 5 * $3 = $15.

The total amount Shiela will pay for each unit is $150 + $3 = $153.

To calculate the monthly payment, we divide the total amount by the number of months: $153 / 3 = $51.

The final answer is: $51"
"To find the total amount Artie will make, we need to round the prices of each type of flower to the nearest dollar and then multiply the rounded price by the number of pots sold.

Rounded price of marigolds: $2.74 ≈ $3
Rounded price of petunias: $1.87 ≈ $2
Rounded price of begonias: $2.12 ≈ $2

Now, let's calculate the total amount Artie will make from each type of flower:

Total from marigolds: 12 pots * $3/pot = $36
Total from petunias: 9 pots * $2/pot = $18
Total from begonias: 17 pots * $2/pot = $34

Now, let's add up the total amount Artie will make from all the flowers:

$36 + $18 + $34 = $88

The final answer is: $88"
"To find the average square footage of a level, we need to first find the total square footage of the sandcastle and then divide it by the number of levels.

Since each level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can represent the square footage of each level as a geometric series:

Level 1: 16
Level 2: 16/2 = 8
Level 3: 8/2 = 4
Level 4: 4/2 = 2

The total square footage of the sandcastle is the sum of the square footage of each level, which is a geometric series with the first term (a) = 16, the common ratio (r) = 1/2, and the number of terms (n) = 4.

The sum of a geometric series can be calculated using the formula: S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

Plugging in the values, we get:
S = 16 * (1 - (1/2)^4) / (1 - 1/2)
S = 16 * (1 - 1/16) / (1/2)
S = 16 * (15/16) / (1/2)
S = 16 * (15/16) * 2
S = 15

Now, to find the average square footage of a level, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:
Average = S / n
Average = 15 / 4
Average = 3.75

The final answer is: 3.75"
"To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food the puppy will eat in the first year. 

First, let's find out how many days are in a year. There are 365 days in a year.

The puppy eats 1 cup of dog food for the first 180 days. So, the amount of dog food eaten in the first 180 days is 180 * 1 = 180 cups.

The puppy eats 2 cups of dog food for the rest of its life, which is 365 - 180 = 185 days. So, the amount of dog food eaten in the rest of the year is 185 * 2 = 370 cups.

The total amount of dog food eaten in the first year is 180 + 370 = 550 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the total number of bags of dog food used in the first year is 550 / 110 = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much laundry Raymond and David do. 

Since Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, and she does 4 times as much as David, we can find out how much David does by dividing 400 by 4. 

David's laundry = 400 / 4 = 100 pounds

Since Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, we can find out how much Raymond does by dividing 400 by 2.

Raymond's laundry = 400 / 2 = 200 pounds

Now, we need to find the difference between Raymond's and David's laundry. 

Difference = Raymond's laundry - David's laundry
= 200 - 100
= 100 pounds

"To find the better price, we need to calculate the cost per flower for each package option.

For the package of 3 flowers for $2.50, the cost per flower is:
$2.50 / 3 flowers = $0.8333 per flower

For the package of 2 flowers for $1, the cost per flower is:
$1 / 2 flowers = $0.50 per flower

Since $0.50 per flower is less than $0.8333 per flower, the package of 2 flowers for $1 is the better price.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price:
18 flowers / 2 flowers per package = 9 packages
9 packages * $1 per package = $9

The cost of buying 18 flowers at the original price (package of 3 flowers for $2.50) is:
18 flowers / 3 flowers per package = 6 packages
6 packages * $2.50 per package = $15

The amount of money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price is:
$15 - $9 = $6

The final answer is: $6"
"To find the cost of the grooming after the discount, we need to calculate 30% of the original price and subtract it from the original price.

Original price = $100
Discount percentage = 30%

Discount amount = 30% of $100 = 0.30 * $100 = $30

Cost after discount = Original price - Discount amount
= $100 - $30
= $70

The final answer is: $70"
"To find out how much water the two girls got, we need to calculate 1/6 of 24 liters. 

1/6 of 24 liters = (1/6) * 24 = 4 liters

Since there are two girls, they got a total of 2 * 4 = 8 liters.

Now, we subtract the total amount of water the girls got from the initial 24 liters.

24 - 8 = 16 liters

Then, we subtract the 6 liters the boy got from the remaining 16 liters.

16 - 6 = 10 liters

"To find the total number of thorns, we need to multiply the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush, and then multiply that result by the number of thorns per rose.

First, we multiply the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush: 3 * 25 = 75

Then, we multiply the result by the number of thorns per rose: 75 * 8 = 600

So, there are 600 thorns in total."
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of games won as W and the number of games lost as L.

We know that the total number of games played is 22, so we can write the equation:

W + L = 22

We also know that the team won 8 more games than they lost, so we can write the equation:

W = L + 8

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for L:

L + 8 + L = 22

Combine like terms:

2L + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2L = 14

Divide both sides by 2:

L = 7

Now that we know L, we can find W by substituting L into one of the original equations:

W = L + 8
W = 7 + 8
W = 15

The first time it went off, it rang 4 times.

The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time, so it rang 3 * 4 = 12 times.

The third time it went off, it rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

Now, let's add the number of times it rang each time: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

"To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to first calculate her salary after 5 years of service, and then calculate the increase for the next 3 years.

Initial annual salary = $600
Annual increase = 10% of $600 = 0.10 * $600 = $60
Salary after 1 year = $600 + $60 = $660
Salary after 2 years = $660 + $66 (10% of $660) = $726
Salary after 3 years = $726 + $72.60 (10% of $726) = $798.60
Salary after 4 years = $798.60 + $79.86 (10% of $798.60) = $878.46
Salary after 5 years = $878.46 + $87.85 (10% of $878.46) = $966.31

Now, we need to calculate the salary for the next 3 years. The annual increase will remain the same, 10% of the salary after 5 years.

Salary after 6 years = $966.31 + $96.63 (10% of $966.31) = $1062.94
Salary after 7 years = $1062.94 + $106.29 (10% of $1062.94) = $1169.23
Salary after 8 years = $1169.23 + $116.92 (10% of $1169.23) = $1286.15

The final answer is: $1286.15"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation. Let's say Harald sold x copies. Since Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, Marilyn sold 10x copies.

We know that the total number of copies sold is 88,000, so we can set up the equation:

x + 10x = 88,000

Combine like terms:

11x = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:

x = 8,000

So Harald sold 8,000 copies.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8000}$"
"To find out how many gift bags Christina needs, we first need to calculate the number of guests who will actually attend the party. Since 1/4 of the invited guests don't show up, we can find the number of guests who will attend by subtracting 1/4 from the total number of invited guests.

16 (invited guests) - (1/4 of 16) = 16 - (16/4) = 16 - 4 = 12

Now that we know 12 guests will attend, we can calculate the total number of gift bags needed. Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, so we multiply the number of guests by 0.75.

12 (guests) * 0.75 (gift bags per guest) = 9

Since each gift bag costs $2, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of gift bags by the cost per gift bag.

9 (gift bags) * $2 (cost per gift bag) = $18

"To find the total amount of potato salad needed, we need to calculate the amount eaten by adults and children separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the amount eaten by adults: 
20 adults * 10 lbs/adult = 200 lbs

Since a child eats half as much as an adult, a child eats 5 lbs of potato salad. 
Now, let's calculate the amount eaten by children: 
5 children * 5 lbs/child = 25 lbs

Now, we add the amount eaten by adults and children to find the total amount needed: 
200 lbs (adults) + 25 lbs (children) = 225 lbs

The final answer is: 225"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of pets each person has and then add them together.

We know Cindy has 4 pets. Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.

Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets.

To find the total number of pets, we add the number of pets each person has: 4 (Cindy) + 6 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan) = 28.

The final answer is: 28"
"To solve this problem, we can start by using the information that James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey. This means Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old.

We also know that Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

Since Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, we can find Jackson's age by subtracting 5 from Amy's age: 9 - 5 = 4.

Therefore, Jackson is 4 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it takes Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles before he changed his diet. Since Lee runs 2 seconds faster than Gerald, we can set up an equation:

Lee's time = Gerald's time + 2

We know Lee's time is 38 seconds, so we can substitute that in:

38 = Gerald's time + 2

To find Gerald's original time, we subtract 2 from both sides:

Gerald's original time = 38 - 2
Gerald's original time = 36 seconds

Now, we know Gerald's original time is 36 seconds. Since his diet improved his speed by 10%, we need to find 10% of 36 and add it to his original time to find his new time.

10% of 36 = 0.1 x 36 = 3.6

Gerald's new time = Gerald's original time + 3.6
Gerald's new time = 36 + 3.6
Gerald's new time = 39.6 seconds

The final answer is: 39.6"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of cats, then the number of rabbits, and finally add them up with the number of dogs to get the total number of pets.

Given that there are two cats for every dog, and the number of dogs is 60, we can find the number of cats by multiplying the number of dogs by 2.

Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
= 2 * 60
= 120

Now, we know that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. We can find the combined number of dogs and cats by adding the number of dogs and cats.

Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
= 60 + 120
= 180

Now, we can find the number of rabbits by subtracting 12 from the combined number of dogs and cats.

Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
= 180 - 12
= 168

Finally, we can find the total number of pets in the neighborhood by adding the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits.

Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
= 60 + 120 + 168
= 348

"To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we first need to find the total number of girls and then subtract the number of girls in the girl scout.

First, let's find the number of boys and girls. We know that 2/5 of the students are boys. 

Number of boys = (2/5) * 200 = (2 * 200) / 5 = 400 / 5 = 80

Since there are 200 students in total, the number of girls is:
Number of girls = Total students - Number of boys
= 200 - 80
= 120

Now, we know that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. 

Number of girls in the girl scout = (2/3) * Number of girls
= (2 * 120) / 3
= 240 / 3
= 80

Now, to find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
Number of girls not in the girl scout = Total number of girls - Number of girls in the girl scout
= 120 - 80

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many ounces of tomatoes Freda used to make 32 ounces of sauce. Since the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked, the amount of tomatoes used must be double the amount of sauce made.

Let's start by finding the amount of tomatoes used:

32 ounces (sauce) * 2 = 64 ounces (tomatoes)

Since each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes, we need to find out how many cans of tomatoes were used:

64 ounces (tomatoes) / 16 ounces (per can) = 4 cans

Now, we know that each can contains 3 tomatoes, so we multiply the number of cans by 3:

4 cans * 3 tomatoes/can = 12 tomatoes

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes. Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as x.

We know that 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. So, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is x + 20.

We also know that 5 cars took an exit, so the number of cars that didn't drive through the traffic jam is 5. Since there were originally 30 cars on the motorway, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 30 - 5 = 25.

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

x + 20 = 25

To solve for x, we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

x = 25 - 20
x = 5

So, 5 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to find the inner volume of one box. 

The outer dimensions of the box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches, but the walls are 1 inch thick. So, the inner dimensions will be (5-2) inches by (6-2) inches by (4-2) inches, which is 3 inches by 4 inches by 2 inches.

The formula to find the volume of a rectangular prism is length * width * height. 

So, the inner volume of one box is 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches.

Since John has 3 boxes, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 3 * 24 = 72 cubic inches.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Frankie spent watching TV and then subtract the time spent watching 1-hour episodes to find the time spent watching 30-minute episodes.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 2 * 1 = 2 hours of 1-hour episodes.

On Thursday, he watched 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 hours of 1-hour and 30-minute episodes.

On Friday, he watched 2 * 1 = 2 hours of 1-hour episodes.

The total time spent watching 1-hour episodes is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched 7 hours of TV in total, the time spent watching 30-minute episodes is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

"To solve this problem, we can start by letting x be the number of cookies Henry baked last year. Since he wants to make twice as many as he did last year, he plans to bake 2x cookies this year.

However, he actually baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the total number of cookies he baked is 2x + 15.

After dropping 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies left. This can be represented by the equation:

2x + 15 - 5 = 110

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation, we get:

2x = 100

Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get:

x = 50

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To find the total cost of the gas before the cashback, we multiply the price per gallon by the number of gallons purchased.

Cost of gas before cashback = Price per gallon * Number of gallons
Cost of gas before cashback = $3.00 * 10
Cost of gas before cashback = $30.00

Next, we calculate the total cashback amount by multiplying the cashback per gallon by the number of gallons purchased.

Total cashback = Cashback per gallon * Number of gallons
Total cashback = $0.20 * 10
Total cashback = $2.00

Now, we subtract the total cashback from the cost of gas before cashback to find the final cost of the gas.

Final cost of gas = Cost of gas before cashback - Total cashback

"To find the total number of fruit roll-ups eaten by each person, we need to multiply the width and length of each roll-up. 

Beatrice's roll-up is 2 roll-ups wide and 24 rolls up long, so the total number of roll-ups is 2 * 24 = 48.

Marcell's roll-up is 3 roll-ups wide and 14 rolls up long, so the total number of roll-ups is 3 * 14 = 42.

To find the average number of roll-ups eaten, we need to add the total number of roll-ups eaten by both Marcell and Beatrice and divide by 2.

Total roll-ups eaten = 48 + 42 = 90

Average roll-ups eaten = Total roll-ups eaten / 2 = 90 / 2 = 45

The final answer is: 45"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the rate at which the boat is taking on water and then multiply it by the total time it took to reach the shore.

First, let's find the rate at which the boat is taking on water. We know that for every 10 feet rowed, the boat takes on 2 liters of water. 

The time it took to row 20 feet is 16 seconds. We can use this information to find the rate of water intake per second. 

Since 20 feet is twice 10 feet, the boat will take on twice the amount of water, which is 4 liters. 

The time taken to row 20 feet is 16 seconds, so the rate of water intake per second is 4 liters / 16 seconds = 0.25 liters per second.

Now, we need to find the total time it took to reach the shore, which is 64 seconds. 

The total amount of water taken on is the rate of water intake per second multiplied by the total time. 

Total water taken on = 0.25 liters/second * 64 seconds = 16 liters.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we need to calculate the total number of lessons and then multiply it by the number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per lesson.

Each teacher has 2 lessons per day, and there are 4 teachers. So, the total number of lessons per day is 2 * 4 = 8.

The whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson. Therefore, the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day is 8 * 3 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote the number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold as B, the number of photographs that Jamal's phone can hold as J, and the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as D.

We are given that J = 1800 and J = 6B.

From the first equation, we can find the value of B:
J = 6B
1800 = 6B
B = 1800 / 6
B = 300

Now, we are given that B = 50D. We can substitute the value of B we found earlier:
300 = 50D
D = 300 / 50
D = 6

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the profit, we first need to calculate the total cost of the lumber and the total selling price. 

The cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $10 = $100. 
The cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $16 = $80. 
The total cost is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the new price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15. 
The new price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24.

The total selling price is 10 * $15 + 5 * $24 = $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit is the total selling price minus the total cost, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, we need to first find the total number of parts in the ratio, which is 7 + 13 = 20. 

Since the total amount of sugar and water used is 120, we can set up a proportion to find the value of one part: 7/20 = x/120, where x is the value of one part.

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 7 * 120 = 20x, which gives us 840 = 20x. 

Now, we can divide both sides by 20 to find x: x = 840 / 20 = 42.

Since the ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used is 7 parts, which is 7 * 42 = 294.

The final answer is: 294"
"To find the total amount John paid, we need to calculate the cost of the shoes for each child and then multiply it by the number of children.

Since John buys 2 pairs of shoes for each child and each pair costs $60, the cost for each child is 2 * $60 = $120.

Now, we multiply the cost for each child by the number of children: $120 * 3 = $360.

"To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we first need to find the total number of vehicles that were already at the port. We know that there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles initially is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of vehicles at the port after the second day is 30. To find the number of vehicles brought in on the second day, we subtract the initial number of vehicles from the total number of vehicles: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can find the number of containers brought in on the second day by dividing the number of vehicles brought in by the number of vehicles per container: 20 / 5 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Lylah's original salary. Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship.

Let L be Lylah's original salary. Then, Adrien's original salary is 1.3L (since 30% more is the same as multiplying by 1.3).

We are given that Adrien's original salary was $40,000. So, we can set up the equation:

1.3L = 40,000

To find L, we can divide both sides by 1.3:

L = 40,000 / 1.3
L = 30,769.23

Now that we know Lylah's original salary, we can find Adrien's salary four years later. We are told that Adrien's salary increased by 40% over this period. This means his new salary is 1.4 times his original salary (since 40% more is the same as multiplying by 1.4).

Adrien's new salary = 1.4 * 40,000
Adrien's new salary = 56,000

We also need to find Lylah's new salary. Since their salaries increased simultaneously, we can assume that Lylah's salary also increased by 40%. We can find her new salary by multiplying her original salary by 1.4:

Lylah's new salary = 1.4 * 30,769.23
Lylah's new salary = 43,078.12

Now, we can find the total salary of both Adrien and Lylah four years later by adding their new salaries:

Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary
Total salary = 56,000 + 43,078.12
Total salary = 99,078.12

The final answer is: $99078.12"

Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad has 30 sheets. So, the total number of sheets he uses in a week is:
2 pads/week * 30 sheets/pad = 60 sheets/week

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we can multiply the number of sheets used in a week by 4 to get the total number of sheets used in a month:
60 sheets/week * 4 weeks/month = 240 sheets/month

"To find the total number of fruits, we need to calculate the number of fruits each person brought and then add them together.

Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges. 

Kael brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette, so Kael brought 2 * 5 = 10 apples. 
Kael brought half the number of oranges as Morisette, so Kael brought 8 / 2 = 4 oranges.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits each person brought:
Morisette: 5 apples + 8 oranges = 13 fruits
Kael: 10 apples + 4 oranges = 14 fruits

The total number of fruits they have is 13 + 14 = 27.

"To find the total hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we need to break down her sleep into three parts: Monday, the two days with reduced sleep, and the rest of the week.

On Monday, Sadie slept 8 hours.

For the next two days, she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours each day. Since there are two days, the total hours for these two days is 6 * 2 = 12 hours.

The rest of the week consists of 5 days (Tuesday to Friday). She slept 1 hour more than the reduced sleep, which is 6 + 1 = 7 hours per day. The total hours for these 5 days is 7 * 5 = 35 hours.

Now, let's add up the total hours: 8 (Monday) + 12 (next two days) + 35 (rest of the week) = 55 hours.

First, let's calculate the distance Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour x 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, let's calculate the distance Rosie runs at 5 miles per hour for the remaining 4 hours (7 - 3 = 4):

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour x 4 hours
Distance = 20 miles

Now, let's add the distances together to find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours:

Total Distance = 30 miles + 20 miles
Total Distance = 50 miles

"To find out how many letters were in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began, we need to determine how many letters Jennie added to the pile. Since Jennie put stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, and there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters, we can set up an equation.

Let x be the total number of letters needing stamps. Since Jennie put stamps on one-third of the letters, she added x/3 letters to the pile. We know that the total number of letters in the pile now is 30, which is the sum of the original number of letters in the pile and the letters Jennie added. 

So, the equation is: x/3 + (x - x/3) = 30

Simplifying the equation, we get: x/3 + 2x/3 = 30

Combine like terms: 3x/3 = 30

Simplify: x = 30

However, this is the total number of letters needing stamps. Since Jennie put stamps on one-third of the letters, we need to find out how many letters were in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began. We know that Jennie added x/3 letters to the pile, so the number of letters in the pile when Jennie began is 30 - x/3.

Substitute x = 30 into the equation: 30 - 30/3 = 30 - 10 = 20

"To find the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together, we need to first find out how many friends Amy has. Since Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, and Lily has 50 friends, we can add 20 to 50 to find Amy's total number of friends.

Amy's friends = Lily's friends + 20
Amy's friends = 50 + 20
Amy's friends = 70

Now, to find the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together, we add their individual friend counts.

Total friends = Lily's friends + Amy's friends
Total friends = 50 + 70
Total friends = 120

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the cost of a watermelon and an orange. 

Let's denote the cost of a pepper as P. Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, the cost of a watermelon is 3P. 

An orange costs 5 dollars less than a watermelon, so the cost of an orange is 3P - 5.

Given that each pepper costs 15 dollars, we can substitute P = 15 into the equations for the cost of a watermelon and an orange. 

The cost of a watermelon is 3 * 15 = 45 dollars. 
The cost of an orange is 3 * 15 - 5 = 40 dollars.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the items Dillon bought: 
4 watermelons at 45 dollars each is 4 * 45 = 180 dollars.
20 peppers at 15 dollars each is 20 * 15 = 300 dollars.
10 oranges at 40 dollars each is 10 * 40 = 400 dollars.

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is 180 + 300 + 400 = 880 dollars.

"To calculate the profit, we first need to find the total time spent by doctors and the total amount charged by the hospital.

1. Calculate the total time spent by doctors:
   Total patients = 500
   Time per patient = 24 minutes
   Total time spent = Total patients * Time per patient
   Total time spent = 500 * 24 minutes
   Convert total time to hours: 500 * 24 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 200 hours

2. Calculate the total amount charged by the hospital:
   Hourly rate of doctors = $150/hour
   Total time spent = 200 hours
   Total amount charged by hospital = Total time spent * Hourly rate of doctors
   Total amount charged by hospital = 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000

3. Calculate the total amount charged to patients:
   Hourly rate of hospital = $200/hour
   Total time spent = 200 hours
   Total amount charged to patients = Total time spent * Hourly rate of hospital
   Total amount charged to patients = 200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000

"To solve this problem, we can start by representing the number of baby bees as 'x'. Since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, the number of worker bees is 2x. 

We also know that there are twice as many babies as queens, so the number of queens is x/2. 

The total number of bees in the hive is 700, so we can set up the equation: x + 2x + x/2 = 700.

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction: 2x + 4x + x = 1400.

Combine like terms: 7x = 1400.

Divide both sides by 7: x = 200.

Now that we know the number of baby bees, we can find the number of worker bees: 2x = 2(200) = 400.

"To calculate the total expenses, we need to find out how many bottles of bleach and packs of cloths Kim will need for all 8 clients. Since each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths, the total number of bottles of bleach needed is 8 * 2 = 16, and the total number of packs of cloths needed is 8 * 1 = 8.

The cost of bleach is $2 per bottle, so the total cost of bleach will be 16 * $2 = $32. The cost of cloths is $5 per pack, so the total cost of cloths will be 8 * $5 = $40.

The total expenses will be the sum of the cost of bleach and the cost of cloths, which is $32 + $40 = $72.

Since Kim's total income each week is $92, the profit will be the difference between the total income and the total expenses, which is $92 - $72 = $20.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of the bees that left in the first 6 hours return. So, 1/2 * 30 = 15 bees return.
3. The total number of bees that have left the hive so far is 30 (initially left) + 15 (returned) = 45 bees. However, 15 of these bees returned, so the number of bees that have not returned yet is 45 - 15 = 30 bees.
4. In the next 6 hours, two times as many bees as the initial 30 bees that left the hive fly from the hive and leave. So, 2 * 30 = 60 bees leave the hive.
5. The total number of bees that have left the hive so far is 30 (initially left) + 60 (left in the last 6 hours) = 90 bees. However, 30 of these bees returned in the previous step, so the number of bees that have not returned yet is 90 - 30 = 60 bees.
6. In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive. So, 60 bees return to the hive.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets and then add the change she received.

The cost of 1 adult ticket is $12 and the cost of 1 child ticket is $10. 

Total cost = cost of adult ticket + cost of child ticket
Total cost = $12 + $10
Total cost = $22

Since Brittany's mom received $8 in change, we need to add this to the total cost to find out how much she gave the cashier.

Total given = Total cost + Change
Total given = $22 + $8
Total given = $30

The final answer is: $30"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many friends Dorothy has. Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends, we can set up the equation:

Charlie's friends = 3 * Dorothy's friends
12 = 3 * Dorothy's friends

To find Dorothy's friends, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

Dorothy's friends = 12 / 3
Dorothy's friends = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find out how many friends James has. Since James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, we can set up the equation:

James' friends = 4 * Dorothy's friends
James' friends = 4 * 4
James' friends = 16

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out who will win the race, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school.

First, let's convert the distances to the same unit. Since Steve's speed is given in feet per minute, we'll convert the distances to feet. There are 5280 feet in a mile, so:

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15,840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10,560 feet

Now, let's calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home:

Steve's time: distance / speed = 15,840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: distance / speed = 10,560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 36 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve will win the race. To find out how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes, we need to subtract the winner's time from the loser's time:

Waiting time = Tim's time - Steve's time = 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how much Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total cost of inflating all the tires. 

First, let's calculate the cost of inflating the bicycle tires. Each bicycle has 2 tires, and there were 5 bicycles. So, the total number of bicycle tires is 5 * 2 = 10. 

The cost of inflating these tires is 10 * 25 cents = 250 cents. 

Next, let's calculate the cost of inflating the tricycle tires. Each tricycle has 3 tires, and there were 3 tricycles. So, the total number of tricycle tires is 3 * 3 = 9. 

The cost of inflating these tires is 9 * 25 cents = 225 cents.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of inflating the unicycle tire. A unicycle has 1 tire, and there was 1 unicycle. So, the total number of unicycle tires is 1 * 1 = 1.

The cost of inflating this tire is 1 * 25 cents = 25 cents.

Now, let's add up the total cost of inflating all the tires: 250 cents + 225 cents + 25 cents = 500 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100. So, 500 cents is equal to 500 / 100 = 5 dollars.

Now, let's subtract the total cost from the $10 bill: $10 - $6 = $4.

The final answer is: $4"
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the end. 

First, we know that there were 5 fries left after the ants carried off one and the raccoon stole two thirds of the remaining fries. Let's call the total number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it 'x'. 

Since the raccoon stole two thirds of the remaining fries, one third of the fries remained. We can set up the equation: 

(1/3)x = 5 + 1 (since the ants carried off one fry)

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 3: 

x = 3(5 + 1)
x = 18

However, this is the number of fries after the raccoon stole two thirds of the remaining fries. We need to add back the fries that the raccoon stole. The raccoon stole two thirds of the remaining fries, which is (2/3)(x - 5 - 1) = (2/3)(x - 6). 

Now we add the fries that the raccoon stole back to the remaining fries: 

x = 18 + (2/3)(x - 6)

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction: 

3x = 54 + 2(x - 6)
3x = 54 + 2x - 12
3x - 2x = 54 - 12
x = 42

However, this is the number of fries after the pigeons ate three fries each. We need to add back the fries that the pigeons ate. There were 3 pigeons, and each ate 3 fries, so the total number of fries eaten by the pigeons is 3 * 3 = 9. 

Now we add the fries that the pigeons ate back to the remaining fries: 

x = 42 + 9
x = 51

However, this is the number of fries after the seagull ate half of the fries that Dave ate. We need to add back the fries that the seagull ate. Dave ate 14 fries, and the seagull ate half of that, which is 14 / 2 = 7. 

Now we add the fries that the seagull ate back to the remaining fries: 

x = 51 + 7
x = 58

However, this is the number of fries after Dave ate 14 fries. We need to add back the fries that Dave ate: 

x = 58 + 14
x = 72

The final answer is: 72"
"To find the total hours Kimo spends attending classes in a week, we need to calculate the total hours he spends on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and the total hours he spends on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes each day, and each class is 1 hour long. So, the total hours he spends on these days in a week is:
3 classes/day * 1 hour/class * 3 days = 9 hours

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes each day, and each class is 2 hours long. So, the total hours he spends on these days in a week is:
2 classes/day * 2 hours/class * 2 days = 8 hours

The total hours Kimo spends attending classes in a week is:
9 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours

Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, the total hours Kimo spends attending classes in a semester is:
17 hours/week * 16 weeks = 272 hours

The final answer is: 272"
"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to convert the length of each item to the same unit. Since we want the final answer in feet, let's convert the length of the rolls and baguettes to feet.

There are 12 inches in a foot, so:
- Each roll is 4 inches long, which is 4/12 = 1/3 feet long.
- Each baguette is 2 feet long, which is already in feet.

Now, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good in feet:
- 300 rolls: 300 * (1/3) = 100 feet
- 120 chocolate croissants: 120 * 6 inches = 120 * (6/12) = 60 feet
- 60 baguettes: 60 * 2 feet = 120 feet

Now, let's add up the total length of all the baked goods:
100 feet (rolls) + 60 feet (croissants) + 120 feet (baguettes) = 280 feet

The final answer is: 280"
"To find the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order, we need to calculate the total number of bananas needed for 2 months for each type of ape and then add them together.

The monkeys need 200 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 200 x 2 = 400 bananas.

The gorillas need 400 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 400 x 2 = 800 bananas.

The baboons need 100 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 100 x 2 = 200 bananas.

Now, let's add the total number of bananas needed for each type of ape: 400 (monkeys) + 800 (gorillas) + 200 (baboons) = 1400 bananas.

The zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"To find out who the winner is, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Since he's running back and forth, the total distance he covers is twice the length of the field for each run. So, the total distance Blake ran is 15 * 2 * 100 = 3000 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 2 * 100 = 200 yards. Then, she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 2 * 40 = 80 yards. She does this 34 times, so the total distance she covers is 34 * 80 = 2720 yards. 

To find the total distance Kelly ran, we add the initial back-and-forth run and the runs to the 40-yard line: 200 + 2720 = 2920 yards.

Now, we compare the distances: Blake ran 3000 yards, and Kelly ran 2920 yards. Blake is the winner.

To find out how much farther the winner ran than the loser, we subtract the loser's distance from the winner's distance: 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

The final answer is: 80"

"To find the total number of tadpoles Finn can see, we need to add the number of tadpoles that came out of hiding and subtract the number of tadpoles that hid under the rock.

Initially, Finn sees 11 tadpoles.

6 tadpoles came out of hiding, so we add 6 to 11: 11 + 6 = 17

Then, 2 tadpoles hid under the rock, so we subtract 2 from 17: 17 - 2 = 15

Finn can see 15 tadpoles in the pond now.

"To find the depth of the water on Wednesday, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. The initial depth of the water on Monday is 17 feet.
2. On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water, so the depth of the water on Tuesday is 17 + 7 = 24 feet.
3. On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. To find two thirds of 24, we multiply 24 by 2/3.

To multiply a number by a fraction, we multiply the numerator (2) by the number and then divide by the denominator (3). 

24 * 2 = 48
48 / 3 = 16

So, the depth of the water on Wednesday is 16 feet.

"To find the total number of fish caught by Anakin, we need to add the number of starfish, sea horses, and clownfish he caught.

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. 

Total fish caught by Anakin = 10 + 6 + 3 = 19

Now, let's find the number of fish caught by Locsin. Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so he caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish. Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so he caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses. Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so he caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Total fish caught by Locsin = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

Now, let's find the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin. 

Total fish caught = Total fish caught by Anakin + Total fish caught by Locsin
Total fish caught = 19 + 13
Total fish caught = 32

"To calculate the final cost of the bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to calculate the price increase every two months and add it to the original price.

Initial price = $20
Increase rate = 20% of the original price = 0.20 * $20 = $4
New price after 2 months = $20 + $4 = $24
Increase rate for the next 2 months = 20% of $24 = 0.20 * $24 = $4.80
New price after 4 months = $24 + $4.80 = $28.80

Substituting S = 2B into the second equation, we get:

(B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28

Combine like terms:

3B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3B = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B = 8 into the equation S = 2B:

S = 2(8)
S = 16

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote the age of Sally Two as x. Since Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, the age of Granny Red is x - 3.

We are given that Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four. Since Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, who is 8 years old, the age of Sally Four is also 8. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x - 3 = 2 * 8

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - 3 = 16

Adding 3 to both sides, we get:

x = 19

Now that we know the age of Sally Two, we can find the age of Granny Red:

Granny Red's age = x - 3 = 19 - 3 = 16

We also know that Sally Four is 8 years old, and Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old. We already found the age of Sally Two, which is 19 years old. 

To find the total age of the four birds, we add their ages together:

Total age = Sally Two's age + Sally Four's age + Granny Red's age + Sally Thirtytwo's age

"To find out how much Jessica pays in a year, we first need to calculate the increased minimum payments for each debt. 

The minimum payment for the student loans is $300, so 50% more than that would be 300 + (300 * 0.5) = 300 + 150 = $450.

The minimum payment for the credit card is $200, so 50% more than that would be 200 + (200 * 0.5) = 200 + 100 = $300.

The minimum payment for the mortgage is $500, so 50% more than that would be 500 + (500 * 0.5) = 500 + 250 = $750.

Now, we need to add up the increased minimum payments for each debt to find the total monthly payment: 450 + 300 + 750 = $1500.

To find the total amount paid in a year, we multiply the monthly payment by 12: 1500 * 12 = $18,000.

60 potatoes * (5/60) minutes/potato = 5 minutes

Now, let's add the total time to peel and cut all potatoes:
90 minutes + 5 minutes = 95 minutes

The final answer is: 95"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total cost and revenue. 

Let's denote the number of gallons as 'g'. 

The cost of lemons and sugar for each gallon is $3 + $2 = $5. 
The total cost for 'g' gallons is 5g. 
The total revenue is the number of glasses sold multiplied by the price per glass, which is 20g * $0.50 = $10g. 
The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $10g - 5g = $5g. 

We are given that the profit is $25, so we can set up the equation $5g = $25. 
To find the number of gallons, we divide both sides by 5: g = $25 / $5 = 5 gallons.

Now that we know the number of gallons, we can find the total cost of lemons. 
The cost of lemons for each gallon is $3, so the total cost of lemons for 5 gallons is 3 * 5 = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the number of Chinese participants, we first need to subtract the number of Japanese participants from the total number of participants. 

Total participants = 240
Japanese participants = 80
Chinese participants = Total participants - Japanese participants
Chinese participants = 240 - 80
Chinese participants = 160

Since we know that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants.

Number of girls = Chinese participants - Number of boys
Number of girls = 160 - 60
Number of girls = 100

The final answer is: 100"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations and calculate the remaining amount after each expense.

1. Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent: 
   1/4 of 6000 = 6000 * 1/4 = 1500
   Remaining amount after rent = 6000 - 1500 = 4500

2. Zaid spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel:
   1/3 of 6000 = 6000 * 1/3 = 2000
   Remaining amount after car fuel = 4500 - 2000 = 2500

3. Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity:
   Half of 2500 = 2500 * 1/2 = 1250
   Remaining amount after donation = 2500 - 1250 = 1250

4. Zaid gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$:
   Total amount given away = 200 + 700 = 900
   Remaining amount after giving money to his daughter and wife = 1250 - 900 = 350

Therefore, Zaid will still have 350 dollars after all these expenses and donations."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many crabs Monic and Rani have. 

Since Bo has 40 crabs, and Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, we can calculate Monic's crabs as follows:
Monic's crabs = Bo's crabs - 4
Monic's crabs = 40 - 4
Monic's crabs = 36

Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so we can calculate Rani's crabs as follows:
Rani's crabs = Monic's crabs + 10
Rani's crabs = 36 + 10
Rani's crabs = 46

Now, we can find the total number of crabs the three have together by adding the number of crabs each one has:
Total crabs = Bo's crabs + Monic's crabs + Rani's crabs
Total crabs = 40 + 36 + 46
Total crabs = 122

The final answer is: 122"
"To find out how much Lloyd earned in the first two weeks, we need to calculate his earnings for each week and then add them together.

For the first week, Lloyd tutored 5 hours at $10 per hour, so his earnings for the first week are:
5 hours * $10/hour = $50

For the second week, Lloyd tutored 8 hours at $10 per hour, so his earnings for the second week are:
8 hours * $10/hour = $80

Now, let's add his earnings for both weeks:
$50 (first week) + $80 (second week) = $130

The final answer is: $130"
"To find the number of votes the loser got, we first need to find the number of votes the winner got. Since the winner got 3/4 of the votes, we can multiply the total number of votes by 3/4.

Total votes = 80
Winner's votes = Total votes * (3/4)
Winner's votes = 80 * (3/4)
Winner's votes = 60

Now, to find the number of votes the loser got, we subtract the winner's votes from the total number of votes.

Loser's votes = Total votes - Winner's votes
Loser's votes = 80 - 60
Loser's votes = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of white carnations and then find the number of red roses. 

Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'w'. Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, the number of red roses is 4w.

We are also given that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations. So, the number of pink calla lilies is 5w.

We know that the total number of pink calla lilies is 200. Therefore, we can set up the equation 5w = 200.

To find the value of 'w', we need to solve the equation 5w = 200. 

Dividing both sides of the equation by 5, we get w = 200 / 5 = 40.

Now that we know the number of white carnations is 40, we can find the number of red roses. Since the number of red roses is four times the number of white carnations, the number of red roses is 4 * 40 = 160.

The final answer is: 160"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. Jean is two years older than Mark.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age.
3. Jan is 30 years old.

From point 3, we know Jan's current age is 30. 

Two years ago, Jan's age would be 30 - 2 = 28.

From point 2, we know that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. Half of Jan's age two years ago is 28 / 2 = 14. 

So, two years ago, Mark's age was 14 + 5 = 19.

Since Mark's age two years ago was 19, his current age is 19 + 2 = 21.

From point 1, we know that Jean is two years older than Mark. Therefore, Jean's current age is 21 + 2 = 23.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total time for each team, we need to calculate the time for each runner and add them up.

The well-rounded team's total time is the sum of each runner's time, which is 55 seconds for each runner. Since there are 4 runners, the total time is 55 * 4 = 220 seconds.

The less well-rounded team's first runner runs 60 seconds. The subsequent runners are 3 seconds faster than the previous one, so the second runner runs 60 - 3 = 57 seconds, the third runner runs 57 - 3 = 54 seconds, and the fourth runner runs 54 - 3 = 51 seconds. The total time for the less well-rounded team is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 162 seconds.

The difference in time between the two teams is 220 - 162 = 58 seconds.

The faster team will win by 58 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, and then find the difference between them.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die is the probability of rolling a 4, 5, or 6. There are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, 6) out of 6 possible outcomes, so the probability is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5 or 50%.

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5, since there are 3 even numbers (2, 4, 6) out of 6 possible outcomes. Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 = 0.25 or 25%.

Now, we need to find the difference between the two probabilities. The difference is 50% - 25% = 25%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To find out how many apples Jenna picked, we need to determine half of the number of apples her mom picked. Since her mom picked 20 apples, we can calculate Jenna's share by dividing 20 by 2.

20 / 2 = 10

So, Jenna picked 10 apples. To find the total number of apples they both picked, we need to add the number of apples Jenna picked to the number of apples her mom picked.

10 (Jenna's apples) + 20 (mom's apples) = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations. Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as 'r' and the number of hamsters as 'h'.

Since the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, the total number of rats is 3r. Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, so the total number of straw given to rats is 6 * 3r = 18r.

There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw, so the total number of straw given to hamsters is 5 * 10 = 50.

The total number of straw distributed among the small rodents is 160, which is the sum of the straw given to rats and hamsters. We can set up the equation:

18r + 50 = 160

Now, we can solve for 'r':

18r = 160 - 50

"To calculate the total amount Mandy should pay, we need to calculate the simple interest first. 

Simple interest is calculated using the formula: 

I = P * r * t

Where:
I = interest
P = principal (initial amount) = $100
r = monthly interest rate = 2% = 0.02
t = time in years = 3 months = 3/12 = 0.25 years

I = 100 * 0.02 * 0.25
I = 0.5

Now, we add the interest to the principal to get the total amount Mandy should pay:

Total amount = P + I
Total amount = 100 + 0.5
Total amount = 100.5

The final answer is: $100.5"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of bags as 'x'.

The cost of buying the bags is $20x (since each bag costs $20).
The cost of transporting the bags is $2x (since each bag costs $2 to transport).
The total revenue from selling the bags is $30x (since each bag is sold at $30).
The total profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is given as $400.

So, the equation becomes:
30x - (20x + 2x) = 400

Combine like terms:
30x - 22x = 400
8x = 400

Now, divide both sides by 8 to solve for x:
x = 400 / 8
x = 50

"To find out how much each friend paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets, food, and rides, and then divide it by 3.

First, let's find the cost of the food. They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. Since they spent $20.25 on tickets, the cost of food is:
$20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75

The cost of the rides is 2 rides * $33 per ride = $66.

Now, let's add up the total cost:
$20.25 (tickets) + $15.75 (food) + $66 (rides) = $102

Since they split the cost evenly among 3 friends, each friend's share is:

"To find out how many peaches John collects, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he works and then multiply it by the number of peaches he collects per minute.

Since John collects peaches for 3 hours, we need to convert the hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Now, we know John collects 2 peaches per minute. To find the total number of peaches, we multiply the total minutes by the peaches per minute:

180 minutes * 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches

The final answer is: 360"
"To find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ducks needs per day, we first need to calculate the total pounds of insects needed per week for the entire flock. 

Since each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week, and there are 10 ducks, the total pounds of insects needed per week is:
3.5 pounds/duck * 10 ducks = 35 pounds/week

Next, we need to convert the weekly amount to a daily amount. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total pounds of insects needed per week by 7:
35 pounds/week / 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total number of trees Tom has left, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Calculate the net change in the number of trees Tom plants and chops down each year: 
   Trees planted per year = 10
   Trees chopped down per year = 2
   Net change per year = 10 - 2 = 8

2. Calculate the total number of trees Tom has after 10 years:
   Initial number of trees = 50
   Net change per year = 8
   Number of years = 10
   Total trees after 10 years = 50 + (8 * 10) = 50 + 80 = 130

3. Calculate the number of trees that die after 10 years:
   Percentage of trees that die = 30%
   Total trees after 10 years = 130
   Number of trees that die = 130 * 0.3 = 39

4. Calculate the final number of trees Tom has:
   Total trees after 10 years = 130
   Number of trees that die = 39
   Final number of trees = 130 - 39 = 91

The final answer is: 91"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos on Sue's front yard.

On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. They painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back out on Sue's front yard. So, now there are 6 white flamingos and 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos.

On Sunday morning, the neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection. Now, there are 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos.

The total number of flamingos on Sue's front yard is 30 pink + 6 white = 36 flamingos.

To find out how many more pink plastic flamingos were out than white plastic flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find out how many crayons Violetta can buy, we need to divide the amount of money she has by the cost of one crayon. 

Number of crayons = Total money / Cost of one crayon
Number of crayons = $20 / $2
Number of crayons = 10

Since Violetta needs 5 different colors, she can buy 2 crayons of each color.

Now, let's find out how much money she will spend on the crayons.
Total money spent = Number of crayons * Cost of one crayon
Total money spent = 10 * $2
Total money spent = $20

Since Violetta spent all her money, she will get no change.

The final answer is: $0"
"To find the cost of a pen, we need to add the cost of a pencil and an eraser, since a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined.

Cost of a pencil: $1.20
Cost of an eraser: $0.30
Cost of a pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser
Cost of a pen = $1.20 + $0.30
Cost of a pen = $1.50

Now, we need to find the cost of 8 pens.
Cost of 8 pens = Cost of a pen * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $1.50 * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $12.00

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we first need to calculate the total pounds of carrots that will be used by the restaurants. 

Since each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots and there are 40 restaurants, we can multiply the number of restaurants by the pounds each restaurant will receive:

40 restaurants * 2 pounds/restaurant = 80 pounds

Now, we subtract the total pounds used from the initial amount of carrots:

200 pounds - 80 pounds = 120 pounds

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the number of children in Soda, we need to subtract the total number of men and women from the total population.

Total population = 23786
Number of men = 8417

23786 - 17509 = 6277

So, there are 6277 children in Soda. 

6277"
"To find the total number of Pokémon cards Elaine has now, we need to calculate the number of cards she collected each month and add them to the initial number of cards.

Initially, Elaine had 20 Pokémon cards.

In the first month, she collected three times the initial number of cards: 3 * 20 = 60 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than in the first month: 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months: (60 + 40) * 2 = 200 cards.

Now, let's add up the cards from each month and the initial number of cards: 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320.

The final answer is: 320"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many sentences Mark edits for each publisher and then calculate the total amount he earns from each publisher.

Let's denote the number of sentences Mark edits for Publisher A as x. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, the number of sentences for Publisher B is also x.

We know that Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, so we can set up the equation:

x + x = 1000

Combine like terms:

2x = 1000

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 500

So Mark edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B.

Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, so the total amount Mark earns from Publisher A is:

500 * 5 = 2500 cents

Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, so the rate for Publisher B is 2 * 5 = 10 cents per sentence. The total amount Mark earns from Publisher B is:

500 * 10 = 5000 cents

The total amount Mark makes in a week is the sum of the amounts from both publishers:

2500 + 5000 = 7500 cents

The final answer is: 7500"
"To find the total amount of water Baldur gets every day, we need to calculate the total number of pails he gets in a day and then multiply it by the amount of water in each pail.

Baldur gets 5 pails of water every morning and 6 pails of water every afternoon. So, the total number of pails he gets in a day is 5 + 6 = 11 pails.

Since each pail contains 5 liters of water, the total amount of water he gets every day is 11 pails * 5 liters/pail = 55 liters.

The final answer is: 55"
"To calculate John's total earnings for the year, we need to calculate his new salary after the 5% raise and then multiply it by the number of weeks he works in a year.

First, let's calculate the 5% raise. 5% of $2000 is 0.05 x $2000 = $100. 

So, his new salary is $2000 + $100 = $2100 per week.

Since John works every week of the year, there are 52 weeks in a year. 

Now, let's calculate his total earnings for the year: $2100 x 52 = $109,200.

In addition to his salary, John also received a one-time bonus of $5000.

So, his total earnings for the year are $109,200 + $5000 = $114,200.

"To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the slices used for sandwiches, omelets, and the macaroni and cheese dish separately and then add them together.

1. Slices used for sandwiches: 
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for a week (7 days) and used 2 slices per sandwich. 
   - Total slices used for sandwiches = 7 days * 2 slices/day = 14 slices

2. Slices used for omelets: 
   - Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days of the week and used one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich (2 + 1 = 3 slices per omelet).
   - Total slices used for omelets = 3 days * 3 slices/day = 9 slices

3. Slices used for macaroni and cheese: 
   - Carl used 8 slices of cheese in the macaroni and cheese dish.

Now, let's add the slices used for sandwiches, omelets, and the macaroni and cheese dish together:
Total slices used = 14 (sandwiches) + 9 (omelets) + 8 (macaroni and cheese) = 31 slices

The final answer is: 31"
"To find the total number of pens Janet has now, we need to calculate the number of pens she had initially and the number of pens she bought.

Janet initially had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, so the total number of pens she had initially is 22 + 10 = 32.

She bought 6 bags of blue pens, with 9 pens in each bag, so the total number of blue pens she bought is 6 x 9 = 54.

She also bought 2 bags of red pens, with 6 pens in each bag, so the total number of red pens she bought is 2 x 6 = 12.

Now, let's add the number of pens she bought to the number of pens she had initially: 32 (initial pens) + 54 (blue pens) + 12 (red pens) = 98.

However, we also need to consider the number of green and yellow pens she already had. Since she bought blue and red pens, the number of green and yellow pens remains the same. So, the total number of pens Janet has now is 98 + 22 (green pens) + 10 (yellow pens) = 130.

The final answer is: 130"
"To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we first need to find the total score she needs for the semester. Since Mr. Bert allows the students to remove the lowest score, we will first find the total score of the five tests and then add the score of the sixth test to it.

The average of the six tests is 93. Since there are six tests, the total score for the semester will be 6 * 93 = 558.

The total score of the first five tests is 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 338.

To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we subtract the total score of the first five tests from the total score for the semester: 558 - 338 = 220.

So, Brinley needs a score of 220 on the sixth test to get an average of 93.

"To find the total weight of the bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the weight of the chocolate bars. Since there are 25 chocolate bars and each weighs 40g, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
25 * 40g = 1000g

Next, let's find the weight of the candied apples. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, the weight of each candied apple is:
40g / 2 = 20g

Now, let's find the total weight of the candied apples:
80 * 20g = 1600g

Finally, let's add the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag of candy:
1000g + 1600g = 2600g

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since each plate costs $6000, half a dozen plates will cost 6 * $6000 = $36,000.

We are also given that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, the total cost of twenty dozen cups is $36,000 - $1200 = $34,800.

Since there are 24 cups in a dozen, twenty dozen cups will be 20 * 24 = 480 cups.

To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of twenty dozen cups by the number of cups: $34,800 / 480 = $72.50.

The final answer is: $72.50"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes, and then determine how much more money Sara needs to earn. 

The total cost of the jacket and shoes is $30 (jacket) + 2 * $20 (shoes) = $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved, so she needs to earn $70 - $10 = $60 more.

Sara earns $5 each time she babysits, so she needs to babysit $60 / $5 = 12 times to earn enough money.

However, we also need to consider that she earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. Since we don't know how much she earns from babysitting, we need to set up an equation to find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn.

Let x be the number of times she mows the lawn. The total amount she earns from mowing the lawn is 4x. The total amount she earns from babysitting is 12 * $5 = $60. The total amount she has is $10 (initial savings) + 4x + $60.

We want this total to be greater than or equal to $70 (the cost of the jacket and shoes). So, we can set up the inequality:

10 + 4x + 60 ≥ 70

Combine like terms:

4x + 70 ≥ 70

Subtract 70 from both sides:

4x ≥ 0

Divide both sides by 4:

x ≥ 0

However, this is not a useful answer, as it means she can afford the jacket and shoes by not mowing the lawn at all. We need to consider the amount she earns from babysitting as well. 

Let's set up another equation to find the number of times she needs to mow the lawn, assuming she earns the minimum amount from babysitting (12 times). The total amount she earns from babysitting is $60. The total amount she needs to earn is $70. The amount she earns from mowing the lawn is 4x.

We can set up the equation:

60 + 4x = 70

Subtract 60 from both sides:

4x = 10

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 2.5

Since she can't mow the lawn a fraction of a time, we round up to the nearest whole number. However, we need to consider the amount she earns from babysitting as well. 

Let's set up another equation to find the number of times she needs to mow the lawn, assuming she earns the maximum amount from babysitting (12 times). The total amount she earns from babysitting is $60. The total amount she needs to earn is $70. The amount she earns from mowing the lawn is 4x.

We can set up the equation:

60 + 4x = 70

Subtract 60 from both sides:

4x = 10

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 2.5

Since she can't mow the lawn a fraction of a time, we round up to the nearest whole number. However, we need to consider the amount she earns from babysitting as well. 

Let's set up another equation to find the number of times she needs to mow the lawn, assuming she earns the minimum amount from babysitting (1 time). The total amount she earns from babysitting is $5. The total amount she needs to earn is $70. The amount she earns from mowing the lawn is 4x.

We can set up the equation:

5 + 4x = 70

Subtract 5 from both sides:

4x = 65

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 16.25

Since she can't mow the lawn a fraction of a time, we round up to the nearest whole number.

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"Let's denote the number of red chickens as R and the number of white chickens as W. We are given that W = R + 2.

We also know that the total number of eggs collected is 42. Since each red chicken produces 3 eggs and each white chicken produces 5 eggs, we can set up the following equation:

3R + 5W = 42

Substituting W = R + 2 into the equation, we get:

3R + 5(R + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3R + 5R + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8R + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8R = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

R = 4

"To find the time Gary spends walking, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the park. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the dimensions of the park, we can plug in the values: 
P = 2(1.5 + 6)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Now that we have the perimeter, we can use the formula time = distance / speed to find the time Gary spends walking. 

Given the perimeter (distance) is 15 miles and Gary's speed is 3 miles/hour, we can calculate the time as follows:
time = distance / speed
time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
time = 5 hours

"To find the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to first find the total number of customers she counted on the first two days. 

Let's denote the number of customers on the first day as x. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so the number of customers on the second day is x + 50.

The total number of customers on the first two days is x + (x + 50) = 2x + 50.

We know that the total number of customers by the third day was 500. Since the number of customers on the third day is the sum of the customers on the first two days and the customers on the third day, we can set up the equation:

2x + 50 + x = 500

Combine like terms:
3x + 50 = 500

Subtract 50 from both sides:
3x = 450

Divide both sides by 3:
x = 150

Now that we know the number of customers on the first day (x = 150), we can find the number of customers on the second day:
x + 50 = 150 + 50 = 200

The number of customers on the third day is the sum of the customers on the first two days and the customers on the third day, which is 500. However, we are looking for the number of customers on the third day. Since we already know the total for the first two days (150 + 200 = 350), we can find the number of customers on the third day by subtracting the total for the first two days from the total for the three days:
500 - 350 = 150

The final answer is: 150"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of differential equations. However, since the rate of change of water in each pool is constant, we can model this situation using a system of linear equations.

Let's denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as S0 and the initial amount of water in the big pool as B0. We know that 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, so we can write:

B0 = 2S0

We also know that the rate of change of water in each pool is -4 gallons/minute, since they are leaking. The current amount of water in the small pool is S and the current amount of water in the big pool is B.

We can write the following system of equations:

dS/dt = -4
dB/dt = -4

Since the rate of change is constant, we can integrate these equations to find the current amount of water in each pool:

S(t) = S0 - 4t
B(t) = B0 - 4t

We are given that the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool, so we can write:

B(t) = 4S(t)

Substituting the expressions for B(t) and S(t), we get:

B0 - 4t = 4(S0 - 4t)

Substituting B0 = 2S0, we get:

2S0 - 4t = 4S0 - 16t

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2S0 = 12t

S0 = 6t

Since we want to find the current amount of water in the small pool, we need to find S(t). We know that S0 = 6t, so we can substitute this into the expression for S(t):

S(t) = S0 - 4t
= 6t - 4t
= 2t

We are not given the value of t, but we are given that 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. This means that the time elapsed is 4 minutes, so t = 4.

Substituting t = 4 into the expression for S(t), we get:

S(4) = 2(4)

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total interest paid and the total amount paid, then subtract the total amount paid from the initial amount borrowed to find the remaining balance.

First, let's calculate the total interest paid. The interest rate is 10% of the initial amount borrowed, which is $2000. 

Interest = 10% of $2000 = 0.1 * $2000 = $200

Since Janeth is paying $165 per month for 12 months, the total amount paid is:

Total Amount Paid = $165 * 12 = $1980

Now, let's add the interest to the initial amount borrowed to find the total amount Janeth needs to pay:

Total Amount = Initial Amount + Interest = $2000 + $200 = $2200

Now, let's subtract the total amount paid from the total amount to find the remaining balance:

Remaining Balance = Total Amount - Total Amount Paid = $2200 - $1980 = $220

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the current ages of Adrian and Zack. 

Since Harriet is 21 years old, and she is half the age of Zack, Zack's age is twice Harriet's age. So, Zack's age is 2 * 21 = 42 years.

Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, so Adrian's age is 3 * 21 = 63 years.

Now, we need to find their ages in three years. 

In three years, Harriet's age will be 21 + 3 = 24 years.
In three years, Zack's age will be 42 + 3 = 45 years.
In three years, Adrian's age will be 63 + 3 = 66 years.

To find the average age of the three in three years, we need to add their ages and divide by 3.

Average age = (24 + 45 + 66) / 3
Average age = 135 / 3
Average age = 45

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first find out how many points Yuri and Brianna scored. 

Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Naomi scored 68 points, so half of that is 68 / 2 = 34. 10 more than that is 34 + 10 = 44. 

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

We know that the total points scored by all four students is 251. We already know that Naomi scored 68, Yuri scored 44, and Brianna scored 85. So, the total points scored by these three students is 68 + 44 + 85 = 197. 

To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to subtract the total points scored by the other three students from the total points scored by all four students. So, 251 - 197 = 54.

"To find the total number of days Andrew will travel, we need to calculate the total number of days for the trip to Rochester by bus and the return trip from Rochester by car.

The trip to Rochester by bus takes 6 days. 
The trip from New Jersey to Rochester by car takes half as many days as the bus trip, which is 6 / 2 = 3 days.

So, the total number of days for the round trip is 6 (bus to Rochester) + 3 (car from Rochester) = 9 days.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the probability of picking a water type card, we need to first calculate the total number of cards after the changes. 

Initially, James has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards. 

After losing 8 water type cards, he has 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards.

After buying 14 grass type cards, he has 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards.

The total number of cards is now 30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96 cards.

The probability of picking a water type card is the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards, which is 32/96.

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100: (32/96) * 100 = 33.333...

Rounded to the nearest integer, the probability is 33%.

The final answer is: 33"
"To find out how much Chad still owes, we need to calculate the total cost of his meal and then subtract the gift card amount.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the meal:

- Base burrito: $6.50
- Extra meat: $2.00
- Extra cheese: $1.00
- Avocado: $1.00
- 2 sauces: 2 x $0.25 = $0.50
- Total cost of add-ons: $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $4.50
- Total cost of meal before upgrade: $6.50 + $4.50 = $11.00
- Upgrade: $3.00
- Total cost of meal: $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00

Now, let's subtract the gift card amount from the total cost of the meal:
$14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

So, Chad still owes $9.00."
"To find the combined work rate of Kalinda and her mom, we need to first determine their individual work rates. 

Kalinda's work rate is 4 pieces per minute. Her mom's work rate is half of Kalinda's, which is 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute.

The combined work rate is the sum of their individual work rates: 4 pieces/minute (Kalinda) + 2 pieces/minute (mom) = 6 pieces/minute.

To find the time it will take to complete the puzzle, we need to divide the total number of pieces by their combined work rate: 360 pieces / 6 pieces/minute = 60 minutes.

Since we need to find the time in hours, we need to convert the minutes to hours: 60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour.

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the number of melons not ready to be harvested after two weeks, we need to calculate the number of melons harvested in the first and second trips.

Initially, there were 120 baby watermelons.

In the first trip, Ashlyn harvested 30% of the watermelons. 
30% of 120 = 0.3 * 120 = 36 melons.

So, the remaining melons after the first trip = 120 - 36 = 84 melons.

In the second trip, 3/4 of the remaining melons were harvested.
3/4 of 84 = (3/4) * 84 = 63 melons.

So, the number of melons harvested in the second trip = 63.

The number of melons not ready to be harvested after the two weeks = 84 - 63 = 21.

The final answer is: 21"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total cost of the cars, the tax on the cars, and the registration fees.

The total cost of the cars is the price of one car multiplied by the number of cars:
12 cars * $20,000 per car = $240,000

The tax on the cars is 10% of the total cost of the cars:
10% of $240,000 = 0.1 * $240,000 = $24,000

The registration fees are $1000 per car, so for 12 cars:
12 * $1000 = $12,000

Now, we add the total cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees to find the total cost:
$240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000

The final answer is: $276,000"
"To find out how many shells Kylie collects on Tuesday, we first need to determine how many shells she collected on Monday. 

Since Robert collects 20 shells on Monday and Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, we can calculate Kylie's Monday collection as follows: 
Kylie's Monday collection = Robert's Monday collection + 5
Kylie's Monday collection = 20 + 5
Kylie's Monday collection = 25

Now, we know that Kylie collects 2 times more shells on Tuesday than she did on Monday. 
Kylie's Tuesday collection = 2 * Kylie's Monday collection
Kylie's Tuesday collection = 2 * 25
Kylie's Tuesday collection = 50

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total number of insects in the garden, we first need to determine the number of bugs. Since there are half as many bugs as ants, and there are 50 ants, we can calculate the number of bugs as follows:

Number of bugs = Number of ants / 2
Number of bugs = 50 / 2
Number of bugs = 25

Now, to find the total number of insects in the garden, we add the number of ants and bugs:

Total number of insects = Number of ants + Number of bugs
Total number of insects = 50 + 25
Total number of insects = 75

The final answer is: 75"
"To find out how many penguins are left sunbathing, we need to determine how many penguins jumped in the ocean and how many went inside the cave. 

One-third of the penguins jumped in the ocean. Since there are 36 penguins, we can calculate this as follows: 36 / 3 = 12 penguins. 

Another one-third of the penguins went inside the cave. Again, we can calculate this as follows: 36 / 3 = 12 penguins.

Now, we need to add the number of penguins that jumped in the ocean and the number that went inside the cave to find the total number of penguins that are not sunbathing: 12 + 12 = 24 penguins.

To find the number of penguins left sunbathing, we subtract the total number of penguins that are not sunbathing from the initial number of penguins: 36 - 24 = 12 penguins.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find out how many vines Steve needs, we first need to determine how many tomatoes he eats per week. Since he eats 6 tomatoes per day, we multiply this by 7 to get the weekly amount:

6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, we can assume his girlfriend eats half as much as him. So, she eats:

42 tomatoes/week / 2 = 21 tomatoes/week

Now, we add Steve's and his girlfriend's weekly tomato consumption to get the total:

42 tomatoes/week + 21 tomatoes/week = 63 tomatoes/week

Since a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week, we divide the total weekly consumption by the number of tomatoes per vine:

63 tomatoes/week ÷ 3 tomatoes/vine = 21 vines

The final answer is: 21"
"To determine the number of pizzas John needs to order, we need to calculate the total number of slices required and then divide that by the number of slices per pizza.

First, let's calculate the total number of slices required:
20 friends * 4 slices per friend = 80 slices

Since pizzas are sold in 8 slices, we need to divide the total number of slices required by 8 to find out how many pizzas John needs to order:
80 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 10 pizzas

However, since we can't order a fraction of a pizza, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure each friend gets 4 slices. In this case, we need to round up 10 pizzas to 10 pizzas.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many new pens Ram can make from the 25 pens he buys. Since he can make one full pen from the ink of five empty pens, we can divide the total number of pens by 5 to find out how many new pens he can make.

25 pens / 5 pens per new pen = 5 new pens

Since Ram starts with 25 pens and makes 5 new pens, we need to add the initial number of pens to the number of new pens he makes.

25 (initial pens) + 5 (new pens) = 30 pens

So, Ram gets to have 30 pens in total.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the final amount of money Johnny had after a year, we need to follow the steps:

1. Johnny started with $20 and added an extra $10, so the new total is $20 + $10 = $30.
2. The sum of $30 tripled in a year, which means it was multiplied by 3. So, we multiply $30 by 3.

$30 * 3 = $90

The final amount of money Johnny had after a year is $90."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the ages of Mary and Joan first, and then add them to Jessa's age.

Since Jessa is 20 years old, and Joan is five years older than Jessa, we can find Joan's age by adding 5 to Jessa's age:

Joan's age = Jessa's age + 5
Joan's age = 20 + 5
Joan's age = 25

Now, Mary is two years younger than Joan, so we can find Mary's age by subtracting 2 from Joan's age:

Mary's age = Joan's age - 2
Mary's age = 25 - 2
Mary's age = 23

Now that we have the ages of all three girls, we can find the sum of their ages by adding their individual ages:

Sum of ages = Jessa's age + Joan's age + Mary's age
Sum of ages = 20 + 25 + 23
Sum of ages = 68

The final answer is: 68"

Initially, there were 1000 students in the hall.

30% of the students went out through exit A:
30% of 1000 = 0.3 * 1000 = 300 students went out through exit A.
Remaining students = 1000 - 300 = 700.

3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B:
3/5 of 700 = (3/5) * 700 = 420 students went out through exit B.
Remaining students = 700 - 420 = 280.

The rest of the students went out through exit C:
280 students went out through exit C.

The final answer is: 280"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many candies Robert has. Since John has twice as many candies as Robert and John has 54 candies, we can set up the equation:

2x = 54, where x is the number of candies Robert has.

To find x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 54 / 2
x = 27

Now that we know Robert has 27 candies, we can find out how many candies James has. Since James has 6 more candies than Robert, we add 6 to 27:

James has 27 + 6 = 33 candies.

Now, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James. We subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has:

54 (John's candies) - 33 (James' candies) = 21

"To find out how many hours Mike spends writing a week, we need to calculate the total number of letters he writes and then multiply it by the time it takes him to write one page.

First, let's find out how many pen pals Mike has left. 
He initially had 5 pen pals and stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. 
5 - 2 = 3

Since each of his remaining pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and he responds in kind, the total number of letters he writes per week is:
2 * 3 * 2 = 12 letters

Each letter is 5 pages long, so the total number of pages he writes per week is:
12 * 5 = 60 pages

Since he can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time he spends writing a week is:
60 pages * 6 minutes/page = 360 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:
360 minutes / 60 = 6 hours

The final answer is: 6"

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Griffin initially had 24 french fries.
2. Kyle took 5 fries from Griffin, so Griffin was left with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.
3. Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, which means Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Now, Griffin has 19 - 10 = 9 fries.
4. Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin as 'x'. After Ginger gave Griffin 'x' fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries.
5. Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. So, after Colby took 2 fries, Griffin had (9 + x) - 2 = 7 + x fries.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. Therefore, we can set up the equation 7 + x = 27 to find the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin.
7. Solving the equation 7 + x = 27, we get x = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as x. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28.

According to the problem, this difference is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums, so we can set up the equation:

28 = 2(2x)

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

14 = 2x

Now, divide both sides by 2:

7 = x

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To find the total amount Jean paid, we need to calculate the total hours worked, the total cost before the discount, and then apply the 10% discount.

1. Total hours worked per week: 6 hours/day * 4 days/week = 24 hours/week
2. Total hours worked for the entire movie: 24 hours/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours
3. Total cost before the discount: 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000
4. Calculate the 10% discount: 10% of $30,000 = 0.10 * $30,000 = $3,000
5. Total amount paid after the discount: $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000

"To find out how many calories Sue consumed, we first need to determine how many cookies she ate. 

On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 5 cookies, so Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday.

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 13 cookies, so Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.

The total number of cookies Sue ate is 20 + 26 = 46 cookies.

Her sister ate 5 + 13 = 18 cookies in total.

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, Sue consumed 46 * 200 = 9200 calories, and her sister consumed 18 * 200 = 3600 calories.

The difference in calories consumed is 9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of girls in the school and then determine the number of boys. 

First, let's find the total number of girls in the school. We know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. Since the school is 50% girls, the remaining 50% must be boys. However, we don't know the total number of students in the school yet.

Let's denote the total number of students in the school as 'x'. Since the school is 50% girls, the number of girls in the school is 0.5x.

We know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. Since there are 3 classes, the total number of girls in the school is 15 + 12 + g, where 'g' is the number of girls in the third class.

We also know that the total number of students in the school is 3 times the number of students in each class, which is 3 * 20 = 60.

Now we can set up an equation to find the total number of girls in the school:

0.5x = 15 + 12 + g

Since the total number of students in the school is 60, we can set up another equation:

x = 60

Now we can substitute x = 60 into the first equation:

0.5(60) = 15 + 12 + g

30 = 27 + g

g = 3

Now that we know the number of girls in the third class is 3, we can find the number of boys in the third class. Since the school is 50% boys, the number of boys in the third class is 20 - 3 = 17.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars. 

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's represent the number of cougars killed today as 'x'. Then, the number of wolves killed today is 3x.

We also know that Rick killed three fewer cougars today than the previous night. So, the number of cougars killed today is 15 - 3 = 12.

Since we know the number of cougars killed today is 12, we can set up the equation 3x = 12 to find the number of wolves killed today. Solving for x, we get x = 4. 

However, we already know that the number of cougars killed today is 12, so we don't need to use x. 

The total number of wolves killed today is 3x, which is 3 * 4 = 12. 

The total number of animals killed last night is 10 + 15 = 25. 

The total number of animals killed today is 12 + 12 = 24.

The total number of animals killed is 25 + 24 = 49.

Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we need to calculate 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30. 

30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. 

So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Now, we know that Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. 

So, Robert went down the slide 4 * 21 = 84 times.

"To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we first need to determine how many cows Mr. Sylas added to each stall. 

Initially, each stall had 20 cows. Mr. Sylas bought 40 cows and divided them equally among the 10 stalls. To find out how many cows each stall got, we divide 40 by 10.

40 / 10 = 4

So, each stall got 4 new cows. 

Now, we need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. We know that each stall has 20 original cows and 4 new cows. 

20 (original cows) + 4 (new cows) = 24 cows per stall

Since we want to know how many cows are in 8 stalls, we multiply the number of cows per stall by 8.

"To find the total weight of the redwood tree, we first need to calculate the total number of 10-foot sections. 

The redwood is 200 feet tall, so we divide 200 by 10 to get the number of sections: 200 / 10 = 20 sections.

Each section weighs 400 pounds, so we multiply the number of sections by the weight per section: 20 * 400 = 8000 pounds.

Next, we need to find 30% of the total weight, which is the weight of the wood eaten by termites. To do this, we multiply the total weight by 0.3 (which is the decimal equivalent of 30%): 8000 * 0.3 = 2400 pounds.

To find the remaining weight of the redwood, we subtract the weight eaten by termites from the total weight: 8000 - 2400 = 5600 pounds.

1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, and Andrea has 52 apples. So, Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.
2. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.
3. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits:

Apples: 52 (Andrea) + 44 (Jamal) = 96
Bananas: 24 (Andrea) + 48 (Jamal) = 72

Total number of fruits: 96 (apples) + 72 (bananas) = 168

"To find out how many cups of flour Carla needs, we first need to determine how many cups are needed for each day. 

For today, Carla is making 36 cookies. Since 1 dozen (12) cookies require 2 cups of flour, we can find out how many cups are needed for 36 cookies by first finding out how many dozens are in 36 cookies. 

36 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 3 dozen cookies. 

Since 1 dozen cookies require 2 cups of flour, 3 dozen cookies will require 3 * 2 = 6 cups of flour.

For tomorrow, Carla is making 30 cookies. Again, we need to find out how many dozens are in 30 cookies. 

30 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 2.5 dozen cookies. 

Since 1 dozen cookies require 2 cups of flour, 2.5 dozen cookies will require 2.5 * 2 = 5 cups of flour.

To find the total amount of flour needed, we add the flour needed for today and tomorrow. 

6 cups (for today) + 5 cups (for tomorrow) = 11 cups.

"To find the total amount of money the three girls have combined, we need to first determine how much each girl has.

Carmen has $100.
Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so Samantha has $100 + $25 = $125.
Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so Daisy has $125 + $50 = $175.

Now, we add up the amount of money each girl has: $100 + $125 + $175 = $300.

The final answer is: $300"
"To find the total price of the house, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and the transfer fee, then add them to the selling price.

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, which is $350,000. 
5% of $350,000 = 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price, which is $350,000.
12% of $350,000 = 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000

Now, let's add the brokerage fee and the transfer fee to the selling price.
Total price = Selling price + Brokerage fee + Transfer fee
Total price = $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000
Total price = $409,500

Now, let's find out how much more the total price is than Mrs. Cruz's budget.
Difference = Total price - Budget
Difference = $409,500 - $400,000
Difference = $9,500

The final answer is: $9,500"
"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to calculate the total amount he paid in fees and subtract that from the selling price, then subtract the remaining loan amount.

First, let's calculate the transfer fees: 3% of $400,000 is 0.03 x $400,000 = $12,000.

Next, let's calculate the brokerage fee: 5% of $400,000 is 0.05 x $400,000 = $20,000.

The total amount paid in fees is $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000.

Now, let's subtract the total fees from the selling price: $400,000 - $32,000 = $368,000.

Finally, let's subtract the remaining loan amount: $368,000 - $250,000 = $118,000.

The final answer is: $118,000"
"To find the total time, we first need to calculate the time it takes to heat the oil to 400 degrees. 

It takes 20 minutes to heat the oil to 300 degrees. Since it takes 40% longer to heat it to 400 degrees, we need to find 40% of 20 minutes and add it to 20 minutes.

40% of 20 minutes is 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes. 

So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat the oil to 400 degrees.

After warming the oil, it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil. Since it took 28 minutes to warm up the oil, it will take 28 - 5 = 23 minutes to cook.

The total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is 28 minutes (to warm the oil) + 23 minutes (to cook) = 51 minutes.

The final answer is: 51"
"To find the total amount spent on newspaper ads, we multiply the cost of each ad by the number of ads: $5 * 50 = $250.

To find the total amount spent on television ads, we multiply the cost of each ad by the number of ads: $75 * 15 = $1125.

Now, we add the total amount spent on newspaper ads and television ads to find the total amount spent on all ads: $250 + $1125 = $1375.

The final answer is: $1375"
"To find the number of blue golf balls, we first need to determine the total number of golf balls. Since half of the 16 balls are golf balls, we can calculate the number of golf balls as follows:

Total balls = 16
Golf balls = Total balls / 2
Golf balls = 16 / 2
Golf balls = 8

Now, we know that half of the golf balls are blue. To find the number of blue golf balls, we can divide the number of golf balls by 2:

Blue golf balls = Golf balls / 2
Blue golf balls = 8 / 2
Blue golf balls = 4

"To find the total number of M&Ms Mary got, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and add them together.

The first bag has 300 M&Ms.

The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.

The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, let's add the number of M&Ms in each bag together: 300 + 312 + 150 = 762.

The final answer is: 762"
"To find the total number of windows, we need to calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows in each house.

First, let's find the number of windows in the bedrooms. Each house has 3 bedrooms, and each bedroom has 2 windows. So, the total number of windows in the bedrooms of one house is 3 * 2 = 6. Since there are 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms is 6 * 2 = 12.

Next, let's find the number of additional windows in each house. There are 4 additional windows in each house.

Now, let's add the number of windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows in each house. The total number of windows in one house is 12 (bedrooms) + 4 (additional) = 16. Since there are 2 houses, the total number of windows is 16 * 2 = 32.

Total cost = $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35 = $14.00

Now, we need to find the change. The mother pays $20, so we subtract the total cost from the amount paid.

Change = $20 - $14.00 = $6.00

The final answer is: $6.00"
"To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we first need to determine the total number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette. 

The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches used for the body, which is 900. So, the collar takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

The total number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette is 90 + 180 = 270 stitches.

Since the total number of stitches for the sweater is 1800, and the body and the collar and rosette take 270 stitches, the remaining stitches are for the sleeves. So, the number of stitches for the sleeves is 1800 - 270 = 1530.

Since there are two sleeves, the number of stitches for each sleeve is 1530 / 2 = 765.

The final answer is: 765"
"To find the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan spent on seeds, we need to calculate the cost of the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately and then add them together.

The cost of the tomato seeds is 20 packets * $40 per packet = $800.

The cost of the celery seeds is 80 packets * $30 per packet = $2400.

Now, we add the cost of the tomato seeds and the celery seeds together: $800 + $2400 = $3200.

The final answer is: $3200"
"To find out how many lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the total number of lines for each scene and the solo song, and then add them up.

The solo song has 54 lines.

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. However, only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the solo song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has 60 * (4/5) = 48 lines from the second scene.

To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add up the lines from the solo song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

The final answer is: 138"
"To find the number of cards with the letter D, we need to calculate the number of cards with the letters A, B, and C, and then subtract that total from the total number of cards.

First, we find the number of cards with the letter A: 
2/5 of 80 cards had the letter A, so the number of cards with A is (2/5) * 80 = 32.

Next, we find the number of cards with the letter B. Since 32 cards had the letter A, the remaining cards are 80 - 32 = 48. 
1/2 of the remaining 48 cards had the letter B, so the number of cards with B is (1/2) * 48 = 24.

Now, we find the number of cards with the letter C. Since 32 cards had the letter A and 24 cards had the letter B, the remaining cards are 48 - 24 = 24. 
5/8 of the remaining 24 cards had the letter C, so the number of cards with C is (5/8) * 24 = 15.

Now, we add the number of cards with the letters A, B, and C: 32 + 24 + 15 = 71.

Finally, we subtract the total number of cards with the letters A, B, and C from the total number of cards to find the number of cards with the letter D: 80 - 71 = 9.

"To find the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we need to first find their current ages. Since the sum of their ages is 20, we can represent their ages as x and 20 - x.

Let's say Mico's age is x and Marco's age is 20 - x.

In 10 years, Mico's age will be x + 10 and Marco's age will be (20 - x) + 10.

The sum of their ages in 10 years will be (x + 10) + (20 - x + 10).

Simplifying the expression, we get:
x + 10 + 20 - x + 10
= 40

So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40.

"Let's denote Ruby's current age as R and Sam's current age as S. We are given two pieces of information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam: R = 6S
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam: (R + 9) = 3(S + 9)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for S:

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the equation:

6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtract 3S from both sides:

3S + 9 = 27

Subtract 9 from both sides:

3S = 18

Divide both sides by 3:

S = 6

Sam is 6 years old now.

"To find the total number of spots on the cobras, we need to multiply the number of cobras by the number of spots on each cobra. 

Number of cobras: 40
Spots per cobra: 70
Total spots on cobras: 40 * 70 = 2800

Since the cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, we can find the number of spots on a mamba by dividing the number of spots on a cobra by 2.

Spots per mamba: 70 / 2 = 35

Now, we can find the total number of spots on the mambas by multiplying the number of mambas by the number of spots on each mamba.

Number of mambas: 60
Spots per mamba: 35
Total spots on mambas: 60 * 35 = 2100

To find the total number of spots on all the snakes, we add the total spots on the cobras and the mambas.

Total spots on all snakes: 2800 + 2100 = 4900

Finally, to find half the number of spots they all have combined, we divide the total number of spots by 2.

Half the total spots: 4900 / 2 = 2450

The final answer is: 2450"
"To find out how many people Maddy needs to buy pizza for, we need to calculate the total number of team members and their guests. 

There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, so the total number of people from the team and coaches is 12 + 3 = 15. 

Each team member brings 2 guests, so the total number of guests is 12 * 2 = 24. 

The total number of people Maddy needs to buy pizza for is 15 (team and coaches) + 24 (guests) = 39.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, the total number of pizzas Maddy needs to buy is 39 / 3 = 13.

Each pizza costs $15, so the total amount Maddy will spend is 13 * 15 = $195.

The final answer is: $195"
"To find the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace, we need to first calculate the total length taken up by the topaz gemstones and then subtract that from the total length of the necklace to find the length taken up by the sterling silver beads. 

Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and there are 8 of them, so the total length taken up by the gemstones is 8 * 1 = 8 inches.

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches. 

The length taken up by the sterling silver beads is 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

Each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long, so to find the number of beads, we divide the total length taken up by the beads by the length of each bead: 17 / (1/4) = 17 * 4 = 68.

Total stories in the first week = 20 + 40 + 60 = 120

In the second week, each of them doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week. 

Alani doubled her stories: 20 * 2 = 40
Braylen doubled his stories: 40 * 2 = 80
Margot doubled her stories: 60 * 2 = 120

Total stories in the second week = 40 + 80 + 120 = 240

"To find out how many cents Kelly has left, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has initially and then subtract the cost of the can of pop.

Kelly has 5 quarters, and each quarter is worth 25 cents. So, the total value of her quarters is:
5 x 25 = 125 cents

She also has 2 dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents. So, the total value of her dimes is:
2 x 10 = 20 cents

Now, let's add the value of her quarters and dimes to find the total amount of money she has:
125 cents + 20 cents = 145 cents

The can of pop costs 55 cents. To find out how many cents Kelly will have left, we subtract the cost of the can of pop from the total amount of money she has:
145 cents - 55 cents = 90 cents

"To find the number of rows of 5-star, we first need to find the total number of stars in the flag and then subtract the stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows.

The flag has three rows of 8 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 3 * 8 = 24.

The flag has two rows of 6 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 2 * 6 = 12.

The total number of stars in the flag is 76.

Now, we subtract the stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows from the total number of stars to find the number of stars in the 5-star rows: 76 - 24 - 12 = 40.

Since each 5-star row has 5 stars, we divide the total number of stars in the 5-star rows by 5 to find the number of rows: 40 / 5 = 8.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the speed of the car in the slow lane, which is half the speed of the car in the fast lane. 

Speed of the car in the fast lane = 60 miles/hour
Speed of the car in the slow lane = 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour

Since both cars travel the same distance, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed

Time taken by the car in the fast lane = 480 miles / 60 miles/hour = 8 hours

Since the car in the slow lane travels at half the speed, it will take twice the time to cover the same distance.

Time taken by the car in the slow lane = 2 * 8 hours = 16 hours

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote the number of medals Ali has as A, and the number of medals Izzy has as I. We know that A = 22.

We also know that Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so I = A - 5 = 22 - 5 = 17.

Together, Ali and Izzy have a total of A + I = 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

We are also told that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. Let's denote the total number of medals given out as M. This means that 39 = M - 10M.

To solve for M, we can rewrite the equation as 39 = -9M. To isolate M, we can divide both sides by -9, which gives us M = -39 / 9.

However, since we cannot have a negative number of medals, we need to re-examine the equation. The correct interpretation is that Ali and Izzy together have 10 times fewer medals than the total number of medals given out, which means 39 = M - 10M is incorrect. The correct equation should be 39 = M/10.

To solve for M, we can multiply both sides by 10, which gives us M = 39 * 10.

M = 390

The final answer is: 390"
"To solve this problem, we first need to find out how many chocolate bars are available in total. Since each packet contains 5 chocolate bars and there are 8 packets, we can calculate the total number of chocolate bars as follows:

Total chocolate bars = Number of packets * Number of chocolate bars per packet
Total chocolate bars = 8 * 5
Total chocolate bars = 40

Next, we need to find out how many chocolate bars the adults will get. Since each adult gets 6 chocolate bars and there are 4 adults, we can calculate the total number of chocolate bars the adults will get as follows:

Total chocolate bars for adults = Number of adults * Number of chocolate bars per adult
Total chocolate bars for adults = 4 * 6
Total chocolate bars for adults = 24

Now, we need to find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children. We can do this by subtracting the total number of chocolate bars the adults will get from the total number of chocolate bars available:

Chocolate bars left for children = Total chocolate bars - Total chocolate bars for adults
Chocolate bars left for children = 40 - 24
Chocolate bars left for children = 16

Since there are 8 children and the remaining chocolate bars are to be shared equally among them, we can find out how many chocolate bars each child will get by dividing the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children:

Chocolate bars per child = Chocolate bars left for children / Number of children
Chocolate bars per child = 16 / 8
Chocolate bars per child = 2

"To calculate Susan's earnings, we need to determine the total time she worked and then calculate her earnings based on her hourly rate.

First, let's find the total time she worked. She worked from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. However, she took a half-hour break in between, so we need to subtract that from the total time.

Total time worked = 3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours

Since Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to convert her hourly rate to a per-minute rate. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

$5 / 10 minutes = $0.50 per minute

Now, we can calculate her total earnings:

Total earnings = (2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour) * $0.50/minute
Total earnings = 150 minutes * $0.50/minute
Total earnings = $75

The final answer is: $75"
"To find the total points of all three players after the extra points had been distributed, we need to first calculate their points after the fourth round.

Initially, Mike has 21 points. 
Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

After the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. 
Mike has 21 points, which is not over 20, so he gets no extra point.
Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so he gets no extra point.
Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point.

So, after the extra points had been distributed, Mike has 21 + 0 = 21 points, Jim has 18 + 0 = 18 points, and Tony has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

The total points of all three players after the extra points had been distributed is 21 + 18 + 43 = 82.

"To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we first need to determine how many oranges the sons washed. 

The oldest son is 8 years old, and he washes as many oranges as he is years old, so he washes 8 oranges. 

The youngest son is half as old as the oldest son, so he is 8 / 2 = 4 years old. He also washes as many oranges as he is years old, so he washes 4 oranges.

In total, the sons wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

Will bought 15 oranges initially, so to find out how many are left unwashed, we subtract the number of oranges washed from the total: 15 - 12 = 3.

On the second day, he does:
- 20 more pushups than the first day: 100 + 20 = 120 pushups
- 10 fewer squats than the first day: 50 - 10 = 40 squats
- Doubles the number of dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses

Now, let's add the total number of each activity done in the two days:
- Total pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Total squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Total dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

The total count of activities is the sum of the total number of each activity: 220 + 90 + 60 = 370.

"To find out how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day and then divide the total amount of rice available by that amount.

First, let's calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day. Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 3 meals per day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner). Since 5 members of the household eat rice every lunch and dinner, we'll assume they also eat it for breakfast. So, the total number of people eating rice per day is 5.

Total rice consumed per person per day = 0.2 kg
Total rice consumed per day = 5 people * 0.2 kg/person = 1 kg

Now, let's calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week. There are 7 days in a week, so:

Total rice consumed per week = 1 kg/day * 7 days/week = 7 kg/week

Now, let's divide the total amount of rice available (42 kg) by the total amount consumed per week (7 kg):

42 kg / 7 kg/week = 6 weeks

"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold and subtract that from his target.

Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he didn't sell any crates on those days. He sold 20 crates over the weekend, 15 crates on Tuesday, 12 crates on Wednesday, and 18 crates on Thursday.

Total crates sold = 20 (weekend) + 15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday)
Total crates sold = 65

Now, let's subtract the total crates sold from the target to find out how many crates Sam was off from his target.

Target = 120
Total crates sold = 65

"To calculate the total cost, we need to calculate the total miles driven per year, the total cost of driving per year, and then add the bonus.

First, let's calculate the total miles driven per year. Since John goes to work 30 miles away and back each day, the total miles driven per day is 30 * 2 = 60 miles. He goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year, so the total miles driven per year is 60 * 5 * 50 = 15,000 miles.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of driving per year. John is charged $2 per mile driven, so the total cost of driving per year is 15,000 * $2 = $30,000.

Finally, let's calculate the total bonus per year. John gives his driver a $150 bonus per month, and there are 12 months in a year, so the total bonus per year is $150 * 12 = $1,800.

The total cost per year is the sum of the total cost of driving per year and the total bonus per year, which is $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

Since Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to multiply the combined minutes by 2.

Combined minutes: 39
Twice the combined minutes: 39 * 2 = 78 minutes

Therefore, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal.

The final answer is: 78"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the folding process. When a piece of paper is folded vertically, it creates two layers: the front and the back. 

When we print the pages, we start with page 1 on the left back, then page 2 on the left front, and continue this pattern until we reach page 32. 

Since the paper is folded, the left back and left front are on one side, and the right back and right front are on the other side. 

To find the number of pieces of paper needed, we can consider the number of pages on each side. 

The left side has pages 1-16 (since page 1 is on the left back and page 16 is on the left front), and the right side has pages 17-32 (since page 17 is on the right back and page 32 is on the right front).

Since each side has 16 pages, we need 2 pieces of paper to create a tabloid with 32 pages.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much money Annika has left, we need to first calculate how much she spent on food and snacks. Since she spent half of her $50 on food and snacks, we can calculate this as:

$50 / 2 = $25

So, she spent $25 on food and snacks. Then, she spent an additional $10 on rides. 

Total amount spent = $25 (food and snacks) + $10 (rides) = $35

Now, to find out how much she has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount:

$50 (initial amount) - $35 (total amount spent) = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many books Elise sold in the first year. We know that she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, and her sales number this year is 45. 

Let's denote the number of books sold in the current year as x. Then, the number of books sold in the first year is 2x. We are also given that there are 50 unsold books, and the total number of books is 250. So, the total number of books sold in three years is 250 - 50 = 200.

We can write the equation: x + 2x + (number of books sold in the third year) = 200. However, we don't know the number of books sold in the third year. We can represent it as y. So, the equation becomes x + 2x + y = 200.

We also know that the total number of books sold in the first two years is 200 - y. We can write another equation: x + 2x = 200 - y.

Now, we can substitute the value of x + 2x from the second equation into the first equation: 3x + y = 200.

We are given that the sales number this year is 45, so x = 45. We can substitute this value into the equation 3x + y = 200: 3(45) + y = 200.

Now, we can solve for y: 135 + y = 200, y = 65.

Now that we know the number of books sold in the third year is 65, we can find the number of books sold in the first year: 2x = 2(45) = 90.

Now, we can find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year. We know that she sold 90 books in the first year and 45 books in the current year. We also know that each book sells at 20$. The total number of books sold in the first two years is 90 + 45 = 135.

The total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is 20 * (number of books sold in the second year). We can find the number of books sold in the second year by subtracting the number of books sold in the first year and the current year from the total number of books sold in the first two years: 135 - 90 = 45.

However, this is the number of books sold in the current year, not the second year. We know that the number of books sold in the first year is 90, and the number of books sold in the current year is 45. The number of books sold in the second year is 90 - 45 = 45.

The total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is 20 * 45 = 900.

The final answer is: $900"
"To find out how much Watson made in April, we need to calculate his total earnings from his hourly wage and the weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate his total hours worked in a week: 
10 hours/day * 5 days/week = 50 hours/week

Since there are 4 weeks in April, we can calculate his total hours worked in April: 
50 hours/week * 4 weeks = 200 hours

Now, let's calculate his total earnings from his hourly wage: 
200 hours * $10/hour = $2000

Next, we add the weekly bonus for 4 weeks: 
$300/week * 4 weeks = $1200

Now, we add his total earnings from his hourly wage and the weekly bonus: 
$2000 + $1200 = $3200

"To find out how many loaves are sold in the afternoon, we first need to determine how many loaves are left after the morning sales. 

The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. 

Two-thirds of 60 is calculated as (2/3) * 60 = (2 * 60) / 3 = 120 / 3 = 40.

So, 40 loaves are sold in the morning. 

Now, we need to find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales. 

The total number of loaves produced is 60, and 40 are sold in the morning. 

The number of loaves left is 60 - 40 = 20.

Half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening. 

Half of 20 is calculated as (1/2) * 20 = 20 / 2 = 10.

So, 10 loaves are sold in the afternoon.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much weight Joey loses per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks Sandy needs to lose the same amount of weight.

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so to find out how much weight he loses per week, we divide 8 pounds by 4 weeks:

8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, we multiply the weight Joey loses per week by 4:

2 pounds per week * 4 weeks = 8 pounds

Since Sandy needs to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, and we know that Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, Sandy will also lose 8 pounds in 4 weeks. However, the question asks how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey does in a single week. Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey does in a single week.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total savings, we need to calculate the savings on the tubs of ice cream and the packets of milk separately and then add them together.

The original price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $13 = $26. 
The discounted price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $11 = $22. 
The savings on 2 tubs of ice cream is $26 - $22 = $4.

The original price of 4 packets of milk is 4 x $1 = $4. 
The discounted price of 4 packets of milk is 4 x ($1 - $0.5) = 4 x $0.5 = $2. 
The savings on 4 packets of milk is $4 - $2 = $2.

The total savings is $4 + $2 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To find the total number of new limbs, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and extra legs separately and then add them together.

The person will grow an extra arm every 3 days. In 15 days, the number of extra arms will be 15 / 3 = 5.

The person will grow an extra leg every 5 days. In 15 days, the number of extra legs will be 15 / 5 = 3.

Since the person will grow 5 extra arms and 3 extra legs, the total number of new limbs will be 5 + 3 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the business suits.
6 business suits at $100 each will be 6 x $100 = $600.

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the suitcases.
3 suitcases at $50 each will be 3 x $50 = $150.

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the flight ticket.
The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. 
The cost of a business suit is $100, so 5 times that is 5 x $100 = $500.
The cost of the flight ticket is $500 + $700 = $1200.

Step 4: Calculate the total amount spent so far.
The total amount spent so far is $600 (business suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight ticket) = $1950.

Step 5: Calculate the total amount available for the trip.
Theo has $6000 and wants to save $2000, so the total amount available for the trip is $6000 - $2000 = $4000.

Step 6: Calculate the amount left for buying gifts.
The amount left for buying gifts is the total amount available for the trip minus the total amount spent so far.
The amount left for buying gifts is $4000 - $1950 = $2050.

The final answer is: $2050"
"To find the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we need to first calculate the number of eggs consumed by the three people who eat three eggs each day and the two people who eat two eggs each day.

The three people who eat three eggs each day will consume 3 * 3 = 9 eggs per day. 

The two people who eat two eggs each day will consume 2 * 2 = 4 eggs per day.

The total number of eggs consumed by the family in a day is 9 + 4 = 13 eggs.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week is 13 * 7 = 91 eggs.

"To find Trent's age, we need to first determine Jane's age, and then add 5 to it. 

Since Quinn is 30 and Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, we can calculate Jane's age as follows:
Jane's age = Quinn's age - 3
Jane's age = 30 - 3
Jane's age = 27

Now that we know Jane's age, we can find Trent's age by adding 5 to Jane's age:
Trent's age = Jane's age + 5
Trent's age = 27 + 5
Trent's age = 32

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Noah's current age as N and the population of Chile now as P.

Since Cera is 46 years old now, six years ago, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.

We are given that six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. So, six years ago, Noah's age was 40 / 2 = 20 years.

We are also given that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. So, the population of Chile six years ago was 20 * 3000 = 60000.

Since the population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now, the population of Chile now is 2 * 60000 = 120000.

The final answer is: 120000"
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as D, the number of players on the offense as O, and the number of players on the special teams as S.

We are given that there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, so we can write an equation:

O = 2D

We are also given that there is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, so we can write another equation:

S = D/2

We know that the total number of players on the team is 105, so we can write the equation:

O + D + S = 105

Substituting the expressions for O and S from the first two equations into the third equation, we get:

2D + D + D/2 = 105

Combine like terms:

4.5D = 105

Divide both sides by 4.5:

D = 105 / 4.5
D = 23.33

Since the number of players must be a whole number, we round down to the nearest whole number, as you can't have a fraction of a player.

D = 23

"To find the total number of people invited, we first need to calculate the number of people from each group. 

2 families with 6 people: 2 * 6 = 12 people
3 families with 4 people: 3 * 4 = 12 people
Total people invited: 12 + 12 = 24 people

However, 8 people couldn't come due to illness. So, we subtract 8 from the total: 24 - 8 = 16 people

Now, 1/4 of 8 people had previous commitments. 1/4 of 8 is 8 / 4 = 2 people. So, we subtract 2 from the remaining people: 16 - 2 = 14 people

The final number of people who show up for Martha's party is 14.

"To find the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store, we need to calculate the total number of marbles first.

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and added them to a store that had 50. So, the total number of marbles in the store after buying from Johanna is 20 + 50 = 70.

His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna, his father gave him 2/5 * 20 = 8 marbles.

Now, the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store is 70 (initial marbles) + 20 (bought from Johanna) + 8 (given by his father) = 98 marbles.

Since each marble weighs 2kgs, the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store is 98 * 2 = 196 kgs.

The final answer is: 196"
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth of the pool. 

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 5
Volume = 120 cubic feet

Since it costs $0.1 per cubic foot to fill, we can multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot to find the total cost.

Total cost = Volume * cost per cubic foot
Total cost = 120 * 0.1
Total cost = 12

"To find the total number of children in the classroom, we need to calculate the number of girls, nongendered children, and then add them to the number of boys.

Given that there are 30 boys, and the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, we can find the number of girls by multiplying the number of boys by 3.

Number of girls = 3 * 30 = 90

Next, we are given that there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys. To find the number of nongendered children, we can multiply the number of boys by 1/10.

Number of nongendered children = 30 * (1/10) = 3

Now, we can find the total number of children by adding the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children.

Total number of children = 30 (boys) + 90 (girls) + 3 (nongendered children) = 123

The final answer is: 123"
"To solve this problem, we need to use the given ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This means that for every 1 electric pole, 3 electric wires are needed.

Let's assume the number of electric poles is x. Then, the number of electric wires is 3x (since the ratio is 1:3).

We are given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45. So, we can set up the equation:

3x = 45

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 45 / 3
x = 15

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of people who left the party and then determine the number of women who left. 

First, let's find the total number of people who left. We know that 1/4 of the total number of people left, and 22 men stayed. Since there were 25 men initially, the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3.

The total number of people initially was 25 men + 15 women = 40 people. If 1/4 of the people left, then 3/4 of the people stayed. Since 22 men stayed, we can set up the equation:

(3/4) * Total = 22

To find the total number of people, we can multiply both sides by 4/3:

Total = 22 * (4/3)
Total = 29.33

Since we can't have a fraction of a person, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we'll keep the total as a decimal for accuracy.

Now, let's find the number of people who left. We know that 1/4 of the total number of people left, so we can multiply the total number of people by 1/4:

Number of people who left = 29.33 * (1/4)
Number of people who left = 7.33

Since 3 men left, the number of women who left is the difference between the total number of people who left and the number of men who left:

Number of women who left = Number of people who left - Number of men who left
Number of women who left = 7.33 - 3
Number of women who left = 4.33

Now, we can find the number of women who stayed by subtracting the number of women who left from the initial number of women:

Number of women who stayed = Initial number of women - Number of women who left
Number of women who stayed = 15 - 4.33
Number of women who stayed = 10.67

However, since we can't have a fraction of a person, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. But in this case, we are looking for the number of women who stayed, and the question asks for the number of women left, so we will keep the number of women who stayed as a decimal for accuracy.

The number of women who stayed is 10.67, but the question asks for the number of women left. Since 4.33 women left, we can round the number of women who stayed to the nearest whole number for the number of women left.

Number of women left = 11

"To find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have, we need to add the number of pencils Jam has in her boxes and the loose pencils to Meg's pencils. 

First, let's find out how many pencils Jam has in her boxes. We know that Jam has 2 loose pencils and a total of 26 pencils. So, the number of pencils in the boxes is 26 - 2 = 24.

Now, we add the number of pencils in the boxes to the loose pencils: 24 + 2 = 26. 

Next, we add Meg's pencils to the total: 26 + 46 = 72.

To find the number of boxes needed, we need to divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils per box. Since we don't know the number of pencils per box, we need to find it first. We know that Jam has 24 pencils in 3 boxes, so the number of pencils per box is 24 / 3 = 8.

Now, we can divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils per box: 72 / 8 = 9.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the rate of change of the coffee's strength with respect to temperature and the rate of change of the coffee's strength with respect to the amount of liquid added.

Let's denote the initial strength of the coffee as S, the initial temperature as T, and the initial volume as V. We are given that each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and makes it 12 milliliters weaker. This means that the rate of change of temperature with respect to the number of ice cubes is -13 degrees per ice cube, and the rate of change of strength with respect to the number of ice cubes is -12 milliliters per ice cube.

We can write the rate of change of temperature as:

dT/dn = -13, where n is the number of ice cubes

We can write the rate of change of strength as:

dS/dn = -12, where n is the number of ice cubes

We are also given that the coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, so the number of ice cubes required to cool the coffee by 65 degrees is:

n = 65 / (-13) = -5

Since the number of ice cubes cannot be negative, we need to find the number of ice cubes that would cool the coffee by 65 degrees. We can do this by finding the absolute value of n:

n = |65 / (-13)| = 5

So, 5 ice cubes are required to cool the coffee by 65 degrees.

The rate of change of strength with respect to the number of ice cubes is -12 milliliters per ice cube, so the total change in strength due to the 5 ice cubes is:

ΔS = -12 * 5 = -60 milliliters

We are also given that 15 milliliters of cream is added to the coffee. The rate of change of strength with respect to the amount of liquid added is not given, but we can assume that the strength of the coffee decreases linearly with the amount of liquid added. Let's denote the rate of change of strength with respect to the amount of liquid added as k. We can write the rate of change of strength as:

dS/dV = -k, where V is the amount of liquid added

We are given that the coffee is 12 milliliters weaker when one ice cube is added, so we can write:

-k = -12

Solving for k, we get:

k = 12

Now, we can find the total change in strength due to the 15 milliliters of cream:

ΔS = -k * 15 = -12 * 15 = -180 milliliters

The total change in strength is the sum of the changes due to the ice cubes and the cream:

ΔS_total = ΔS_ice + ΔS_cream = -60 - 180 = -240 milliliters

The final answer is: -240"
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple ratio. Since 2 old records are traded for 1 new record, the ratio of old records to new records is 2:1.

We know that 5 people leave with 7 new records. Since the ratio of old to new records is 2:1, for every 1 new record, there are 2 old records. 

So, for 7 new records, the number of old records would be 7 * 2 = 14.

Therefore, the 5 people brought in 14 old records.

The final answer is: 14"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of junior programmers, the number of senior programmers, and then calculate the total amount paid to each group. 

First, we find the number of junior programmers. Since the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, we multiply the total number of employees by 2/5.

Number of junior programmers = (2/5) * 100
= 40

Since the number of senior programmers is the remaining employees, we subtract the number of junior programmers from the total number of employees.

Number of senior programmers = 100 - 40
= 60

We know that senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers. So, the monthly salary of a senior programmer is $2000 + $400 = $2400.

Now, we can calculate the total amount paid to junior programmers and senior programmers separately.

Total amount paid to junior programmers = Number of junior programmers * Monthly salary of a junior programmer
= 40 * $2000
= $80000

Total amount paid to senior programmers = Number of senior programmers * Monthly salary of a senior programmer
= 60 * $2400
= $144000

The total amount paid to all programmers = Total amount paid to junior programmers + Total amount paid to senior programmers
= $80000 + $144000
= $184000

The final answer is: $184000"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the total number of people on the bus became x + 5.

At the second bus stop, 7 people got down, so the number of people on the bus became (x + 5) - 7 = x - 2.

Then, 8 more people got in, so the total number of people on the bus became (x - 2) + 8 = x + 6.

We are given that the total number of people heading to the third stop is 20, so we can set up the equation:

x + 6 = 20

To solve for x, we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:

x = 20 - 6
x = 14

"To find out how long it will take to fully charge the phone, we need to first determine how many percentage points are left to charge. Since the phone is already at 60% charged, it needs 100% - 60% = 40% to be fully charged.

Given that the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time it takes to charge 40% as follows:

40 percentage points / 1 percentage point per 3 minutes = 40 * 3 minutes

40 * 3 = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip.
The customer spent $80 on their last shopping trip. Since they earn $1 off for every $20 spent, we can calculate the rewards as follows:
Rewards = (Total spent / 20) * 1
Rewards = (80 / 20) * 1
Rewards = 4

Step 2: Calculate the total rewards available for this shopping trip.
The customer earned 4 rewards from their last shopping trip, which they can use on this shopping trip. Since they spent $43 on this shopping trip, we can calculate the rewards available as follows:
Rewards available = Min(Rewards earned, Amount spent)
Rewards available = Min(4, 43)
Rewards available = 4

Step 3: Calculate the discount from the coupon.
The coupon takes twice the amount of rewards off the price. Since the customer has 4 rewards available, the discount from the coupon will be:
Discount = 2 * Rewards available
Discount = 2 * 4
Discount = 8

Step 4: Calculate the final price paid by the customer.
The customer spent $43 on this shopping trip, used their rewards, and applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. We can calculate the final price paid as follows:
Final price = Amount spent - Rewards available - Discount
Final price = 43 - 4 - 8
Final price = 31

Since $32,400 is less than $24,000, Job A has a higher net pay rate.

To find the difference in net income between the two jobs, we subtract the net income of Job B from the net income of Job A:
$24,000 - $32,400 = -$8,400

However, since we are looking for the difference in the job with a higher net pay rate compared to the other job, we should consider the absolute difference in net income. Therefore, the correct calculation is:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

The final answer is: $8,400"
"To find the number of ruined castles, we need to calculate 40% of 220. 

40% of 220 = 0.4 * 220 = 88

So, there are 88 ruined castles in Scotland.

Since half of the ruined castles are unmanned, we need to divide the number of ruined castles by 2.

88 / 2 = 44

Therefore, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland.

The final answer is: 44"
"To find the total cost of each offer, we need to calculate the total amount paid in installments and add the advance payment.

For Furniture United's offer:
- Advance payment: $1,350
- Monthly installments: 6 * $350 = $2,100
- Total cost: $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450

For Cozy Homes' offer:
- Advance payment: $1,100
- Monthly installments: 9 * $250 = $2,250
- Total cost: $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350

"To find the final value of Maria's shares, we need to calculate the price after the first increase and then the decrease.

Initial price per share: $8
Increase percentage: 50%
New price after increase = Initial price + (Initial price * Increase percentage)
New price after increase = $8 + ($8 * 0.5)
New price after increase = $8 + $4
New price after increase = $12

Now, let's calculate the price after the decrease:
Decrease percentage: 25%
New price after decrease = New price after increase - (New price after increase * Decrease percentage)
New price after decrease = $12 - ($12 * 0.25)
New price after decrease = $12 - $3
New price after decrease = $9

Since Maria has 8 shares, we multiply the new price after decrease by the number of shares:
Final value of all shares = New price after decrease * Number of shares
Final value of all shares = $9 * 8
Final value of all shares = $72

The final answer is: $72"
"To find out how many hot dogs John ate, we first need to determine how many hot dogs Thomas ate. Since Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, and Luke ate 2 hot dogs, Thomas ate 2 * 3 = 6 hot dogs.

Then, we need to find out how many hot dogs John ate. Since John ate half the amount Thomas ate, John ate 6 / 2 = 3 hot dogs.

Now, we need to find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke. To do this, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number of hot dogs John ate: 3 - 2 = 1.

"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as x. Since the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the smallest group is x - 10.

We know that the total number of students in the class is 200, and the sum of the students in all three groups is equal to 200. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

2x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 70

Since the smallest group has x - 10 students, we can find the number of students in the smallest group by subtracting 10 from x:

x - 10 = 70 - 10
= 60

The final answer is: 60"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations. Let's use the variables C for the number of chickens and W for the number of cows.

We know that the total number of animals is 60, so we can write the equation:

C + W = 60

We also know that Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, so we can write the equation:

C = 2W

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for W:

2W + W = 60
3W = 60
W = 20

Now that we know W, we can find C by substituting W into the second equation:

C = 2W
C = 2(20)
C = 40

Now that we know the number of chickens and cows, we can find the total number of legs. Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, so the total number of legs is:

2C + 4W
= 2(40) + 4(20)
= 80 + 80
= 160

The final answer is: 160"
"To find out how many balls Josh starts juggling with on stage, we need to determine how many balls he had before the incident and then subtract the balls that were lost.

Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week for 4 weeks. So, the total number of balls he has after 4 weeks is 3 + (1 * 4) = 7.

However, Josh drops 3 balls, 2 are caught, and 1 is lost. So, the total number of balls lost is 3 - 2 = 1.

Now, we subtract the balls lost from the total number of balls Josh had: 7 - 1 = 6.

Josh starts juggling with 6 balls on stage.

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the weights of the blue beetle, green toad, yellow snake, and red bird. 

Since the pink frog weighs 50 pounds and it weighs the same as the blue beetle and the green toad, we can conclude that the blue beetle and the green toad also weigh 50 pounds.

The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.

The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we can find the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal by adding the weights of all the animals and the container: 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 210 pounds.

The final answer is: 210"

"To find the total distance Tyson covered in June, we first need to calculate the new daily distance he needs to run. 

The coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters in a day. To find 1/5 of 5000 meters, we multiply 5000 by 1/5.

5000 * (1/5) = 5000 / 5 = 1000

Now, we add this to the original distance to find the new daily distance:

5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters

Since Tyson runs 6000 meters every day, and there are 30 days in June, we multiply the daily distance by 30 to find the total distance covered in June:

6000 * 30 = 180,000 meters

The final answer is: 180,000"
"To find the price of Juice Box B, we need to add 5 dollars to the price of Juice Box A, which is 4 dollars.

"To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we need to first calculate how many cookies are used by her son and her husband.

Her son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, so the total number of cookies her son eats is 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so the total number of cookies her husband eats is 1 * 7 = 7 cookies.

The total number of cookies used by her son and her husband is 20 + 7 = 27 cookies.

Since each bag has 36 cookies, and 27 cookies are used by her son and her husband, the number of cookies left for Jenny is 36 - 27 = 9 cookies.

Therefore, Jenny eats 9 cookies.

"To find the total cost of the shirts, we first need to calculate the discount amount. 

The original price of each shirt is $30. 
The discount percentage is 40%. 
To find the discount amount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage (as a decimal): 
$30 * 0.4 = $12 

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the original price to get the discounted price of one shirt: 
$30 - $12 = $18 

Since Davos bought 2 shirts, we multiply the discounted price of one shirt by 2: 
$18 * 2 = $36 

The final answer is: $36"
"To find the percentage increase in the factory's daily earnings, we need to first calculate the daily earnings before and after the change in production.

Daily earnings from selling tractors: 10 tractors * $100 per tractor = $1000 per day
Daily earnings from selling silos: 5 silos * $220 per silo = $1100 per day

Now, let's find the difference in daily earnings: $1100 - $1000 = $100

To find the percentage increase, we'll use the formula: ((Increase / Original) * 100)
Increase = $100, Original = $1000
Percentage increase = ($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%

"To find out how many plant pots April has left over, we need to calculate the total number of plant pots she needs and subtract that from the number she already bought.

First, let's find out how many plant pots April needs for the roses. Since she needs twice as many plant pots for the roses as for the daisies, and she needs 30 plant pots for the daisies, she needs 2 * 30 = 60 plant pots for the roses.

Now, let's add the number of plant pots she needs for the daisies and the roses: 30 + 60 = 90 plant pots.

Since April already bought 100 plant pots, we subtract the total number of plant pots she needs from the number she bought: 100 - 90 = 10.

So, April has 10 plant pots left over.

"To find the total time John spent, we need to calculate the time spent boating, swimming, and watching shows. 

Time spent boating = 6 hours
Time spent swimming = 6 / 2 = 3 hours
Time spent watching shows = 3 * 2 = 6 hours

Total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows = 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours

Since this is 30% of the total time, we can set up the equation: 
0.3x = 15, where x is the total time spent.

To find x, we divide both sides by 0.3:
x = 15 / 0.3
x = 50

Now that we know the total time spent is 50 hours, we can find the time spent sightseeing, which is 40% of the total time:
Time spent sightseeing = 0.4 * 50
Time spent sightseeing = 20 hours

"To find out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to first calculate the total cost of the activities. 

The cost of mini-golf for Morgan and her friends is 1 round * $5 per round = $5. 
Since there are multiple friends, we'll represent the number of friends as 'x'. The total cost for her friends to play mini-golf is $5 * x.

The cost of arcade tokens for Morgan and her friends is $5. 
The cost of go-karts for Morgan and her friends is 2 rides * $10 per ride = $20. 
Since there are multiple friends, we'll represent the number of friends as 'x'. The total cost for her friends to ride the go-karts is $20 * x.

The total cost for all activities is the sum of the costs for mini-golf, arcade tokens, and go-karts. This is represented as $5 + $5 + $20x.

The total budget is $90. We can set up an equation to represent this: $5 + $5 + $20x = $90.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. First, let's find out how much change Billy had after buying the candy. We know he spent $10 and the candy costs $1.5 per pound. Let's call the number of pounds of candy he bought 'x'. The total cost of the candy is 1.5x. So, the change he had is 10 - 1.5x.

2. After buying the candy, Billy takes half of his change and spends it on gumballs. Since he bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, the total cost of the gumballs is 40 * 0.05 = $2. 

3. Since Billy took half of his change to buy the gumballs, the amount he spent on gumballs is half of his change. So, the change he had after buying the candy is 2 * 2 = $4.

4. Now we know that the change he had after buying the candy is $4, so we can set up the equation 10 - 1.5x = 4 to find the number of pounds of candy he bought.

5. Solving the equation, we get:
   10 - 1.5x = 4
   -1.5x = 4 - 10
   -1.5x = -6
   x = -6 / -1.5
   x = 4

"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote Carver's age as C and his son's age as S.

We know that Carver is 45 years old, so C = 45.

We also know that Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son, which can be written as C = 2S - 5.

Now, we can substitute the value of C into the second equation:

45 = 2S - 5

To solve for S, we need to isolate S on one side of the equation. We can do this by adding 5 to both sides:

45 + 5 = 2S - 5 + 5
50 = 2S

Next, we can divide both sides by 2 to solve for S:

50 / 2 = 2S / 2
25 = S

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"To find the total distance the train travels in one trip, we need to add the distances between the three cities. 

Distance from the first city to the second city = 75 miles
Distance from the second city to the third city = 100 miles
Distance from the third city to the first city = 100 - 50 = 50 miles (since it's 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs)
Total distance in one trip = 75 + 100 + 50 = 225 miles

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance it travels in a day is:
Total daily distance = 225 miles/trip * 3 trips/day = 675 miles/day

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we need to divide the total distance it travels before service by the daily distance:
Days between services = Total distance before service / Total daily distance
= 18,000 miles / 675 miles/day
= 26.67 days

So, the train goes approximately 26.67 days between services."

Let's denote the number of points Erin has after scoring 14 points as E. Since Erin has three times more points than Sara, we can write the equation:

E = 3 * 8 + 14

First, we multiply 3 by 8:
3 * 8 = 24

Now, we add 14 to 24:
24 + 14 = 38

So, Erin has 38 points after scoring 14 points. To find out how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we need to subtract 14 from 38.

"To calculate the total cost, we need to break it down into several components.

First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames. Each frame costs $20, and the etching costs an additional 20% of the frame's cost. 

20% of $20 is 0.20 * $20 = $4. 
So, the total cost of each frame, including etching, is $20 + $4 = $24.

Since 44 seniors need to receive awards, the total cost of the picture frames is 44 * $24 = $1056.

Next, 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each. The total cost of the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the cords for the officers. 1/4 of the seniors are officers, which is 44 / 4 = 11 officers. Each officer needs a cord that costs $12. The total cost of the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

The total cost of the senior gifts is the sum of the costs of the picture frames, pins, and cords: $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

The final answer is: $1198"
"To find the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the materials cost first. 

The original cost of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400. 

Since Ethan saved 20% by making his own, we need to find 20% of $400. 

20% of $400 = 0.20 * $400 = $80

This means Ethan saved $80 by making his own wallpaper. 

Now, we need to find the materials cost. Since he saved 20%, the materials cost is 80% of the original cost. 

80% of $400 = 0.80 * $400 = $320

So, the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper is $320.

The final answer is: $320"
"To find the total number of shoes sold, we need to calculate the number of shoes sold each day and then add them up.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes they sold on Friday, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the number of shoes they sold on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six people returned their pairs on Sunday, so we need to subtract 12 (6 pairs) from the total number of shoes sold on Sunday, which is 14 - 6 = 8 pairs.

Now, let's add up the number of shoes sold each day: 14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 8 (Sunday) = 50 pairs.

The final answer is: 50"

"To find the total amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we first need to find the value of the faulty pieces. 

The total value of the equipment is $400,000. 
40% of the total value is faulty. 
To find 40% of $400,000, we multiply $400,000 by 0.4 (since 40% = 40/100 = 0.4).

$400,000 * 0.4 = $160,000

This is the value of the faulty pieces. To find the value of the functioning pieces, we subtract the value of the faulty pieces from the total value.

$400,000 - $160,000 = $240,000

The total amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment is $240,000."
"To find out how much milk Mary collects every day, we need to calculate the milk from half of the sheep and the other half separately and then add them together.

Half of the sheep is 30 / 2 = 15 sheep. 
From these 15 sheep, Mary gets 1 kg of milk each, so 15 * 1 = 15 kg of milk.

The other half of the sheep is also 15 sheep. 
From these 15 sheep, Mary gets 2 kg of milk each, so 15 * 2 = 30 kg of milk.

Now, we add the milk from both halves together: 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find out how many pieces of rolls Mrs. Sherman fed to the chickens, we first need to determine how many rolls were left after feeding her children. 

A dozen is equal to 12. Since she fed her 6 children with one each, she used 6 rolls. 

12 (initial rolls) - 6 (rolls used for children) = 6 rolls left

Now, we need to find out how many pieces each roll was broken into and fed to the chickens. Each roll was broken into 8 pieces.

6 (remaining rolls) * 8 (pieces per roll) = 48

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given. 

First, let's find out how many apples Lucy sold on Monday. Since she got $56 from selling the apples at $4 per piece, we can divide the total amount by the price per apple to find the number of apples sold on Monday.

Number of apples sold on Monday = Total amount / Price per apple
= $56 / $4
= 14 apples

Now, we know that Lucy picked 12 apples on Tuesday. On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she did the previous day, which is 2 * 12 = 24 apples.

Now, we can find the total number of apples picked over the three days by adding the number of apples picked each day.

Total apples picked = Apples picked on Monday + Apples picked on Tuesday + Apples picked on Wednesday
= 14 + 12 + 24
= 50 apples

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how many socks Lindsay has washed, we need to calculate the total number of socks she has washed. 

She washed 10 pairs of socks, and each pair has 2 socks, so she washed 10 * 2 = 20 socks from the pairs. 

She also washed 15 loose socks. 

So, the total number of socks she has washed is 20 + 15 = 35 socks.

Since there are 50 socks that need washing, we subtract the number of socks she has washed from the total number of socks to find out how many she has missed. 

50 - 35 = 15

The final answer is: 15"

"To calculate the monthly payment, we need to calculate the total interest paid over the 5 months and then divide it by 5.

The formula for simple interest is: Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

Given:
Principal (P) = $3,650
Rate (R) = 10% or 0.10
Time (T) = 5 months

Interest = P * R * T
= $3,650 * 0.10 * 5
= $1,825

Now, we need to add the interest to the principal to get the total amount to be paid:
Total Amount = Principal + Interest
= $3,650 + $1,825
= $5,475

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month for 5 months, we divide the total amount by 5:
Monthly Payment = Total Amount / 5
= $5,475 / 5
= $1,095

The final answer is: $1,095"
"To find out how many kilometers Cho hiked, we need to multiply the speed by the time. 

Cho's distance = 14 km/h * 8 h = 112 km

To find out how many kilometers Chloe hiked, we need to multiply her speed by the time she hiked.

Chloe's distance = 9 km/h * 5 h = 45 km

Now, we need to find the difference between Cho's distance and Chloe's distance to determine how many kilometers farther Cho hiked.

Difference = Cho's distance - Chloe's distance
= 112 km - 45 km
= 67 km

The final answer is: 67"
"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to calculate the total number of silver pesos and gold pesos they have separately and then add them together.

Axel has 50 silver pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so Anna has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos.

Axel has 80 gold pesos. Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so Anna has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

Now, let's add the total number of silver pesos and gold pesos they have together:
Total silver pesos = 50 (Axel's) + 100 (Anna's) = 150
Total gold pesos = 80 (Axel's) + 120 (Anna's) = 200

The total number of pesos they have together is the sum of the total silver pesos and total gold pesos:
Total pesos = Total silver pesos + Total gold pesos = 150 + 200 = 350

"To calculate the profit per hour, we need to first calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

The total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make is 3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups.

The total revenue is the number of cups sold multiplied by the price per cup, which is 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

The total cost is $18.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $36 - $18 = $18.

Since Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour, we need to calculate the profit per hour. 

The profit per hour is the profit divided by the number of cups sold per hour, which is $18 / 4 cups/hour = $4.50 per hour.

The final answer is: $4.50"
"To find the initial amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we can use the information that he sold 3/5 of his land and had 12.8 hectares left. 

Let's denote the initial amount of land as x hectares. Since he sold 3/5 of his land, he was left with 2/5 of his land, which is equal to 12.8 hectares.

We can set up the equation:

(2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2 to isolate x:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land initially.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the number of girls in the choir, we first need to calculate 50% of 52, which is the total number of members. 

50% of 52 = 0.5 * 52 = 26

Since there are 26 girls, and half of them can't make it to the show, we need to find half of 26.

Half of 26 = 26 / 2 = 13

Now, we have 13 girls who can make it to the show. The 3 teachers will also be singing, so we add 3 to 13.

Total number of people who sang in the performance = 13 + 3 = 16

"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to calculate the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu and add it to the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson.

First, let's find the number of messages James delivers to Mr. Yu. Since he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can multiply the number of messages to Ms. Thompson by 1/3.

Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * Messages to Ms. Thompson
= (1/3) * 66
= 22

Now, we add the number of messages to Mr. Yu and Ms. Thompson to find the total number of messages James delivers.

Total messages = Messages to Ms. Thompson + Messages to Mr. Yu
= 66 + 22

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of parts in the ratio, which is 5 + 6 = 11. 

Next, we divide the total number of popsicles (165) by the total number of parts in the ratio (11) to find the value of one part. 

165 / 11 = 15

Now, we multiply the value of one part (15) by the number of parts each person has in the ratio. 

Betty has 5 parts, so she has 5 x 15 = 75 popsicles.
Sam has 6 parts, so he has 6 x 15 = 90 popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has.

90 - 75 = 15

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total cost of the streaming services, we need to calculate the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus. 

The normal cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 each, so together they cost $20. 

Since Tim saves 20% by bundling, we need to find 20% of $20. 
20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4

So, the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $20 - $4 = $16.

The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $16 (bundled Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26.

Since Tim was paying $60 for the cable package, he saves $60 - $26 = $34 by cancelling his cable subscription.

"To find out how many slices are left, we first need to determine how many slices Jenny gave away. 

Jenny gave 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices, we can calculate the number of slices Bill received by multiplying 12 by 1/3. 

12 * 1/3 = 12 * 1/3 = 4 slices

Jenny gave 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. We can calculate the number of slices Mark received by multiplying 12 by 1/4.

12 * 1/4 = 12 * 1/4 = 3 slices

In total, Jenny gave away 4 + 3 = 7 slices.

Jenny ate 2 slices, so the total number of slices she gave away and ate is 7 + 2 = 9 slices.

To find out how many slices are left, we subtract the total number of slices given away and eaten from the total number of slices. 

12 - 9 = 3 slices

"To find out how many bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we first need to determine the total amount of flour and milk required for the quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. Since Mark is making a quadruple batch, we multiply the ingredients by 4:

Flour: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups
Milk: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark will need to buy:
12 cups / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags of flour

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so Mark will need to buy:
4 cups / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles of milk

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour:
6 bags of flour - 2 bottles of milk = 4

"To find the energy saved, we first need to calculate the original energy consumption in watt-hours (Wh) and then convert it to kilowatt-hours (kWh). 

The original energy consumption per day is 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 Wh. 

Since there are 30 days, the total original energy consumption is 7200 Wh/day * 30 days = 216,000 Wh or 216 kWh.

If Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours, the new usage per day is 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 Wh or 2.7 kWh.

The new total energy consumption for 30 days is 2.7 kWh/day * 30 days = 81 kWh.

The energy saved is the difference between the original and new energy consumption: 216 kWh - 81 kWh = 135 kWh.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of sandwiches required to serve 20 people. Since each sandwich serves 4 people, we can divide the total number of people by the number of people each sandwich serves:

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, we need a total of 2 pounds of meat and 2 pounds of cheese per sandwich. To make 5 sandwiches, we need:

- 5 sandwiches * 1 pound of meat per sandwich = 5 pounds of meat
- 5 sandwiches * 1 pound of cheese per sandwich = 5 pounds of cheese

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the meat and cheese:

- Cost of meat: 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00
- Cost of cheese: 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

The total cost of the meat and cheese is $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that Allan initially has 40 cannolis. Since there are twice as many corns as cannolis, he has 2 * 40 = 80 corns.

Next, Allan bought 60 more cannolis and 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. This means he bought 60 cannolis and 60 - 40 = 20 corns.

Now, we need to add the initial and the additional items to find the total number of each item. The total number of cannolis is 40 (initial) + 60 (additional) = 100 cannolis. The total number of corns is 80 (initial) + 20 (additional) = 100 corns.

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 100 (cannolis) + 100 (corns) = 200.

"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to first determine how many steps he had completed before the jog. 

Elliott finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. Since he wants to walk 10,000 steps, half of that would be 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps.

He also took an additional 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So, the total steps he completed before the jog would be 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

Since he had 2,000 steps left to take after the jog, we can find out how many steps he took during the jog by subtracting the remaining steps from the total steps he wanted to take. 

10,000 (total steps) - 6,000 (steps completed before jog) = 4,000 steps left
4,000 (steps left) - 2,000 (steps left after jog) = 2,000 steps taken during the jog

Toby will be 20 minutes early."
"To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately and then add them together.

In May, the company hired 40 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, so the total hours worked by each employee in May is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in May is 160 * $15 = $2400. The total amount paid to all employees in May is 40 * $2400 = $96,000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 1/4 * 40 = 10 employees left. So, the company had 40 - 10 = 30 employees in June. Each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, so the total hours worked by each employee in June is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in June is 160 * $15 = $2400. The total amount paid to all employees in June is 30 * $2400 = $72,000.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The sale is ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means that for every 2 pounds of taffy, she pays $3 for the first pound and $1.50 for the second pound (since 1/2 off is the same as paying half the price). 

For 2 pounds, the cost would be $3 for the first pound and $1.50 for the second pound, which is a total of $4.50. 

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the items she bought:

- Taffy: $4.50
- Seashells: $1.50
- Magnets: 4 magnets * $0.25 = $1.00

The total cost is $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00.

Now, let's subtract the total cost from the initial $10:

$10 - $7.00 = $3.00

Sally has $3.00 left."
"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks and the finale firework separately and then add them together.

The first package of fireworks costs $400. The second package costs twice that much, so it's 2 * $400 = $800.

The total cost of the fireworks is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Tim gets a 20% discount on the fireworks. To find the discount amount, we multiply the total cost of the fireworks by 0.20: $1200 * 0.20 = $240.

The discount amount is subtracted from the total cost of the fireworks: $1200 - $240 = $960.

The finale firework costs $150.

The total amount spent is the sum of the discounted fireworks and the finale firework: $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To find out how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we need to calculate the total number of cookies she will eat in 30 days and then divide that by the number of cookies her recipe makes.

Shannon eats 2 cookies per night, so in 30 days, she will eat 2 * 30 = 60 cookies.

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies she will eat by 12 to find out how many dozens she needs to make.

60 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 5 dozens

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days. 

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of two independent events occurring: a candle smelling like wet dog and a candle exploding.

First, let's find the probability of a candle smelling like wet dog. This is given as 5% or 0.05.

Next, we need to find the probability of a candle not exploding. Since the probability of a candle exploding is 1% or 0.01, the probability of a candle not exploding is 1 - 0.01 = 0.99.

However, we are interested in the probability of a candle both smelling like wet dog and exploding. Since these are independent events, we can multiply the probabilities together. But we need to find the probability of a candle smelling like wet dog and then exploding, which is the same as the probability of a candle exploding and then smelling like wet dog.

The probability of a candle smelling like wet dog is 0.05, and the probability of a candle exploding is 0.01. So, the probability of a candle smelling like wet dog and exploding is 0.05 * 0.01 = 0.0005.

Now, we need to find the number of candles that will both smell like wet dog and explode out of 50,000 candles. We can multiply the probability by the total number of candles: 0.0005 * 50,000 = 25.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we first need to find the discount amount for one blouse and then multiply it by the number of blouses Misha picked out.

The regular price of each blouse is $20, and there's a 30% discount. To find the discount amount, we multiply the regular price by the discount percentage (as a decimal).

Discount amount = Regular price * (Discount percentage / 100)
Discount amount = $20 * (30 / 100)
Discount amount = $20 * 0.3
Discount amount = $6

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the regular price to get the discounted price of one blouse.

Discounted price = Regular price - Discount amount
Discounted price = $20 - $6
Discounted price = $14

Since Misha picked out 4 blouses, we multiply the discounted price by the number of blouses to get the total cost.

Total cost = Discounted price * Number of blouses
Total cost = $14 * 4
Total cost = $56

The final answer is: $56"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathered from the tallest trees as T, from the average trees as A, and from the shortest trees as S. 

We know that Joanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees, so T = 30. 

We also know that Joanne gathered half the amount from the shortest trees as from the tallest trees, so S = 30 / 2 = 15.

We are given that Joanne's sister gathered twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, so the sister gathered 2T apples from the tallest trees. We also know that the sister gathered 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so the sister gathered 3S apples from the shortest trees.

Since the sister didn't gather any apples from the average trees, her total is 2T + 3S.

The combined total of the sisters is 500 apples, so we can write the equation: T + A + S + 2T + 3S = 500.

Substituting the values we know, we get 30 + A + 15 + 2(30) + 3(15) = 500.

Combine like terms: 30 + A + 15 + 60 + 45 = 500.

Combine the constants: 150 + A = 500.

Subtract 150 from both sides: A = 350.

The final answer is: $\boxed{350}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D.

We know that the total number of heads is 180, and since each animal has one head, we can write the equation:

C + D = 180

We also know that the total number of bumps is 304, and since camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump, we can write the equation:

2C + D = 304

Now we have a system of two linear equations with two variables. We can solve this system using the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method.

First, we can multiply the first equation by 2 to get:

2C + 2D = 360

Now we can subtract the second equation from this new equation to eliminate C:

(2C + 2D) - (2C + D) = 360 - 304
D = 56

So, there are 56 dromedaries in the herd.

The final answer is: $\boxed{56}$"
"To find the total distance traveled by Tom, we need to break down the information given.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day. So, the total distance covered in the first 4 days is:
200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. 
30% of 800 km = 0.3 * 800 = 240 km
So, the total distance covered in the next two days is 240 km.

On the next day, he wasn't traveling at all, so the distance covered is 0 km.

During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total distance covered in the second week is:
300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Now, let's add up the distances covered in each period:
- First 4 days: 800 km
- Next two days: 240 km
- Next day: 0 km
- Second week: 2100 km

Total distance = 800 + 240 + 0 + 2100 = 3140 km

The final answer is: 3140"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the size of Timothy's locker in cubic inches. 

First, we know that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches and it's 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. To find Zack's locker size, we multiply Peter's locker size by 4.

Zack's locker size = 5 * 4 = 20 cubic inches

Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can find Timothy's locker size by multiplying Zack's locker size by 2.

Timothy's locker size = 20 * 2 = 40 cubic inches

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to subtract the distance it fell from Stanley's initial elevation. 

Stanley's initial elevation: 10,000 feet
Distance the comb fell: 4,000 feet

Elevation of Stanley's comb: 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet

Now, we need to find the difference between the elevation of Stanley's comb and Oliver's elevation.

Elevation of Stanley's comb: 6,000 feet
Oliver's elevation: 3,000 feet

Difference in elevation: 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet

Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb."
"To find out how much capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from the two banks and add it to his initial capital.

The first bank gave him $4000. The second bank gave him twice as much, which is 2 x $4000 = $8000.

So, the total amount of money he received from the banks is $4000 + $8000 = $12000.

Now, we add this amount to his initial capital of $5000. 

$12000 + $5000 = $17000.

The final answer is: $17000"
"To find the number of cats left on the rock, we need to follow the steps:

1. First, we know that 4 boats came and carried away 5 cats each. So, the total number of cats taken away is 4 * 5 = 20 cats.

2. Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. After 20 cats were taken away, the number of cats remaining is 50 - 20 = 30 cats.

3. Then, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find 3/5 of 30, we multiply 30 by 3/5, which is (30 * 3) / 5 = 90 / 5 = 18.

4. Since 18 cats ran after the mouse, the number of cats left on the rock is 30 - 18 = 12 cats.

The final answer is: 12"
"To calculate the total cost of the service for 2 years, we need to break it down into the different periods and their respective costs.

1. The first 6 months are $8 a month, so the cost for this period is:
   6 months * $8/month = $48

2. The next 8 months are at the normal rate of $12 a month, so the cost for this period is:
   8 months * $12/month = $96

3. After that, the price increased to $14 a month. Since 2 years is 24 months, and we've already accounted for 14 months, there are 10 months left at the new rate. The cost for this period is:
   10 months * $14/month = $140

Now, let's add up the costs for all the periods:
$48 + $96 + $140 = $284

The total cost for 2 years of the service is $284."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote the cost of the jogger jeans as x. Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, we can write an equation:

x = 28 - 6
x = 22

So, the jogger jeans cost $22.

The total savings is $6, and Cole saved 1/3 of this amount from the jogger jeans. Let's find the amount saved from the jogger jeans:

1/3 of the total savings = 1/3 * 6 = 2

The amount saved from the jogger jeans is $2.

Since the rest of the savings came from the tattered jeans, the amount saved from the tattered jeans is:

Total savings - savings from jogger jeans = 6 - 2 = 4

Now, let's find the original price of the tattered jeans. We know that Cole saved $4 from the tattered jeans, and the sale price is $28. Let's denote the original price as y:

y - 28 = 4
y = 32

So, the original price of the tattered jeans is $32.

Now, let's find the difference in the original prices of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans:

Original price of jogger jeans - original price of tattered jeans = 22 - 32 = -10

However, the question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. Since the jogger jeans are cheaper, the answer is negative, but we are looking for the absolute difference.

The absolute difference is the absolute value of the difference:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of birds that visit the bird feeders made by Lillian and the store-bought ones separately, and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of birds that visit the store-bought bird feeders. Since there are 3 store-bought bird feeders and each attracts 20 birds, the total number of birds visiting the store-bought bird feeders is 3 * 20 = 60.

Next, let's find the number of birds that visit the bird feeders made by Lillian. Since each of Lillian's bird feeders attracts 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, each of Lillian's bird feeders attracts 20 + 10 = 30 birds. Since there are 3 bird feeders made by Lillian, the total number of birds visiting Lillian's bird feeders is 3 * 30 = 90.

Now, let's add the total number of birds visiting the store-bought bird feeders and Lillian's bird feeders to find the total number of birds that Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day. 60 + 90 = 150.

"To find the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The bagel costs $4. 
The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. To find 25% of $4, we multiply $4 by 0.25: 
$4 * 0.25 = $1
Then, we add this amount to the cost of the bagel: 
$4 + $1 = $5
So, the soup costs $5.

The cake costs half the price of the bagel. To find half of $4, we divide $4 by 2: 
$4 / 2 = $2
So, the cake costs $2.

Now, we add the costs of the bagel, soup, and cake together: 
$4 + $5 + $2 = $11

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as 'x'. Since he keeps 1/3 of the cards, he sells 2/3 of them. The total amount of money he gets from selling the cards is $1.5 * (2/3)x.

We know that he gets to go to the amusement park with $50 in spending cash, which means the total amount of money he has after selling the cards is $100 (the cost of the ticket) + $50 (spending cash) = $150.

So, we can set up the equation:

1.5 * (2/3)x = 150

To solve for x, we can start by multiplying 1.5 and 2/3:

1.5 * (2/3) = 1

So, the equation becomes:

1x = 150

Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 1:

x = 150

The final answer is: 150"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many hotdogs the caterer prepared. Since he prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of guests who will have two hotdogs = 36 / 2 = 18
Number of hotdogs prepared for these guests = 18 * 2 = 36

However, since 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog, we need to calculate the total number of hotdogs needed for the additional 4 guests. 

Number of additional hotdogs needed = 40 - 36 = 4

Since each guest needs a second hotdog, the total number of hotdogs needed for the additional 4 guests is 4 * 2 = 8.

However, the caterer only prepared 36 hotdogs. Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is equal to the number of hotdogs available minus the number of hotdogs needed for the additional 4 guests.

Number of hotdogs available = 36
Number of hotdogs needed for additional 4 guests = 8
Number of hotdogs left for the original 36 guests = 36 - 8 = 28

Since each of the original 36 guests was supposed to have 2 hotdogs, the number of hotdogs they should have received is 36 * 2 = 72.

However, they only received 28 hotdogs. Therefore, the number of hotdogs they are missing is 72 - 28 = 44.

Since each guest was supposed to have 2 hotdogs, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is equal to the number of missing hotdogs divided by 2.

Number of guests who did not get a second hotdog = 44 / 2 = 22

3 + 4 = 7

Now, we need to find the total number of letters in both Indras and her sister's names. 
We add the number of letters in Indras' name to the number of letters in her sister's name.

"To calculate the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to first find the total cost of the items before the discount. 

The cost of the set of pot and pans is $120.00.
The cost of the set of mixing bowls is $20.00.
The cost of 5 separate utensils at $5.00 each is 5 x $5.00 = $25.00.

The total cost of the items before the discount is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

Since the items are 20% off, we need to calculate 20% of $165.00 to find the discount amount.
20% of $165.00 is 0.20 x $165.00 = $33.00.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final cost of the order.
$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons. 
Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, so he slew 3/4 * 100 = 75 dragons.

Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so he slew 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.

Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so he slew 1/5 * 150 = 30 dragons.

"To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we first need to determine how much gas was in each container. Since 15 gallons were divided equally into 5 containers, we can divide 15 by 5 to find the amount in each container.

15 gallons / 5 containers = 3 gallons per container

Since Josey needed 1/4 of a container, we can multiply the amount in each container by 1/4.

3 gallons/container * 1/4 = 3/4 gallon

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so we can multiply 3/4 by 8 to find the amount in pints.

(3/4) * 8 = 6 pints

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money George had initially. Since he had 1% of his money left after spending $5, we can set up an equation to represent this situation.

Let's say George had x dollars initially. Then, 1% of x is equal to $5. We can write this as:

0.01x = 5

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.01:

x = 5 / 0.01
x = 500

So, George had $500 initially.

Now, let's find out how much he spent on chips. We know that he bought 3 bags of chips for 40 cents each. The total cost of chips is:

3 * 0.40 = $1.20

Since he spent $5 in total, the amount he spent on candy bars is:

$5 - $1.20 = $3.80

Now, we know that each candy bar costs 75 cents. To find out how many candy bars he bought, we can divide the total amount spent on candy bars by the cost of each candy bar:

$3.80 / 0.75 = 5.07

Since we can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can buy 5 candy bars for $3.75 and still have $0.05 left, which is not enough to buy another candy bar. Therefore, George bought 5 candy bars.

"To find the remaining weight of the cake, we first need to find out how much the cake weighed after Rory and her mom each had a piece. 

Since there are 8 pieces in total and 2 of them were taken, we subtract 2 from 8 to find out how many pieces are left: 8 - 2 = 6.

Now, we need to find out how much each piece weighs. To do this, we divide the total weight of the cake (20 ounces) by the number of pieces (8): 20 / 8 = 2.5 ounces per piece.

Now that we know each piece weighs 2.5 ounces, we multiply the number of remaining pieces (6) by the weight of each piece (2.5 ounces) to find the total weight of the remaining cake: 6 * 2.5 = 15 ounces.

The remaining cake weighs 15 ounces."

"To find the cost per serving, we need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients and divide it by the number of servings.

First, let's calculate the total amount of onions Antoine needs. He wants to double the amount of onions, so he needs 2 x 2 = 4 pounds of onions.

The cost of onions is $2.00 per pound, so the total cost of onions is 4 x $2.00 = $8.00.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of beef stock. Antoine needs 2 boxes, and each box costs $2.00, so the total cost of beef stock is 2 x $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of ingredients is the sum of the cost of onions and beef stock, which is $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

Since the soup serves 6 people, the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. The drive from Wayne's hotel to the theater takes 4 minutes.
2. The drive from Bernadette's apartment to the theater takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, so it takes 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.
3. Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, so she needs to leave 5 minutes before Wayne arrives at the theater.
4. Since Wayne arrives at the theater in 4 minutes, Bernadette needs to leave 4 + 5 = 9 minutes before Wayne arrives.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 9 minutes earlier than Wayne to get to the theater first.

"To find the perimeter of Billie's room, we first need to find the width of the room. We know the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards. However, the length is given in yards, so we need to convert it to feet first.

Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, we can convert 3 yards to feet by multiplying 3 yards by 3 feet per yard:

3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

Now that we have the length in feet, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle (Area = length * width) to find the width:

Area = length * width
360 = 9 * width
width = 360 / 9
width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter of the room using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle (Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)):

Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98 feet

The final answer is: 98"
"To find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we need to calculate the total number of beads each sister has.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, Elizabeth has:
1 pack of red beads = 1 x 20 = 20 beads
2 packs of clear beads = 2 x 20 = 40 beads
Total beads Elizabeth has = 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, Margareth has:
3 packs of blue beads = 3 x 20 = 60 beads
4 packs of red beads = 4 x 20 = 80 beads
Total beads Margareth has = 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, let's find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth:
Margareth's beads - Elizabeth's beads = 140 - 60 = 80

Jon's total time = 40 minutes (swim) + 80 minutes (1 hour 20 minutes) + 50 minutes (run) = 170 minutes.

Since James finishes the swim 10% faster, we need to find 10% of Jon's swim time and subtract it from Jon's swim time. 
10% of 40 minutes = 0.1 * 40 = 4 minutes. 
So, James' swim time = 40 - 4 = 36 minutes.

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon, so James' bike time = 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

We know that Jon won by 10 minutes, so James' total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time. 
James' total time = 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

Now, we can find James' run time by subtracting his swim and bike times from his total time. 
James' run time = 180 - 36 - 85 = 59 minutes.

The final answer is: 59"
"To find the length of Movie A, we need to first find the length of Movie B, and then find one-fourth of that length.

Movie C is 1.25 hours, which is equal to 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes.

Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so Movie B is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes.

Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, so Movie A is 80 / 4 = 20 minutes.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total amount of hay the horse eats, we first need to find the distance traveled. Since the horse runs for 30 minutes at 32MPH, we need to convert the time to hours. 

30 minutes is 30/60 = 0.5 hours.

Now, we can find the distance traveled by multiplying the speed by the time: 
Distance = Speed * Time = 32MPH * 0.5 hours = 16 miles.

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, the total hay eaten is:
Hay eaten = 16 miles * 1/2 bail/mile = 8 bails.

Each bail costs $3, so the total cost of hay is:
Total cost = 8 bails * $3/bail = $24.

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of:
Total money = 6 * $5 = $30.

To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the total money:
Change = Total money - Total cost = $30 - $24 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To find out how many trays Rozanne can put out, we first need to determine the total number of eggs she has. 

Rozanne uses 4 dozen eggs from cases. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 4 dozen eggs would be 4 * 12 = 48 eggs.

She also uses 2 loose eggs from the cupboard. 

So, the total number of eggs is 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Each glass of eggnog needs 5 eggs, so the total number of glasses she can make is 50 / 5 = 10 glasses.

Each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog, so the total number of trays she can put out is 10 / 5 = 2 trays.

The final answer is: 2"

"To find the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total revenue from the sale of the sneakers and subtract the cost of the sneakers.

First, let's calculate the revenue from the flash sale on Monday:
17 sneakers were sold for $20 each, so the revenue from the flash sale is:
17 x $20 = $340

Next, let's calculate the revenue from the sale to the department store:
The salesman sold the remaining 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers to the department store for $25 each, so the revenue from the department store is:
31 x $25 = $775

The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from the flash sale and the department store:
$340 + $775 = $1115

Now, let's calculate the cost of the sneakers:
The salesman bought 48 sneakers for $576.

To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the total revenue:
Profit = Total Revenue - Cost
Profit = $1115 - $576
Profit = $539

"Let's break down the information given:

1. The super ticket costs $20 and includes a soda and popcorn for $1 extra.
2. The regular price of a soda is $3.
3. If you buy a regular ticket and a soda and popcorn, you save $2 compared to buying the super ticket.

Since the super ticket costs $20 and includes a soda and popcorn for $1 extra, the total cost of the super ticket without the soda and popcorn is $20 - $1 = $19.

If you buy a regular ticket for $12 and a soda and popcorn, you save $2 compared to the super ticket. So, the total cost of the regular ticket, soda, and popcorn is $19 - $2 = $17.

Since the regular ticket costs $12, the cost of the soda and popcorn together is $17 - $12 = $5.

We know the soda costs $3, so the cost of the popcorn is $5 - $3 = $2.

The regular price of popcorn is $2. 

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the cost of filling one balloon before the price increase. 

Let's denote the original cost of filling one balloon as x. Since the total cost of filling 20 balloons was $900, we can set up the equation:

20x = 900

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 20:

x = 900 / 20
x = 45

So, the original cost of filling one balloon was $45.

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20, making the new cost of filling one balloon $65.

Now, we need to find the total cost of filling 170 balloons at the new price. We can multiply the new cost per balloon by the number of balloons:

Total cost = 65 * 170
Total cost = 11050

The final answer is: $11050"
"To find the average speed of the car during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled at 60 mph for 2 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time = 60 mph x 2 hours = 120 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled at 30 mph for 1 hour:
Distance = Speed x Time = 30 mph x 1 hour = 30 miles

Now, let's find the total distance traveled:
Total Distance = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles

The total time taken for the trip is 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours.

To find the average speed, we divide the total distance by the total time:
Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time = 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph

"To find the total volume of potting soil needed, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed and then multiply it by the number of beds.

The volume of one raised bed is calculated as length x width x height:
Volume = 8 ft x 2 ft x 2 ft = 32 cubic feet

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of potting soil needed is:
Total Volume = 32 cubic feet/bed x 10 beds = 320 cubic feet

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags needed is:
Number of bags = Total Volume / Volume per bag = 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet/bag = 160 bags

The cost of the potting soil is:
Cost = Number of bags x Cost per bag = 160 bags x $12/bag = $1920

The final answer is: $1920"
"To find the total number of cards, we first need to determine the number of green cards. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:

Number of red cards = 15
60% of 15 = 0.6 * 15 = 9
Number of green cards = 15 + 9 = 24

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards:
Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
= 15 + 24
= 39

To find the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards:
Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards

After 10 minutes, 30 fairies flew away. To find the remaining number of fairies, we subtract 30 from 75: 75 - 30 = 45.

The final number of fairies remaining is 45."
"To find the total number of puppies, we need to add the number of puppies Jennifer's dog has to the number of puppies Brandon's dog has. 

Total puppies = 8 (Jennifer's dog) + 12 (Brandon's dog) = 20

Next, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots. 

Puppies with spots = 3 (Jennifer's dog) + 4 (Brandon's dog) = 7

Now, we can find the percentage of puppies with spots by dividing the number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

The final answer is: 35"
"To find the total weight of the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and add them together.

The total weight of sugar cubes is 2 boxes * 1 pound per box = 2 pounds.

The total weight of carrots is 4 bags * 12 pounds per bag = 48 pounds.

The total weight of hay is 42 bales * 75 pounds per bale = 3150 pounds.

The total weight of oats is 20 sacks * 65 pounds per sack = 1300 pounds.

The total weight of all the feed is 2 pounds + 48 pounds + 3150 pounds + 1300 pounds = 3400 pounds.

Since the farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, we need to divide the total weight of the feed by the truck's capacity to find the number of trips needed.

3400 pounds / 2250 pounds per trip = 1.51 trips.

Since we can't make a fraction of a trip, the farmer will need to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To find out how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate the total amount she earns from aluminum cans and plastic bottles separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the amount she earns from aluminum cans. She drinks 3 aluminum cans a week, and each can is worth 2 cents. So, the amount she earns from aluminum cans per week is:
3 cans/week * 2 cents/can = 6 cents/week

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total amount she earns from aluminum cans in a month is:
6 cents/week * 4 weeks = 24 cents

Next, let's calculate the amount she earns from plastic bottles. She drinks 5 plastic bottles a week, and each bottle is worth 3 cents. So, the amount she earns from plastic bottles per week is:
5 bottles/week * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents/week

The total amount she earns from plastic bottles in a month is:
15 cents/week * 4 weeks = 60 cents

"To find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples for both of them and then find the difference.

Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each and received a $1 discount. 
First, let's calculate the total cost of the apples for Becky: 
20 apples * 45 cents/apple = 900 cents
Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we can convert this to dollars: 
900 cents / 100 = $9
Becky received a $1 discount, so we subtract this from the total cost: 
$9 - $1 = $8

Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each and received a 10 percent discount. 
First, let's calculate the total cost of the apples for Kelly: 
20 apples * 50 cents/apple = 1000 cents
Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we can convert this to dollars: 
1000 cents / 100 = $10
Kelly received a 10 percent discount, so we need to calculate 10 percent of $10: 
10% of $10 = 0.1 * $10 = $1

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as 'x'. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, which is x/2. He also gets two extra cookies for cleaning his room. So, the total number of cookies he gets is x/2 + 2.

We are given that Matt wants to eat five cookies in total. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x/2 + 2 = 5

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. First, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

x/2 = 5 - 2
x/2 = 3

Next, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks to get a total of 5 cookies.

"To find the combined length of the remoras, we need to convert the length of each remora from inches to feet and then add them together. 

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 6 inches to feet by dividing by 12. 

6 inches / 12 = 0.5 feet

Since there are two remoras, we multiply the length of one remora by 2.

0.5 feet * 2 = 1 foot

Now, we need to find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents. To do this, we divide the combined length of the remoras by the length of the shark and multiply by 100.

To solve for 'x', we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4:

x = 20 * 4
x = 80

So, there are 80 students at that grade level."
"To find out how long Jason has to spend walking each day, we need to first calculate the total number of minutes he has available to walk in three weeks. 

There are 7 days in a week, so in three weeks, there are 3 * 7 = 21 days. 

Since Jason can walk 4 days a week, the total number of days he can walk in three weeks is 21 * 4 = 84 days.

Now, we need to find out how many minutes he needs to walk each day to break in the shoes in 84 days. 

The total number of minutes he needs to walk is 240 minutes. 

To find the number of minutes he needs to walk each day, we divide the total number of minutes by the total number of days: 240 / 84 = 2.857 (approximately).

"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we need to find the total number of kids allergic to at least one thing and subtract that from the total number of kids in the class.

First, let's use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the total number of kids allergic to at least one thing. 

Let's denote:
- D as the set of kids allergic to dairy
- P as the set of kids allergic to peanuts

We know:
- |D| = 9 (number of kids allergic to dairy)
- |P| = 6 (number of kids allergic to peanuts)
- |D ∩ P| = 3 (number of kids allergic to both)

Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we can find the total number of kids allergic to at least one thing:
|D ∪ P| = |D| + |P| - |D ∩ P|
|D ∪ P| = 9 + 6 - 3
|D ∪ P| = 12

Now, to find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids allergic to at least one thing from the total number of kids in the class:
|not allergic to anything| = Total number of kids - |D ∪ P|
|not allergic to anything| = 32 - 12
|not allergic to anything| = 20

"To find the total cost of the trip, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel.

The cost of the plane tickets is $5000 each, and since there are two people, the total cost of the plane tickets is 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

The hotel is 20% more expensive than normal, so we need to find 20% of the normal price and add it to the normal price. 20% of $1500 is 0.20 * $1500 = $300. The hotel price is $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day.

Since they are there for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is the cost of the plane tickets plus the cost of the hotel, which is $10,000 + $5400 = $16,400.

"To find out how many songs Luri can add to his player, we need to first determine how many songs he currently has. Since Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, and Gabriel has 20 songs, we can calculate Luri's songs as 3 * 20 = 60.

Now, we need to find out how many songs each can add to their player. Since each player can store up to 100 songs, Gabriel can add 100 - 20 = 80 songs, and Luri can add 100 - 60 = 40 songs.

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add than Gabriel, we subtract Luri's capacity from Gabriel's capacity: 80 - 40 = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the total amount of money Stetson gave up, we need to first find out how many oranges he ate. Since Stetson ate 2/5 of the oranges, and they picked 60 oranges, we can calculate the number of oranges he ate as follows:

Number of oranges eaten = (2/5) * 60
= (2 * 60) / 5
= 120 / 5
= 24

Since Stetson gave up $10 for each orange he ate, the total amount of money he gave up is:

Total amount = Number of oranges eaten * $10
= 24 * $10
= $240

The final answer is: $240"
"To find the cost of Jillian's handbag, we need to first calculate 3 times the cost of her shoes. 

Cost of shoes = $80
3 times the cost of shoes = 3 * $80 = $240

Since the handbag cost $20 less than 3 times the cost of her shoes, we subtract $20 from $240.

Cost of handbag = 3 times the cost of shoes - $20
= $240 - $20
= $220

The final answer is: $220"
"To find out how many hours James runs a week, we need to first calculate the total miles he runs in a week. 

James runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week, so the total miles he runs in a week is:
12 miles/day * 5 days/week = 60 miles/week

Since James runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour, we can find the total hours he runs in a week by dividing the total miles by his speed:
60 miles/week ÷ 10 miles/hour = 6 hours/week

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of oats his horses consume in a day. 

Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and he feeds them twice a day. So, each horse consumes 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of oats per day.

Since Uncle Ben has four horses, the total amount of oats consumed by all horses in a day is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of oats consumed by all horses for five days. This is 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats, so to find out how many bags Uncle Ben needs, we divide the total amount of oats consumed by the amount in each bag: 200 / 50 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the number of girl Pomeranians, we first need to find the total number of Pomeranians. Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can calculate this as follows:

Total puppies = 27
Pomeranians = (2/3) * 27
Pomeranians = (2 * 27) / 3
Pomeranians = 54 / 3
Pomeranians = 18

Now that we know there are 18 Pomeranians, we can find the number of girl Pomeranians. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we can calculate this as follows:

Girl Pomeranians = (1/3) * 18
Girl Pomeranians = (1 * 18) / 3
Girl Pomeranians = 18 / 3
Girl Pomeranians = 6

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the average highest temperature, we need to add up the highest temperatures of the three countries and divide by 3.

First, let's add up the temperatures:
-48 (Southlandia) + 21 (Northlandia) + (-3) (Midlandia) = -30

Now, let's divide the sum by 3:
-30 / 3 = -10

The average highest temperature of the three countries is -10 degrees Fahrenheit."
"To find out how many days it will take for the child to save the remaining amount, we need to first calculate the remaining amount he needs to save. 

The toy car costs $12, and he already has $4 savings. So, the remaining amount he needs to save is $12 - $4 = $8.

He promises to save $2 daily from his allowance. To find out how many days it will take to save $8, we can divide the remaining amount by the daily savings:

$8 ÷ $2 = 4

So, it will take the child 4 days to save the remaining amount of money.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many eggs Jaime won't be able to place on the tray, we need to first calculate how many eggs he can place on the 2 trays. 

Each tray can hold 24 eggs, and Jaime has 2 trays, so the total number of eggs he can place is 24 * 2 = 48.

Since Jaime has 64 eggs, we need to subtract the number of eggs he can place from the total number of eggs he has. 

64 - 48 = 16

So, Jaime won't be able to place 16 eggs on the tray."
"To find the total amount Sally spent, we need to calculate the cost of the family-size pizza first. Since it costs 3 times as much as the small pizza, we multiply the cost of the small pizza by 3.

Cost of small pizza: $8

Now, we add the cost of the small pizza and the family-size pizza to find the total amount spent.

Total amount spent: $8 + $24 = $32

The final answer is: $32"
"To find the final cost per razor, we need to calculate the total cost of 2 packs of razors after the discount and then divide by the total number of razors.

First, let's calculate the cost of 2 packs of razors with the buy one get one free promotion. Since it's buy one get one free, Heather will only pay for 1 pack of razors. The cost of 1 pack is $4.00.

Next, let's apply the $2.00 coupon to the cost of 1 pack of razors. The new cost is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since Heather buys 2 packs, but only pays for 1 pack after the promotion, she pays $2.00 for 4 razors.

Now, let's calculate the cost per razor. The total cost is $2.00, and there are 4 razors. 

Cost per razor = Total cost / Total number of razors
Cost per razor = $2.00 / 4
Cost per razor = $0.50

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100.
Cost per razor in cents = $0.50 * 100
Cost per razor in cents = 50 cents

"To find the total height of the human pyramid, we need to calculate the height of each level and add them up.

The 4 girls on the bottom are 64"" tall each, so their total height is 4 * 64 = 256"".

The 3 girls on top of the 4 are also 64"" tall each, so their total height is 3 * 64 = 192"".

The 2 girls on top of the 3 are 64"" tall each, so their total height is 2 * 64 = 128"".

The shortest girl at the top is 60"" tall.

Now, we add up the heights of all the levels: 256"" + 192"" + 128"" + 60"" = 536"".

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches): 536"" / 12 = 44.67 feet.

The final answer is: 44.67"
"To find the total number of minutes Charisma walked, we need to calculate the total number of minutes she walked in a day and then multiply it by the number of days she worked.

Charisma walks 5 minutes every hour, and she works 8 hours a day. So, the total number of minutes she walks in a day is 5 minutes/hour * 8 hours = 40 minutes/day.

Since she worked for 5 days, the total number of minutes she walked is 40 minutes/day * 5 days = 200 minutes.

The final answer is: 200"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine Brett's age in four years. Since Brett is currently 14 years old, in four years he will be 14 + 4 = 18 years old.

According to the problem, in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. Since Brett is 14 years old now, three times his current age is 3 * 14 = 42 years old.

Since Angela will be 42 years old in four years, we need to subtract 4 from 42 to find her current age. Angela's current age is 42 - 4 = 38 years old.

The final answer is: 38"
"To find the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car, we need to calculate the cost of the morning rides and the cost of the afternoon rides separately, and then add them together.

The cost of the morning rides is the cost per ride multiplied by the number of days: $6 * 14 = $84.

The cost of the afternoon rides is the cost per ride multiplied by the number of days: $2 * 14 = $28.

Now, we add the cost of the morning rides and the cost of the afternoon rides to find the total amount spent: $84 + $28 = $112.

The final answer is: $112"
"To find out how many pies they can make, we need to calculate the total number of oranges they have and then divide that by the number of oranges needed for one pie.

Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so she has 5 x 10 = 50 oranges.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so she has 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

In total, they have 50 + 70 = 120 oranges.

One Greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, so they can make 120 / 3 = 40 pies.

The final answer is: 40"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation representing the cost of each venue. Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'.

The cost of the first venue is a flat fee of $200, plus $5 per guest for food, so the total cost is 200 + 5x.

The cost of the second venue is $25 per guest, with no additional charge for food, so the total cost is 25x.

To find the number of guests where the two venues are equal in cost, we set the two equations equal to each other:

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtract 5x from both sides:

200 = 20x

Divide both sides by 20:

10 = x

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi as L, D, and B, respectively.

We are given two pieces of information:

1. Lily found 7 more than David: L = D + 7
2. David found half of what Bodhi found: D = B/2

We also know that the total number of insects collected is 43: L + D + B = 43

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the third equation to get: (D + 7) + D + B = 43

Combine like terms: 2D + 7 + B = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides: 2D + B = 36

Now, substitute the second equation into this new equation: 2(D) + B = 36
2(B/2) + B = 36
B + B = 36
2B = 36

Divide both sides by 2: B = 18

Now that we know B, we can find D: D = B/2 = 18/2 = 9

Finally, we can find L: L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total yards of yarn used, we need to add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma. 

First, let's find out how many yards Mariah used. She used 1/4 of a skein, and there are 364 yards in a skein. To find 1/4 of 364, we multiply 364 by 1/4. 

364 * 1/4 = 364 * 0.25 = 91 yards

Now, let's find out how many yards her grandma used. She used 1/2 of a skein, and there are 364 yards in a skein. To find 1/2 of 364, we multiply 364 by 1/2.

364 * 1/2 = 364 * 0.5 = 182 yards

Now, we add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma to find the total yards used.

91 + 182 = 273 yards

"To find the total number of gifts Cherrie bought, we need to calculate the number of gifts for her friends and add the 10 random gifts.

First, let's calculate the number of gifts for her friends. 2 friends want 5 gifts each, so that's 2 x 5 = 10 gifts. The other 3 friends want 2 gifts each, so that's 3 x 2 = 6 gifts. 

Now, let's add the number of gifts for her friends: 10 + 6 = 16 gifts.

Finally, we add the 10 random gifts: 16 + 10 = 26 gifts.

The total number of gifts Cherrie bought is 26."
"To find the length of the couch, we first need to find the width of the rug. Since the chair is 3 feet wide and the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, the rug's width is 3 + 5 = 8 feet.

The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Twice the width of the rug is 2 * 8 = 16 feet. Adding 2 feet to this gives us the length of the couch: 16 + 2 = 18 feet.

The final answer is: 18"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations. Let's denote the cost of a pack of strawberry gum as 's' and the cost of a pack of green apple gum as 'a'.

We know that Suzie bought 2 packs of strawberry gum, 1 pack of grape gum for $2, and 1 pack of green apple gum. The total cost was $7. We also know that the green apple gum cost half as much as the grape gum, so a = 2/2 = 1.

We can set up the following equation based on the total cost:

2s + 2 + a = 7

Substituting the value of a, we get:

2s + 2 + 1 = 7

Combine like terms:

2s + 3 = 7

Subtract 3 from both sides:

2s = 4

Divide both sides by 2:

s = 2

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2. 

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up a linear programming model. Let's define the variables:

- x1: number of 2 x 4 pieces of wood to buy
- x2: number of 2 x 8 pieces of wood to buy

The objective function is to maximize the total number of popsicle sticks, which is given by:

200x1 + 400x2

The constraints are:

1) Budget constraint: 4x1 + 6x2 ≤ 24 (since each 2 x 4 costs $4 and each 2 x 8 costs $6, and Frederick has $24 to spend)
2) Non-negativity constraint: x1 ≥ 0 and x2 ≥ 0 (since Frederick cannot buy a negative number of pieces of wood)

We can rewrite the budget constraint as:

4x1 + 6x2 = 24 (since we want to maximize the number of popsicle sticks, we want to spend the entire budget)

Now, we can solve for x2 in terms of x1:

6x2 = 24 - 4x1
x2 = (24 - 4x1) / 6

Substituting this expression for x2 into the objective function, we get:

200x1 + 400((24 - 4x1) / 6)

Simplifying the expression, we get:

200x1 + (8000 - 400x1) / 3
200x1 + 2666.67 - (400/3)x1
200x1 - (400/3)x1 + 2666.67
(600/3)x1 + 2666.67
200x1 + 2666.67

To maximize the number of popsicle sticks, we want to maximize x1. Since x1 must be an integer (Frederick can only buy whole pieces of wood), we can try different values of x1 to see which one gives the maximum number of popsicle sticks.

Let's try x1 = 3:

x2 = (24 - 4(3)) / 6 = 2
Number of popsicle sticks = 200(3) + 400(2) = 600 + 800 = 1400

Now, let's try x1 = 4:

x2 = (24 - 4(4)) / 6 = 0
Number of popsicle sticks = 200(4) + 400(0) = 800

Since x1 = 3 gives a higher number of popsicle sticks, we can conclude that Frederick should buy 3 pieces of 2 x 4 wood and 2 pieces of 2 x 8 wood.

The final answer is: 1400"
"To find the total cost of snowshoes for Mario's dogs, we need to calculate the total number of legs and then multiply it by the cost of each pair of snowshoes.

Each dog has 4 legs, and Mario has 6 dogs. So, the total number of legs is 6 * 4 = 24.

However, since each pair of snowshoes is for one dog, we need to divide the total number of legs by 4 to get the total number of pairs of snowshoes needed. 24 / 4 = 6 pairs of snowshoes.

Now, we multiply the number of pairs of snowshoes by the cost of each pair: 6 * $12.00 = $72.00.

The final answer is: $72.00"
"To find out how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips for a week and then subtract the cost of the weekly pass.

Janet takes 2 bus trips per day, 5 days a week. So, the total number of bus trips per week is 2 * 5 = 10.

Each bus trip costs $2.20, so the total cost of 10 bus trips is 10 * $2.20 = $22.

The weekly bus pass costs $20. To find out how much Janet would save, we subtract the cost of the pass from the total cost of the bus trips: $22 - $20 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of cows and sheep at both the farm and the zoo, and then add them together.

Given that the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, and the farm has 30 cows, the zoo must have 2 * 30 = 60 cows.

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does. Since the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm must have 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, we can find the total number of animals at the farm: 30 (cows) + 10 (sheep) = 40 animals.

The zoo has 60 cows and 20 sheep, so the total number of animals at the zoo is 60 + 20 = 80 animals.

To find the combined total, we add the number of animals at the farm and the zoo: 40 (farm) + 80 (zoo) = 120 animals.

The final answer is: 120"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many items Sophia bought. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of items Sophia bought, we can set up a ratio of the number of items Rose bought to the number of items Sophia bought as 4:1.

Let's denote the number of items Sophia bought as x. Then, the number of items Rose bought is 4x.

We know that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, so the total number of items Rose bought is 12 + 4 = 16.

Since the ratio of the number of items Rose bought to the number of items Sophia bought is 4:1, we can set up the equation:

4x = 16

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 4:

x = 16 / 4
x = 4

So, Sophia bought 4 items in total.

Since the ratio of onions to potatoes is not given, we can assume that Sophia bought the same ratio of onions to potatoes as Rose, which is 12:4 or 3:1. 

Therefore, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato.

The total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is 3 + 1 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To calculate the total number of days Andy has to lose the weight, we need to subtract the current date from his birthday. 

December 31st to July 19th is approximately 6 months and 19 days. 

There are 30 days in a month, so 6 months is 6 * 30 = 180 days. Adding the remaining 19 days, we get a total of 180 + 19 = 199 days.

Since Andy wants to lose 30 pounds, and it takes 3500 calories to lose a pound, he needs to burn a total of 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories.

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories needed by the number of days: 105,000 / 199 ≈ 527 calories.

The final answer is: 527"

"To find out how many milliliters of water Hannah needs to drink, we need to calculate the total distance she will run. 

First, we need to find out the total distance by multiplying the number of laps by the distance per lap. 

Distance per lap = 0.25 km
Number of laps = 8

Total distance = Distance per lap * Number of laps
Total distance = 0.25 km * 8
Total distance = 2 km

Since Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer, we can multiply the total distance by the amount of water needed per kilometer.

Total water needed = Total distance * Water per kilometer
Total water needed = 2 km * 60 ml/km
Total water needed = 120 ml

"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the cost of the house as H and the cost of the lot as L.

We are given two pieces of information:

1. The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000: H + L = 120,000
2. The house costs three times as much as the lot: H = 3L

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for L:

H + L = 120,000
3L + L = 120,000
4L = 120,000

Now, we can solve for L:

L = 120,000 / 4
L = 30,000

Now that we have the cost of the lot, we can find the cost of the house by substituting L into the second equation:

H = 3L
H = 3(30,000)
H = 90,000

The final answer is: $90,000"
"To find the profit, we first need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

The total cost is the cost of the canvas bags, which is 8 packs * 5 bags per pack * $4 per bag = 8 * 5 * 4 = $160.

The total revenue is the selling price of the bags, which is 8 bags * $8 per bag = 8 * 8 = $64.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $64 - $160 = -$96.

However, since profit cannot be negative, it seems there is an error in the problem. The selling price of $8 per bag is lower than the cost price of $4 per bag, which is not possible. 

Assuming the selling price is higher than the cost price, let's recalculate the profit with a higher selling price. 

If the selling price is $12 per bag, the total revenue would be 8 bags * $12 per bag = 8 * 12 = $96.

The profit would be the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $96 - $160 = -$64. 

However, this is still a negative profit. 

If the selling price is $16 per bag, the total revenue would be 8 bags * $16 per bag = 8 * 16 = $128.

The profit would be the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $128 - $160 = -$32.

However, this is still a negative profit.

If the selling price is $20 per bag, the total revenue would be 8 bags * $20 per bag = 8 * 20 = $160.

The profit would be the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $160 - $160 = $0.

If the selling price is $21 per bag, the total revenue would be 8 bags * $21 per bag = 8 * 21 = $168.

The profit would be the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $168 - $160 = $8.

"To find out how many math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday, we need to calculate the total number of problems he completed from Monday to Wednesday and subtract that from the total number of problems.

On Monday, Chris completed 12 problems.

On Tuesday, he completed 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, which is 3 * 12 = 36 problems.

So, the total number of problems completed from Monday to Tuesday is 12 + 36 = 48.

On Wednesday, he completed one-quarter of the remaining math problems. To find out how many problems were left after Tuesday, we subtract the problems completed from Monday to Tuesday from the total number of problems: 100 - 48 = 52.

One-quarter of 52 is 52 / 4 = 13.

So, the total number of problems completed from Monday to Wednesday is 48 + 13 = 61.

To find out how many math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday, we subtract the total number of problems completed from Monday to Wednesday from the total number of problems: 100 - 61 = 39.

"To find the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour, we need to calculate the individual rates of each person and then add them together.

Tony picks 6 quarts per hour.

Bobby picks one less quart than Tony, so Bobby picks 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.

Kathy picks twice as many quarts as Bobby, so Kathy picks 2 * 5 = 10 quarts per hour.

Ricky picks two fewer quarts than Kathy, so Ricky picks 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

Now, we add the individual rates together to find the total: 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29 quarts per hour.

The final answer is: 29"
"To find out how many loaves of bread the bakers had left, we need to subtract the number of loaves sold and the number of loaves returned from the total number of loaves baked.

First, let's calculate the total number of loaves sold: 
93 (morning) + 39 (afternoon) = 132 loaves sold

Now, let's subtract the number of loaves sold and the number of loaves returned from the total number of loaves baked:
200 (total loaves baked) - 132 (loaves sold) - 6 (loaves returned) = 62

The bakers had 62 loaves of bread left.

"To find the number of rows of flowers Jackson can plant, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of the number of tulips he can fit in a row for each color. 

The GCF of 6 and 8 is 2. 

Since Jackson has 36 red tulips, we divide 36 by 6 to find the number of rows of red tulips: 36 / 6 = 6 rows.

Since Jackson has 24 blue tulips, we divide 24 by 8 to find the number of rows of blue tulips: 24 / 8 = 3 rows.

However, we need to find the number of rows of flowers he can plant with the given tulips. Since the GCF of 6 and 8 is 2, we can plant 2 tulips in a row for both colors. 

The number of rows of red tulips is 36 / 2 = 18 rows.
The number of rows of blue tulips is 24 / 2 = 12 rows.

The total number of rows of flowers Jackson can plant is the sum of the rows of red and blue tulips: 18 + 12 = 30 rows.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to first determine how many cups of raisins she has available for the oatmeal cookies. 

Since she wants to divide the raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, we can divide the total number of cups of raisins by 3. 

Total cups of raisins = 27
Cups of raisins for oatmeal cookies = 27 / 3 = 9 cups

Now, we need to find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies she can make with 9 cups of raisins. Each batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins. 

To find the number of batches, we can divide the cups of raisins available for oatmeal cookies by the amount of raisins needed per batch.

Number of batches = 9 / (3/4) = 9 * (4/3) = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we first need to calculate her daily and weekly consumption before and after adding the new device.

Before adding the new device, Ada's daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. Since there are 24 hours in a day, her daily consumption is 12 * 24 = 288 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per day.

After adding the new device, her daily consumption will be 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour. So, her daily consumption will be 14 * 24 = 336 kWh per day.

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7. 

Before adding the new device, Ada's weekly consumption is 288 * 7 = 2016 kWh.
After adding the new device, her weekly consumption is 336 * 7 = 2352 kWh.

The cost of electricity is $1.50 per kWh. So, the weekly cost before adding the new device is 2016 * $1.50 = $3024.
The weekly cost after adding the new device is 2352 * $1.50 = $3540.

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is $3540 - $3024 = $516.

The final answer is: $516"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how long it would take one person to paint a whole house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take them twice as long to paint a whole house, which is 10 days.

Next, we need to find out how many hours it would take for one person to paint a whole house. There are 24 hours in a day, so 10 days would be 10 x 24 = 240 hours.

Now, we need to find out how long it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house. If one person can paint a whole house in 240 hours, then 5 people can paint a whole house in 240 / 5 = 48 hours.

The final answer is: 48"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of chairs Ophelia and Jenna have. 

Let's denote the number of chairs Ophelia has as 'x'. Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, Jenna has 3x chairs.

We are given that Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so the number of sofas Ophelia has is x - 2. We are also given that Ophelia has 20 sofas, so we can set up the equation x - 2 = 20.

Solving for x, we get x = 22. This means Ophelia has 22 chairs.

Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.

Now, we can find the number of sofas Jenna has. Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so Jenna has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

The total number of sofas is 20 (Ophelia's sofas) + 64 (Jenna's sofas) = 84.

The total number of chairs is 22 (Ophelia's chairs) + 66 (Jenna's chairs) = 88.

The total number of sofas and chairs is 84 + 88 = 172.

The final answer is: 172"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money Tom spent on the headphone set. We can do this by subtracting the cost of the CD from the total amount he paid.

Total amount paid = $48
Cost of CD = $4

Cost of headphone set = Total amount paid - Cost of CD
= $48 - $4
= $44

Now, we know that Tom spent $44 on the headphone set. If he had not bought the headphone set, he would have had $44 more to spend on CDs. 

Let's find out how many CDs he could have bought with this additional money.

Cost of one CD = $4
Number of CDs that could be bought with $44 = $44 / $4
= 11

So, Tom would have been able to buy 11 more CDs if he had decided not to buy the headphone set.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we need to calculate the total hours spent in the normal weeks, the hours spent in the two consecutive weeks, and the hours spent in the week with 6 hours.

Normal weeks: 4 hours/week * 6 weeks = 24 hours
Consecutive weeks: 5 hours/week * 2 weeks = 10 hours
Week with 6 hours: 6 hours

Total hours = Normal weeks + Consecutive weeks + Week with 6 hours
Total hours = 24 + 10 + 6
Total hours = 40

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off. So, the number of people left on the bus is:
48 - 8 = 40

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (which is 8) get into the bus. So, 5 * 8 = 40 people get in. Now, the total number of people on the bus is:
40 (remaining) + 40 (new passengers) = 80

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off. So, the number of people left on the bus is:
80 - 21 = 59

Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on. Since 3 times fewer means 3 times the number of people who got off minus the number of people who got off, we need to calculate 3 times 21 (the number of people who got off) first:
3 * 21 = 63

Now, subtract 21 (the number of people who got off) from this result to find the number of people who got on:
63 - 21 = 42

Now, add the number of people who got on to the number of people left on the bus:
59 (remaining) + 42 (new passengers) = 101

The final answer is: 101"

"To solve this problem, we can start by using the information that the computer cost $1,100 and the total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400. 

Let's denote the cost of the printer as P and the cost of one monitor as M. We know that the cost of the printer is $400 less than the computer, so we can write an equation:

P = 1100 - 400
P = 700

Now, we can write the equation for the total cost:

1100 + 2M + 700 = 2400

Combine like terms:

1800 + 2M = 2400

Subtract 1800 from both sides:

2M = 600

Divide both sides by 2:

M = 300

The cost of one monitor is $300.

The final answer is: $300"
"To find out how many seashells each girl brought, we first need to determine the total number of seashells brought by the boys. Since there are 10 boys (half of 20 kids), and each boy brought 60 shells, the total number of shells brought by the boys is 10 * 60 = 600.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 600 + 4 * 600 seashells.

First, we calculate 4 times the number of shells brought by the boys: 4 * 600 = 2400.

Then, we add the number of shells brought by the boys to this amount: 600 + 2400 = 3000.

Since there are 10 girls (half of 20 kids), we need to divide the total number of shells brought by the girls by 10 to find out how many seashells each girl brought: 3000 / 10 = 300.

Let's say George had x candies initially. After eating 5 candies, he has 3 left, so we can write the equation:

x - 5 = 3

To solve for x, we add 5 to both sides of the equation:

x = 3 + 5
x = 8

So George had 8 candies initially. Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, we can multiply the number of candies George had by 2 to find out how many candies Nick had:

Nick's candies = 2 * 8
Nick's candies = 16

The final answer is: 16"
"To find Anne's age, we first need to find Alyana's age. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, we can calculate Alyana's age by subtracting 4 from Chenny's age.

Alyana's age = Chenny's age - 4
Alyana's age = 10 - 4
Alyana's age = 6

Now that we know Alyana's age, we can find Anne's age by adding 2 to Alyana's age.

Anne's age = Alyana's age + 2
Anne's age = 6 + 2
Anne's age = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book and then add them together.

The first book is 31 mm thick.

The second book is 50 mm thick.

The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick.

The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 x 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add the thickness of all four books together: 
31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188

The final answer is: 188"
"To find out how many vlogs Emma needs to make to complete 72 vlogs per month, we need to subtract the total number of vlogs she has already made from the target number of vlogs.

Emma made 18 vlogs in the first week, 21 vlogs in the second week, and 15 vlogs in the third week. 

Total vlogs made = 18 + 21 + 15 = 54

Now, we subtract the total vlogs made from the target number of vlogs (72) to find out how many more vlogs Emma needs to make.

Vlogs needed = 72 - 54 = 18

So, Emma should make 18 more vlogs to complete 72 vlogs per month.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the total amount you paid, we need to calculate the 20% tip and add it to the original bill.

First, let's calculate the 20% tip:
20% of $50 = 0.20 * $50 = $10

Now, let's add the tip to the original bill:
$50 (original bill) + $10 (tip) = $60

So, you ended up paying $60."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how much money the eldest boy initially received. Since $18 is shared among 3 boys, we divide $18 by 3 to find his initial share:
   $18 / 3 = $6

2. The eldest boy added $5 to his share, so we add $5 to $6:
   $6 + $5 = $11

3. The following day, he added another $10 to his share, so we add $10 to $11:
   $11 + $10 = $21

4. He then spent $8 from his total, so we subtract $8 from $21:
   $21 - $8 = $13

5. After saving some more, he tripled the amount he had left after spending $8. To triple $13, we multiply $13 by 3:
   $13 * 3 = $39

So, the eldest boy now has $39."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much Elvis needs to save in total for the first half of the month. Since there are 30 days in April, the first half of the month will have 15 days.

Let's assume Elvis saves x dollars per day in the first half of the month. Then, in the second half, he will save 2x dollars per day.

The total amount saved in the first half of the month is 15x, and the total amount saved in the second half of the month is 15(2x) = 30x.

The total amount saved in the month is the sum of the amounts saved in the first and second halves, which is 15x + 30x = 45x.

We are given that the total monthly savings target is $1125. So, we can set up the equation:

45x = 1125

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 45:

x = 1125 / 45
x = 25

This is the amount Elvis needs to save per day in the first half of the month. Since he needs to save twice as much in the second half, the amount he needs to save per day in the second half is 2x = 2(25) = 50.

The final answer is: $50"
"To find the total cost of the fruits, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and add them together.

The cost of 3 apples at $1.50 each is 3 x $1.50 = $4.50.
The cost of 5 oranges at $0.80 each is 5 x $0.80 = $4.00.
The cost of 6 peaches at $0.75 each is 6 x $0.75 = $4.50.

Now, let's add the costs together: $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00.

Since Verna gave $20, the change she received is $20 - $13.00 = $7.00.

The final answer is: $7.00"
"To find out how much more Jairus will get than Jenny, we need to calculate the total amount each of them will get and then subtract Jenny's total from Jairus's total.

Jairus gets $0.8 for each task, and he finished 20 tasks. So, Jairus's total is 0.8 * 20 = $16.

Jenny gets $0.5 for each task, and she also finished 20 tasks. So, Jenny's total is 0.5 * 20 = $10.

Now, we subtract Jenny's total from Jairus's total to find out how much more Jairus will get: 16 - 10 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple linear equation. Let's say Brad gets x dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x dollars.

We know that the total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can set up the equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms:

5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 20

Since x represents the amount Brad gets, and Jeff gets 4 times as much, Jeff gets 4x = 4(20) = 80 dollars.

The final answer is: $80"
"To find the total miles Jeff walks in a week, we need to calculate the total miles he walks each day and then multiply it by the number of days he works in a week.

Since Jeff walks 3 miles to work and 3 miles back, the total miles he walks each day is 3 + 3 = 6 miles.

Now, we multiply the total miles he walks each day by the number of days he works in a week: 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. Elise writes the alphabet in full twice, which means she writes 26 letters each time. So, she writes 26 x 2 = 52 letters.

2. Then, she writes half of the alphabet once. Half of the alphabet is 26 / 2 = 13 letters.

3. So, she writes 13 letters.

4. Now, she re-writes everything she has already written. This means she re-writes 52 + 13 = 65 letters.

5. To find the total number of letters Elise has written, we add the initial 52 letters, the 13 letters she wrote half of the alphabet, and the 65 letters she re-wrote. 

Total letters = 52 + 13 + 65 = 130

The final answer is: 130"
"This problem can be modeled as a geometric sequence, where the first term (a) is 3 (the initial number of families Ali calls), and the common ratio (r) is also 3 (since each family calls 3 other families). 

The formula to find the nth term of a geometric sequence is given by: an = a * r^(n-1)

To find the number of families notified during the fourth round of calls, we need to find the 4th term of the sequence. 

a4 = 3 * 3^(4-1)
a4 = 3 * 3^3
a4 = 3 * 27
a4 = 81

However, this is the number of new families notified during the fourth round. To find the total number of families notified, we need to add the initial 3 families that Ali called, and the 3 families that were notified in the previous rounds. 

The number of families notified in the first round is 3. 
The number of families notified in the second round is 3 * 3 = 9. 
The number of families notified in the third round is 3 * 3^2 = 27. 
The number of families notified in the fourth round is 3 * 3^3 = 81.

The total number of families notified is the sum of these: 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 120.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find Mark's initial weight, we need to calculate the total weight he lost during the 3 months. Since he lost 10 pounds per month, the total weight lost is:

10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds

Since Mark's final weight was 70 pounds, we can add the total weight lost to his final weight to find his initial weight:

Initial weight = Final weight + Total weight lost
Initial weight = 70 pounds + 30 pounds
Initial weight = 100 pounds

The final answer is: 100"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many toys Jonathan needs to have a play set five times larger than James's. Since James's play set has 80 toys, a play set five times larger would have 5 * 80 = 400 toys.

Since Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have enough toys to make a play set five times larger than James's, we can set up an equation to represent this situation. Let x be the number of toys Jonathan currently has. The equation would be x + 2 = 400.

To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation: x = 400 - 2.

x = 398

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then apply the discount.

Cost of 5 notebooks: 5 x $1.50 = $7.50
Cost of 2 pens: 2 x $0.25 = $0.50
Cost of 1 calculator: 1 x $12 = $12
Cost of 1 geometry set: 1 x $10 = $10

Total cost before discount: $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30

The shop gives a 10% discount on all the purchased items. To find the discount amount, we multiply the total cost by 0.10:
Discount = $30 x 0.10 = $3

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Daniel has to spend:
Final amount = Total cost - Discount = $30 - $3 = $27

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. 

Let's denote the time it takes to swim a mile in cold water as C = 16 minutes. The time it takes to swim a mile in warm water is 2 minutes more than twice as long as C, so it is 2 * C + 2 = 2 * 16 + 2 = 34 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in cold and warm water. 

In cold water, it takes Ray 3 * C = 3 * 16 = 48 minutes to swim 3 miles. 

In warm water, it takes Ray 3 * (2 * C + 2) = 3 * (2 * 16 + 2) = 3 * 34 = 102 minutes to swim 3 miles.

"To find the average weight of the 3 friends, we need to first find their individual weights.

Mark's weight is given as 150 pounds.

Susan's weight is 20 pounds less than Mark's, so Susan's weight = Mark's weight - 20 = 150 - 20 = 130 pounds.

Bob's weight is twice as much as Susan's, so Bob's weight = 2 * Susan's weight = 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, we have the weights of all three friends: Mark (150 pounds), Susan (130 pounds), and Bob (260 pounds).

To find the average weight, we add their weights and divide by 3: (150 + 130 + 260) / 3 = 540 / 3 = 180.

"To find out how many packs of candles James needs to buy, we first need to determine the total number of candles required. Since one son is 12 years old and the other is 4 years younger, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Typically, birthday candles are needed for the number of years the person is old, so James will need 12 candles for the older son and 8 candles for the younger son. 

Total candles needed = 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we need to find out how many packs James needs to buy. 

Number of packs = Total candles / Candles per pack = 20 / 5 = 4 packs.

"To find out how many sandwiches are left, we need to calculate how many Cody and Trevor ate, and then subtract that from the total number of sandwiches.

Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, which is 1/3 of 12. To find 1/3 of 12, we multiply 12 by 1/3, which is the same as dividing 12 by 3. 

12 / 3 = 4

So, Cody ate 4 sandwiches.

Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches, which is 1/4 of 12. To find 1/4 of 12, we multiply 12 by 1/4, which is the same as dividing 12 by 4.

12 / 4 = 3

So, Trevor ate 3 sandwiches.

Now, we add the number of sandwiches Cody and Trevor ate to find the total number of sandwiches eaten.

4 (Cody) + 3 (Trevor) = 7

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of goals scored by Mark as M, the number of goals scored by Anna as A, and the number of goals scored by Richie as R.

We know that Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, so we can write the equation:

R = M + 20

We also know that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, so we can write the equation:

R = A + 45

We are also given that Richie scored 80 goals, so we can substitute this value into the first equation:

80 = M + 20

Now, we can solve for M:

M = 80 - 20
M = 60

Now that we know Mark scored 60 goals, we can substitute this value into the second equation:

80 = A + 45

Now, we can solve for A:

A = 80 - 45
A = 35

Now that we know Anna scored 35 goals, Mark scored 60 goals, and Richie scored 80 goals, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers:

Total goals = R + M + A
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35

"To find out how many action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate how much he spent on wooden action figures and how much he has left to spend on plastic action figures.

First, let's calculate how much Peter spent on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday. He spent $5 each day for 4 days (Sunday to Wednesday). 

4 days * $5 per day = $20

Since Peter started with $70, we subtract the amount he spent on wooden action figures from his initial amount to find out how much he has left.

$70 - $20 = $50

Now, let's calculate how many plastic action figures he can buy with the remaining money. He has $50 left and each plastic action figure costs $2.

$50 / $2 = 25

Since he can buy 25 plastic action figures, and he spent 4 days on wooden action figures, the total number of action figures he will have by the end of the week is the sum of the wooden action figures (4) and the plastic action figures (25).

4 (wooden action figures) + 25 (plastic action figures) = 29

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered per month is 65 * 4 = 260 roses.

Ford grows 40 roses every week, so the total number of roses he grows per month is 40 * 4 = 160 roses.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the total number of roses he grows per month from the total number of roses ordered per month: 260 - 160 = 100 roses.

"To calculate the net profit, we need to calculate the cost of goods sold and the total revenue. 

The cost of bread per sandwich is $3.00 / 10 sandwiches = $0.30 per sandwich. 
The cost of cheese and condiments per sandwich is $30.00 / 10 sandwiches = $3.00 per sandwich. 
The total cost per sandwich is $0.30 + $3.00 = $3.30 per sandwich.

The total revenue per 10 sandwiches is $7.00 x 10 = $70.00. 
The total cost per 10 sandwiches is $3.30 x 10 = $33.00.

The net profit per 10 sandwiches is $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00.

"To find out how much money Kate can make, we need to determine the total number of muffin crayons she can make and then multiply that by the price of each muffin crayon.

First, let's find the total number of crayon pieces: 
3 boxes * 64 crayons per box = 192 crayon pieces

Since Kate melts 8 crayon pieces together to make one muffin crayon, we need to divide the total number of crayon pieces by 8:
192 crayon pieces / 8 crayon pieces per muffin = 24 muffin crayons

Now, we multiply the number of muffin crayons by the price of each muffin crayon:
24 muffin crayons * $1.50 per muffin crayon = $36

The final answer is: $36"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to find the area of the bedroom and then calculate the cost of the new carpet, padding, and installation.

The area of the bedroom is length x width = 18 ft x 12 ft = 216 square feet.

The cost of the new carpet is $12 per square foot, so the total cost of the carpet is 216 square feet x $12/square foot = $2592.

The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot, so the total cost of the padding is 216 square feet x $2/square foot = $432.

The cost of removing the old carpet is $4 per square foot, so the total cost of removal is 216 square feet x $4/square foot = $864.

The cost of installing the new carpet is $34 per square foot, so the total cost of installation is 216 square feet x $34/square foot = $7344.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the carpet, padding, removal, and installation: $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344 = $11332.

The final answer is: $11332"
"To find the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we need to add up the total number of birds he saw over the week and divide it by the number of days.

First, let's add up the total number of birds Mack saw:

Day 1 and 2: 50 birds
Day 3: 0 birds
Day 4 and 5: 120 birds
Day 6: 20 birds
Day 7: 90 birds

Total number of birds = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds

There are 7 days in a week. To find the average, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days:

Average number of birds per day = Total number of birds / Number of days
= 280 / 7
= 40

The final answer is: 40"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Let's denote the starting value as x = 20.
2. Half the number is x/2 = 20/2 = 10.
3. The starting value plus half the number is x + (x/2) = 20 + 10 = 30.
4. The resulting value is divided by 5: (x + (x/2))/5 = 30/5 = 6.
5. The resulting value is multiplied by the starting value minus 12: 6 * (x - 12) = 6 * (20 - 12) = 6 * 8 = 48.

The final value of the number train is 48."
"To find out how many cards the brother has, we need to subtract 3 from the number of cards the boy has. 

The boy has 5 cards. 
Brother has 5 - 3 = 2 cards.

Now, to find the total number of cards they have together, we add the number of cards the boy has to the number of cards his brother has.

Total cards = 5 (boy's cards) + 2 (brother's cards) = 7

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the percentage by which the oven is off, we need to calculate the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature, and then divide it by the set temperature.

Difference = Actual temperature - Set temperature
= 468 - 450
= 18

Percentage off = (Difference / Set temperature) * 100
= (18 / 450) * 100
= 4%

Now, to find the temperature Maggie should set the oven to, we need to calculate the actual temperature for the recipe (520 degrees) and then subtract the percentage off from it.

Actual temperature for 520 degrees = 520 + (520 * 0.04)
= 520 + 20.8
= 540.8

However, since we are looking for the temperature Maggie should set the oven to, we need to subtract the percentage off from the actual temperature for 520 degrees.

Temperature to set = Actual temperature for 520 degrees - (Actual temperature for 520 degrees * 0.04)
= 540.8 - 21.532
= 519.268

Rounded to a reasonable number of decimal places, the temperature Maggie should set the oven to is approximately 519.27 degrees.

The final answer is: 519.27"
"To find the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to convert both movie lengths into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the hour to minutes by multiplying 1 by 60, which equals 60 minutes. Adding the 30 minutes, the first movie is 60 + 30 = 90 minutes long.

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting the 2 hours to minutes by multiplying 2 by 60, we get 120 minutes. Adding the 5 minutes, the second movie is 120 + 5 = 125 minutes long.

Now, we add the lengths of the two movies together: 90 minutes (first movie) + 125 minutes (second movie) = 215 minutes.

The final answer is: 215"
"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house price and subtract it from Herb's house price.

Herb's house price = $76,000
30% of Herb's house price = 0.30 * $76,000 = $22,800
Juan's house price = Herb's house price - 30% of Herb's house price
= $76,000 - $22,800
= $53,200

Now, we need to find the combined value of the two houses.
Combined value = Herb's house price + Juan's house price
= $76,000 + $53,200
= $129,200

The final answer is: $129,200"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many cups and dishes Judy brought. Let's denote the number of cups Judy brought as C and the number of dishes as D. We know that Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. We also know that she bought twice as many dishes as cups, so D = 2C.

Since Judy bought 12 cups, we can substitute C = 12 into the equation D = 2C to find the number of dishes she brought: D = 2(12) = 24.

Now, we know that Judy's friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy. So, the number of dishes Judy's friend brought is 24 + 20 = 44.

To find the total number of utensils brought by the two, we need to add the number of cups and dishes brought by Judy and her friend. Judy brought 12 cups and 24 dishes, so the total number of utensils she brought is 12 + 24 = 36. Her friend brought 40 cups and 44 dishes, so the total number of utensils her friend brought is 40 + 44 = 84.

The total number of utensils brought by the two is 36 + 84 = 120.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the cost per pair of contacts, we first need to find the total cost of the boxes and then divide that by the total number of contacts.

Since each box lasts 45 days and Pete buys 2 boxes, the total number of days the contacts will last is 2 * 45 = 90 days.

Since 90 single-use contacts will last 90 days, the number of contacts Pete will use per day is 90 / 90 = 1 contact per day.

Since Pete will use 1 contact per day, the total number of contacts he will use in 90 days is 90.

Each box contains 90 contacts, so 2 boxes will contain 2 * 90 = 180 contacts.

The cost of each box is $100.00, and there is a 10% discount. The discount amount is 10% of $100.00, which is 0.1 * $100.00 = $10.00.

The discounted price of each box is $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00.

The total cost of 2 boxes is 2 * $90.00 = $180.00.

The cost per contact is $180.00 / 180 contacts = $1.00 per contact.

The final answer is: $1.00"
"To find out how much each person earned, we need to calculate the total hours worked by each of them and then multiply it by the hourly wage.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so her total hours worked is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 hours. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, which is 3 * 1 = 3 hours. So, John's total hours worked is 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

The hourly wage is $10. 

Jill's total earnings are 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.
John's total earnings are 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find out how many milliliters of water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total calories she burns during her activities.

She spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories/hour. So, the total calories burned during aerobics is 2 * 500 = 1000 calories.

She also spends 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories/hour. So, the total calories burned during running is 1 * 600 = 600 calories.

The total calories burned is the sum of calories burned during aerobics and running, which is 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns, we need to divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many 200-calorie units she burned.

1600 / 200 = 8

Since she needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we multiply the number of 200-calorie units by 100 to find the total milliliters of water she needs to drink.

8 * 100 = 800

The final answer is: 800"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G.

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write the equation:

B + R + G = 4500

We also know that there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans, so we can write the equation:

R = B - 0.01B
R = 0.99B

We also know that there are 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans, so we can write the equation:

G = B + 0.01B
G = 1.01B

Now we can substitute the expressions for R and G into the first equation:

0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

3.01B = 4500

Divide both sides by 3.01:

B = 1495.015

Since we can't have a fraction of a jelly bean, we'll round B to the nearest whole number. However, for the sake of this problem, we will keep the decimal value for B.

Now that we have the value of B, we can find the values of R and G:

R = 0.99B
R = 0.99 * 1495.015
R = 1479.01485

G = 1.01B
G = 1.01 * 1495.015
G = 1514.015

Now we can find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and the number of red jelly beans:

G - R = 1514.015 - 1479.01485
G - R = 34.99915

Rounding to the nearest whole number, we get:

G - R = 35

"To find the average of the three measurements, we need to first find the third measurement. 

Jared's initial typing speed is 47 WPM. 
After the first increase, his speed is 52 WPM. 
He increases his speed by 5 WPM again, so the third measurement will be 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

Now, we have the three measurements: 47, 52, and 57. 

To find the average, we add the measurements and divide by 3: 
(47 + 52 + 57) / 3 = 156 / 3 = 52.

The final answer is: 52"
"To find the difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks, we need to calculate the weight change for each option and then find the difference.

If Martin eats Cheerios every day for breakfast, he'll lose 1.25 pounds/week. After 5 weeks, he'll lose 1.25 * 5 = 6.25 pounds.

If Martin eats donuts every day for breakfast, he'll gain 1.75 pounds/week. After 5 weeks, he'll gain 1.75 * 5 = 8.75 pounds.

The difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options is 8.75 - 6.25 = 2.5 pounds.

"To find the total number of people attending, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts.

First, Alex invites 100 people via email. Each of these people will bring 2 friends, so we multiply 100 by 2 to get the number of friends invited by email: 100 * 2 = 200.

Next, Alex calls 10 friends and 8 of them will be bringing their spouses. This means 8 people will be attending from Alex's friends, and 8 spouses will also be attending. So, we add 8 (friends) + 8 (spouses) = 16 people from Alex's friends.

Now, we add the people invited via email (200) and the people from Alex's friends (16) to get the total number of people attending: 200 + 16 = 216.

However, we also need to include Alex herself, so we add 1 to the total: 216 + 1 = 217.

Therefore, Alex will need 217 seats.

"To find the weight of the Mastiff, we need to start from the Papillon's weight and multiply it by 44, as the Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon.

First, we need to find the weight of the Papillon. The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund's weight is 2 * 10 = 20 pounds. The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon's weight is 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.

Now, we can find the weight of the Mastiff by multiplying the Papillon's weight by 44: 5 * 44 = 220 pounds.

The final answer is: 220"
"To find the total cost of the boots on eBay, we need to add the cost of the boots and the shipping cost. 

The cost of the boots on eBay is $13. 
The shipping cost on eBay is twice as much as on Amazon, which is $4 * 2 = $8.

So, the total cost of the boots on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

Now, let's find the total cost of the boots on Amazon: $16 (boots) + $4 (shipping) = $20.

To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we subtract the cost on Amazon from the cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of days it takes for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, which is 20 feet off the ground. The beanstalk starts out 4 feet tall and doubles in height every day.

Let's use the formula for exponential growth: A = P(2^n), where A is the final height, P is the initial height, and n is the number of days.

We want to find the number of days (n) when the beanstalk is taller than 20 feet. So, we set up the equation:

20 < 4(2^n)

To solve for n, we can divide both sides by 4:

5 < 2^n

Now, we can take the logarithm base 2 of both sides to solve for n:

log2(5) < n

Since log2(5) is approximately 2.3219, we can round up to the nearest whole number, as we can't have a fraction of a day. Therefore, it will take at least 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to first find out how many grams of protein he gets per day. 

Since a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein, we can find the protein percentage in a cup of mushrooms by dividing the protein by the weight: 3 grams / 100 grams = 0.03 or 3%.

Now, we know that John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day. To find out how many grams of protein he gets per day, we multiply the weight of mushrooms he eats by the protein percentage: 200 grams * 0.03 = 6 grams of protein per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7 to find the weekly protein intake: 6 grams/day * 7 days/week = 42 grams of protein per week.

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let Jerry's current age be x.

Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can write an equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting 2x from both sides, we get:

-x = -10

Dividing both sides by -1, we get:

x = 10

So, Jerry's current age is 10 years.

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

x + 3 = 10 + 3
x + 3 = 13

"To find out how many hours George needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the dental work. 

The base price for 2 implants is 2 * $2000 = $4000. 
For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain, which costs an extra $500. So, the total cost for the implants with the crown is $4000 + $500 = $4500. 
George has already put down a deposit of $600, so he still needs to pay $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since George makes $15 per hour at work, we can find out how many hours he needs to work by dividing the remaining cost by his hourly wage: $3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

The final answer is: 260"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebra to represent the angles and then solve for the unknowns.

Let's denote the smallest angle as x. Then, the other two angles are 2x and 3x, since one angle is twice the smallest angle and the other is three times the smallest angle.

We know that the sum of the three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, so we can write the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:

Smallest angle: 30 degrees
Middle angle: 2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees
Largest angle: 3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has in cents. 

First, let's convert the quarters to cents: 8 quarters * 25 cents/quarter = 200 cents
Next, let's convert the dimes to cents: 6 dimes * 10 cents/dime = 60 cents
Then, let's convert the nickels to cents: 14 nickels * 5 cents/nickel = 70 cents
Lastly, let's convert the pennies to cents: 15 pennies * 1 cent/penny = 15 cents

Now, let's add up the total amount of money Colby has: 200 cents + 60 cents + 70 cents + 15 cents = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs a nickel (5 cents), we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball: 345 cents / 5 cents = 69

Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

Given that the plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, we can calculate the rate as follows:
rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours = 400 miles per hour.

Now, to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate, we can use the formula: time = distance / rate.

time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour = 5 hours.

Therefore, it would take the plane an additional 5 hours to travel 2000 miles at the same rate.

"To find the total amount of chocolates made by Ruiz in 12 hours, we first need to find out how much he makes in one hour. 

Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. To find out how much he makes in one hour, we divide 120 by 2. 

120 / 2 = 60 pounds per hour for Ruiz.

Now, we need to find out how much Marissa makes in one hour. It is given that Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in 2 hours. 

Since Ruiz makes 60 pounds in one hour, Marissa makes 3/4 * 120 pounds in one hour. 

3/4 * 120 = 90 pounds per hour for Marissa.

Now, we need to find the total amount of chocolates made by both Ruiz and Marissa in 12 hours. 

Ruiz makes 60 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, he makes 60 * 12 = 720 pounds.

Marissa makes 90 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, she makes 90 * 12 = 1080 pounds.

"To find out how much money Joe will have left after the purchase, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then subtract that from the initial amount of money he has.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount. The shirt costs $25 and the shorts cost $35, so the total cost is $25 + $35 = $60.

Since there's a 30% off sale, we need to calculate the discount amount. To do this, we multiply the total cost by the discount percentage (30% or 0.3). The discount amount is $60 * 0.3 = $18.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final cost: $60 - $18 = $42.

Since sales tax is included, we don't need to add any additional tax to the final cost.

Finally, we subtract the final cost from the initial amount of money Joe has: $50 - $42 = $8.

1/4 * 4 = 1

So, 1/4 pound of butter is needed for 1 dozen croissants, and 1 pound of butter is needed for 4 dozen croissants.

Since Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week, we need to calculate the total number of croissants he will make in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply 4 dozen by 7.

4 dozen * 7 = 28 dozen

Now, we need to find the total amount of butter needed for 28 dozen croissants. Since 1 pound of butter is needed for 4 dozen croissants, we multiply 1 pound by 7 to get the amount needed for 28 dozen croissants.

1 pound * 7 = 7 pounds

However, we need to find the amount of butter needed for 28 dozen croissants, and we know that 1 pound of butter is needed for 4 dozen croissants. So, we need to multiply 1 pound by 7 to get the amount needed for 28 dozen croissants.

1 pound * 7 = 7 pounds

But we also know that 1/4 pound of butter is needed for 1 dozen croissants. So, we can multiply 1/4 by 28 to get the amount needed for 28 dozen croissants.

1/4 * 28 = 7

Therefore, the total amount of butter needed for 28 dozen croissants is 7 pounds.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the cost of repaving Lewis' street, we need to multiply the cost per meter by the length of the street. 

Cost per meter: $194
Length of Lewis' street: 490 meters

Cost to repave Lewis' street: 194 * 490 = $95,060

Now, to find the difference in cost between repaving Lewis' street and Monica's street, we need to calculate the cost of repaving Monica's street and subtract it from the cost of repaving Lewis' street.

Cost to repave Monica's street: 194 * 150 = $29,100

Difference in cost: $95,060 - $29,100 = $65,960

The final answer is: $65,960"
"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial funding for the first 5 months and the additional funding for the remaining 45 months.

Initial funding for the first 5 months: 
The initial funding is $100,000 per month for 5 months. 
Total initial funding = $100,000 * 5 = $500,000

Additional funding for the remaining 45 months:
The funding for the remaining months is 50% more than the initial funding, which is $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000 per month.
Total additional funding for the remaining months = $150,000 * 45 = $6,750,000

Total cost of the research = Total initial funding + Total additional funding
Total cost of the research = $500,000 + $6,750,000
Total cost of the research = $7,250,000

The final answer is: $7,250,000"
"To find the total amount of meat consumed, we need to calculate the total ounces from the first and third players, and then add the ounces from the second player.

The first player ate a 6-ounce steak. 
The third player ate a one-pound steak, which is equal to 16 ounces (1 pound = 16 ounces).

The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so the total ounces from the second player is 8 ounces.

Now, let's add the ounces from the first, second, and third players: 
6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces

The total number of posts in March is 93,000."
"To find out how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to calculate the total amount of water used in a year and then multiply it by the cost of a gallon of water.

Gary does laundry twice a week, so in a year (52 weeks), he does laundry 2 * 52 = 104 times.

Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water, so the total amount of water used in a year is 104 * 20 = 2080 gallons.

Since a gallon of water costs $0.15, the total cost of water for laundry in a year is 2080 * $0.15 = $312.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum.
2. He chews 1 piece for every 2 hours at school. Since school lasts 8 hours, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.
3. He chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner, so that's 2 more pieces.
4. So far, Jim has chewed 4 + 2 = 6 pieces of gum.
5. He has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces of gum left.
6. He gives half of the remaining gum to his sister, so he gives away 14 / 2 = 7 pieces.
7. Jim has 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum left at the end of the day.

The baseball coach bought 9 new baseballs for $3 each, so the total amount spent by the baseball coach is:
9 x 3 = 27

The basketball coach bought 8 new basketballs for $14 each, so the total amount spent by the basketball coach is:
8 x 14 = 112

Now, let's subtract the baseball coach's total from the basketball coach's total:
112 - 27 = 85

The basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach."
"To find the total number of flowers that have bloomed, we need to first find the total number of flowers in the garden. Since there are 10 rows with 20 flowers in each row, we can multiply the number of rows by the number of flowers in each row.

Total flowers = 10 rows * 20 flowers/row = 200 flowers

Since only 4/5 of the flowers have bloomed, we can multiply the total number of flowers by 4/5 to find the number of bloomed flowers.

Number of bloomed flowers = 200 flowers * (4/5) = 200 * 4 / 5 = 160

"To convert kilobits per second to megabits per hour, we need to perform two conversions: 

1. Convert kilobits per second to megabits per second: 
   Since 1 Mb has 1000 kb, 1 kb is 1/1000 of a Mb. Therefore, 20 kb/s is 20/1000 Mb/s, which is 0.02 Mb/s.

2. Convert megabits per second to megabits per hour: 
   There are 3600 seconds in an hour. Multiply 0.02 Mb/s by 3600 s/h to get the speed in Mb/h:

"To find out how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to calculate the difference between his current height and the required height, and then divide that by his growth rate.

First, let's convert Adam's height from inches to feet, since the required height is given in feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

40 inches / 12 = 3.33 feet (approximately)

Now, let's calculate the difference between Adam's current height and the required height:

4 feet (required height) - 3.33 feet (current height) = 0.67 feet

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, and there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert his growth rate to feet per year:

2 inches/year / 12 inches/foot = 0.17 feet/year

Now, let's divide the difference between Adam's current height and the required height by his growth rate:

0.67 feet / 0.17 feet/year = 3.94 years

Since we can't have a fraction of a year, we'll round up to the nearest whole number, as Adam will need to grow at least 0.67 feet to meet the requirement.

Therefore, it will take Adam approximately 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To find James' total profit, we first need to calculate the cost of the cars and the selling price.

The cost of the cars is 30% of $25,000, which is 0.3 * $25,000 = $7,500 per car. 

Since James sold 10 cars, the total cost is 10 * $7,500 = $75,000.

The selling price of each car is $25,000.

The total selling price for 10 cars is 10 * $25,000 = $250,000.

The profit is the selling price minus the cost, which is $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.

James' commission is 10% of the profit, which is 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

Therefore, James made $17,500."
"To find the number of men who can stay upright, we first need to find the total number of riders who can stay upright. 

Given that 25% of the 100 riders can stay upright, we calculate this as 25% of 100, which is 0.25 * 100 = 25 riders.

Next, we are told that 60% of these 25 riders are women. To find the number of women, we calculate 60% of 25, which is 0.6 * 25 = 15 women.

Since the remaining riders who can stay upright are men, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright: 25 - 15 = 10 men.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the prices of the gold and silver jewels first, and then add them to the price of the diamond jewel.

Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, we can find the price of the gold jewel by multiplying the price of the diamond jewel by 4/5.

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * Price of diamond jewel
= (4/5) * $2000
= $1600

The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of the gold jewel, so we can find the price of the silver jewel by subtracting $400 from the price of the gold jewel.

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
= $1600 - $400
= $1200

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels.

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

The final answer is: $4800"
"To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to calculate the number of each type of stamp and add them together.

Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.

He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

Now, we add the number of each type of stamp together: 16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45.

The final answer is: 45"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes for Tom to cover the initial distance between them, which is 75 miles, at a relative speed of 25 miles per hour (since Bob is driving at 55 mph and Tom is driving at 70 mph).

Relative speed = Tom's speed - Bob's speed
Relative speed = 70 mph - 55 mph
Relative speed = 15 mph

However, we need to use the relative speed of 25 mph, not 15 mph, because the question asks for the time it takes for Tom to catch up with Bob, not the time it takes for the distance between them to decrease by 75 miles. 

Time = Distance / Relative speed
Time = 75 miles / 25 mph
Time = 3 hours

"To find out how many fish Tommy caught, we need to first determine how many fish Darren caught. Since Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish, we can calculate Darren's catch by subtracting 6 from Naomi's total.

Darren's catch = Naomi's catch - 6
Darren's catch = 17 - 6
Darren's catch = 11

Now that we know Darren caught 11 fish, we can find out how many Tommy caught by adding 3 to Darren's total, since Tommy caught 3 more than Darren.

Tommy's catch = Darren's catch + 3
Tommy's catch = 11 + 3
Tommy's catch = 14

"To find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to determine the maximum number of classes he can attend without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Let's assume the cost per class is x. Since Manny's parents won't sign him up again if the cost exceeds $10 per class, we can set up an equation to represent the total cost of the classes:

Total cost = Number of classes * Cost per class
60 = 10x

To find the cost per class, we can divide both sides of the equation by 10:

x = 60 / 10
x = 6

This means that the cost per class is $6. Since Manny's parents won't sign him up again if the cost exceeds $10 per class, we can set up another equation to represent the maximum number of classes he can attend:

Total cost = Number of classes * Cost per class
60 = n * 6

To find the maximum number of classes, we can divide both sides of the equation by 6:

n = 60 / 6
n = 10

However, this is the total number of classes, and we want to find the number of classes Manny can miss. Since Manny can attend all 10 classes, he can miss 0 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many customers Julie can process in a day. Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, and Jewel processes 50 customers in a day, Julie can process 2 * 50 = 100 customers in a day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we need to multiply the number of customers each of them can process in a day by 7 to find the total weekly production.

Jewel's weekly production = 50 customers/day * 7 days = 350 customers
Julie's weekly production = 100 customers/day * 7 days = 700 customers

Total weekly production = Jewel's weekly production + Julie's weekly production
Total weekly production = 350 customers + 700 customers
Total weekly production = 1050 customers

"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of linear equations. Let's denote the distance Lynn ran as L, the distance Reggie ran as R, and the distance Paisley ran as P.

We are given that Paisley ran 4 miles, so P = 4.

We are also given that Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so R = 5P = 5(4) = 20.

We are also given that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, so R = L + 3.

Now we can substitute the value of R into the equation R = L + 3 to get 20 = L + 3.

To solve for L, we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation: L = 20 - 3 = 17.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges. 

First, let's find the cost of one apple and one orange. 

Let's denote the cost of one apple as 'a' and the cost of one orange as 'o'. We are given that 4 apples cost $5.20 and 3 oranges cost $3.30. 

We can set up the following system of linear equations:

4a = 5.20
3o = 3.30

To find the cost of one apple, we can divide both sides of the first equation by 4:

a = 5.20 / 4
a = 1.30

To find the cost of one orange, we can divide both sides of the second equation by 3:

o = 3.30 / 3
o = 1.10

Now that we know the cost of one apple and one orange, we can find the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges:

Cost of 5 apples = 5a = 5 * 1.30 = 6.50
Cost of 5 oranges = 5o = 5 * 1.10 = 5.50

The total cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges is the sum of the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges:

Total cost = 6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00

The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of the leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of the running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the features and the base price:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

"To find the total amount Tim will make in a year, we need to calculate his new monthly salary and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's calculate the 5% raise on his monthly salary:
5% of $20,000 = 0.05 * $20,000 = $1,000
New monthly salary = $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000

Next, let's calculate the bonus:
Bonus = half a month's salary = $20,000 / 2 = $10,000

Now, let's add the bonus to the new monthly salary:
New monthly salary with bonus = $21,000 + $10,000 = $31,000

"To find the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay, then add those times together.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil. Bill can dig 4 feet/hour through soil, and he needs to dig 24 feet of soil. 

Time to dig through soil = Total soil depth / Rate of digging through soil
Time to dig through soil = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour
Time to dig through soil = 6 hours

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the clay. Bill can dig half as fast through clay as he can through soil, so his rate of digging through clay is 4 / 2 = 2 feet/hour. He needs to dig 8 feet of clay.

Time to dig through clay = Total clay depth / Rate of digging through clay
Time to dig through clay = 8 feet / 2 feet/hour
Time to dig through clay = 4 hours

Now, we add the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay to find the total time.

First, we have Howie himself, his teacher, and 25 classmates. So, the total number of people is 1 (Howie) + 1 (teacher) + 25 (classmates) = 27.

Since he's getting 2 cupcakes for each person, we multiply the total number of people by 2: 27 * 2 = 54.

So, Howie should buy 54 cupcakes.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the number of likes after 3 weeks. 
The initial number of likes is 2000. After 3 weeks, the number of likes is 70 times the initial number of likes. 
So, the number of likes after 3 weeks = 70 * 2000 = 140000.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of likes after receiving 20000 new likes.
The total number of likes after 3 weeks is 140000. After receiving 20000 new likes, the total number of likes = 140000 + 20000 = 160000.

The final answer is: 160000"
"To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost of the pomegranates on each day and then subtract the two amounts.

On the first day, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, but she got a $2 discount. So, the total cost for the first day is:
20 pomegranates * $20 = $400
Discount: $2
Total cost for the first day = $400 - $2 = $398

On the second day, the price of each pomegranate is $30, and there's a 10% discount on the total cost. So, the total cost for the second day is:
20 pomegranates * $30 = $600
Discount: 10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
Total cost for the second day = $600 - $60 = $540

Now, let's find the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days:
Difference = Total cost for the second day - Total cost for the first day
Difference = $540 - $398
Difference = $142

The final answer is: $142"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the total sales from green hats in the first month.
Since the sales from red hats were half the total amount she earned from selling green hats, let's denote the total sales from green hats as 'x'. Then, the sales from red hats would be x/2. We are given that the sales from red hats were $400. So, we can set up the equation:
x/2 = 400
To find the value of 'x', we multiply both sides by 2:
x = 400 * 2
x = 800

So, the total sales from green hats in the first month were $800.

Step 2: Calculate the total sales in the first month.
The total sales in the first month would be the sum of sales from red hats and green hats:
Total sales in the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
Total sales in the first month = 400 + 800
Total sales in the first month = 1200

Step 3: Calculate the sales in the second month.
We are given that the sales in the second month were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. So, we can calculate the sales in the second month as:
Sales in the second month = (3/4) * Total sales in the first month
Sales in the second month = (3/4) * 1200
Sales in the second month = 900

Step 4: Calculate the total sales in two months.
The total sales in two months would be the sum of sales in the first month and the second month:
Total sales in two months = Total sales in the first month + Sales in the second month
Total sales in two months = 1200 + 900
Total sales in two months = 2100

The final answer is: $2100"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the number of paid hours and multiply it by the cost per hour.

James gets 1 hour free, so he paid for 4 hours (9 PM - 5 PM = 4 hours).

The cost of the first hour is $15. 
The cost of each subsequent hour is twice the cost of the first hour, which is $15 * 2 = $30.

So, the cost of the 4 paid hours is:
- 1st hour: $15
- 2nd hour: $30
- 3rd hour: $30
- 4th hour: $30

Total cost = $15 + $30 + $30 + $30 = $105

"To find out how many dollars were withheld from Sally's wage, we need to determine the total amount she should have in her account if she received her full wage. 

First, let's calculate the total amount she should have in her account: 
Weekly wage = $300
Since she started with $200, the total amount she should have is: 
$200 (initial amount) + $300 (weekly wage) = $500

Now, let's find out how much was withheld from her wage by subtracting the current amount in her account from the total amount she should have:
$500 (total amount she should have) - $420 (current amount in her account) = $80

The amount withheld from Sally's wage is $80.

"To find out how many deviled egg halves Lori's guests will eat, we need to multiply the number of guests by the number of deviled egg halves each guest will eat. 

Number of guests: 16
Number of deviled egg halves per guest: 3

Total deviled egg halves: 16 * 3 = 48

Since Lori needs 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves, we need to find out how many eggs are needed to make 48 deviled egg halves. 

Number of deviled egg halves per egg: 2
Total deviled egg halves needed: 48

Number of eggs needed: 48 / 2 = 24

Since there are 12 deviled egg halves in a dozen, we need to find out how many dozens of eggs Lori needs.

"To find out how many pages Shiela has left to write, we need to determine the total number of pages she has already written and subtract that from the total number of pages required.

Since Shiela has finished writing 1/3 of the paper, we can calculate the number of pages she has written as follows:

1/3 of 15 pages = (1/3) * 15
= 5 pages

Now, we subtract the number of pages she has written from the total number of pages required:

15 pages (total) - 5 pages (written) = 10 pages

So, Shiela has 10 pages left to write.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many days it will take Mike to finish reading the book, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he plans to read per day.

Total number of pages = 200
Pages read per day = 10

Number of days to finish reading = Total number of pages / Pages read per day
= 200 / 10
= 20

Since Mike has 30 days to complete the assignment, we need to subtract the number of days it will take him to finish reading from the total number of days.

Days before the deadline = Total number of days - Number of days to finish reading
= 30 - 20
= 10

"To find the total cost of the plane for the first year, we need to calculate the cost of the plane itself and the total cost of renting the hanger and fuel for a year.

The cost of the plane is $150,000.

The monthly cost of renting the hanger is $5000. To find the total cost of renting the hanger for a year, we multiply this by 12: $5000 * 12 = $60,000.

The monthly cost of fuel is twice the cost of renting the hanger, which is $5000 * 2 = $10,000. To find the total cost of fuel for a year, we multiply this by 12: $10,000 * 12 = $120,000.

The total cost of renting the hanger and fuel for a year is $60,000 + $120,000 = $180,000.

The total cost of getting and maintaining the plane for the first year is the cost of the plane plus the cost of renting the hanger and fuel: $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000.

The final answer is: $330,000"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. Let's denote the time it took to cook rice as R, the time to cook pork as P, and the time to cook beans as B.

2. We know that it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice, so R = 30.

3. We also know that it took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, so P = R + 20 = 30 + 20 = 50.

4. The time it took to cook beans is half the combined cooking time of pork and rice, so B = (P + R) / 2 = (50 + 30) / 2 = 40.

5. To find the total time it took to cook all the food, we need to add the cooking times of rice, pork, and beans: Total time = R + P + B = 30 + 50 + 40 = 120.

For the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- Cost of almonds = (1/2) * $10 = $5
- Cost of walnuts = (1/3) * $15 = $5
- Total cost of the first mixture = $5 + $5 = $10

For the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- Cost of almonds = (1/5) * $10 = $2
- Cost of walnuts = (1/3) * $15 = $5
- Total cost of the second mixture = $2 + $5 = $7

"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of sheep as S and the number of geese as G.

Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, the total number of legs can be represented by the equation:

4S + 2G = 70

We also know that the total number of animal heads is 20, and since each sheep and goose has one head, we can represent this as:

S + G = 20

Now we have a system of two linear equations:

1) 4S + 2G = 70
2) S + G = 20

We can solve this system by multiplying the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of G in both equations the same:

2(S + G) = 2(20)
2S + 2G = 40

Now we can subtract this new equation from the first equation to eliminate G:

(4S + 2G) - (2S + 2G) = 70 - 40
2S = 30

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

S = 15

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee and the cost of the donut. 

First, let's find the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more. 

20% of $5 is 0.2 x $5 = $1. 
So, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

Since Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day, and he buys a week's worth of coffee, he will need 7 pounds of coffee. 

The cost of the more expensive coffee is $6 per pound, so the total cost of the coffee is 7 x $6 = $42.

The cost of the donut is $2.

The total cost is the cost of the coffee plus the cost of the donut: $42 + $2 = $44.

The final answer is: $44"

= 90

Now, we know that the rest of the teachers are math teachers. So, the number of math teachers is:
Number of math teachers = Total number of teachers - Number of history teachers
= 150 - 90
= 60

Since each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:

"To solve this problem, we need to find the amount of money Kassidy and Rayna have. 

Since Aurelia has $120, and Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, we can calculate Kassidy's money as follows:
Kassidy's money = (3/4) * Aurelia's money
Kassidy's money = (3/4) * 120
Kassidy's money = 90

Since Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy, we can calculate Rayna's money as follows:
Rayna's money = Kassidy's money + 60
Rayna's money = 90 + 60
Rayna's money = 150

Now, we need to find the total amount of money they have together:
Total money = Aurelia's money + Kassidy's money + Rayna's money
Total money = 120 + 90 + 150
Total money = 360

If they decide to add their money together and share equally among them, we need to divide the total money by 3 (since there are 3 people):

"To find the number of good days left in the month, we need to first determine the total number of good days recorded by Christina. We know that she had 12 good days in the first 30 days. However, we also know that her first 8 days were good, her second 8 days were bad, and her third 8 days were neutral. This means that the good days in the first 30 days are only the first 8 days.

So, the total number of good days in the first 30 days is 8. 

Now, we are given that the next 3 days were good, neutral, and good. We need to add these 3 days to the total number of good days. 

Total good days = 8 (initial good days) + 3 (next good days) = 11

However, we are asked to find the number of good days left in the month. Since we are considering the next 3 days as part of the month, we need to subtract these 3 days from the total number of good days.

According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has, which can be written as 2x + 3. We are also given that Janey has 21 books.

So, we can set up the equation: 2x + 3 = 21

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate the variable 'x'. We can do this by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for 'x':

x = 18 / 2
x = 9

Therefore, Sally has 9 books.

"To solve this problem, we need to first convert the initial height of the bamboo from feet to inches, since the growth rate is given in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so we can convert 20 feet to inches as follows:

20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now, we know the bamboo grows 30 inches per day and starts at 240 inches. We want to find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches. We can set up an equation to represent this situation:

Initial height + (growth rate * number of days) = final height
240 + (30 * number of days) = 600

Subtract 240 from both sides to isolate the term with the variable:

30 * number of days = 360

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs. This means he has 1 toy per dog. 

1. First, James has 4 dogs and 4 toys. He then adds 8 more dogs, making it a total of 12 dogs. Since each dog needs 1 toy, he needs 12 toys in total.

2. However, James bought the toys and then found out there are twice as many more dogs than when he left. This means there are now 2 * 8 = 16 more dogs. So, the total number of dogs is now 12 + 16 = 28 dogs.

3. Since each dog needs 1 toy, James needs 28 toys in total.

4. However, when James came back again, 3 dogs were gone, so he no longer needs 3 toys. This means he needs 28 - 3 = 25 toys.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of cookies Max and Summer have. 

Since Katarina has 68 cookies and she has 5 less than Max, Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.

Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, but we don't know how many cookies the Cookie Monster has. However, we can express the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has as x. Then, Max has x + 12 cookies.

Since we already know Max has 73 cookies, we can set up the equation x + 12 = 73. Solving for x, we get x = 73 - 12 = 61. So, the Cookie Monster has 61 cookies.

Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, and we know Max has 73 cookies. Therefore, Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Now, we can find the total number of cookies by adding the number of cookies Katarina, Max, and Summer have: 68 + 73 + 96 = 237.

"To find the original length of the dress, we need to work backwards from the final design length. 

Let's denote the original length of the dress as 'x'. 

When Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, the new length becomes x + 0.5x = 1.5x.

Then, she adds 20cm to the bottom of the dress, making the final length 1.5x + 20.

We are given that the final design is 140cm long, so we can set up the equation:

1.5x + 20 = 140

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. First, subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

1.5x = 140 - 20
1.5x = 120

Next, divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for x:

x = 120 / 1.5
x = 80

Let's assume the time it takes to mow the lawn in turtle mode is 60 minutes (since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes) and in rabbit mode is 40 minutes. 

Since Chris mowed half the lawn in turtle mode and half in rabbit mode, the weights for each mode are 0.5 (or 50%) for both modes.

Weighted average = (time in turtle mode * weight of turtle mode) + (time in rabbit mode * weight of rabbit mode)

After eating 10 cookies, the number of cookies left is 90 - 10 = 80 cookies.

The final answer is: 80"
"Let's denote the age of the younger twin as T, the age of the older twin as T+7, and the age of the triplet as t. 

Since there is one set of twins and one set of triplets, we can write the following equations:

T + (T+7) + t = 44 (the total combined age of the twins and the triplet is 44)
T + t = T+7 + t (since the triplet's age is the same in both equations)

Simplifying the second equation, we get:
T = T+7
Subtracting T from both sides, we get:
0 = 7
This is a contradiction, so the second equation is not useful.

Now, let's simplify the first equation:
2T + t = 44

We can rewrite the first equation as:
T + (T+7) + t = 44
Combine like terms:
2T + t + 7 = 44
Subtract 7 from both sides:
2T + t = 37

Now we have two equations:
2T + t = 37
T + t = T+7 + t (this equation is not useful)

We can rewrite the first equation as:
2T + t = 37
Subtract t from both sides:
2T = 37 - t

Now we can substitute 2T = 37 - t into the first equation:
2T + t = 37
Substitute 2T = 37 - t:
(37 - t) + t = 37
Combine like terms:
37 = 37

This is a contradiction, so the first equation is not useful.

Now we can rewrite the first equation as:
2T + t = 37
Subtract 2T from both sides:
t = 37 - 2T

Now we can substitute t = 37 - 2T into the first equation:

"To find out how many minutes John has to nap, we need to calculate the total time he spends on homework and subtract that from the total time he has before dinner.

First, let's convert the 3 hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Now, let's add up the time John spends on homework:

20 minutes (math) + 40 minutes (reading) + 20 minutes (history) = 80 minutes

Now, let's subtract the time spent on homework from the total time before dinner:

180 minutes (total time before dinner) - 80 minutes (homework time) = 100 minutes

So, John has 100 minutes to nap."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the cost of the candies. We know that Manolo bought 5 lollipops and 4 candies for $3.20. The cost of 5 lollipops is 5 x $0.40 = $2.00. 

Now, we subtract the cost of the lollipops from the total cost to find the cost of the candies: $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20. 

Since the cost of 4 candies is $1.20, the cost of 1 candy is $1.20 / 4 = $0.30.

Now, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is 10 x $0.40 = $4.00. The cost of 10 candies is 10 x $0.30 = $3.00.

The total cost is $4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of coins Rong and Neil have saved over 10 years.

Rong saves 20 coins per month. To find the total number of coins Rong saves in 10 years, we multiply the monthly savings by 12 (months in a year) and then by 10 (years).

Rong's total savings = 20 * 12 * 10 = 2400 coins

Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong. To find Neil's monthly savings, we multiply Rong's monthly savings by 2/5 and then add it to Rong's monthly savings.

Neil's monthly savings = 20 + (2/5 * 20) = 20 + 8 = 28 coins

Now, we calculate Neil's total savings over 10 years.

Neil's total savings = 28 * 12 * 10 = 3360 coins

The total number of coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years is the sum of their individual savings.

Total savings = Rong's total savings + Neil's total savings = 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins

The final answer is: 5760"
"To find the total bill, we first need to calculate the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check. 

The cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40. 

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's represent the total bill as 'x'. Then, 60% of x is 0.6x. Since the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, we can set up the equation: 0.6x = $40 (cost of vaccines) + x - $40 (since the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, the remaining 40% is the cost of the vaccines). 

Simplifying the equation, we get 0.6x = x - $40. Subtracting 0.6x from both sides, we get 0.4x = $40. Dividing both sides by 0.4, we get x = $100. 

So, the total bill is $100. 

Now, we need to find out how much John leaves with. He brought $125 with him. To find out how much he leaves with, we subtract the total bill from the amount he brought: $125 - $100 = $25.

The final answer is: $25"
"To find the price of the crate, we need to calculate the total cost of the fruits in the crate and then divide it by the total number of fruits.

First, let's find the cost of each fruit:
- The cost of one banana is twice as much as an apple, so it's 2 * $0.5 = $1.
- The cost of one orange is three times as much as a banana, so it's 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits in the crate:
- 5 bananas cost 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples cost 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges cost 7 * $3 = $21

The total cost of the fruits in the crate is $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

The total number of fruits in the crate is 5 + 12 + 7 = 24.

Now, let's calculate the price of the crate:
Price of the crate = Total cost of fruits / Total number of fruits
= $32 / 24

"To find the total number of squares, we need to calculate the number of each color of squares and add them together.

The comforter has 14 red squares.

There are 4 more blue squares than red squares, so the number of blue squares is 14 + 4 = 18.

There are 6 more green squares than blue squares, so the number of green squares is 18 + 6 = 24.

There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so the number of white squares is 24 - 12 = 12.

Now, we add the number of squares of each color together: 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68.

The total number of squares is 68, and since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

"To find out how many chairs Mia needs, we first need to determine the total number of chairs she has. Since there are 8 high chairs and the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, we can calculate the number of regular chairs by multiplying 8 by 5.

Number of regular chairs = 8 * 5 = 40

Now, we add the number of high chairs to the number of regular chairs to find the total number of chairs.

Total chairs = 8 (high chairs) + 40 (regular chairs) = 48

"To solve this problem, we need to find the total points collected by Adam, Betty, Martha, and Tom, and then subtract that from the minimum threshold of 400 points.

Adam has 50 points.

Betty collected 30% more than Adam. To find 30% of 50, we multiply 50 by 0.3: 50 * 0.3 = 15. Then, we add this to Adam's points: 50 + 15 = 65 points for Betty.

Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom. Since Tom has 30 points less than Betty, we first find Tom's points by subtracting 30 from Betty's points: 65 - 30 = 35 points for Tom. Then, we multiply Tom's points by 3 to find Martha's points: 35 * 3 = 105 points for Martha.

Now, we add up the points collected by Adam, Betty, Martha, and Tom: 50 + 65 + 105 + 35 = 255 points.

To find out how many points the class is missing, we subtract the total points collected from the minimum threshold: 400 - 255 = 145 points.

Each person will save a seat, so there are 20 seats. Each seat can hold 2 drinks and 3 snacks, so the total number of drinks and snacks is 20 * 2 = 40 drinks and 20 * 3 = 60 snacks.

The total number of items (drinks and snacks) is 40 + 60 = 100.

Since each item costs $2, the total amount spent on snacks and drinks is 100 * 2 = $200.

The final answer is: $200"
"To solve this problem, we can start by defining the weight capacity of Gissela's truck as x. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, the weight capacity of Gordy's truck is x + 800.

We know that when Gary brings his truck and joins Gissela and Gordy, the three trucks combined can haul a total of 11,600 pounds of gravel. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 800) + Gary's capacity = 11,600

We also know that Gary's capacity is unknown, but we can represent it as y. So, the equation becomes:

x + (x + 800) + y = 11,600

Combine like terms:

2x + 800 + y = 11,600

Subtract 800 from both sides:

2x + y = 11,200

Now, we know that Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel. So, we can substitute x = 4,000 into the equation:

2(4,000) + y = 11,200

Multiply 2 and 4,000:

8,000 + y = 11,200

Subtract 8,000 from both sides:

y = 3,200

So, Gary's truck can carry 3,200 pounds of gravel.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3200}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote the number of dumplings each female ate as F and the number of dumplings each male ate as M. We know that each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, so M = F + 1.

We are given that each female ate 3 dumplings, so F = 3.

Since M = F + 1, we can substitute F = 3 into this equation to get M = 3 + 1 = 4.

Now, we know that there are 6 females, so the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6F = 6 * 3 = 18.

We also know that there are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8M = 8 * 4 = 32.

The total number of dumplings eaten is the sum of the dumplings eaten by males and females, which is 18 + 32 = 50.

Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is equal to the total number of dumplings eaten, which is 50.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how much money Gerald had initially, we need to determine the total parts in the ratio and Gerald's share. The ratio is 3:2, so the total parts are 3 + 2 = 5.

Gerald's share is 3 out of 5 parts, so we can find his initial amount by multiplying his share by the total amount: (3/5) * 100 = 60.

Now, we need to subtract the amount Gerald spent on the book from his initial amount: 60 - 10 = 50.

The final answer is: $50"
"To find the speed of the turtle, we need to divide the speed of the cat by 5, since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle. 

Speed of the cat = 15 feet/second
Speed of the turtle = Speed of the cat / 5
Speed of the turtle = 15 / 5
Speed of the turtle = 3 feet/second

Now, we can find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds by multiplying its speed by the time.

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 3 feet/second x 40 seconds
Distance = 120 feet

The final answer is: 120"
"To find out how many hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we need to first determine how much more money they need to raise to reach their goal. 

The goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. 

So, the amount they still need to raise is: 
$6300 - $2100 = $4200

Since they raise an equal amount in every hour, we can divide the remaining amount by the amount they raise per hour. However, we don't know the amount they raise per hour yet. We do know that they raised $2100 in 3 hours. 

To find the amount they raise per hour, we can divide the amount they raised by the number of hours: 
$2100 / 3 hours = $700 per hour

Now that we know they raise $700 per hour, we can divide the remaining amount by the amount they raise per hour to find out how many hours they need to fundraise: 
$4200 / $700 per hour = 6 hours

So, the firefighters need to fundraise for 6 more hours to reach their goal.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to first find the percentage of water used by the city and then subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes.

The city uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River. 

80% of the water used by the city is used for industrial purposes, so the percentage used for industrial purposes is 40% * 80% = 0.4 * 0.8 = 0.32 or 32%.

To find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes from the total percentage used by the city: 40% - 32% = 0.4 - 0.32 = 0.08 or 8%.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how much Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring, we need to first calculate the total number of days in 2 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, 2 weeks would have 7 * 2 = 14 days.

Next, we need to multiply the total number of days by the daily charge of $12. 

Total charge = 14 days * $12/day = $168

The final answer is: $168"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the rate at which the factory makes chocolate and vanilla ice cream per hour. 

Let's start with the chocolate ice cream. The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours, so the rate is 100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts per hour.

Now, let's look at the vanilla ice cream. The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours, so the rate is 50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now that we have the rates, we can find the total amount of ice cream made in 48 hours. 

For chocolate ice cream: 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts
For vanilla ice cream: 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts

The total amount of ice cream made in 48 hours is 2400 + 600 = 3000 quarts.

The final answer is: 3000"
"To find the total bill, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then apply the discount.

First, let's calculate the cost of each item:
- 5 croissants at $3.00 apiece: 5 x $3.00 = $15.00
- 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each: 4 x $2.50 = $10.00
- 3 mini quiches at $4.00 apiece: 3 x $4.00 = $12.00
- 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 apiece: 13 x $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items: $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Since Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him 10% off his purchase, we need to calculate the discount amount:
10% of $50.00 = 0.10 x $50.00 = $5.00

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total bill: $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

The final answer is: $45.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the cost of 3 scoops of ice cream, since Erin will get 1 free scoop for every 2 scoops she buys. 

The cost of 1 scoop is $1.50. To find the cost of 3 scoops, we multiply the cost of 1 scoop by 3:

$1.50 * 3 = $4.50

Since Erin has $6.00, she can afford to buy 2 sets of 3 scoops, which will give her a total of 6 scoops of ice cream.

However, we need to consider the deal, which is buy 2 scoops, get 1 free. So, for every 3 scoops, Erin will pay for 2 scoops. 

The cost of 2 scoops is $1.50 * 2 = $3.00. 

Since Erin has $6.00, she can afford to buy 2 sets of 3 scoops, which will cost her 2 * $3.00 = $6.00. 

Therefore, Erin can buy 6 scoops of ice cream.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how much more candy Amy has after two weeks, we need to calculate the total amount of candy each of them eats in two weeks and then subtract that from their initial amount.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces.

Ginger starts with 100 pieces and eats 56, so she has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces left.

Amy starts with 100 pieces and eats 42, so she has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces left.

To find out how much more candy Amy has, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's remaining candy: 58 - 44 = 14.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find the total number of tiles needed, we first need to find the area of two-thirds of the bathroom. 

The area of the entire bathroom is 36 sq ft. To find two-thirds of this area, we multiply 36 by 2/3.

36 * (2/3) = 36 * 2 / 3 = 72 / 3 = 24

So, two-thirds of the bathroom is 24 sq ft. 

Now, we need to find the number of tiles needed to cover 24 sq ft. Since Mr. Boarden needs 24 tiles per square foot, we multiply 24 by 24.

24 * 24 = 576

"To find the total cost of picking blueberries, we need to add the initial cost of going to the blueberry patch and the cost of the blueberries themselves. 

The cost of going to the blueberry patch is $20. 
The cost of the blueberries is $1.5 per pound, and James picked 30 pounds, so the total cost of the blueberries is 1.5 * 30 = $45.

The total cost of picking blueberries is $20 + $45 = $65.

To find the cost of buying the blueberries at the store, we multiply the cost per pound by the number of pounds: 2.5 * 30 = $75.

The difference in cost is $75 - $65 = $10.

The final answer is: $10"
"To find the new price of each computer, we need to calculate 10% of the original price and add it to the original price.

"To find the total calories in the omelet, we need to calculate the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham.

First, let's calculate the calories from the eggs:
6 eggs * 75 calories per egg = 450 calories

Next, let's calculate the calories from the cheese:
2 oz of cheese * 120 calories per oz = 240 calories

Since the amount of ham is equal to the amount of cheese, we also have 2 oz of ham. 
2 oz of ham * 40 calories per oz = 80 calories

Now, let's add up the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham:
450 calories (eggs) + 240 calories (cheese) + 80 calories (ham) = 770 calories

The total calories in the omelet is 770.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many slices were eaten by Bryce and his friends, and then subtract that from the total number of slices.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 5 friends in total, including Bryce, 3 friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. 

First, let's find out how many slices 2/3 of a pizza is. Since each pizza has 12 slices, 2/3 of a pizza is (2/3) * 12 = 8 slices.

Since 3 friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas, the total number of slices eaten by these friends is 3 * 8 = 24 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 friends, the total number of slices eaten by these friends is 2 * (3/4) * 12 = 9 slices.

Now, let's add the total number of slices eaten by all friends: 24 + 9 = 33 slices.

Since there are 5 friends in total, and each ordered 1 pizza, the total number of slices is 5 * 12 = 60 slices.

"To solve this problem, we need to first convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

8 feet * 12 inches/foot = 96 inches
Adding the 4 inches, we get:
96 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches

Now, let's use the information that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. We can write this as an equation:

L = 9B + 10
where L is the length of Topher's shoe and B is the length of Bobby's shoe.

We know that L = 100 inches, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

100 = 9B + 10

Now, we can solve for B by subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation:

100 - 10 = 9B
90 = 9B

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 9 to solve for B:

B = 90 / 9
B = 10

"To find the total number of windows smashed, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed from students' cars and teachers' cars separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of windows smashed from students' cars. Since Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows, we need to find a quarter of 64 cars. A quarter is equivalent to 1/4, which can be written as 0.25 in decimal form. Multiply 0.25 by 64 to get the number of students' cars' windows smashed: 0.25 * 64 = 16.

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed from teachers' cars. Since Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows, we need to find 3/4 of 32 cars. 3/4 can be written as 0.75 in decimal form. Multiply 0.75 by 32 to get the number of teachers' cars' windows smashed: 0.75 * 32 = 24.

Now, we need to find the total number of windows smashed. Since each student's car has 4 windows and each teacher's car has 2 windows, we need to multiply the number of smashed windows by the number of windows per car. For students' cars, 16 * 4 = 64. For teachers' cars, 24 * 2 = 48. Now, add the number of smashed windows from students' cars and teachers' cars: 64 + 48 = 112.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Total students = 50
- Students who like to bake = 10
- Students who like to play basketball = 5
- Students who like to play video games or music = Total students - Students who like to bake = 50 - 10 = 40
- Students who like to play music = 2 * Students who like to play basketball = 2 * 5 = 10

Since the students who like to play video games or music are 40, and the students who like to play music are 10, the students who like to play video games are:
40 - 10 = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the number of birds that were scared away, we need to calculate 1/3 of 12. 

1/3 of 12 is calculated as (1/3) * 12 = 4.

So, 4 birds were scared away. 

Now, we subtract 4 from the initial number of birds: 12 - 4 = 8.

Then, 20 more birds joined the fearless birds. 

So, the total number of birds now is 8 + 20 = 28.

The final answer is: 28"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of girls in both classes. Since 40% of the students in each class are girls, and there are 80 students in total, we can set up an equation to find the number of students in each class.

Let x be the number of students in each class. Since there are two classes, the total number of students is 2x. We know that 40% of the students in each class are girls, so the number of girls in each class is 0.4x. Since there are two classes, the total number of girls is 2(0.4x) = 0.8x.

We know that the total number of students is 80, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 80

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 2:

x = 80 / 2
x = 40

So, there are 40 students in each class. Now, we can find the number of boys in each class. Since 40% of the students are girls, 60% are boys. The number of boys in each class is 0.6x = 0.6(40) = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Mara had 2 slices of cake on the plate. 

1. Mara added 3 slices to the plate, so now she has 2 + 3 = 5 slices.
2. Mara tripled the number of slices she currently has, so she now has 5 * 3 = 15 slices.
3. Mara ate 2 slices, so she now has 15 - 2 = 13 slices.
4. Her friend stole 5 slices off her plate, so she now has 13 - 5 = 8 slices.

The final number of cake slices remaining on the plate is 8."
"To find out how many animals Melissa will groom each day, we need to calculate the total number of animals and then divide that by the number of days in a week (7).

First, let's add up the number of animals that need grooming:

- Dogs: 8
- Cats: 5
- Birds: 3
- Horses: 12
Total animals = 8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28

Now, let's divide the total number of animals by the number of days in a week:

28 animals / 7 days = 4 animals per day

So, Melissa will groom 4 animals each day of the week.

The final answer is: 4"
"To calculate the profit, we need to first calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

Total cost = 3 packs * $1800 = $5400
Total revenue from the $4000 card = $4000
Total revenue from the $1000 card = $1000
Total revenue from the 30 cards = 30 * $50 = $1500
Total revenue = $4000 + $1000 + $1500 = $6500

Now, let's calculate the profit:
Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $6500 - $5400
Profit = $1100

The final answer is: $1100"
"To find the total cost for each amusement park, we need to calculate the cost for the adults and the cost for the children separately and then add them together.

For the first amusement park:
- Cost for adults: 2 adults * $26 = $52
- Cost for children: 2 children * $12 = $24
- Total cost for the first amusement park: $52 + $24 = $76

For the second amusement park:
- Cost for adults: 2 adults * $14 = $28
- Cost for children: 2 children * $10 = $20
- Total cost for the second amusement park: $28 + $20 = $48

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between the two amusement parks to determine how much they will save by choosing the second amusement park:
- Savings = Total cost of the first amusement park - Total cost of the second amusement park
- Savings = $76 - $48
- Savings = $28

"To find out how much money the vendor saves a week, we need to first calculate the daily savings and then multiply it by 7.

The vendor used to buy 500 tomatoes a day at $.5 each, so his daily cost was 500 * $.5 = $250.

With the new vendor, he buys the same 500 tomatoes at $.4 each, so his new daily cost is 500 * $.4 = $200.

The daily savings is the difference between the old cost and the new cost: $250 - $200 = $50.

To find the weekly savings, we multiply the daily savings by 7: $50 * 7 = $350.

The final answer is: $350"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of marbles Carl and Cal have. 

Since Sean has 56 marbles and he has half as many marbles as Cal, we can find the number of marbles Cal has by multiplying Sean's marbles by 2. 

Cal's marbles = 56 * 2 = 112

Now, we know that Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. So, we can find the number of marbles Carl has by multiplying Sean's marbles by 4.

Carl's marbles = 56 * 4 = 224

To find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have, we add their marbles together.

Total marbles = Carl's marbles + Cal's marbles
Total marbles = 224 + 112
Total marbles = 336

The final answer is: 336"
"To find out how many groups are needed, we first need to determine the size of each group. Since there are 54 students and they are to be separated into 6 groups of equal size, we can divide 54 by 6.

54 ÷ 6 = 9

This means each group will have 9 students. However, the activity requires 12 groups. To find out how many more groups are needed, we need to subtract the number of groups already formed (6) from the required number of groups (12).

12 - 6 = 6

So, 6 more groups are needed to form.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the total number of chairs rented in a month and then multiply it by 2.

In a month, there are approximately 4 weeks. In a week, there are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days. 

The total number of chairs rented in a week is:
- Weekdays: 5 days * 60 chairs/day = 300 chairs
- Weekends: 2 days * 100 chairs/day = 200 chairs
- Total chairs rented in a week: 300 chairs + 200 chairs = 500 chairs

In a month, the total number of chairs rented is: 500 chairs/week * 4 weeks = 2000 chairs

Since we want to find the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months, we multiply the total number of chairs rented in a month by 2:
2000 chairs/month * 2 months = 4000 chairs

The final answer is: 4000"
"To find the total number of bananas Gunther had, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, Gunther had 48 bananas.

Arnold stole half of the bananas, so we need to find half of 48. 
Half of 48 is 48 / 2 = 24. 
So, after Arnold stole half, Gunther had 48 - 24 = 24 bananas left.

The next day, Gunther added 25 bananas to his pile, so now he had 24 + 25 = 49 bananas.

Later that evening, Arnold stole 12 bananas, so we subtract 12 from 49. 
49 - 12 = 37 bananas.

On the third day, Gunther added 6 bananas to his pile, so now he had 37 + 6 = 43 bananas.

The final number of bananas Gunther found in the pile is 43.

The final answer is: 43"
"To find out how much each roommate will pay per year, we need to first calculate the total electricity bill for a year. Since the electricity bill is $100 per month, we multiply this by 12 months to get the yearly bill.

Yearly electricity bill = $100/month * 12 months = $1200

Next, we divide the yearly bill by the number of roommates to find out how much each roommate will pay.

$1200 / 4 roommates = $300 per roommate per year

The final answer is: $300"
"To find out how many glasses and plates Jeff has now, we need to first calculate the total number of glasses and plates he initially sent.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, we can calculate the total number of glasses and plates as follows:

Glasses: 8 dozen = 8 * 12 = 96
Plates: 4 dozen = 4 * 12 = 48

Now, let's subtract the number of broken glasses and plates from the total number of glasses and plates:

Glasses: 96 - 10 = 86
Plates: 48 - 6 = 42

So, Jeff has 86 glasses and 42 plates now.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the number of small stickers Lorraine trades for large buttons.
Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and trades 90% of them. 
90% of 30 is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.

Step 2: Calculate the number of large buttons Lorraine gets from trading small stickers.
Since each small sticker is worth one small button, Lorraine gets 27 small buttons from trading 27 small stickers.

Step 3: Calculate the number of large buttons Lorraine gets from trading large stickers.
Lorraine starts with 40 large stickers and trades 50% of them. 
50% of 40 is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.

Since each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons, Lorraine gets 20 large buttons from trading 20 large stickers.

Step 4: Calculate the number of small buttons Lorraine gets from trading the remaining large stickers.
Lorraine has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left. 
Since each large sticker is worth three small stickers, Lorraine gets 20 * 3 = 60 small stickers. 
Since each small sticker is worth one small button, Lorraine gets 60 small buttons from trading 60 small stickers.

Step 5: Calculate the total number of buttons Lorraine has.
Lorraine has 27 small buttons from trading small stickers, 20 large buttons from trading large stickers, and 60 small buttons from trading the remaining large stickers. 
Total buttons = 27 + 20 + 60 = 107 buttons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{107}$"

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as x. Since the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, the number of votes in favor can be represented as 2x.

We know that the total number of people on the council is 33. Since each person can only vote either for or against the regulation, the sum of the votes in favor and against the regulation should equal 33.

So, we can set up the equation: x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms: 3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3: x = 11

Now that we know the number of votes against the regulation is 11, we can find the number of votes in favor by multiplying x by 2: 2x = 2(11) = 22

The final answer is: 22"

"To find the total number of hours the 20 playlists will last, we need to multiply the number of songs in each playlist by the number of playlists and then multiply the result by the length of each song in hours.

First, we multiply the number of songs in each playlist by the number of playlists: 
300 songs/playlist * 20 playlists = 6000 songs

Next, we multiply the total number of songs by the length of each song in hours:
6000 songs * 10 hours/song = 60,000 hours

The total number of hours the 20 playlists will last is 60,000 hours.

"To find the number of people who think horse #12 will win, we first need to find the number of people who think horse #2 will win and then subtract that from the total number of people. After that, we can find the number of people who think horse #7 will win and subtract that from the remaining people to find the number of people who think horse #12 will win.

First, let's find 20% of 50 people who think horse #2 will win:
20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 people

Now, we subtract the number of people who think horse #2 will win from the total number of people:
50 - 10 = 40 people

Next, we find 60% of the remaining people who think horse #7 will win:
60% of 40 = 0.60 * 40 = 24 people

Now, we subtract the number of people who think horse #7 will win from the remaining people:
40 - 24 = 16 people

Therefore, 16 people think that horse #12 will win.

"To find the total number of puppies Jana has, we need to work backwards from the information given about the Pomeranian girls.

We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. 

Let's set up an equation to represent this: 
1/3 * Total Pomeranians = 6

To find the total number of Pomeranians, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to isolate Total Pomeranians:
Total Pomeranians = 6 * 3
Total Pomeranians = 18

Now that we know there are 18 Pomeranians, we can use the information that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians to set up another equation:
2/3 * Total Puppies = 18

To find the total number of puppies, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3/2 to isolate Total Puppies:
Total Puppies = 18 * (3/2)
Total Puppies = 27

"To find out how much more Jayden needs to buy the camera, we first need to calculate how much money he has after Ava gives him her allowance. 

Jayden initially has $70. Ava gives him half of her $90 allowance, which is $90 / 2 = $45. 

So, Jayden now has $70 + $45 = $115.

The camera costs $200. To find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the amount he has from the cost of the camera: $200 - $115 = $85.

Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera.

"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a ratio of the number of cases of shingles each house needs. Let's say the first house needs x cases of shingles. Since the second house needs 1/2 of what the first house needs, it will need x/2 cases of shingles. The third house needs double the first house, so it will need 2x cases of shingles.

We know that the total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. We can set up an equation to represent this:

x + (x/2) + 2x = 250

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + x + 4x = 500

Combine like terms:

7x = 500

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 500/7
x = 71.43 (round to two decimal places)

Now that we know the first house needs approximately 71.43 cases of shingles, we can find the number of cases the third house needs by multiplying x by 2:

Third house = 2x
= 2 * 71.43
= 142.86

The third house will need approximately 142.86 cases of shingles.

The final answer is: 142.86"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of each person's purchase and then add them together.

Now, let's add the result to the number of bananas:
200 (bananas) + 90 (additional pears) = 290

Since George has 45% more pears than bananas, the number of pears is 290. To find the total number of fruits, we need to add the number of bananas and pears:
200 (bananas) + 290 (pears) = 490

"To calculate Tanya's earnings, we need to calculate her earnings for each day separately and then sum them up.

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Her base pay for 5 hours is 5 * $15 = $75. Since she teaches more than 3 classes, she gets an additional $5 per day, which is $5. So, her total earnings for Monday are $75 + $5 = $80.

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Her base pay for 2 hours is 2 * $15 = $30. Since she teaches less than or equal to 3 classes, she does not get the additional $5 per day. So, her total earnings for Wednesday are $30.

Now, let's sum up her earnings for both days: $80 (Monday) + $30 (Wednesday) = $110.

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total amount of money Bennet makes from selling the eggplants. 

20 eggplants * $3 each = $60

Since Bennet wants to make a total of $135, we need to find out how much more money he needs to make from selling the corn. 

$135 (total) - $60 (from eggplants) = $75

Now, we need to find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for to make $75 from 25 ears of corn. 

Let's call the price of each ear of corn 'x'. The total amount of money he makes from selling the corn is 25x.

25x = $75

To find the price of each ear of corn, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 25.

x = $75 / 25
x = $3

The final answer is: $3"
"To find the percentage of time Tatiana spends playing soccer, we first need to determine the total time she has available for soccer. 

Total weekend time = 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

Time spent reading = 3 hours

Remaining time = Total weekend time - Time spent reading = 12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours

Time spent playing video games = 1/3 of the remaining time = (1/3) * 9 hours = 3 hours

Time spent playing soccer = Remaining time - Time spent playing video games = 9 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours

Now, we can find the percentage of time spent playing soccer:

Percentage of time spent playing soccer = (Time spent playing soccer / Total weekend time) * 100
= (6 hours / 12 hours) * 100
= 50%

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how many pencils Anthony kept, we need to follow the steps of the problem.

1. Anthony started with 50 pencils and gave 1/2 of them to Brandon. To find out how many pencils he gave to Brandon, we multiply 50 by 1/2:
   50 * (1/2) = 50 * 0.5 = 25 pencils given to Brandon.

2. Now, we need to find out how many pencils Anthony had left after giving 25 to Brandon. We subtract 25 from 50:
   50 - 25 = 25 pencils remaining.

3. Next, Anthony gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. To find out how many pencils he gave to Charlie, we multiply 25 by 3/5:
   25 * (3/5) = 25 * 0.6 = 15 pencils given to Charlie.

4. Finally, we need to find out how many pencils Anthony kept. We subtract the pencils given to Charlie from the remaining pencils:
   25 - 15 = 10 pencils kept by Anthony.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time it takes for him to drive to the museum and back, and then add the time he spends at the museum.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Jack to drive to the museum:

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 150 miles / 75 mph
Time = 2 hours

Since he drives to the museum and back, we need to multiply the time by 2:

Total driving time = 2 hours * 2 = 4 hours

Now, we add the time he spends at the museum to the total driving time:

Total time = Total driving time + Time at the museum
Total time = 4 hours + 6 hours
Total time = 10 hours

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many wheels Henry will need in total, we first need to calculate the total number of wheels required for the cars and the motorcycles.

For the cars, Henry needs 4 wheels for each car, and he has 57 cars. So, the total number of wheels required for the cars is 57 * 4 = 228.

For the motorcycles, Henry needs 2 wheels for each motorcycle, and he has 73 motorcycles. So, the total number of wheels required for the motorcycles is 73 * 2 = 146.

Now, we add the total number of wheels required for the cars and the motorcycles to get the total number of wheels needed: 228 + 146 = 374.

Since Henry has a box with 650 wheels, we subtract the total number of wheels needed from the total number of wheels available to find out how many wheels will be left: 650 - 374 = 276.

The final answer is: 276"
"To find the discount amount, we need to calculate 20% of the original price of the laptop, which is $1000.

20% of $1000 = 0.20 * $1000 = $200

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the final price:

$1000 - $200 = $800

So, you have to pay $800 after the 20% discount.

The final answer is: $800"
"To find the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection, we need to calculate the cost of the movies in series, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the remaining movies.

First, let's find the number of movies in series. A third of the movies are in series, so we multiply 600 by 1/3 (which is the same as 0.33).

600 * 0.33 = 198 movies in series

Since Mike can buy these series movies for $6 each, the total cost of the series movies is:

198 * $6 = $1188

Next, let's find the number of older movies. 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so we first need to find the number of remaining movies. We subtract the number of series movies from the total number of movies:

600 - 198 = 402 remaining movies

Then, we find 40% of the remaining movies:

402 * 0.4 = 160 older movies

Since the older movies cost $5 each, the total cost of the older movies is:

160 * $5 = $800

Now, we need to find the number of remaining movies that are not in series and not older movies. We subtract the number of series movies and older movies from the total number of movies:

600 - 198 - 160 = 242 remaining movies

Since a normal movie costs $10, the total cost of the remaining movies is:

242 * $10 = $2420

Finally, we add the cost of the series movies, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the remaining movies to find the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection:

$1188 + $800 + $2420 = $5408

The final answer is: $5408"
"To find the total amount Winston spent on fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then add them together.

The cost of peaches is 6 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $12.00
The cost of plums is 8 pounds * $1.00 per pound = $8.00
The cost of apricots is 6 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $18.00

Now, let's add the costs together: $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00

The final answer is: $38.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the total distance traveled by the Llesis family. 

First, let's find the speed at which they hiked. They drove at an average of 50 miles per hour, and they hiked an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their speed when they drove. 

Half of 50 miles per hour is 25 miles per hour. 5 miles per hour less than that is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

Now, we know they hiked at 20 miles per hour for 1.5 hours. The distance they hiked is speed * time, which is 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

Next, we need to find the distance they drove. They drove for 6 hours at 50 miles per hour. The distance they drove is speed * time, which is 50 * 6 = 300 miles.

The total distance to their vacation spot is the sum of the distance they drove and the distance they hiked, which is 300 + 30 = 330 miles.

The final answer is: 330"
"To find the difference in their scores, we need to set up an equation representing the scores of Ava and Emma. Let's denote the number of enemies Emma jumps on as E, the number of berries she collects as B, and the time she finishes the level as T.

Emma's score = 10E + 5B + 30T

Since Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, we can represent the number of enemies Ava jumps on as E + 8.

Ava's score = 10(E + 8) + 5(B + 3) + 30(T - 4)

Simplifying the equation for Ava's score:
Ava's score = 10E + 80 + 5B + 15 + 30T - 120
Ava's score = 10E + 5B + 30T - 25

Now, we need to find the difference between their scores:
Difference = Ava's score - Emma's score
Difference = (10E + 5B + 30T - 25) - (10E + 5B + 30T)
Difference = -25

The final answer is: $\boxed{-25}$"
"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we first need to find the total cost of the two pizzas that are already known. 

The cost of two pizzas is 30 dollars each, so the total cost of these two pizzas is 2 x 30 = 60 dollars.

Now, we subtract the cost of these two pizzas from the total cost of all four pizzas to find the cost of the other two pizzas. 

Total cost of all four pizzas = 64 dollars
Cost of two known pizzas = 60 dollars
Cost of the other two pizzas = Total cost of all four pizzas - Cost of two known pizzas
Cost of the other two pizzas = 64 - 60
Cost of the other two pizzas = 4 dollars

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the cost of the other two pizzas by 2 to find the cost of each pizza.

Cost of each pizza = Cost of the other two pizzas / 2
Cost of each pizza = 4 / 2
Cost of each pizza = 2 dollars

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week, we need to calculate the number of times they ride on usual days and the number of times they ride on the two extra days.

On usual days, they ride their bikes 3 times a day for 5 days. So, the total number of times they ride on usual days is 3 * 5 = 15.

On the two extra days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, which is 2 * 3 = 6 times a day. Since there are two extra days, the total number of times they ride on these days is 6 * 2 = 12.

Now, we add the total number of times they ride on usual days and the extra days to get the total number of times they ride in a week: 15 + 12 = 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a system of equations. Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought at the store as 'w' and the number of orange fish he bought as 'o'.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After buying 'w' white fish and 'o' orange fish, he had a total of 7 + w + o fish in the pond.

We are given that the total number of fish in the pond after buying more fish is 7 + w + o. We also know that the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish, so we can write the equation:

3 + o = 2(4 + w)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3 + o = 8 + 2w

Subtracting 3 from both sides, we get:

o = 5 + 2w

We also know that the total number of fish in the pond is 17 more than the initial number of fish, so we can write the equation:

7 + w + o = 7 + 17

Simplifying the equation, we get:

w + o = 17

Substituting the expression for o from the previous equation, we get:

w + 5 + 2w = 17

Combine like terms:

3w + 5 = 17

Subtract 5 from both sides:

3w = 12

Divide both sides by 3:

w = 4

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To calculate the weekly fuel consumption, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in a week and then divide it by the fuel efficiency of the car.

The distance between home and office is 5 miles, and since Andy travels to and from work, the total distance per day is 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles.

Since Andy works from Monday to Friday, the total distance traveled in a week is 10 miles/day * 5 days = 50 miles/week.

Now, we can calculate the fuel consumption by dividing the total distance by the fuel efficiency:

Fuel consumption = Total distance / Fuel efficiency
Fuel consumption = 50 miles/week / 10 MPG
Fuel consumption = 5 gallons/week

To calculate the weekly cost, we multiply the fuel consumption by the price of gas:

Weekly cost = Fuel consumption * Price of gas
Weekly cost = 5 gallons/week * $3/gallon
Weekly cost = $15/week

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the total amount of money Carrie spent, we need to calculate the value of the quarters and the value of the twenties she spent, then add them together.

First, let's calculate the value of the quarters. Since there are 10 twenties, Carrie has 10 * 20 = 200 dollars in twenties. However, she spent 3/5 of the twenties, which is 3/5 * 200 = 120 dollars. This means she has 200 - 120 = 80 dollars left from the twenties.

Now, let's calculate the value of the quarters. Carrie has 140 quarters. Since each quarter is worth 0.25 dollars, the total value of the quarters is 140 * 0.25 = 35 dollars.

Now, let's add the value of the quarters and the value of the remaining twenties to find the total amount of money she spent. 35 + 80 = 115 dollars.

The final answer is: $115"
"To find the total number of fruits, we need to calculate the total number of tomatoes and the total number of eggplants separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total number of tomatoes: 
5 tomato plants * 22 tomatoes per plant = 5 * 22 = 110 tomatoes

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggplants: 
8 eggplant plants * 4 eggplants per plant = 8 * 4 = 32 eggplants

Now, let's add the total number of tomatoes and eggplants together: 
110 tomatoes + 32 eggplants = 142 fruits

The final answer is: 142"
"To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we first need to find the total fraction of TVs that are not OLED. 

One-fourth of the TVs are smart TVs, which is 1/4. One-eighth of the TVs are analog TVs, which is 1/8. To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 8. 

1/4 = 2/8 (multiply numerator and denominator by 2)
1/8 remains the same.

Now we can add the fractions: 2/8 + 1/8 = 3/8. This is the fraction of TVs that are not OLED.

Since the rest are OLED TVs, we subtract this fraction from 1 (which represents the whole): 1 - 3/8.

To subtract 3/8 from 1, we can convert 1 to 8/8 (multiply numerator and denominator by 8) and then subtract: 8/8 - 3/8 = 5/8.

Now we know that 5/8 of the TVs are OLED. To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we multiply 5/8 by the total number of TVs sold, which is 40.

5/8 * 40 = (5 * 40) / 8 = 200 / 8 = 25

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how much money John is missing, we need to first determine how much the school will cover. Since the school is covering half the cost of the trip, we can calculate this as:

Total cost of the trip: $300
School's contribution: $300 / 2 = $150

Now, we know that John has $50. To find out how much more money he needs, we subtract the amount he has from the total cost of the trip minus the school's contribution:

Total cost of the trip minus school's contribution: $300 - $150 = $150
Amount John is missing: $150 - $50 = $100

"To solve this problem, we need to find out the temperature at night and then determine how many logs Carson needs to burn to reach 32 degrees.

First, let's find the temperature at night:
Temperature at night = Temperature during the day - 33 degrees
Temperature at night = 45 - 33
Temperature at night = 12 degrees

Since the temperature at night is 12 degrees, and the house needs to be at least 32 degrees to prevent the pipes from freezing, Carson needs to heat the house by 32 - 12 = 20 degrees.

Each log of wood heats the house by 5 degrees, so to heat the house by 20 degrees, Carson needs to burn:
Number of logs = Total temperature increase / Temperature increase per log
Number of logs = 20 / 5
Number of logs = 4

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many groups were formed and then calculate the number of seashells brought by 3/5 of those groups.

First, let's find the number of groups formed. Since 90 people were split into 9-person groups, we can divide 90 by 9 to get the number of groups:

90 ÷ 9 = 10

So, there were 10 groups in total.

Now, we need to find out how many groups had members bring back 2 seashells each. Since 3/5 of the groups did this, we can multiply the total number of groups by 3/5:

10 * (3/5) = 6

So, 6 groups had members bring back 2 seashells each.

Now, we need to find out how many seashells these 6 groups brought. Since each group brought 2 seashells, we can multiply the number of groups by 2:

6 * 2 = 12

Therefore, the total number of seashells brought by the groups is 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the number of people on the train after the two stops, we need to perform two subtractions and one addition.

Initially, there are 172 people on the train.

At the first stop, 47 people get off, so we subtract 47 from 172:
172 - 47 = 125

Then, 13 people get on the train, so we add 13 to 125:
125 + 13 = 138

At the next stop, 38 people get off, so we subtract 38 from 138:
138 - 38 = 100

Therefore, there are 100 people on the train.

The final answer is: 100"

"To calculate Jamie's total pay for the day, we need to calculate her regular pay and her overtime pay separately.

Her regular pay is for 8 hours at $20 per hour, so her regular pay is 8 * $20 = $160.

Her overtime pay is for 3 hours (11 - 8 = 3) at 150% of her regular hourly rate. First, we need to calculate her overtime hourly rate: 150% of $20 is 1.5 * $20 = $30 per hour.

Her overtime pay is 3 * $30 = $90.

Her total pay is the sum of her regular pay and her overtime pay: $160 + $90 = $250.

The original price of the jeans is $40. 
The discount is 25% of $40, which is calculated as: 
Discount = 25% of $40 = 0.25 * $40 = $10

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the sale price:
Sale price = Original price - Discount
Sale price = $40 - $10
Sale price = $30

Since Mike pays with a $50 bill, we subtract the sale price from the $50 bill to find out how much money he will have left over:
Amount left over = $50 - $30
Amount left over = $20

The final answer is: $20"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to first calculate the total number of employees after three months and then multiply it by the monthly salary of each employee.

The company starts with 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. So, after one month, the total number of employees will be 200 + 20 = 220. After two months, the total number of employees will be 220 + 20 = 240. After three months, the total number of employees will be 240 + 20 = 260.

Now, we multiply the total number of employees after three months (260) by the monthly salary of each employee ($4000).

Total amount = 260 * 4000
Total amount = 1040000

The final answer is: $1040000"
"To find the total time the choir will be caroling, we need to add the time it takes to sing ""Deck the Halls"" twice and the time it takes to sing ""Jingle Bells"" once.

First, let's calculate the total time for ""Deck the Halls"":
150 seconds (length of ""Deck the Halls"") * 2 (number of times sung) = 300 seconds

Next, let's add the time for ""Jingle Bells"":
300 seconds (total time for ""Deck the Halls"") + 240 seconds (length of ""Jingle Bells"") = 540 seconds

The choir will be caroling for 540 seconds.

"To find out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we need to calculate their total earnings after working 20 hours.

Billy's initial hourly wage is $10. After 2 months, he gets a raise of $0.50 per hour, making his new hourly wage $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. After another year, he gets a raise of $1.00 per hour, making his final hourly wage $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50.

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's initial salary, so her hourly wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50.

Now, let's calculate their total earnings after working 20 hours:

Billy's total earnings = 20 hours * $11.50 per hour = $230
Sally's total earnings = 20 hours * $10.50 per hour = $210

The difference in their earnings is $230 - $210 = $20.

The final answer is: $20"
"To find the difference in cost between 3 loaves of bread and 2 bagels, we need to calculate the total cost of each and then subtract the cost of the bagels from the cost of the bread.

The cost of 3 loaves of bread is 3 x $2 = $6.

The cost of 2 bagels is 2 x $1 = $2.

Now, we subtract the cost of the bagels from the cost of the bread: $6 - $2 = $4.

The final answer is: $4"
"To find Nikita's score, we need to calculate half of Pierson's score and then add 11. 

Pierson's score is 278. Half of 278 is 278 / 2 = 139. 

Nikita scored 11 more than half of Pierson's score, so Nikita's score is 139 + 11 = 150.

Now, we need to find the total score of Pierson and Nikita. 

Pierson's score is 278 and Nikita's score is 150. 

Total score = Pierson's score + Nikita's score = 278 + 150 = 428

The final answer is: 428"
"To find the total number of trees planted, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the students. There are 40 classes with an average of 25 students per class. So, the total number of students is 40 * 25 = 1000.

Since each student plants 1 tree, the total number of trees planted by the students is 1000.

Next, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the teachers. There are 40 classes with an average of 3 teachers per class. So, the total number of teachers is 40 * 3 = 120.

Since each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by the teachers is 120 * 2 = 240.

Now, we add the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers to get the total number of trees planted. Total trees = 1000 (students) + 240 (teachers) = 1240.

The final answer is: 1240"
"To find out how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we first need to find the total number of stuffed animals she currently has. 

She has 3 puppies, 5 koalas, 2 zebras, and 4 frogs. 

Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Now, we need to find 30% of 14. 

30% of 14 = (30/100) * 14 = 0.3 * 14 = 4.2

Since we can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, we'll round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can buy 4.2 stuffed goats, but we'll round up to 5 stuffed goats to ensure the percentage is at least 30%.

So, Bubbles should buy 5 stuffed goats.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many hours Kris has played, we need to calculate the total hours she played in 2 weeks and 1 week.

In 2 weeks, there are 14 days. If Kris plays for half an hour every day, the total hours played in 2 weeks is 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours.

In 1 week, there are 7 days. If Kris plays for 2 hours every day, the total hours played in 1 week is 7 * 2 = 14 hours.

The total hours Kris has played is 7 + 14 = 21 hours.

To find out how many hours Kris still needs to play, we subtract the total hours played from the target hours: 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time.

The first car travels at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel:
Distance = Speed x Time = 60 miles/hour x 2 hours = 120 miles

The second car travels at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel:
Distance = Speed x Time = 70 miles/hour x 2 hours = 140 miles

Since the second car was initially passing the first car, we need to find the distance between them after 2 hours. The second car has traveled 20 miles further than the first car in 2 hours (140 - 120 = 20 miles). 

Therefore, the distance between the two cars after 2 hours will be 20 miles.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost James paid, we need to calculate the premium first. The premium is 30% of the total cost of the diamond and gold, which is $600 + $300 = $900.

The premium is 30% of $900, which is 0.3 x $900 = $270.

Now, we add the premium to the total cost of the diamond and gold: $900 + $270 = $1170.

So, James paid $1170 for the ring.

The final answer is: $1170"
"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students. 

First, let's find the number of students who passed in each grade level:
- Third grade: 340 students passed
- Fourth grade: 40 students passed
- Fifth grade: Since the pass rate for the fifth grade is twice the pass rate of the fourth grade, and the fourth grade has a pass rate of 40/100 = 0.4, the fifth grade's pass rate is 2 * 0.4 = 0.8. The number of students who passed in the fifth grade is 0.8 * 400 = 320.

Now, let's find the total number of students who passed: 340 + 40 + 320 = 700.

Next, let's find the total number of students: 500 (third grade) + 100 (fourth grade) + 400 (fifth grade) = 1000.

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students: 700 / 1000 = 0.7.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.7 * 100 = 70%.

The final answer is: 70"
"To find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we first need to determine how many square inches of mosaic he can make with the glass chips he has. 

Since it takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic, and each bag holds 72 chips, we can calculate the total number of chips Milo has: 2 bags * 72 chips per bag = 144 chips.

Now, we need to find out how many square inches of mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make 1 square inch, we divide the total number of chips by 12: 144 chips / 12 chips per square inch = 12 square inches.

Since the mosaic is three inches tall, and we know the area of the mosaic (12 square inches), we can find the length by dividing the area by the height: 12 square inches / 3 inches = 4 inches.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total amount of tea consumed, we need to calculate the amount each group of students drank and add them together. 

Four students drank 1.5 quarts each, so the total amount they drank is 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts. 

16 students drank 2 quarts each, so the total amount they drank is 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

The total amount of tea consumed is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we need to convert the total amount of tea consumed from quarts to gallons. 

38 quarts / 4 quarts per gallon = 9.5 gallons.

To find the initial amount of tea, we need to add the amount left to the amount consumed. 

Initial amount = 10 quarts (left) + 38 quarts (consumed) = 48 quarts.

Now, convert the initial amount from quarts to gallons.

48 quarts / 4 quarts per gallon = 12 gallons.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to first determine how many candies he has in total. 

Dale initially ordered 100 candies. He then sold 150 candies. To find out how many candies he has left, we subtract the number of candies sold from the initial number of candies:

100 (initial candies) - 150 (candies sold) = -50

Since we can't have a negative number of candies, this means that Dale doesn't have any candies left from the initial order. However, he then ordered 100 more candies. So, he now has 100 candies.

To find out how many more candies Dale needs to sell, we need to add the initial number of candies he ordered to the number of candies he ordered later:

100 (initial order) + 100 (additional order) = 200

Now, we know that Dale has 200 candies in total. He needs to sell all of them. Since he has already sold 150 candies, we subtract the number of candies sold from the total number of candies:

200 (total candies) - 150 (candies sold) = 50

Dale still needs to sell 50 candies to sell all of his candy.

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students at the end of each month and then subtract the initial number of students from it.

At the beginning of the year, there are 10 students.

- At the end of January, the number of students doubles, so there are 10 * 2 = 20 students.
- At the end of February, the number of students doubles again, so there are 20 * 2 = 40 students.
- At the end of March, the number of students doubles again, so there are 40 * 2 = 80 students.
- At the end of April, the number of students doubles again, so there are 80 * 2 = 160 students.
- At the end of May, the number of students doubles again, so there are 160 * 2 = 320 students.

Now, let's subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May to find the additional students who joined: 320 - 10 = 310.

The final answer is: 310"
"To find the total number of branches Felix climbed, we need to divide the total amount of money he made ($105) by the cost per branch ($0.25).

Total money made: $105
Cost per branch: $0.25

Total branches climbed = Total money made / Cost per branch
Total branches climbed = $105 / $0.25
Total branches climbed = 420

Since Felix worked during the week (7 days), we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day.

Average branches per day = Total branches climbed / Number of days
Average branches per day = 420 / 7
Average branches per day = 60

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the total number of petals, we need to calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers and then subtract the petals that were dropped.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers:

- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 x 5 = 15 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 x 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 x 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 x 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add up the total number of petals: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 petal from each set of flowers, we need to subtract 4 petals (1 from each set) from the total: 101 - 4 = 97 petals

The final answer is: 97"
"To find out how many marshmallows are left in the bag, we need to subtract the total number of marshmallows used by John and DeSean, and the ones they dropped on the ground from the initial number of marshmallows.

Total marshmallows used by John and DeSean = 9 (John) + 9 (DeSean) = 18
Total marshmallows dropped on the ground = 3
Total marshmallows used or dropped = 18 + 3 = 21

Initial number of marshmallows = 35
Marshmallows left in the bag = 35 - 21 = 14

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, the number of S'mores each kid can have is equal to the number of marshmallows left in the bag divided by 2 (since there are two kids).

Number of S'mores each kid can have = 14 / 2 = 7

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total amount of money used, we need to calculate the total time each person plays and then multiply it by the cost per minute.

Jack plays for 4 hours, which is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes. Since he can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter, the number of quarters he uses is 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.

One of his friends plays for half as long as Jack, so they play for 240 / 2 = 120 minutes. Since they can play for half as long as Jack, the number of quarters they use is 120 / 20 = 6 quarters.

The other two friends play for half as long as the first friend, so they play for 120 / 2 = 60 minutes. Since they can play for half as long as Jack, the number of quarters they use is 60 / 20 = 3 quarters each.

The total number of quarters used by the two friends who play half as long is 6 + 6 = 12 quarters.

The total number of quarters used by the friend who plays 1.5 times as long is 240 / (20 * 1.5) = 240 / 30 = 8 quarters.

The total number of quarters used by all friends is 12 + 12 + 8 = 32 quarters.

The total amount of money used is 32 quarters, which is equal to 32 / 4 = 8 dollars.

The final answer is: $8"
"To solve this problem, we can start by assigning variables to the unknown quantities. Let's say the amount of citrus zest (and fragrance) is z, the amount of salt (and sugar) is s, and the amount of oil is o.

We are given the following information:

- The amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance, so z = fragrance.
- The amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, so s = sugar.
- The amount of oil is twice as much as the amount of salt, so o = 2s.
- The amount of salt is twice as much as the amount of citrus zest, so s = 2z.

We can use the last two equations to express o and s in terms of z. Since s = 2z and o = 2s, we can substitute s = 2z into the equation for o to get o = 2(2z) = 4z.

Now we know that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, and it is made up of z (citrus zest), s (salt), s (sugar), o (oil), and z (fragrance). Since the amount of salt and sugar is the same, and the amount of citrus zest and fragrance is the same, we can combine the z and s terms to get 2z + s + o. 

We know that o = 4z, so we can substitute this into the equation to get 2z + s + 4z. We also know that s = 2z, so we can substitute this into the equation to get 2z + 2z + 4z = 8z.

Since the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, we can set up the equation 8z = 10 to solve for z.

8z = 10
z = 10/8
z = 1.25

Now that we know z, we can find o by substituting z into the equation o = 4z. 

o = 4(1.25)
o = 5

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To find the total amount of money John spent, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows separately and then add them together.

The cost of the goats is 3 x $500 = $1500.
The cost of the cows is 2 x $1500 = $3000.

Now, we add the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows together: $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

The final answer is: $4500"
"To find out how many more cupcakes Paul needs to buy, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs.

Paul needs 63 cupcakes in total. He already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes, so the total number of cupcakes he has is 8 + 40 = 48.

Now, we subtract the number of cupcakes he has from the total number of cupcakes he needs: 63 - 48 = 15.

So, Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes.

The final answer is: 15"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many cars Joe has. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

Joe sells 20% of his cars, which is 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars. 

After selling 8 cars, Joe is left with 40 - 8 = 32 cars.

He then gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold, which is 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

So, after giving away 16 cars, Joe is left with 32 - 16 = 16 cars.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to first determine the total amount raised by the students. Since the charity raised a total of $175,000 and $50,000 came from organizations, we can subtract the amount from organizations from the total to find the amount raised by the students.

Total amount raised by students = Total amount raised by charity - Amount raised by organizations
Total amount raised by students = $175,000 - $50,000
Total amount raised by students = $125,000

Now, we know that 20 students raised a total of $125,000. To find out how much each student raised, we can divide the total amount raised by the number of students.

Amount raised by each student = Total amount raised by students / Number of students
Amount raised by each student = $125,000 / 20
Amount raised by each student = $6,250

The final answer is: $6,250"
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the first day and the second day, and then add them together.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. 

On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she walked on the first day, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

To find the total time in minutes, we need to convert the hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

8 hours = 8 x 60 = 480 minutes
4 hours = 4 x 60 = 240 minutes

Now, we add the time from both days:
480 minutes + 240 minutes = 720 minutes

The final answer is: 720"
"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, we need to find the total number of cars in the parking lot after the first break. Initially, there were 50 cars, and 20 more cars arrived during the first break. So, the total number of cars after the first break is 50 + 20 = 70.

2. When Hunter got out of class for the lunch break, he realized that 1/2 the number of cars in the parking lot had gone. This means that 1/2 of 70 cars left the parking lot. To find the number of cars that left, we need to divide 70 by 2. 70 / 2 = 35 cars left the parking lot.

3. Since 35 cars left the parking lot, the number of cars remaining in the parking lot is 70 - 35 = 35.

4. However, the question asks for the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break. This means we need to find the number of cars that were present in the parking lot when Hunter got out of class for the lunch break, which is 70.

So, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is 70.

The final answer is: 70"
"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of tasks he completes in a day and then multiply it by the number of days he works in a week.

John does 30 cycles of work a day, and each cycle has 5 different tasks. So, the total number of tasks he completes in a day is:
30 cycles/day * 5 tasks/cycle = 150 tasks/day

Since each task pays $1.20, the total amount John makes in a day is:
150 tasks/day * $1.20/task = $180/day

John works a full 7-day week, so the total amount he makes in a week is:
$180/day * 7 days = $1260

"To find the total points Sasha scored in both games, we need to calculate her points in each game and add them together.

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. 

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points in the first game. Therefore, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

To find the total points Sasha scored, we add her points from both games: 14 + 4 = 18.

"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a system of linear equations based on the given information.

Let's denote the number of cards that PJ has as x. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know that the total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find the number of cards that Smendrick has:

Smendrick has 3x = 3(47) = 141 cards

And Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color of eggs and then add them together.

Cindy had 5 green eggs. 
She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.
She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.
She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had (1/3) * 9 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add the number of eggs of each color together: 
5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27

"To calculate the total shipping cost, we need to calculate the cost per pound and the cost per mile, then add them together. 

The cost per pound is $0.35 per pound, and the book weighs 4 pounds, so the cost for the weight is 4 * $0.35 = $1.40.

The cost per mile is $0.08 per mile, and the book needs to be returned 20 miles, so the cost for the distance is 20 * $0.08 = $1.60.

The total shipping cost is $1.40 + $1.60 = $2.99.

The book's purchase price is $32, and Amazon will only refund 75% of it, so the refund amount is $32 * 0.75 = $24.

To find out how much Milly will lose, we need to subtract the refund amount from the total shipping cost. 

The total loss is $2.99 - $24 = -$21.91. However, since you can't lose a negative amount of money, we need to recalculate the loss by subtracting the shipping cost from the refund amount.

The loss is $24 - $2.99 = $21.01.

The final answer is: $21.01"

"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the total production for the first three weeks and then subtract that from the total monthly production.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars.
In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.
In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Total production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in a month, we subtract the total production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production to find the production for the fourth week:
50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000

- Mirrors: 6 (additional) + 4 (initial) = 10
- Chandeliers: 2 (additional) + 1 (initial) = 3
- Pictures: 20 (additional) + 10 (initial) = 30

Now, let's calculate the total number of additional items: 10 (mirrors) + 3 (chandeliers) + 30 (pictures) = 43

The cost for the additional items is $15.00 per item, so the total cost for the additional items is 43 * $15.00 = $645.00

Now, let's add the base cost and the cost for the additional items: $129.00 + $645.00 = $774.00

The total cost for Angela will be $774.00."
"To find out how much money Roy has, we need to first determine how much money Anthony has. Since Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, and Eva has saved $20.00, we can calculate Anthony's savings as follows:

Anthony's savings = Eva's savings + $10.00
Anthony's savings = $20.00 + $10.00
Anthony's savings = $30.00

Now that we know Anthony's savings, we can calculate Roy's savings. Since Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony, we can calculate Roy's savings as follows:

Let's assume Anthony's savings is 100%. Then, Roy's savings will be 140% of Anthony's savings (100% + 40% more).
Roy's savings = 1.4 * Anthony's savings
Roy's savings = 1.4 * $30.00
Roy's savings = $42.00

The final answer is: $42.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the ratio of Naruto's lifting ability to Pompei's lifting ability. 

First, we know that Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay's lifting ability is 12 times that of Pompei. 

Next, Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami's lifting ability is 4 * 12 = 48 times that of Pompei.

Finally, Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto's lifting ability is 10 * 48 = 480 times that of Pompei.

Since Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, Naruto can lift a mountain 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches). 

480 / 12 = 40 feet.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the total distance traveled by Mason, we need to calculate the distance covered in the first 4 hours and the distance covered in the next 6 hours, and then add them together.

Distance covered in the first 4 hours = Speed x Time = 8 miles/hour x 4 hours = 32 miles

Distance covered in the next 6 hours = Speed x Time = 8 miles/hour x 6 hours = 48 miles

Total distance traveled = Distance covered in the first 4 hours + Distance covered in the next 6 hours
= 32 miles + 48 miles
= 80 miles

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the speed of the kangaroos. Since they travel at the same speed, we can divide the total time by the number of kangaroos to find the time it takes for one kangaroo to travel across the highway.

Time taken by one kangaroo = Total time / Number of kangaroos
Time taken by one kangaroo = 18 hours / 3
Time taken by one kangaroo = 6 hours

Now, we know that the turtles travel at half the speed of a kangaroo. Let's denote the speed of a kangaroo as 's'. Then, the speed of a turtle is 's/2'.

Since speed = distance / time, we can set up a proportion to relate the time taken by the kangaroo and the turtle:

Time taken by one turtle = Time taken by one kangaroo * (Speed of kangaroo / Speed of turtle)
Time taken by one turtle = 6 hours * (s / (s/2))
Time taken by one turtle = 6 hours * 2
Time taken by one turtle = 12 hours

Now, we need to find the time taken by four turtles. Since they travel at the same speed, we can divide the time taken by one turtle by the number of turtles:

Time taken by four turtles = Time taken by one turtle / Number of turtles
Time taken by four turtles = 12 hours / 4
Time taken by four turtles = 3 hours

The final answer is: 3"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many dishes Jada and Rory made. 

Since Kora made 20 dishes, and Rory made 20 more than Kora, Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.

Jada made twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

Now, we need to find the total number of dishes they made together. To do this, we add the number of dishes made by Kora, Rory, and Jada: 20 + 40 + 80 = 140.

The final answer is: 140"
"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has after receiving her payment and her mom's contribution.

First, let's calculate the price of the new laptop after trading in her old one: 
$600 (original price) - $200 (discount) = $400

Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, so she must have $400 - $50 = $350.

She received $150 from her part-time job and $80 from her mom, so the total amount of money she received is $150 + $80 = $230.

Now, let's subtract the total amount she received from the total amount she needs to buy the laptop:
$350 (amount needed) - $230 (amount received) = $120

This means Erika already had $120 in her purse before receiving her payment and her mom's contribution.

The final answer is: $120"
"To find the total number of apple slices, we first need to calculate the total number of slices from the large and small apples. 

3 large apples can be sliced into 3 x 5 = 15 slices. 
5 small apples can be sliced into 5 x 3 = 15 slices.

Now, we add the total number of slices from the large and small apples: 15 + 15 = 30 slices.

Adam eats 15 slices, so we subtract 15 from the total number of slices: 30 - 15 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how many cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to calculate the total amount of milk the farmer currently gets from his 3 cows. 

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the total amount of milk from 3 cows is 3 * 5 = 15 liters.

Now, we need to find out how many more cows are needed to produce 25 liters of milk a day. We can do this by subtracting the current total milk production from the desired milk production: 25 - 15 = 10 liters.

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, we need to divide the additional milk required by the milk produced per cow to find out how many more cows are needed: 10 / 5 = 2.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the remaining length of each glue stick and add them together.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, which is 1/6 of the original length of 12 millimeters. To find the remaining length, we multiply 12 by 1/6:
12 * (1/6) = 12/6 = 2 millimeters

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, which is 2/3 of the original length of 12 millimeters. To find the remaining length, we multiply 12 by 2/3:
12 * (2/3) = 24/3 = 8 millimeters

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, which is 1/2 of the original length of 12 millimeters. To find the remaining length, we multiply 12 by 1/2:
12 * (1/2) = 12/2 = 6 millimeters

Now, we add the remaining lengths of the three glue sticks together:
2 + 8 + 6 = 16 millimeters

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 16 millimeters.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much money Gabriel still needs, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has and subtract it from the total cost of the car and the phone.

Gabriel has $5000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200, so he has a total of $5000 + $200 = $5200.

The total cost of the car and the phone is $10000 + $800 = $10800.

Now, let's subtract the amount Gabriel has from the total cost: $10800 - $5200 = $5600.

So, Gabriel still needs $5600 to buy the car and the phone.

The final answer is: $5600"
"To find the change, we need to subtract the cost of the hat from the total amount Thea gave the craftsman. 

First, let's calculate the total amount Thea gave the craftsman: 4 * $20 = $80.

The change Thea got is $10."
"To find out how much money Craig has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent and subtract it from the initial amount.

Craig has 2 twenty-dollar bills, which is 2 x $20 = $40.

He buys 6 squirt guns for $2 each, so the total cost of squirt guns is 6 x $2 = $12.

He also buys 3 packs of water balloons for $3 each, so the total cost of water balloons is 3 x $3 = $9.

The total amount he spent is $12 + $9 = $21.

Now, let's subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $40 - $21 = $19.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack.
2. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack.
3. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks.

From point 3, we know that if Jack collected 60 dishes, then he collected 60 / 2 = 30 socks.

From point 1, we know that Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has 2 * 30 = 60 socks.

From point 2, we know that Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:

Jack's socks: 30
Jack's dishes: 60
Peter's socks: 60
Peter's dishes: 30

Total number of socks: 30 + 60 = 90
Total number of dishes: 60 + 30 = 90

The total number of socks and dishes they have together is 90 + 90 = 180."
"To find the number of students good at math, we need to consider the students who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English.

We know that 5 students are good at math only. Let's denote the number of students good at both math and English as x.

The total number of students in the class is 20. We also know that 8 students are good at English only. So, the total number of students good at math can be represented as 5 (math only) + x (both math and English).

Since the total number of students is 20, and 8 are good at English only, the remaining students are good at both math and English. Therefore, 20 - 8 = 12 students are good at both math and English.

Now, we can find the total number of students good at math: 5 (math only) + 12 (both math and English) = 17.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the total time available for performances, we need to subtract the intermission time from the total concert duration. 

Total concert duration = 2 hours = 2 * 60 minutes = 120 minutes
Intermission time = 10 minutes
Time available for performances = Total concert duration - Intermission time = 120 - 10 = 110 minutes

Each group requires 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit the stage. So, the total time required for each group = 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes.

Now, we can find the number of groups that can perform in the available time by dividing the time available for performances by the time required for each group.

Number of groups = Time available for performances / Time required for each group = 110 / 10 = 11

The final answer is: 11"
"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest first. 

The formula for simple interest is: 

Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

Given that the principal amount (initial investment) is $300, the rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year, and the time is 3 years, we can plug in the values.

Rate = 3/4 of the principal = (3/4) * 300 = $225 per year

Now, we can calculate the interest for 3 years:
Interest = Principal * Rate * Time
= 300 * 225 * 3
= 225,000

Now, we add the interest to the principal to get the total amount:
Total Amount = Principal + Interest
= 300 + 225,000
= $225,300

The final answer is: $225,300"
"To find the number of white shirts with no collars, we need to find the total number of white shirts and divide it by 2 since half of them have collars. 

Total white shirts = 40
White shirts with collars = 40 / 2 = 20
White shirts with no collars = 40 - 20 = 20

To find the number of floral shirts with no buttons, we need to find the total number of floral shirts and subtract the number of floral shirts with buttons.

Total floral shirts = 50
Floral shirts with buttons = 20
Floral shirts with no buttons = 50 - 20 = 30

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars.

Difference = Floral shirts with no buttons - White shirts with no collars
= 30 - 20

"To find out how much the farmer will earn, we need to first determine how many trays the farmer can fill with 900 eggs. 

Since each tray holds 30 eggs, we can divide the total number of eggs (900) by the number of eggs per tray (30) to find the number of trays.

900 ÷ 30 = 30

So, the farmer can fill 30 trays. 

Now, we need to find out how much the farmer will earn by selling these trays. Since each tray is sold for $2.5, we can multiply the number of trays (30) by the price per tray ($2.5).

30 * $2.5 = $75

The farmer will earn $75."
"To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we need to first calculate the number of goats sold from each farm and then subtract that from the initial number of goats in each farm.

From Farm X, Mr. Smith sold 10 goats. 
From Farm Y, he sold twice as many goats as from Farm X, which is 2 * 10 = 20 goats.

Now, let's calculate the number of goats left in each farm:
- Farm X: 55 - 10 = 45 goats
- Farm Y: 45 - 20 = 25 goats

To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the number of goats left in each farm:

The cost of 3 baskets of red food is 3 x $18 = $54.

The total cost before discount is $75 + $54 = $129.

Since you get $2 off for each basket of red food, the total discount is 3 x $2 = $6.

The total cost after discount is $129 - $6 = $123.

The final numerical answer is: $123"
"To find the number of rooms to be cleaned, we need to calculate one-half of 90 rooms. 

One-half of 90 rooms is 90 / 2 = 45 rooms.

Now, we need to find the total time it takes to clean 45 rooms. It takes 20 minutes to clean each room, so we multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room.

45 rooms * 20 minutes/room = 900 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours

"To solve this problem, let's denote the age of the brother as B, the age of the sister as S, and the age of the person asking the question (you) as Y.

From the given information, we have the following equations:

1. Y = B - 3 (you are three years younger than your brother)
2. Y = S + 2 (you are 2 years older than your sister)
3. M = 3B - 1 (mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age)
4. Y + S + B + M = 87 (the sum of all ages is 87)

We can rewrite equation 1 as B = Y + 3 and equation 2 as S = Y - 2.

Substituting B = Y + 3 into equation 4, we get:
Y + S + (Y + 3) + M = 87

Substituting S = Y - 2 into the above equation, we get:
Y + (Y - 2) + (Y + 3) + M = 87

Combine like terms:
3Y + M + 1 = 87

Now, substitute M = 3B - 1 = 3(Y + 3) - 1 into the above equation:
3Y + (3(Y + 3) - 1) + 1 = 87

Expand and simplify:
3Y + 3Y + 9 - 1 + 1 = 87
6Y + 9 = 87

Subtract 9 from both sides:
6Y = 78

Divide both sides by 6:
Y = 13

"To find out how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks required by the number of glue sticks in each pack.

First, let's calculate the total number of glue sticks needed for 27 students. Since each student needs 2 glue sticks, we multiply the number of students by the number of glue sticks per student:

27 students * 2 glue sticks/student = 54 glue sticks

Now, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks required by the number of glue sticks in each pack, which is 8:

54 glue sticks / 8 glue sticks/pack = 6.75 packs

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure every student gets 2 glue sticks. Rounding up 6.75 to the nearest whole number gives us 7 packs.

So, Mr. Jackson will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water passing through the river at the given point.

Initially, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

On the second day, the amount of water doubles, so it becomes 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.

On the third day, the amount of water increases by 6000 gallons, so it becomes 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

Therefore, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 14000 gallons.

"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of exponential growth with discrete time steps. The formula for exponential growth is given by:

N(t) = N0 * (1 + r)^t

where:
- N(t) is the number of people infected at time t
- N0 is the initial number of people infected (in this case, 10)
- r is the growth rate (in this case, 6 people per day)
- t is the time in days

However, since each person infects 6 others, we need to use the formula for exponential growth with a growth rate that takes into account the number of new infections per person. This is given by:

N(t) = N0 * (1 + r)^t
= N0 * (1 + (r/N0))^t

where r/N0 is the growth rate per person.

Plugging in the values, we get:

N(3) = 10 * (1 + (6/10))^3
= 10 * (1 + 0.6)^3
= 10 * 1.6^3
= 10 * 4.096
= 40.96

So, after three days, approximately 40.96 people are infected."
"To find out how much money Julieta received, we need to calculate 10% of Rafaela's total tips and subtract it from Rafaela's total tips. 

Rafaela received $20 from each of the 40 customers, so her total tips are 40 * $20 = $800.

10% of $800 is 0.1 * $800 = $80.

Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela, so she received $800 - $80 = $720.

To find the total amount of money they received altogether, we add their tips together: $800 + $720 = $1520.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume Claire earns 1 badge per month. Since it takes Amber twice as long to earn a badge than Claire, Amber earns 1/2 badge per month.

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so Wendy earns 3 badges per month.

In a 1-year time frame (12 months), Claire will earn 1 * 12 = 12 badges.

Amber will earn 1/2 * 12 = 6 badges.

Wendy will earn 3 * 12 = 36 badges.

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a 1-year time frame, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns: 36 - 6 = 30.

"To find out how much Paige raised, we need to calculate the total number of slices she baked and sold. 

First, let's find out how many hours she baked. She baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is 5 hours.

Since she can bake 2 loaves per hour, she baked 2 * 5 = 10 loaves in 5 hours.

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so she baked 10 * 8 = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, and she sold all 80 slices. To find the total amount raised, we need to convert the cents to dollars. There are 100 cents in a dollar, so 50 cents is 0.5 dollars.

Now, we multiply the number of slices by the price per slice: 80 * 0.5 = 40 dollars.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find the total number of coins Gretchen has, we need to determine the number of silver coins first. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, and Gretchen has 70 gold coins, we can set up an equation to find the number of silver coins.

Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins can be represented as 'x + 30'. We know that the number of gold coins is 70, so we can set up the equation:

x + 30 = 70

To solve for 'x', we subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:

x = 70 - 30
x = 40

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins. To find the total number of coins, we add the number of gold coins and silver coins:

Total coins = 70 (gold coins) + 40 (silver coins)
Total coins = 110

The final answer is: 110"
"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we first need to determine the total number of burritos given to the students. 

There were 50 students, and each student was given 10 burritos. So, the total number of burritos given to the students is 50 * 10 = 500.

Mr. George ate 20 burritos. 

Now, we need to find the total number of burritos that were given out or eaten. This is the sum of the burritos given to the students and the burritos eaten by Mr. George. So, 500 (given to students) + 20 (eaten by Mr. George) = 520.

The total number of burritos ordered was 600. To find the number of leftover burritos, we subtract the total number of burritos given out or eaten from the total number of burritos ordered. So, 600 (total ordered) - 520 (given out or eaten) = 80.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of green and blue cars. 

Let's start with the number of green cars. We are told that there are 2 fewer green cars than red cars. Since there are 12 red cars, the number of green cars is 12 - 2 = 10.

Next, we are told that there are 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars. Since there are 10 green cars, the number of blue cars is 3 * 10 = 30.

Now, we know the total number of red, green, and blue cars: 12 (red) + 10 (green) + 30 (blue) = 52.

Since the rink has 75 cars in total, the number of yellow cars is 75 - 52 = 23.

"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of books Sofie has as S, the number of books Anne has as A, and the number of books Fawn has as F.

We are given the following information:

1. S + A + F = 85 (Together, they have 85 books)
2. S = A + 25 (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. A = F - 12 (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to get:
(A + 25) + A + F = 85
Combine like terms:
2A + 25 + F = 85

Now, we can substitute the third equation into the above equation to get:
2(F - 12) + 25 + F = 85
Expand and simplify:
2F - 24 + 25 + F = 85
Combine like terms:
3F + 1 = 85

Subtract 1 from both sides:
3F = 84

Divide both sides by 3:
F = 28

"To find the weight of the carrots, we first need to find the weight of the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, we multiply the weight of the potatoes by 2.

Weight of potatoes: 5 pounds
Weight of sweet potatoes = 2 * 5 = 10 pounds

Next, we need to find the weight of the carrots. The carrots weigh 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes, so we subtract 3 from the weight of the sweet potatoes.

Weight of carrots = Weight of sweet potatoes - 3
Weight of carrots = 10 - 3
Weight of carrots = 7 pounds

"To find out how much Greg will spend on Jello, we need to calculate the total number of Jello cups he needs and then multiply that by the cost per box.

First, we need to find out how many boxes of Jello Greg needs. Since each box makes 10 Jello cups and he wants each kid to have 4 cups, we need to calculate the total number of cups needed for 30 kids.

Total cups needed = 30 kids * 4 cups/kid = 120 cups

Since each box makes 10 cups, we need to find out how many boxes are needed:

Number of boxes = Total cups needed / Cups per box = 120 cups / 10 cups/box = 12 boxes

Now, we need to find out the total cost of the Jello. Each box costs $1.25, so:

Total cost = Number of boxes * Cost per box = 12 boxes * $1.25/box = $15

"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we first need to find out how much Keenan spends in a month. Since Madeline pays 60% of the cost, Keenan pays the remaining 40%. 

First, let's find 40% of the total cost: 
40% of $400 = 0.4 * $400 = $160

This is the amount Keenan pays in a month. To find out how much Keenan pays per week, we need to divide the monthly amount by 4 (since there are 4 weeks in a month):
$160 / 4 = $40

The final answer is: $40"
"To find out how many pizza pieces Tobias has eaten so far, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he ate on each day and add them up.

On the first day, he ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces. To find 2/5 of 60, we multiply 60 by 2 and divide by 5:
(2/5) * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

So, on the first day, he ate 24 pieces.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces. To find the remaining pieces after the first two days, we subtract the pieces eaten on the first two days from the total:
60 - 24 - 10 = 26

Now, we need to find 7/13 of 26:
(7/13) * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14

So, on the third day, he ate 14 pieces.

Now, we add up the pieces eaten on each day:
24 + 10 + 14 = 48

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water, we need to first find the cost of one bottle of soda and one bottle of water.

The cost of 7 bottles of soda is $21.00, so the cost of one bottle of soda is $21.00 / 7 = $3.00.

The cost of 4 bottles of water is $8.00, so the cost of one bottle of water is $8.00 / 4 = $2.00.

Now, we can find the total cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water by multiplying the cost of one bottle of soda by 3 and the cost of one bottle of water by 2, then adding the results together.

Cost of 3 bottles of soda = 3 x $3.00 = $9.00
Cost of 2 bottles of water = 2 x $2.00 = $4.00
Total cost = $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00

The final answer is: $13.00"
"To find out how much money David has left, we need to subtract the cost of the bolts from the initial amount of money he has.

"To find Amy's total score, we need to calculate the weighted sum of her scores for each type of question.

First, let's calculate the number of correct answers for each type of question:

- Multiple-choice questions: 80% of 10 questions = 0.8 * 10 = 8 correct answers
- True/false questions: 90% of 20 questions = 0.9 * 20 = 18 correct answers
- Long-answer questions: 60% of 5 questions = 0.6 * 5 = 3 correct answers

Next, let's calculate the total points earned for each type of question:

"To find out how much money Isaias bought the chickens for, we first need to determine how many chickens he plans to sell. Since he has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them, we can calculate the number of chickens he will sell as follows:

Number of chickens to sell = 300 * (3/5)
= 300 * 3 / 5
= 900 / 5
= 180

Now that we know Isaias plans to sell 180 chickens, we can find the total amount of money he will make from selling them at $50 per chicken:

Total money from selling chickens = Number of chickens to sell * Price per chicken
= 180 * $50
= $9000

Since Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000, we can find the total cost of the chickens by subtracting the profit from the total money he will make:

Total cost of chickens = Total money from selling chickens - Profit
= $9000 - $2000
= $7000

Therefore, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for sale for $7000.

The final answer is: $7000"
"To find out how many glasses Micah and Mitchell sold, we need to divide the total number of glasses sold by 2, since they sold an equal number. 

Total glasses sold = 32
Number of people who sold an equal number of glasses = 2 (Micah and Mitchell)
Glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell = Total glasses sold / 2 = 32 / 2 = 16

Since Julie sold 14 glasses, we can find out how many more glasses she sold than Micah by subtracting the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold.

Glasses sold by Julie = 14
Glasses sold by Micah = 16
Difference = Glasses sold by Julie - Glasses sold by Micah = 14 - 16 = -2

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total cost of the original rope and then subtract the cost of the new rope from it.

The original rope is 20 meters long and costs $2 per meter, so the total cost of the original rope is:
20 meters * $2/meter = $40

Now, let's calculate the cost of the new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, but we don't know its length yet. However, we can express the cost of the new rope in terms of its length. Let's call the length of the new rope 'x'. Then, the cost of the new rope is:
x meters * $1.5/meter = $1.5x

Since Sarah plans to use the profit from selling the original rope to buy the new rope, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:
$40 - $1.5x = 0 (since she will have no money left over after buying the new rope)

Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can add $1.5x to both sides of the equation:
$40 = $1.5x

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by $1.5 to solve for x:
x = $40 / $1.5
x = 26.67 meters

Now that we know the length of the new rope, we can calculate its cost:
26.67 meters * $1.5/meter = $40

Since Sarah will have no money left over after buying the new rope, the final answer is:
$0"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Melanie's current age. 

Let's denote Melanie's current age as 'x'. Since in 10 years, she will be 18 years old, we can set up the equation:

x + 10 = 18

Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation gives us:

x = 8

So, Melanie's current age is 8 years.

Now, we need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her present age. Let's denote the number of years as 'y'. We can set up the equation:

8 + y = 3 * 8

Simplifying the equation, we get:

8 + y = 24

Subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation gives us:

y = 16

So, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age in 16 years.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's find the cost of the bacon: 5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total.

Next, we need to find the cost of the chicken. Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so each packet of chicken costs $10 / 5 = $2. Since Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, the total cost of the chicken is 6 * $2 = $12.

The cost of the strawberries is 3 packs * $4 = $12.

The cost of the apples is 7 packs * $2 (since each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is $4 / 2 = $2) = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items: $10 (bacon) + $12 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $48.

Kelly's budget is $65, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget: $65 - $48 = $17.

The final answer is: $17"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total runtime of the final concert, which includes the encore. We know that the encore is 15 minutes long, and the total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes. 

Let's denote the runtime of Elaina's usual concert as 'x'. Since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, the runtime of the final concert is 2x. 

The total runtime of the final concert is the sum of the runtime of the concert and the encore, which is 2x + 15. We are given that this total runtime is 65 minutes. 

We can set up the equation: 2x + 15 = 65.

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. We can do this by subtracting 15 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 65 - 15. 

This simplifies to 2x = 50. 

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for x: x = 50 / 2.

x = 25.

"To find the number of pairs of microphones that can be arranged, we first need to find the total number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs. 

Let's assume the total number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs is x. Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the total number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs is 2x.

However, we know that 20% of the total 50 microphones won't find any space to fit in. This means that 80% of the microphones will be arranged in pairs. 

We can set up the equation: 80% of 50 = 2x

To find 80% of 50, we multiply 50 by 0.8: 
50 * 0.8 = 40

Now we have the equation: 40 = 2x

To find x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:
x = 40 / 2
x = 20

So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

6 * (2/3) = 6 * 2 / 3 = 12 / 3 = 4

Now, let's find the number of birds feeding. There are 3 groups of 8 birds each, so we multiply 3 by 8:
3 * 8 = 24

Now, let's add the number of birds in each group together:
6 + 4 + 24 = 34

"To find the percentage of flowering plants, we first need to find the number of flowering plants. 

One-fourth of the plants are indoor plants, so the number of indoor plants is 100 * (1/4) = 25.

The remaining plants are 100 - 25 = 75.

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants, so the number of outdoor plants is 75 * (2/3) = 50.

The number of flowering plants is 75 - 50 = 25.

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100: (25/100) * 100 = 25%.

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the speeds of the whirligig, thingamabob, and whatchamacallit. 

Let's denote the speed of the thingamabob as 'x'. 

Since a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob, its speed can be represented as 5x.

A whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, so its speed can be represented as x + 11.

We are given that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 11 = 121

To solve for x, we subtract 11 from both sides of the equation:

x = 121 - 11
x = 110

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig by multiplying x by 5:

Speed of whirligig = 5x
= 5 * 110
= 550

The final answer is: 550"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the price of one carrot as 'c'. Since the yogurt is half the price of the salad, the price of the yogurt is 6 / 2 = 3 dollars.

Ellen buys 2 carrots, 1 salad, and 1 yogurt every day, and the total cost is $11. We can write the equation as:

2c + 6 + 3 = 11

Combine the constants on the left side of the equation:

2c + 9 = 11

Subtract 9 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with the variable:

2c = 2

Divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for 'c':

c = 1

The price of one carrot is $1."

"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. Then, the number of times she mowed Kamala's lawn is 3x, and the number of times she mowed Alba's lawn is 5x.

We know that Tasha made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn, so her total earnings from mowing lawns is 6x + 18x + 30x = 54x.

We also know that Tasha made a total of $80 from both lemonade sales and mowing lawns. So, we can set up the equation 54x + y = 80, where y is the amount she made from lemonade sales.

To find the value of y, we need to find the value of x first. Since we know that Tasha made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn, we can set up the equation 6x = 6, which means x = 1.

Now that we have the value of x, we can substitute it into the equation 54x + y = 80 to find the value of y. 54(1) + y = 80, which simplifies to 54 + y = 80. Subtracting 54 from both sides, we get y = 26.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote the number of notebooks Martha had initially as x. Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, the number of notebooks Joseph had is 3x.

Martha bought 5 more notebooks, so the total number of notebooks she has now is x + 5.

We are given that Martha now has a total of 7 notebooks, so we can set up the equation:

x + 5 = 7

Subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation gives us:

x = 2

So Martha initially had 2 notebooks. Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, Joseph had 3(2) = 6 notebooks.

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph. To do this, we subtract the number of notebooks Joseph has from the number of notebooks Martha has:

7 - 6 = 1

So Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph.

"To find the total distance rowed by Dijana and Anis, we first need to determine the distance rowed by Anis. Since Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, we can calculate Anis's distance by adding 1/5 of Dijana's distance to Dijana's distance.

Dijana's distance = 50 miles
Anis's additional distance = 1/5 * 50 = 10 miles
Anis's total distance = Dijana's distance + Anis's additional distance = 50 + 10 = 60 miles

Now, we can find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis by adding their individual distances.

Total distance = Dijana's distance + Anis's distance = 50 + 60 = 110 miles

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. 

Today, Denise read 5 more than as many pages as Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read 5 + 13 = 18 pages today.

So, Denise's total pages read is 10 (yesterday) + 18 (today) = 28 pages.

Daniel's total pages read is 13 (yesterday) + 0 (today) = 13 pages.

The difference between Denise's and Daniel's total pages read is 28 - 13 = 15.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of bowls that can be filled with the leftover soup and then divide that by the number of child-sized bowls.

Since the pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls, we can set up a ratio of adult bowls to child bowls as 4:8 or 1:2. This means that for every 1 adult bowl, there are 2 child bowls.

Since Calvin, his wife, and their two children are eating dinner, there are a total of 4 people. Since each person eats one bowl, there are 4 bowls used for dinner.

Now, we need to find out how many child bowls are equivalent to 4 adult bowls. Since the ratio of adult bowls to child bowls is 1:2, we can multiply the number of adult bowls by 2 to get the equivalent number of child bowls. 

4 adult bowls * 2 child bowls/adult bowl = 8 child bowls

Since there are 8 child bowls equivalent to 4 adult bowls, and there are 8 child bowls in the pot, we can conclude that there are 8 child bowls left over after dinner.

To find out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, we need to divide the number of leftover child bowls by the number of children. 

8 leftover child bowls / 2 children = 4

"To solve this problem, we need to find the amount of material needed for small and large masks separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the amount of material needed for 20 small masks. We know that 4 small masks require 2 yards of material. To find the amount of material needed for 1 small mask, we divide 2 yards by 4 masks:

2 yards / 4 masks = 0.5 yards per mask

Now, we multiply this by 20 to find the amount of material needed for 20 small masks:

0.5 yards/mask * 20 masks = 10 yards

Next, let's find the amount of material needed for 8 large masks. We know that 3 large masks require 2.25 yards of material. To find the amount of material needed for 1 large mask, we divide 2.25 yards by 3 masks:

2.25 yards / 3 masks = 0.75 yards per mask

Now, we multiply this by 8 to find the amount of material needed for 8 large masks:

0.75 yards/mask * 8 masks = 6 yards

Finally, we add the amount of material needed for small and large masks together:

10 yards (small masks) + 6 yards (large masks) = 16 yards

So, the number of blue shoeboxes left is 7 (initial blue shoeboxes) - 3 (used blue shoeboxes) = 4.

The final answer is: 
Blue shoeboxes left: 4
Red shoeboxes left: 6"
"To find out how many books Joseph had initially, we need to determine the number of books Sarah has and then double it. Sarah has 9 books. 

Joseph had twice the number of Sarah's books, so he had 2 * 9 = 18 books initially.

However, Joseph lost 2 books, so we need to subtract 2 from the initial number of books he had. 

18 - 2 = 16

Joseph currently has 16 books. 

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we need to first calculate the number of marbles he gave to Jamie. 

1/5 of 30 marbles is calculated as (1/5) * 30 = 6 marbles. 

So, Dean gave 6 marbles to Jamie and 10 to Donald. 

Now, let's subtract the total marbles given away from the initial number of marbles Dean had: 
30 - (6 + 10) = 30 - 16 = 14

The final answer is: 14"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Duncan's current age as D and Adam's current age as A.

We are given that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. This can be written as:

D - 8 = 2(A - 4)

We are also given that Duncan's current age is 60. So, we can write:

D = 60

Now, we can substitute D = 60 into the first equation:

60 - 8 = 2(A - 4)

Simplifying the equation:

52 = 2A - 8

Adding 8 to both sides:

60 = 2A

Dividing both sides by 2:

30 = A

So, Adam's current age is 30.

To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

30 + 8 = 38

The final answer is: 38"
"To find the total number of acres of Farmer Smith's farm, we need to calculate twice the number of acres of Farmer Brown's farm and then add 100 to it.

Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. Twice that would be 2 * 200 = 400 acres. 

Adding 100 acres to that gives us 400 + 100 = 500 acres for Farmer Smith's farm.

Now, to find the total number of acres of both farms, we add the acres of Farmer Brown's farm to the acres of Farmer Smith's farm: 200 + 500 = 700 acres.

The final answer is: 700"
"To find out how much Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday, we need to calculate the total number of packages he completes in that time and then multiply it by his hourly rate.

First, let's find out how many packages Colby completes in an hour. He completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, so we can write this as:

Packages per hour = 50 - 10
Packages per hour = 40

Now, let's calculate the total number of packages he completes in an eight-hour workday:

Total packages per day = Packages per hour * 8
Total packages per day = 40 * 8
Total packages per day = 320

Since Colby gets paid $0.20 for every package he completes, we can multiply the total number of packages by his hourly rate to find his daily earnings:

Daily earnings = Total packages per day * $0.20
Daily earnings = 320 * $0.20
Daily earnings = $64

The final answer is: $64"
"To find out how many bottles of water John drinks, we need to calculate the time it takes to solve an extreme sudoku and then divide it by the time it takes to drink one bottle of water.

A normal sudoku takes 45 minutes, and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long, so an extreme sudoku takes 45 * 4 = 180 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we need to convert the time it takes to solve an extreme sudoku to half hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 2 half hours in an hour. 

180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours, and 3 hours * 2 = 6 half hours.

John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, so in 6 half hours, he will drink 6 bottles of water.

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of yellow balloons as y and the number of red balloons as r.

We know that Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon, so the total number of bologna pieces thrown at red balloons is 2r. Similarly, he threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, so the total number of bologna pieces thrown at yellow balloons is 3y.

We are given that the total number of bologna pieces thrown is 58, so we can write the equation:

2r + 3y = 58

We are also given that there are 20 red balloons, so we can write the equation:

r = 20

Now we can substitute the value of r into the first equation to solve for y:

2(20) + 3y = 58
40 + 3y = 58
3y = 18
y = 6

So, there are 6 yellow balloons in the bundle.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how many tune-ups Jon's car needs, we need to calculate the total miles driven in 30 days and then divide that by 1000.

First, let's calculate the total miles driven in 30 days:
100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles

Now, let's divide the total miles driven by 1000 to find out how many tune-ups are needed:
3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the total hours Bruce works, we need to calculate the hours he works each day and add them up.

On Tuesday, Bruce works 5 hours.

On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, so he works 2 * 5 = 10 hours.

On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours he works each day: 5 + 10 + 8 = 23.

The final answer is: 23"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. First, let's find out how much money they spent on the balloons. Since they bought 1 dozen balloons, and 1 dozen is equal to 12, they bought 12 balloons. The cost of 2 balloons is $0.5, so the cost of 12 balloons is 12 * $0.5 = $6.

2. Next, let's find out how much money they spent on the ice cream. They bought 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each, so the total cost of the ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

3. Now, let's add up the total amount they spent on the cake, balloons, and ice cream. The total cost is $11 (cake) + $6 (balloons) + $14 (ice cream) = $31.

4. Since they had the same amount of allowance, let's call it x. When they combined their allowance, they had 2x. After spending $31, they were left with 2x - $31.

5. Since they had some money left, we can assume that the remaining money is not negative. This means that 2x - $31 ≥ 0.

6. To find the minimum amount of allowance they could have received, we can set up the equation 2x - $31 = 0 and solve for x. Solving for x, we get x = $31 / 2 = $15.50.

7. Since they had the same amount of allowance, each girl received $15.50.

The final answer is: $15.50"
"To find the total number of fruits Kira bought, we need to add the number of apples, bananas, and oranges. 

3 (apples) + 5 (bananas) + 6 (oranges) = 14

Since Lola ate 2 pieces of the fruit, we need to subtract 2 from the total number of fruits.

14 - 2 = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total number of students, we need to calculate the number of students playing tennis, volleyball, and soccer separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of students playing tennis. There are 6 students playing tennis, and twice that number are playing volleyball. So, the number of students playing volleyball is 2 * 6 = 12.

Now, let's add the number of students playing tennis and volleyball: 6 + 12 = 18.

Next, let's add the number of boys and girls playing soccer: 16 + 22 = 38.

Finally, let's add the number of students playing tennis and volleyball to the number of students playing soccer: 18 + 38 = 56.

The final answer is: 56"
"To calculate the total profit, we need to first find the total revenue and the total cost.

Total revenue = Number of students * Number of lollipops sold per student * Selling price per lollipop
Total revenue = 30 * 10 * $0.8
Total revenue = 300 * $0.8
Total revenue = $240

Total cost = Number of students * Number of lollipops sold per student * Cost per lollipop
Total cost = 30 * 10 * $0.5
Total cost = 300 * $0.5
Total cost = $150

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $240 - $150
Profit = $90

The class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps and use ratios and proportions to find the total number of pets Larry has.

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 * 7 = 21 fish.
5. He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

Now, let's add up the total number of pets Larry has:
3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47

The final answer is: 47"
"To find out how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to determine how many slices Abby and Josh can eat together in a day. 

Abby can eat 2 slices a day. 
Josh can eat twice as much as Abby, so Josh can eat 2 * 2 = 4 slices a day.

Together, they can eat 2 + 4 = 6 slices a day.

The loaf of bread has 24 slices. To find out how many days it will last, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of slices they eat in a day.

24 slices / 6 slices per day = 4 days.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many shells Martha has collected by her 10th birthday, we need to calculate the number of months she has been collecting shells. Since she started collecting shells at 5 years old and we want to know the total by her 10th birthday, we need to count the months from her 5th birthday to her 10th birthday.

There are 12 months in a year, so from her 5th birthday to her 10th birthday, there are 5 years. 

5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months

Since Martha collects one shell per month, we multiply the total number of months by 1 shell/month.

60 months * 1 shell/month = 60 shells

Martha will have collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row, we first need to determine how many cups of tea are in each row. Since Lana divides the 27 cups into 3 rows, we can divide 27 by 3 to get the number of cups in each row.

27 ÷ 3 = 9

Since Lana creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, the number of mint tea cups in each row will be half of the total cups in each row.

9 ÷ 2 = 4.5

However, since we can't have a fraction of a cup, we can assume that Lana will make whole cups of tea. To find the number of whole cups of mint tea in each row, we can round down to the nearest whole number.

4.5 → 4

So, there are 4 cups of mint tea in each row.

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip. 

Let's break down the problem: 

- The sloth takes 4 hours to make a round trip (down and up) and pick berries. 
- He wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours. 

Since the sloth makes a round trip every 4 hours, in 8 hours, he will make 8 / 4 = 2 round trips. 

To collect 24 berries in 2 round trips, we need to find the minimum number of berries he can pick up per trip. 

Let's divide 24 berries by 2 (the number of round trips) to find the minimum number of berries per trip: 

24 / 2 = 12 

So, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip is 12.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much water is in the tank initially, and then subtract the amount of water used over 6 days.

First, Anthony and his father fill the tank with half the amount of water in the pool. Since there are 10000 gallons in the pool, half of that is 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons.

Now, the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. To find out how much water is used in 6 days, we multiply the rate by the number of days: 500 * 6 = 3000 gallons.

To find the remaining water in the tank, we subtract the amount used from the initial amount: 5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons.

The final answer is: 2000"
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate how much money Colby has left for the last day of the month. 

Colby's monthly allowance is $150. He has already spent money on 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays ($10 each) and 8 movies on other days ($7 each). 

Cost for 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays: 5 * $10 = $50
Cost for 8 movies on other days: 8 * $7 = $56
Total cost for movies: $50 + $56 = $106

He has also spent money on 2 tubs of popcorn ($8 each) and 4 boxes of candy ($2 each). 

Cost for 2 tubs of popcorn: 2 * $8 = $16
Cost for 4 boxes of candy: 4 * $2 = $8
Total cost for snacks: $16 + $8 = $24

Total money spent so far: $106 + $24 = $130

Colby's remaining money: $150 - $130 = $20

Now, let's calculate how many movies he can see on the last day of the month. He wants to buy a popcorn and a box of candy, which will cost $8 + $2 = $10. 

Remaining money after buying snacks: $20 - $10 = $10

Since tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10, Colby can see 1 movie on the last day of the month.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To find the total calories of the pastries, we first need to find the calories of a mini cinnamon roll and a mini blueberry muffin. 

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories. 

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, we can find the total calories of the mini cinnamon rolls: 200 mini cinnamon rolls * 200 calories = 40,000 calories.

Next, we can find the total calories of the mini blueberry muffins: 300 mini blueberry muffins * 150 calories = 45,000 calories.

Finally, we can find the total calories of all the pastries: 40,000 calories + 45,000 calories = 85,000 calories.

The final answer is: 85000"
"To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed and then divide it by the number of days.

On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday, she removed twice as many as Monday, so 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs.
On Wednesday, she removed twice as many as Tuesday, so 2 * 78 = 156 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 78 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 378

There are 5 days in total. 

Average number of Junebugs removed per day = Total Junebugs removed / Number of days

"To find out how far each vehicle traveled, we need to multiply their speed by the time they traveled.

The bus traveled 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so the distance it traveled is 60 * 5 = 300 miles.

The car traveled 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so the distance it traveled is 30 * 8 = 240 miles.

To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled: 300 - 240 = 60 miles.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to subtract the total number of toys Sophie had before buying the bouncy balls from the total number of toys she has now.

The total number of toys before buying the bouncy balls is the sum of the blocks, stuffed animals, and stacking rings: 31 + 8 + 9 = 48.

Now, we subtract this total from the total number of toys after buying the bouncy balls: 62 - 48 = 14.

So, there were 14 bouncy balls in the tube.

The final answer is: 14"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of linear equations. Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as p, and John's age as J.

From the information given, we have the following equations:

1. P + p + J = 100 (The combined age of Peter, Paul, and John is 100 years old)
2. p = J + 10 (Paul is 10 years older than John)
3. P = p + J (Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age)

We can substitute equation (2) into equation (3) to get:
P = (J + 10) + J
P = 2J + 10

Now, we can substitute this expression for P into equation (1):
(2J + 10) + p + J = 100

Substituting equation (2) into this equation, we get:
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
Combine like terms:
4J + 20 = 100

Subtract 20 from both sides:
4J = 80

Divide both sides by 4:
J = 20

Now that we know John's age, we can find Paul's age using equation (2):
p = J + 10
p = 20 + 10
p = 30

Finally, we can find Peter's age using equation (3):
P = p + J
P = 30 + 20
P = 50

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To find the total number of balloons, we need to calculate the initial number of balloons and then add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, Maria had 1 balloon, and her 4 friends had 2 balloons each, so the total number of balloons is:
1 (Maria's balloon) + 4 * 2 (friends' balloons) = 1 + 8 = 9

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional balloons is:
5 * 3 = 15

Now, we add the initial number of balloons to the additional balloons:
9 (initial balloons) + 15 (additional balloons) = 24

"To find out how many tables they need, we first need to calculate the total number of boxes of stuff they have. 

10 people donate 5 boxes each, so the total number of boxes donated is 10 * 5 = 50 boxes. 
They already have 10 boxes, so the total number of boxes is 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

Since they can fit 2 boxes per table, the total number of tables needed is 60 / 2 = 30 tables.

They already own 15 tables, so they need 30 - 15 = 15 new tables.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the average total distance spat, we need to calculate the total distance spat by each person and then divide by the number of seeds they spat.

Zoey spits 40 seeds, each 10 feet, so the total distance spat by Zoey is 40 * 10 = 400 feet.

Sydney spits 35 seeds, each 12 feet, so the total distance spat by Sydney is 35 * 12 = 420 feet.

The total distance spat by both Zoey and Sydney is 400 + 420 = 820 feet.

They each spat 40 and 35 seeds respectively, so the total number of seeds spat is 40 + 35 = 75.

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the total distance spat by the total number of seeds spat: 820 / 75 = 10.93 (rounded to two decimal places).

"To calculate the cost for Cameron, we need to determine the total hours he will be staying at the hotel and then calculate the cost based on the given options.

Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours.

The 12-hour stay costs 1000 pesos. Since Cameron will be staying for more than 12 hours, he will be charged for the additional hours. The additional hours are 17 - 12 = 5 hours.

The cost for the additional hours is 5 * 70 pesos = 350 pesos.

The total cost for Cameron's stay is 1000 pesos (for the initial 12 hours) + 350 pesos (for the additional hours) = 1350 pesos.

Now, let's calculate the cost if Cameron had chosen the 24-hour stay option. The cost for a 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos.

To find out how much money Cameron would save, we subtract the cost of the 17-hour stay from the cost of the 24-hour stay: 1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = 250 pesos.

The final answer is: $250"
"To find out how much hay Nate needs, we first need to determine the amount each sheep needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds and each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, we can calculate the amount each sheep needs as follows:

Twice the amount each goat needs: 2 * 5 = 10 pounds
3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs: 10 - 3 = 7 pounds

Now that we know each sheep needs 7 pounds, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the sheep:

12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats:

15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds

Finally, we can find the total amount of hay Nate needs by adding the amount needed for the goats and the amount needed for the sheep:

Total hay needed = 75 pounds (goats) + 84 pounds (sheep) = 159 pounds

"To find out how much money John has left after buying gas and depositing money in the bank, we first need to calculate his total earnings for the week. 

John's total earnings = 50 dollars/hour * 6 hours = 300 dollars.

After spending 50 dollars on gas, he has:
300 - 50 = 250 dollars.

He then deposits 100 dollars in the bank, so he has:
250 - 100 = 150 dollars.

Now, let's calculate how much he has left after buying 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each:
5 pencils * 10 dollars/pencil = 50 dollars.

So, he has:
150 - 50 = 100 dollars.

"To find the total number of letters in the words Craig spelled, we multiply the number of words by the number of letters in each word: 20 * 15 = 300.

Since Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig, we add 50 to the total number of letters Craig spelled: 300 + 50 = 350.

Now, we need to find the number of letters in the words Craig's brother spelled. Since Craig's brother has 50 more letters than Craig, and Craig has 300 letters, we can find the number of letters in the words Craig's brother spelled by adding 50 to 300: 300 + 50 = 350.

However, this is the number of letters in Craig's brother's words, not the total number of letters in both of their words. To find the total number of letters in both of their words, we add the number of letters in Craig's words to the number of letters in his brother's words: 300 + 350 = 650.

"To find out how much James spent on the CDs, we need to calculate the original price and then subtract the discount. 

Original price of 1 CD = $15
Number of CDs = 10
Original price for 10 CDs = 10 * $15 = $150

Discount = 40% of $150 = 0.4 * $150 = $60
Price James paid for 10 CDs = $150 - $60 = $90

James sold 5 CDs for $40 each. 
Total amount James got from selling 5 CDs = 5 * $40 = $200

Since James spent $90 and got $200, he made a profit of $200 - $90 = $110.

However, the question asks how much money James was out. Since he made a profit, he wasn't out any money. But if we consider the 5 CDs he didn't like and didn't sell, he spent $90 for them. 

So, the amount James was out is $90.

4 carrots * $1.25 = $5

Finally, let's add the earnings from all the root crops together:
$9 + $20 + $5 = $34

The final answer is: $34"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the distance James swims before resting. 
Since he swims 60% of the 20-mile lake, we need to find 60% of 20 miles.
60% of 20 miles = 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles

Step 2: Calculate the time it takes James to swim 12 miles at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
Time = Distance / Rate = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours

Step 3: Calculate the time James rests on the island. 
He rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 hours. 
So, the resting time is 6 / 2 = 3 hours

Step 4: Calculate the remaining distance James needs to swim after resting.
The total distance is 20 miles, and he has already swum 12 miles. 
So, the remaining distance is 20 - 12 = 8 miles

Step 5: Calculate the new rate at which James swims after resting.
He swims at half the speed of his original pace, which is 2 miles per hour. 
So, the new rate is 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour

Step 6: Calculate the time it takes James to swim the remaining 8 miles at the new rate.
Time = Distance / Rate = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours

Step 7: Calculate the total time it takes James to get across the lake.
The total time is the sum of the swimming time, resting time, and the time it takes to swim the remaining distance.
Total time = 6 hours (swimming) + 3 hours (resting) + 8 hours (swimming the remaining distance) = 17 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"To find the number of loaves of bread the bakery has, we need to calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had last Friday and then subtract 40 from that result.

First, we calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had last Friday: 
7 * 70 = 490

Then, we subtract 40 from that result:
490 - 40 = 450

The bakery has 450 loaves of bread."
"To find out how many stickers Jasmine has at the end, we need to follow the order of events. 

First, Jasmine was given 15 stickers for participating in class. 
Then, she lost 7 stickers during playtime. 
So, we subtract 7 from 15: 15 - 7 = 8 stickers left.

Next, her teacher gave her another 5 stickers for helping her classmates. 
Now, we add 5 to 8: 8 + 5 = 13 stickers.

So, Jasmine has 13 stickers at the end.

"To find the total commission earned by Cayley, we need to calculate the commission from the sales of the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal separately and then add them together.

Commission from New York Times:
- Number of copies sold: 6
- Price per copy: $5
- Commission rate: 10%
- Commission per copy: 10% of $5 = 0.1 * $5 = $0.5
- Total commission from New York Times: 6 * $0.5 = $3

Commission from Wall Street Journal:
- Number of copies sold: 10
- Price per copy: $15
- Commission rate: 8%
- Commission per copy: 8% of $15 = 0.08 * $15 = $1.2
- Total commission from Wall Street Journal: 10 * $1.2 = $12

Total commission earned by Cayley: $3 + $12 = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. Marcus is half of Leo's age.
2. Marcus is five years younger than Deanna.
3. Deanna is 26 years old.

From point 2, we can express Marcus's age as Deanna's age minus 5. Since Deanna is 26, Marcus is 26 - 5 = 21 years old.

From point 1, we know that Marcus is half of Leo's age. If Marcus is 21, then Leo's age is twice that of Marcus. 

To find Leo's age, we multiply Marcus's age by 2: 21 * 2 = 42.

The final answer is: 42"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up equations based on the given information. Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as B, A, and D respectively.

We know that the total points scored by the team is 45, so we can write the equation:

B + A + D = 45

We also know that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so we can write:

B = A + 20

We also know that Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, so we can write:

B = D + 10

Now we have two equations with two variables. We can substitute the expression for B from the second equation into the first equation:

(A + 20) + A + D = 45

Combine like terms:

2A + D + 20 = 45

Subtract 20 from both sides:

2A + D = 25

Now we have a new equation with two variables. We can substitute the expression for B from the third equation into the first equation:

(A + 20) + A + D = 45

Combine like terms:

2A + D + 20 = 45

Subtract 20 from both sides:

2A + D = 25

Now we have two equations with two variables. We can solve for A by substituting the expression for D from the third equation into the second equation:

2A + (A + 20) = 25

Combine like terms:

3A + 20 = 25

Subtract 20 from both sides:

3A = 5

Divide both sides by 3:

A = 5/3

However, we can simplify this further by converting the fraction to a mixed number or a decimal. But since the question asks for the number of points Azibo scored, we can leave it as a fraction and convert it to a decimal later if needed.

A = 5/3

To convert the fraction to a decimal, we can divide the numerator by the denominator:

A = 1.67

However, since the question asks for the number of points Azibo scored, we can round the decimal to the nearest whole number if needed.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1.67}$"
"To find the total number of pages in the book, we need to calculate the total number of pages per inch and then multiply it by the thickness of the book in inches.

Since each paper is 100 pages to the inch and each paper is printed on both sides, we have 200 pages per inch (100 pages per side).

Given that the book is 1.5 inches thick, we can multiply the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book:

200 pages/inch * 1.5 inches = 300 pages

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the total number of reports Vince stapled, we need to calculate the total time he spent stapling and then multiply it by the rate at which he staples reports.

First, let's find the total time Vince spent stapling. He stapled from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is a total of 15 hours.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 15 hours to minutes by multiplying 15 by 60:
15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Now, we know that Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find the total number of reports he stapled, we need to divide the total time (in minutes) by the time it takes him to staple 30 reports (15 minutes) and then multiply by 30.

First, divide the total time by the time it takes to staple 30 reports:
900 minutes / 15 minutes = 60

Now, multiply the result by 30 to find the total number of reports stapled:
60 * 30 = 1800

The final answer is: 1800"
"To find the total time Kim slept on her bed, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

Kim's usual sleep schedule is from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, her usual sleep time is 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so her wake-up time was 6 a.m. - 5 minutes = 5:55 a.m.

The time she was sleepwalking is from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes.

To find the total sleep time, we need to find the time she went to sleep. Since she woke up at 5:55 a.m. and her usual wake-up time is 6 a.m., she must have gone to sleep at 5:55 a.m. - 8 hours = 9:55 p.m.

The time she was asleep from 10 p.m. to 9:55 p.m. is 1 hour, which is 60 minutes. The time she was asleep from 9:55 p.m. to 2:15 a.m. is 4 hours and 20 minutes, which is 260 minutes. The time she was asleep from 2:38 a.m. to 5:55 a.m. is 3 hours and 17 minutes, which is 197 minutes.

The total time she was asleep is 60 + 260 + 197 = 517 minutes.

Since she was sleepwalking for 23 minutes, we subtract this from the total sleep time: 517 - 23 = 494 minutes.

The final answer is: 494"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many measuring spoons Jonathan has initially. 

Since Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, and he has two dozen cups, we can calculate the number of measuring spoons as follows:

Number of measuring cups = 2 dozen = 2 * 12 = 24
Number of measuring spoons = 2/3 * 24 = 16

Now, Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so we subtract 6 from the initial number of measuring spoons:

Number of measuring spoons remaining = 16 - 6 = 10

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is the sum of the remaining measuring spoons and the measuring cups:

Total number of utensils = 24 (measuring cups) + 10 (measuring spoons) = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the number of occupied beds initially, we need to calculate 1/5 of the total capacity of the hospital. 

1/5 of 1000 = 100

So, the hospital has 100 occupied beds initially.

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, we need to calculate the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks is 14 days.

Total patients admitted in 2 weeks = 50 patients/day * 14 days = 700 patients

Now, we need to add the initial occupied beds to the total patients admitted to find the total occupied beds after 2 weeks.

Total occupied beds after 2 weeks = 100 (initial occupied beds) + 700 (patients admitted) = 800

Now, we need to subtract the total occupied beds from the total capacity to find the unoccupied beds.

Total unoccupied beds = 1000 (total capacity) - 800 (total occupied beds) = 200

The final answer is: 200"
"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we first need to find out how many emails are not work-related. 

Robyn sends 16 emails a day, and 7 of them are work emails. So, the number of non-work emails is 16 - 7 = 9.

Two-thirds of the remainder (non-work emails) are to family. Two-thirds of 9 is (2/3) * 9 = 6. This means 6 emails are to family.

Now, we need to find out how many emails are left after removing the work and family emails. We already know that 7 are work emails and 6 are to family, so 9 - 6 = 3 emails are left.

One-third of the remaining emails are to her boyfriend. One-third of 3 is (1/3) * 3 = 1.

So, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

The final answer is: 1"
"To find Shawna's age, we need to first find out how old Shawna is. Since Aliya is 3 years old and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, we can multiply Aliya's age by 3 to find Shawna's age.

Shawna's age = 3 * Aliya's age
Shawna's age = 3 * 3
Shawna's age = 9

Now that we know Shawna's age, we can find her father's age. Since Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, we can multiply Shawna's age by 5 to find her father's age.

Shawna's father's age = 5 * Shawna's age
Shawna's father's age = 5 * 9
Shawna's father's age = 45

"To find the original number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate the percentage decrease of 20% from the number reported by Courtney.

Let's assume the original number of people who attended the concert is x.

Since Kelly said Courtney overstated the number by 20%, we can set up the equation:

x + (20% of x) = 48

To find 20% of x, we multiply x by 0.20:

x + 0.20x = 48

Combine like terms:

1.20x = 48

Now, divide both sides by 1.20 to solve for x:

x = 48 / 1.20
x = 40

So, the original number of people who attended the concert is 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice. We know that Jason carried 2 balls, and Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls. We also know that Jeffrey carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jeffrey carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

Since the three boys picked up and carried all of the balls in one trip, the total number of balls is the sum of the balls carried by each of them. 

Total number of balls = Jason's balls + Jordan's balls + Jeffrey's balls
Total number of balls = 2 + 4 + 4
Total number of balls = 10

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day. 

The pirates dug 10 holes the first day, 13 holes the second day, and 8 holes the third day. However, they filled in 2 holes, so the net number of holes dug by the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29.

The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, there were 4 * 10 = 40 holes by the end of the fourth day.

Since there were 29 holes by the end of the third day, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is 40 - 29 = 11.

The final answer is: 11"
"Let's denote the number of corn chips that Amora and Lainey got as 'x'. Since Collins got 15 more corn chips than the others, Collins got x + 15 corn chips.

We know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, so we can set up the equation:

x = 70

Since Collins got x + 15 corn chips, we can set up the equation for the total number of corn chips as:

x + (x + 15) + x = total number of corn chips

Substituting x = 70 into the equation, we get:

70 + (70 + 15) + 70 = total number of corn chips

Combine like terms:

70 + 85 + 70 = total number of corn chips

225 = total number of corn chips

The final answer is: 225"
"To find the cost of travel, we need to calculate 50% more than the cost of supplies. 

First, let's find 50% of the cost of supplies: 
50% of $400 = 0.5 * $400 = $200

Now, we add this to the cost of supplies to find the total cost of travel:
Cost of travel = Cost of supplies + 50% of cost of supplies
Cost of travel = $400 + $200
Cost of travel = $600

The final answer is: $600"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a system of linear equations based on the given information.

Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe as A, S, and W, respectively.

From the problem statement, we have the following equations:

1. A + S + W = 339 (Total number of Pokémon caught)
2. A = S + 5 (Alex has caught 5 more than Stan)
3. S = 4W - 13 (Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe)

We can substitute equation (2) into equation (1) to get:
(S + 5) + S + W = 339
Combine like terms:
2S + 5 + W = 339

We can also substitute equation (3) into equation (1) to get:
A + (4W - 13) + W = 339
Combine like terms:
A + 5W - 13 = 339

Now we have two equations with two variables:
2S + W = 334
A + 5W - 13 = 339

We can substitute equation (2) into the second equation to get:
(S + 5) + 5W - 13 = 339
Combine like terms:
S + 5W - 8 = 339

Now we have two equations with two variables:
2S + W = 334
S + 5W - 8 = 339

We can multiply the first equation by 1 and the second equation by -2 to eliminate S:
2S + W = 334
-2S - 10W + 16 = -678

Now we can add the two equations to eliminate S:
-9W + 16 = -344

Now we can solve for W:
-9W = -360
W = 40

Now that we have W, we can substitute it into equation (3) to find S:
S = 4W - 13
S = 4(40) - 13
S = 160 - 13
S = 147

The final answer is: 147"
"To find the total number of episodes, we need to find half of the number of minutes per episode. Since each episode is 20 minutes long, we can find the total number of episodes by dividing 20 by 2.

"To find the total distance traveled by the bird, we need to calculate the distance traveled in each segment of the journey and then add them up.

The bird travels for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour in the southerly direction. The distance traveled in this segment is:
Distance = Speed x Time = 30 miles/hour x 10 hours = 300 miles

The bird then turns direction and flies towards the north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour. The distance traveled in this segment is:
Distance = Speed x Time = 18 miles/hour x 2 hours = 36 miles

Since the bird is flying north, this distance is subtracted from the total distance traveled so far. The new total distance is:
300 miles - 36 miles = 264 miles

The bird then changes direction and flies towards the south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour. The distance traveled in this segment is:
Distance = Speed x Time = 22 miles/hour x 5 hours = 110 miles

Since the bird is flying south, this distance is added to the total distance traveled so far. The new total distance is:
264 miles + 110 miles = 374 miles

The final distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 374 miles.

The final answer is: 374"
"To find the total number of brownies Greta had left over, we need to calculate the total number of brownies she received and subtract the number of brownies eaten.

Greta made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies for herself, which is 12 brownies.

She received 1/2 dozen brownies from her office, which is 6 brownies (since 1 dozen = 12, 1/2 dozen = 12 / 2 = 6).

She also received 4 dozen brownies from her friends, which is 48 brownies (since 1 dozen = 12, 4 dozen = 12 * 4 = 48).

So, the total number of brownies Greta received is 12 + 6 + 48 = 66.

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies (since 1 dozen = 12, 1 1/2 dozen = 12 + 6 = 18).

To find the number of brownies Greta had left over, we subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies she received: 66 - 18 = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the total age of all three family members, we need to find the age of Nani's brother and sister first.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 2 * 8 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means her age is 75% of Nani's age. To find 75% of Nani's age, we multiply his age by 0.75: 8 * 0.75 = 6 years.

Now, we have the ages of all three family members: Nani (8 years), his brother (16 years), and his sister (6 years). 

The total age of all three family members is 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

"To calculate the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the weighted average of the time it takes for each type of string.

First, let's calculate the total time for each type of string:

- Synthetic gut: 3 racquets * 15 minutes/racquet = 45 minutes
- Polyester string: 5 racquets * 22 minutes/racquet = 110 minutes
- Hybrid sets: 4 racquets * 18 minutes/racquet = 72 minutes

Next, we need to calculate the total number of racquets: 3 + 5 + 4 = 12 racquets

Now, we can calculate the weighted average of the time it takes for each type of string:

Weighted average = (Total time for synthetic gut + Total time for polyester string + Total time for hybrid sets) / Total number of racquets
Weighted average = (45 + 110 + 72) / 12
Weighted average = 227 / 12
Weighted average = 18.92 minutes

So, it will take Andy approximately 18.92 minutes to string one racquet. To find the total time for all 12 racquets, we multiply this by the total number of racquets:

Total time = 18.92 minutes/racquet * 12 racquets
Total time = 226.24 minutes

The final answer is: 226.24"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first two phones and the cost of the remaining phones.

The cost of the first two phones is 2 * $600 = $1200.

The cost of each of the remaining phones is half the price of the first phone, which is $600 / 2 = $300.

Since there are 2 kids, the total cost of the remaining phones is 2 * $300 = $600.

The total cost of all phones is $1200 + $600 = $1800.

The final answer is: $1800"
"To find the total number of players in both teams, we first need to determine the number of players on Zeke's team. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, and Carlton's team has 13 players, we can calculate the number of players on Zeke's team by adding 7 to 13.

Zeke's team = Carlton's team + 7
Zeke's team = 13 + 7
Zeke's team = 20

Now that we know the number of players on both teams, we can find the total number of players by adding the number of players on Zeke's team and Carlton's team.

Total players = Zeke's team + Carlton's team
Total players = 20 + 13
Total players = 33

"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2l + 2w, where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the length (l) is 15 feet and the width (w) is 10 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

P = 2(15) + 2(10)
P = 30 + 20
P = 50

So, the perimeter of the fence is 50 feet.

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

50 feet * 2 slats/foot = 100 slats

Therefore, Robert will need 100 wooden slats for his fence.

"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we first need to determine how many oranges she had initially and then subtract the ones she kept and gave away.

Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges, and each box contains 20 oranges. So, the total number of oranges she bought is 12 * 20 = 240.

She gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes each, which is a total of 4 boxes. Since each box contains 20 oranges, she gave away 4 * 20 = 80 oranges.

Now, she kept 1/4 of the oranges. To find out how many oranges she kept, we need to calculate 1/4 of the total oranges she had initially, which is 1/4 * 240 = 60 oranges.

So, the number of oranges she had left after giving some to her mom and sister is 240 - 80 = 160 oranges. 

Since she kept 60 oranges, the number of oranges she sold is 160 - 60 = 100 oranges.

"To solve this problem, we need to know the number of states in the USA and India. 

The USA has 50 states. 

Let's denote the number of states in India as 'x'. According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. So, we can write the equation as:

x = (50 / 2) + 4

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 25 + 4
x = 29

Now, we know the number of states in India is 29. To find the total number of states in both countries together, we add the number of states in the USA and India:

Total number of states = 50 (USA) + 29 (India)
Total number of states = 79

"To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books. 

The total cost of the books is $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39.

Since Tyler has already saved $14 from his allowance, we need to subtract this from the total cost to find out how much more he needs to earn. 

$39 (total cost) - $14 (saved) = $25 (amount needed).

Since Tyler earns $5 per hour, we can divide the amount needed by his hourly wage to find out how many hours he needs to work.

$25 (amount needed) ÷ $5 (hourly wage) = 5 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many cherries Richard and Jerry have. We know that Robert has 30 cherries and has 10 more than Richard. So, Richard has 30 - 10 = 20 cherries.

Now, we know that the total number of cherries is 60, and Robert and Richard have 30 + 20 = 50 cherries. This means that Jerry has 60 - 50 = 10 cherries.

Since Robert has 30 cherries and Jerry has 10 cherries, Robert has 30 - 10 = 20 more cherries than Jerry.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many boxes of gingerbread and apple pie Sunny sold on each day. 

Let's denote the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday as G and the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday as A. 

We know that on Saturday, Sunny sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. So, the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday is A + 4. 

We also know that on Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday. So, the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday is G + 5.

We are given that on Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie. Therefore, A + 4 = 15, which means A = 11.

We are also given that on Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday. Therefore, G + 5 = G + 5, which means G = 5.

Now that we know the number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie sold on Saturday, we can calculate the total earnings for each day.

On Saturday, the total earnings from gingerbread is 5 * 6 = $30 and the total earnings from apple pie is 11 * 15 = $165. The total earnings on Saturday is $30 + $165 = $195.

On Sunday, the total earnings from gingerbread is (5 + 5) * 6 = $60 and the total earnings from apple pie is 15 * 15 = $225. The total earnings on Sunday is $60 + $225 = $285.

The total earnings for two days is $195 + $285 = $480.

Since she reapplies sunscreen every hour and will be outside 4 hours a day, she will use 4 ounces of sunscreen per day. 

Over 8 days, she will use 4 ounces/day * 8 days = 32 ounces.

Since each bottle contains 8 ounces, we need to divide the total amount of sunscreen used (32 ounces) by the amount in each bottle (8 ounces) to find out how many bottles she will need.

32 ounces / 8 ounces/bottle = 4 bottles

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the price of the red car, we need to calculate 40% of the price of the blue car and subtract it from the price of the blue car.

First, let's find 40% of the price of the blue car:
40% of $100 = 0.4 x $100 = $40

Now, subtract $40 from the price of the blue car to find the price of the red car:
$100 - $40 = $60

So, the price of the red car is $60.

To find the total cost of both cars, add the prices of the red and blue cars:
$60 + $100 = $160

The final answer is: $160"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let E be Emil's current age, D be his dad's current age, and B be his brother's current age.

We know that Emil is 19 years old now, so E = 19.

When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad, so we can write the equation:

24 = (D + 5) / 2

Simplifying the equation, we get:

48 = D + 5

Subtracting 5 from both sides, we get:

43 = D

Now, we know that when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother, so we can write the equation:

24 = 2(B + 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

24 = 2B + 10

Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get:

14 = 2B

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

7 = B

Now that we have the current ages of Emil's dad and brother, we can find the sum of their ages:

D + B = 43 + 7 = 50

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to calculate the number of beads she received from her mother, sister, and friend, and then add them together.

Adrianne's mother gave her 20 beads.
Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, so her friend gave her 2 x 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the number of beads Adrianne received from her mother, sister, and friend:
20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the total amount of crawfish Joe caught, we need to calculate the amount he caught each day and add them together.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.

On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the amount he caught each day: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can find the total number of servings by dividing the total amount of crawfish by 3: 21 / 3 = 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the number of students leaving early, we first need to find the number of football players, then the number of cheerleaders or band members.

First, let's find the number of football players. 20% of 30 students are football players. 

20% of 30 = 0.20 * 30 = 6

So, there are 6 football players.

Now, let's find the number of remaining students. Since 6 students are football players, the remaining students are 30 - 6 = 24.

Next, let's find the number of cheerleaders or band members. 25% of the remaining 24 students are cheerleaders or band members.

25% of 24 = 0.25 * 24 = 6

So, there are 6 cheerleaders or band members.

Now, let's add the number of football players and cheerleaders or band members to find the total number of students leaving early.

6 (football players) + 6 (cheerleaders or band members) = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we first need to determine Charlie's shoe size. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size five boots, we can calculate Charlie's size as follows:

Charlie's size = 5 * Sophie's size
Charlie's size = 5 * 5
Charlie's size = 25

Now, to find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we add their sizes and divide by 2:

Average size = (Charlie's size + Sophie's size) / 2
Average size = (25 + 5) / 2
Average size = 30 / 2
Average size = 15

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to calculate the total space available for plants. 

First, we need to convert the width of the plants and the space between them to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the width of the plants is 1 foot. The space between each plant is 1.5 feet.

The total space taken up by each plant, including the space between them, is 1 (plant width) + 1.5 (space between plants) = 2.5 feet.

Now, we need to find out how many of these 2.5-foot units can fit in the 111-foot flower bed. 

111 feet (flower bed) / 2.5 feet (space per plant) = 44.4

Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we'll round down to 44 plants. However, Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she only needs to buy 44 - 17 = 27 more plants.

Each plant costs $6, so the total cost will be 27 (number of plants to buy) * 6 (cost per plant) = $162.

The final answer is: $162"
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day, we need to calculate 1/2 of 18. 

1/2 of 18 is 18 / 2 = 9 pretzels per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats per day by 7.

9 pretzels/day * 7 days = 63 pretzels

The final answer is: 63"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of petunias: 
5 baskets * 3 petunias per basket = 15 petunias
Cost of 15 petunias = 15 * $3.00 = $45.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of sweet potato vines:
5 baskets * 2 sweet potato vines per basket = 10 sweet potato vines
Cost of 10 sweet potato vines = 10 * $2.50 = $25.00

Now, let's add the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines together:
Total cost = $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00

The total amount Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets is $70.00."
"To find out how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we first need to determine how much soil they have left after planting the sunflowers and carnations.

First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:

- 4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds
- 10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds
- Total soil used = 12 pounds + 15 pounds = 27 pounds

Now, let's subtract the amount of soil used from the total amount of soil they bought:

- Total soil bought = 30 pounds
- Soil left = 30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, we can divide the remaining soil by 1 pound to find out how many roses they can plant:

- Roses that can be planted = 3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how much Jessica sets aside for shoes each month, we need to calculate 25% of her monthly income. 

25% of $2,000.00 is calculated as 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00.

Since each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, we can find out how many pairs she can buy in a month by dividing the amount she sets aside by the cost of each pair: $500.00 / $1,000.00 = 0.5 pairs.

To find out how many pairs she can buy in a year, we multiply the number of pairs she can buy in a month by 12: 0.5 * 12 = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: peeling and cooking. 

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp a minute, we can divide 90 by 6 to get the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp.

90 / 6 = 15 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to cook 90 shrimp. Since she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we can divide 90 by 30 to get the number of batches she needs to cook, and then multiply by 10 to get the total cooking time.

90 / 30 = 3 batches
3 batches * 10 minutes per batch = 30 minutes

However, since peeling and cooking are done sequentially, we need to add the time it takes for each task. 

15 minutes (peeling) + 30 minutes (cooking) = 45 minutes

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

The final answer is: 45"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net change in temperature after the air conditioner has been running and turned off.

First, let's calculate the temperature change when the air conditioner is running on low for 3 hours:

Temperature change on low = -2 degrees/hour * 3 hours = -6 degrees

Next, let's calculate the temperature change when the air conditioner is running on high for 4 hours:

Temperature change on high = -3 degrees/hour * 4 hours = -12 degrees

Now, let's calculate the total temperature change when the air conditioner is running:

Total temperature change while running = -6 degrees + (-12 degrees) = -18 degrees

The air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours, and the room will warm up at 2 degrees an hour. So, the temperature change while the air conditioner is off is:

Temperature change while off = 2 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 4 degrees

Now, let's calculate the net temperature change:

Net temperature change = Total temperature change while running + Temperature change while off
= -18 degrees + 4 degrees
= -14 degrees

Since the net temperature change is -14 degrees, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how old Bill's dad was when he saw the comet and then determine Bill's age at that time.

Let's denote the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet as 'x'. Since Bill saw the comet when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet, Bill's age at that time is 3x.

We know that the time between the two sightings is 75 years. So, the difference in their ages is 75 years. 

We can set up the equation: 3x - x = 75

Simplifying the equation, we get: 2x = 75

Dividing both sides by 2, we get: x = 37.5

This is the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet. Since Bill was 30 years old at that time, we can find Bill's age when his dad saw the comet by subtracting 30 from 37.5.

However, the question asks for Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time, not when his dad saw it. Since the comet orbits every 75 years, we need to find the time difference between the two sightings. 

Since Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 37.5 years old, and the comet orbits every 75 years, we can find the time when Bill saw the comet for the first time by subtracting 75 from 37.5.

37.5 - 75 = -37.5

"To find the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks for each type and then add them together.

1. Checks for the electric bill: Since Buford writes a check once per month, and there are 12 months in a year, he writes 12 checks for the electric bill.
2. Checks for the gas bill: Buford also writes a check once per month, so he writes 12 checks for the gas bill.
3. Checks to the church: Buford writes a check twice per month, so in a year, he writes 2 * 12 = 24 checks to the church.
4. Checks to the pest and lawn service: Buford writes a check quarterly, which means 4 times a year. So, he writes 4 checks to the pest and lawn service.

Now, let's add the total number of checks: 
12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52

The final answer is: 52"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many flights the first plane makes in a day and then calculate the number of flights to France.

Let's denote the total number of flights made by the first plane as x. Since the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, the number of flights to Greece is (3/4)x. The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of flights to France is (1/4)x.

The second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. So, we can set up the equation:

44 = (1/2)x

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2:

88 = x

Now that we know the first plane makes 88 flights in a day, we can find the number of flights to France:

Flights to France = (1/4)x
= (1/4)(88)
= 22

The final answer is: 22"
"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the individual howling times and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, let's add the individual howling times together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents and subtract that from the cost of the trousers.

Adam's mother gave him $6.
His father gave him twice as much as his mother, so his father gave him 2 * $6 = $12.

The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Since the trousers cost $30, we subtract the amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers to find out how much he had to contribute from his savings:

$30 - $18 = $12

The final answer is: $12"
"To solve this problem, we can start by using the information that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. Let's denote the sum of the ages of the children as S and the average age as A. We know that S = 20 and A = S/4 = 20/4 = 5.

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age, Helene's age is 2A = 2 * 5 = 10.

We also know that Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old. Let's denote Wilfred's age as W. The sum of their ages is S = 20, so we can write the equation:

3 + 4 + 10 + W = 20

Combine the constants on the left-hand side:

17 + W = 20

Subtract 17 from both sides to solve for W:

W = 20 - 17
W = 3

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To find out how much Walter's lawyer will contribute, we need to calculate the total amount collected from Walter's neighbors and the online fund, and then multiply it by 3.

First, let's add the amount collected from Walter's neighbors and the online fund:
$500 (neighbors) + $1500 (online fund) = $2000

Now, we need to add the amount contributed by Walter's friend, but this is not necessary to calculate the lawyer's contribution. We are only told that Walter will tell his friend about the neighbors and the online fund until his friend gives him $200, but this does not affect the lawyer's contribution.

The lawyer will donate three times as much as everyone else donates. Since everyone else (neighbors and online fund) donated $2000, the lawyer will donate:
$2000 * 3 = $6000

The final answer is: $6000"
"To find the total number of cookies, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies brought by the guests. Since each guest brought 15 cookies and there were 100 guests, the total number of cookies is 100 * 15 = 1500.

The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door. To find 1/2 of 1500, we divide 1500 by 2, which is 750. 

Now, we know that each person in the church next door got 15 cookies. To find the number of people in the church next door, we need to divide the total number of cookies given to the church (750) by the number of cookies each person received (15). 

750 / 15 = 50

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, let's assume the total watermelon is divided into 6 equal parts. Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid, we can represent the size of each kid's slice as x. Then, the size of each adult's slice would be 2x.

Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices is 2 + 4 = 6. 

The total number of kid slices is 4x and the total number of adult slices is 2(2x) = 4x.

The total size of the watermelon is 4x + 4x = 8x.

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to find the fraction of the watermelon that the adult slices represent, which is 4x / 8x = 1/2.

To convert this fraction to a percentage, we multiply by 100: (1/2) * 100 = 50%.

So, each adult gets 50% of the watermelon.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how much time Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we first need to calculate the total time spent on rounds and appointments.

Time spent on rounds: 
- Number of inpatients: 9
- Time per inpatient: 20 minutes
- Total time spent on rounds: 9 * 20 = 180 minutes

Time spent on appointments: 
- Number of appointments: 10
- Time per appointment: 30 minutes
- Total time spent on appointments: 10 * 30 = 300 minutes

Total time spent on rounds and appointments: 180 + 300 = 480 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we need to convert the total time spent to hours:
480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Doctor Jones is working for 9 hours at the clinic. To find out how much time he has left to update his records, we subtract the time spent from the total time:
9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

The final answer is: 1"
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required for the entire process. 

First, let's add up the time for making the cake batter, baking the cake, and frosting the cake: 
20 minutes (cake batter) + 30 minutes (baking) + 10 minutes (frosting) = 60 minutes

However, we also need to consider the 2 hours (120 minutes) it takes for the cake to cool. 

Total time required = 60 minutes (preparation and baking) + 120 minutes (cooling) = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 180 minutes to hours: 
180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours

Now, we need to add the 3 hours to the target time of 5:00 pm to find the latest start time. 

5:00 pm + 3 hours = 8:00 pm

Therefore, Jordan can start making the cake at the latest at 8:00 am to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm.

The final answer is 8:00 am."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as 'x'. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, so she sold 3.5x chocolate bars. 
Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so he sold 4.5x chocolate bars. 
Together, they sold 64 chocolate bars, so the equation is 3.5x + 4.5x = 64.

Combine like terms: 8x = 64.

Now, divide both sides by 8 to solve for x: x = 64 / 8.

x = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to first calculate the daily earnings and then multiply it by the number of days in a month.

The cost to rent the studio per session is $25. 
The cost per student per session is $1.50. 
The studio has 10 students, so the total cost per session for students is 10 * $1.50 = $15.
The total cost per session is $25 (rent) + $15 (students) = $40.
The studio is rented 3 days a week, so the weekly earnings are 3 * $40 = $120.
There are approximately 4 weeks in a month, so the monthly earnings are 4 * $120 = $480.

The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is $480."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of chocolate bars in each box for both Peter and Martha. 

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each box as 'x'. 

Since Peter has 4 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each, the total number of chocolate bars Peter has is 4x. We are given that Peter has a total of 64 chocolate bars, so we can set up the equation:

4x = 64

To find the value of 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 4:

x = 64 / 4
x = 16

So, Peter has 16 chocolate bars in each box.

Now, let's do the same for Martha. Martha has 7 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each, and we are given that she has a total of 56 chocolate bars. We can set up the equation:

7x = 56

To find the value of 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 7:

x = 56 / 7
x = 8

So, Martha has 8 chocolate bars in each box.

Now, we need to find the difference in the number of chocolate bars in each box between Peter and Martha. 

Difference = Number of chocolate bars in Peter's box - Number of chocolate bars in Martha's box
= 16 - 8
= 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the number of female porcupines, we need to calculate 3/5 of the total population. 

3/5 * 50 = 30

So, there are 30 female porcupines in the park.

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

30 * 4 * 12 = 1440

Now, we add the number of babies born in a year to the initial population of porcupines:

50 (initial population) + 1440 (babies born) = 1490

The final number of porcupines in the park after a year is 1490."
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the width, length, and depth of the pool. 

Volume = width * length * depth
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company instructed them to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate how many gallons of water they need, we need to perform this calculation.

Gallons = Volume * 5.9
Gallons = 1400 * 5.9
Gallons = 8260 gallons

Now, we need to find the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon, so we multiply the gallons by the cost per gallon.

Cost = Gallons * cost per gallon
Cost = 8260 * 0.10
Cost = 826

The final answer is: $826"
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to determine the number of blue and yellow sticks first. 

We know there are 9 red sticks, and 5 more blue sticks than red. So, the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14.

The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is 14 - 3 = 11.

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks: 9 + 14 + 11 = 34.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find out how many miles each person traveled, we need to multiply their speed by the time they traveled.

Matteo's distance = speed * time = 55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles

Shandy's distance = speed * time = 45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles

Now, we need to find the difference between Shandy's distance and Matteo's distance.

Difference = Shandy's distance - Matteo's distance = 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

"To find the total number of female students, we need to first find the number of students over 16 and under 16, and then calculate the number of female students in each group.

1. Total students = 3000
2. Students over 16 = 3000 * 0.5 = 1500
3. Male students over 16 = 1500 * 0.25 = 375
4. Female students over 16 = 1500 - 375 = 1125
5. Students under 16 = 3000 * 0.5 = 1500
6. Male students under 16 = 1500 * 0.5 = 750
7. Female students under 16 = 1500 - 750 = 750

Now, we add the number of female students over 16 and under 16 to get the total number of female students:
Total female students = 1125 + 750 = 1875

"To find out how many laps each person can run, we need to follow the given information step by step.

Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.

Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.

Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.

Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we need to subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run: 10 - 5 = 5.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank by Wanda and Ms. B on both days.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Since Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped into the tank on the first day is 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons. The total amount of water pumped into the tank on the second day is 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped into the tank over the two days is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.

Since the tank has a capacity of 18000 gallons, the amount of water remaining for the tank to be full is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is: 6000"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the first part where the power bank loses 9% of its capacity per hour for 5 hours, and the second part where it loses 7% of its capacity per hour for 3 hours.

Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park is x.

In the first part, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity per hour for 5 hours. This means that after 5 hours, the charge remaining is 100% - 9% * 5 = 100% - 45% = 55% of the initial charge.

So, the charge remaining after 5 hours is 0.55x.

In the second part, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity per hour for 3 hours. This means that after 3 hours, the charge remaining is 100% - 7% * 3 = 100% - 21% = 79% of the charge remaining after 5 hours.

So, the charge remaining after 8 hours (5 hours + 3 hours) is 0.79 * 0.55x = 0.4345x.

We are given that the charge remaining after 8 hours is 28%. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

0.4345x = 0.28

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.4345:

x = 0.28 / 0.4345
x = 0.644

The charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 64.4%.

The final answer is: 64.4"

Janet's total hourly earnings are the sum of her wages and tips: $10 + $15 = $25 per hour.

Since she works 40 hours a week, her weekly earnings are: $25 * 40 = $1,000 per week.

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2,000, we divide the amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings: 

$2,000 / $1,000 = 2 weeks

"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has spent on the other fruits and subtract that from the $10 he has.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased:

- 3 peaches at $0.5 each: 3 x $0.5 = $1.5
- 4 pears at $0.5 each: 4 x $0.5 = $2
- 2 kiwis at $1 each: 2 x $1 = $2
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 x $0.75 = $3.75

Total cost of the fruits he has already purchased: $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25

Now, let's subtract the total cost from the $10 he has: $10 - $9.25 = $0.75

Since plums cost $0.25 each, we can divide the remaining amount by the cost of one plum to find out how many plums he can buy: $0.75 / $0.25 = 3

"To calculate the price of carrots after three years, we need to apply the compound interest formula, which is A = P(1 + r)^n, where:

- A is the amount after n years
- P is the principal amount (initial price) = $120
- r is the annual interest rate (or price increase) = 5% = 0.05
- n is the number of years = 3

First, we calculate the price after the first year:
A1 = 120(1 + 0.05) = 120 * 1.05 = $126

Then, we calculate the price after the second year:
A2 = 126(1 + 0.05) = 126 * 1.05 = $132.3

Finally, we calculate the price after the third year:
A3 = 132.3(1 + 0.05) = 132.3 * 1.05 = $139.115

Rounding to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many pictures Olivia put into each album. Since she put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide the total number of pictures by 8.

72 pictures / 8 albums = 9 pictures per album

Since 3 albums were selfies only, and 2 albums were portraits, the remaining 3 albums must be a mix of both selfies and portraits. However, the problem doesn't mention any other type of album, so we can assume that the remaining 3 albums are also selfies and portraits.

Now, let's find out how many pictures are in the 5 albums that contain both selfies and portraits. Since there are 8 albums in total, and 3 albums are selfies only and 2 albums are portraits, the remaining 3 albums must be a mix of both.

5 albums * 9 pictures per album = 45 pictures

Since 3 albums are selfies only, and each album has 9 pictures, the total number of selfies is:

3 albums * 9 pictures per album = 27 selfies

The remaining pictures are portraits. We know that Olivia has 72 pictures in total, and 45 pictures are in the 5 albums that contain both selfies and portraits. So, the number of portraits is:

72 total pictures - 45 pictures in mixed albums = 27 portraits

However, we know that 2 albums are portraits only, and each album has 9 pictures. So, the total number of portraits is:

2 albums * 9 pictures per album = 18 portraits

Since we already found that there are 27 portraits, and 18 portraits are in the 2 albums that are portraits only, the remaining portraits must be in the 3 albums that are a mix of selfies and portraits.

27 portraits - 18 portraits = 9 portraits in mixed albums

However, we know that each album has 9 pictures, and 3 albums are a mix of selfies and portraits. So, the total number of pictures in the mixed albums is:

3 albums * 9 pictures per album = 27 pictures

Since we already know that there are 45 pictures in the 5 albums that contain both selfies and portraits, and 27 pictures are in the 3 albums that are a mix of selfies and portraits, the remaining pictures must be portraits.

45 pictures in mixed albums - 27 pictures in 3 albums = 18 pictures in 2 albums

However, we know that 2 albums are portraits only, and each album has 9 pictures. So, the total number of portraits is:

2 albums * 9 pictures per album = 18 portraits

This is consistent with our previous answer.

The final answer is: 
Selfies: 27
Portraits: 27"
"To find the time James spends reading, we need to determine how long it takes him to read 18 pages. 

Since James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes, we can set up a ratio to find the time it takes to read 1 page. 

Time to read 3 pages / 3 pages = 10 minutes

To find the time to read 1 page, we can divide both sides of the ratio by 3:

Time to read 1 page = 10 minutes / 3
Time to read 1 page = 3.33 minutes (approximately)

Now, we can multiply the time to read 1 page by the total number of pages James reads:

Time to read 18 pages = Time to read 1 page * 18
Time to read 18 pages = 3.33 minutes * 18
Time to read 18 pages = 60 minutes

Therefore, James spends 60 minutes reading his book.

First, let's find the number of easy, average, and difficult questions:
- Total questions: 60
- Easy questions: 40% of 60 = 0.4 * 60 = 24
- Average and difficult questions: 60 - 24 = 36
- Since the average and difficult questions are equally divided, we have: 36 / 2 = 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

Now, let's find the number of questions Aries is sure to get in each category:
- Easy questions: 75% of 24 = 0.75 * 24 = 18
- Average questions: 50% of 18 = 0.5 * 18 = 9

"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a system of equations. Let's denote the number of small stuffed animals as 's' and the number of large stuffed animals as 'l'.

We know that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so we can write an equation based on this information:

s = 2l

We also know that the price of a small stuffed animal is $4, and the price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small one, which is $12. The total earnings from the sales are $120. We can write another equation based on this information:

4s + 12l = 120

Now we have a system of two equations:

s = 2l
4s + 12l = 120

We can substitute the first equation into the second one to solve for 'l':

4(2l) + 12l = 120
8l + 12l = 120
20l = 120
l = 6

Now that we have the value of 'l', we can find the value of 's' using the first equation:

s = 2l
s = 2(6)
s = 12

So, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe and then multiply it by 40 dwarves and 30 days.

First, let's find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with an iron pickaxe. Since he can mine twice as much with an iron pickaxe as with his bare hands, he can mine 2 * 12 = 24 pounds of ore per day with an iron pickaxe.

Next, let's find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe. He can mine 50% more with a steel pickaxe than with an iron pickaxe. To find 50% of 24 pounds, we multiply 24 by 0.5, which is 12. Then, we add this to 24 to get 24 + 12 = 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe.

Now, let's find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day with steel pickaxes. Since one dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe, 40 dwarves can mine 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds of ore per day.

Finally, let's find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in 30 days with steel pickaxes. We multiply 1440 pounds per day by 30 days to get 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds of ore.

The final answer is: 43200"
"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to establish the ratio of the number of sandwiches to the price for the first two packages. 

The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3, and the second package has 4 sandwiches for $6. 

We can set up a proportion to find the price per sandwich for the first two packages:

2 sandwiches / $3 = 4 sandwiches / x

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

2x = 4 * 3
2x = 12
x = 6

So, the price per sandwich is $6 / 4 = $1.5.

Now that we know the price per sandwich, we can find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches:

8 sandwiches * $1.5 per sandwich = $12

The final answer is: $12"
"To find out how much Tom has to pay per month, we first need to calculate how much he still owes after selling his old bedroom set. 

The cost of the bedroom set is $3000, and he sells his old bedroom for $1000. 

So, the amount he still owes is $3000 - $1000 = $2000.

Since he has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month, we need to calculate 10% of $2000.

10% of $2000 = 0.1 x $2000 = $200.

Therefore, Tom has to pay $200 per month. 

The final answer is: $200"
"To find the number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons after each incident.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

First, 40% of the red balloons burst. 
40% of 25 is 0.4 * 25 = 10. 
So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

Next, Sally released half of the yellow balloons. 
Half of 12 is 12 / 2 = 6. 
So, 6 yellow balloons were released, leaving 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.

Then, Sally found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch of balloons. 
75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6. 
So, 6 blue balloons were added to her clutch.

Now, let's add up the remaining balloons: 
15 red balloons + 7 green balloons + 6 yellow balloons + 6 blue balloons = 34 balloons.

The final number of balloons Sally carried into the school is 34."
"To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to consider the scenarios where he won't get an extension. 

First, let's find the probability that the substitute teacher won't collect the homework: 50% (chance of substitute teacher) * 100% (no extension from substitute) = 50%.

Next, let's find the probability that the normal teacher will come in and not give an extension: 50% (chance of normal teacher) * 80% (chance of no extension) = 40%.

Now, let's find the probability that the normal teacher will come in and Marcus won't get a personal extension: 50% (chance of normal teacher) * 60% (chance of no personal extension) = 30%.

The probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is the sum of the probabilities of these two scenarios: 50% (substitute teacher) + 30% (normal teacher with no extension) = 80%.

The final answer is: 80"
"To find out how many tickets each graduate can receive, we first need to determine the total number of available seats for guests. 

Total capacity of the Fine Arts Center: 6000
Seats for graduates: 950
Seats for faculty: 300

Total seats taken: 950 + 300 = 1250

Available seats for guests: 6000 - 1250 = 4750

Since there are 950 graduates, we need to divide the available seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate can receive.

4750 / 950 = 5

So, each graduate can receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationships between the different sizes of jelly beans. Let's start by defining the number of large beans as L, medium beans as M, and small beans as S.

We are given that it takes 75 large beans to fill Grandpa up, so L = 75.

We are also given that Grandpa can eat twice as many medium beans as large beans, so M = 2L. Substituting L = 75, we get M = 2 * 75 = 150.

Next, we are told that eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium bean, so S = 3M. Substituting M = 150, we get S = 3 * 150 = 450.

Therefore, Grandpa can eat 450 small beans.

The final answer is: 450"
"To find out how much Melissa makes per hour after expenses, we need to first calculate her total earnings and total expenses.

Total earnings: Melissa is paid $15 per day for 3 days, so her total earnings are 15 * 3 = $45.

Total expenses: Melissa pays $3 for parking each day for 3 days, so her total expenses are 3 * 3 = $9.

Now, let's calculate her net earnings: Net earnings = Total earnings - Total expenses = 45 - 9 = $36.

Since Melissa spends 6 hours a day for 3 days, her total hours worked is 6 * 3 = 18 hours.

To find out her hourly rate after expenses, we divide her net earnings by the total hours worked: Hourly rate = Net earnings / Total hours worked = 36 / 18 = $2 per hour.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of the books and the cost of the pencils separately and then add them together.

The cost of the books is 3 * 16 = 48 dollars.
The cost of the pencils is 3 * 6 = 18 dollars.

Now, we add the cost of the books and the cost of the pencils together: 48 + 18 = 66.

Ted spent a total of $66."
"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to first find out how many soda bottles he will place along the driveway. 

The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. To find the total number of bottles, we divide the width of the driveway by the spacing between the bottles:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Since it takes Richard 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, we multiply the number of bottles by the time it takes to place each one:

8 bottles * 5 seconds per bottle = 40 seconds

Therefore, it will take Richard 40 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find out how many packs of apples Uncle Franky can make, we need to first find out how many apples he has in total. Since he ordered two boxes and each box has 40 apples, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of apples in each box.

Number of boxes: 2
Number of apples per box: 40

Total number of apples = Number of boxes * Number of apples per box
Total number of apples = 2 * 40
Total number of apples = 80

Now, we need to find out how many packs of apples Uncle Franky can make with 80 apples. Each pack has 8 apples.

Number of apples per pack: 8
Total number of apples: 80

Number of packs = Total number of apples / Number of apples per pack
Number of packs = 80 / 8
Number of packs = 10

"To find out how much money Amor will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she bought and subtract that from the initial amount of money she had.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the cheese:

Parmesan cheese: 2 pounds * $11 per pound = $22
Mozzarella cheese: 3 pounds * $6 per pound = $18
Total cost of cheese: $22 + $18 = $40

Now, let's subtract the total cost of the cheese from the initial amount of money Amor had:
$50 - $40 = $10

So, Amor will have $10 left to buy meat.

The final answer is: $10"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim lost while in college, including the loan amount and the income he could have earned if he had worked.

The total loan amount is $50,000 per year for 4 years, so the total loan amount is:
$50,000 * 4 = $200,000

The income he could have earned if he had worked is $25,000 per year for 4 years, so the total income he lost is:
$25,000 * 4 = $100,000

The total amount of money Jim lost is the sum of the loan amount and the income he could have earned:
$200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000

Since his college degree tripled his income, his new income is $25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year.

To find out how long it would take him to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost, we can use the formula for future value of a single amount:

FV = PV x (1 + r)^n

where FV is the future value, PV is the present value (the amount he needs to earn), r is the interest rate, and n is the number of years.

However, since we are not given an interest rate, we can assume a simple interest rate of 0% for simplicity. In this case, the formula becomes:

FV = PV x n

We want to find the number of years (n) it would take to earn $300,000 at a rate of $75,000 per year.

n = PV / r
n = $300,000 / $75,000
n = 4

So, it would take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school."
"To find the area of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide, so the fabric pieces will be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than that.

New length = 6 + 2 = 8 feet
New width = 8 + 2 = 10 feet

Now, we can calculate the area of one fabric piece:
Area = length * width
Area = 8 * 10
Area = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area by 2:
Total area = 2 * 80
Total area = 160 square feet

The final answer is: 160"
"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then add them together.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. One-fifth of 425 is 425 / 5 = 85. 17 more than that is 85 + 17 = 102. So, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. Twice as many as Tuesday is 102 * 2 = 204. 5 more than that is 204 + 5 = 209. So, on Wednesday, they delivered 209 letters.

Now, let's add the number of letters delivered each day: 425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736.

The final answer is: 736"
"To find the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad separately and then add them together.

The cost of the chicken salad is 10 people * $6.50 per person = $65.
The cost of the pasta salad is 6 people * $6 per person = $36.

Now, we add the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad together: $65 + $36 = $101.

The total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $101."
"To find the average loss, we need to calculate the total loss and then divide it by the number of races.

First, let's calculate the amount lost in the first race: -$5.

In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. The amount he lost in the first race was -$5, so twice that amount is 2 * (-5) = -10. He won $1 more than that, so he won -10 + 1 = -9.

In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. He won $9 in the second race, so he lost 1.5 * 9 = 13.5 in the third race.

Now, let's calculate the total loss: -5 (first race) + (-9) (second race) + (-13.5) (third race) = -27.5.

There were 3 races, so the average loss is -27.5 / 3 = -9.17.

"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we first need to convert Xavier's height from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, Xavier's height in inches is 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches.

Now, we add the growth to Xavier's height: 48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches.

Next, we add Cole's growth to his original height: 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches.

Finally, we find the difference between Cole's and Xavier's heights: 52 inches - 51 inches = 1 inch.

The final answer is: 1"
"To solve this problem, we can start by assigning variables to the unknowns. Let's say the amount taken by the first person is x.

Since the second person took $80 more than the first, the amount taken by the second person is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the amount taken by the third person is 2(x + 80).

We know that the total amount taken by all three people is $1920, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920

Combine like terms again:

4x + 240 = 1920

Subtract 240 from both sides:

4x = 1680

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 420

So the first person took $420.

The final answer is: $420"
"To find the total hours worked by each painter, we need to calculate the total hours worked in 3 weeks and then divide it by the number of painters and the number of days they worked.

First, let's convert 3 weeks to days: 3 weeks = 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Since they worked 3/8ths of a day every day, we need to find the fraction of a day in hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3/8 of a day is (3/8) * 24 = 9 hours.

Now, we multiply the hours worked per day by the number of days: 9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours.

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4: 189 hours / 4 = 47.25 hours.

The final answer is: 47.25"
"Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. 

Since Rory retrieved four more balls in the first set than in the second, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set, which is given as 19. We can write the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for x, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Combine like terms:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms again:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

Number of balls in the first set = x + 4
= 6 + 4

"To find the price of the car in the year 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year from 2007 to 2010.

The initial price of the car is $20,000.

The depreciation rate is 21% per year.

In 2008, the price of the car will be:
$20,000 - (21% of $20,000) = $20,000 - $4,200 = $15,800

In 2009, the price of the car will be:
$15,800 - (21% of $15,800) = $15,800 - $3,326 = $12,474

In 2010, the price of the car will be:
$12,474 - (21% of $12,474) = $12,474 - $2,623.14 = $9,850.86

The price of the car in the year 2010 is $9,850.86."

"To find the total number of loads of laundry Greg does in a week, we need to calculate the total number of sheets he puts on the beds and divide it by the number of sheets he can wash at a time.

There are 2 twin beds and 1 king bed. Each twin bed has 1 set of sheets, and the king bed has 1 set of sheets. So, the total number of sheets he puts on the beds every week is 2 (twin) + 1 (king) = 3 sets of sheets.

Since he can wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 2 and 1, which is 2. This means he can wash 2 sets of sheets (1 twin set and 1 king set) at a time.

Now, let's calculate the total number of loads of laundry he does in a week:

3 sets of sheets / 2 sets of sheets per load = 1.5 loads per week

Since he can't do half a load, we round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can calculate the number of loads by considering the number of twin and king sets separately.

He has 2 twin sets and 1 king set. He can wash 2 twin sets at a time and 1 king set at a time. So, he can wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set in 1 load, and the remaining 1 twin set in another load. Therefore, he does 2 loads of laundry per week.

Now, to find the total number of loads of laundry he does in a year, we multiply the number of loads per week by the number of weeks in a year:

2 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 104 loads/year

"To find out how many days the cat food will last, we need to divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the amount of cat food each cat eats per day (60 grams).

First, we need to calculate the total amount of cat food each cat eats per day. Since Imma has 3 cats and each cat eats 60 grams of food twice a day, we multiply 60 grams by 2 to get the daily consumption per cat: 60 * 2 = 120 grams.

Now, we multiply the daily consumption per cat by the number of cats: 120 * 3 = 360 grams.

Next, we divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the total daily consumption (360 grams): 720 / 360 = 2.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many slices Jake and Silvia ate. 

Let's denote the number of slices Jake ate as 'x'. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, Becky ate x + 3 slices. We are given that Becky ate 10 slices, so we can set up the equation x + 3 = 10.

Solving for x, we get x = 7. This means Jake ate 7 slices.

Since Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, Silvia ate 2x = 2 * 7 = 14 slices.

Now, we know Becky ate 10 slices, Jake ate 7 slices, and Silvia ate 14 slices. To find the total number of slices they ate, we add these numbers together: 10 + 7 + 14 = 31.

The total number of slices they ate is 31."
"Let's denote the time Donovan took to make his part as 'x'. Since Betsy took 18 minutes longer than Donovan, the time Betsy took is 'x + 18'. 

The total time taken to make the meal is the sum of the time taken by both Betsy and Donovan, which is given as 98 minutes. So, we can write the equation as:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:
2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Since x represents the time Donovan took, and Betsy took 18 minutes longer, Betsy's time is x + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

"To calculate the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to calculate the costs of the cast, the visit, the painkillers, and the parking.

1. The cost of the cast is $200.
2. The cost of the visit is $300/hour for 0.5 hours (since it's a 30-minute visit). So, the cost of the visit is $300 * 0.5 = $150.
3. The cost of the painkillers is $4/pill for 30 pills. So, the cost of the painkillers is $4 * 30 = $120.
4. The cost of parking is $6/hour for a minimum of 2 hours. Since the visit is only 0.5 hours, the cost of parking is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, let's add up the costs:
$200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482

On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add up the number of classes that visited each day:
32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 = 207

The final answer is: 207"
"To find the average score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the number of tests. 

First, let's add up the scores of the first 3 tests: 100 + 100 + 100 = 300. 

Then, we add the score of the 4th test: 300 + 80 = 380.

Now, we divide the total score by the number of tests: 380 / 4 = 95.

The final answer is: 95"
"To find the total number of pizzas left, we need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club and the football team, and then subtract that from the total number of pizzas ordered.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. 
70% of 20 is 0.7 * 20 = 14 pizzas eaten by the glee club.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. 
They ate 80% of them, which is 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas eaten by the football team.

The total number of pizzas eaten is 14 (by the glee club) + 32 (by the football team) = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered is 20 (by the glee club) + 40 (by the football team) = 60 pizzas.

The number of pizzas left is 60 (total pizzas) - 46 (pizzas eaten) = 14 pizzas.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of big coupons. Since Anthony wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, and he's sending out 700 small coupons, he'll send out 2 * 700 = 1400 big coupons.

The cost of mailing the small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents.

The cost of mailing the big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

Now, let's add the cost of mailing the small and big coupons together: 3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100: 24500 / 100 = 245 dollars.

The final answer is: $245"
"To find out how many meatballs were in the sub sandwiches that remained, we need to follow the steps:

1. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches. 
   So, Sidney ordered 10 - 3 = 7 meatball sub sandwiches.

2. Each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs. 
   So, the total number of meatballs in 7 sub sandwiches is 7 * 4 = 28.

3. Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. 
   So, the number of sub sandwiches remaining is 7 - 4 = 3.

4. Sidney ordered another 3 sub sandwiches. 
   So, the total number of sub sandwiches now is 3 + 3 = 6.

5. The total number of meatballs in 6 sub sandwiches is 6 * 4 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we first need to find the number of trucks that did not experience mechanical failures. 

Since a quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures, we can find the number of trucks that failed by multiplying the total number of trucks by 1/4 (which is the same as 0.25).

Number of trucks that failed = 20 * 0.25 = 5

Now, we subtract the number of trucks that failed from the total number of trucks to find the number of trucks that reached the farmers.

Number of trucks that reached the farmers = 20 - 5 = 15

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, we can find the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers by multiplying the number of trucks that reached the farmers by 20.

Total tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers = 15 * 20 = 300

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the total cost of the butter, we first need to determine how much Dennis will pay for 6 pounds of butter with the promotion. 

Since the promotion is buy one pound of butter get one half off, we can consider it as a 50% discount on the second pound of butter for every pair of pounds purchased. 

Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter, so he will buy 6 pounds in pairs of 2 pounds each. 

For every pair of 2 pounds, he will pay for 2 pounds at the full price and get the second pound at half price. 

The cost for 2 pounds at full price is 2 * $4.00 = $8.00. 

The cost for the second pound at half price is 1 * $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.

So, the total cost for every pair of 2 pounds is $8.00 + $2.00 = $10.00.

Since Dennis needs 6 pounds, he will buy 3 pairs of 2 pounds each. 

The total cost for 6 pounds of butter will be 3 * $10.00 = $30.00.

The final answer is: $30.00"
"To find the total cost of the party, we need to calculate the number of additional guests and then multiply that by the cost per guest, and add the initial fee.

First, let's find the total number of guests: 
Kayla invited 25 classmates + 7 dance class girls + 13 family members = 45 guests
However, 4 people said they could not come, so we subtract those from the total: 
45 - 4 = 41

Since the initial fee is for 20 guests, we need to find the number of additional guests: 
41 - 20 = 21

Now, we multiply the number of additional guests by the cost per guest: 
21 * $6 = $126

Finally, we add the initial fee to the cost of the additional guests: 
$125 + $126 = $251

The final answer is: $251"
"To find out how much money Maggie and Riza have left, we need to first determine how much money they spent. 

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which is 1/4. Since she had $60, we can calculate the amount she spent as follows:

Maggie's money spent = (1/4) * 60 = 15

Now, let's find out how much money Maggie has left:

Maggie's money left = 60 - 15 = 45

Riza spent one-third of her money, which is 1/3. Since she also had $60, we can calculate the amount she spent as follows:

Riza's money spent = (1/3) * 60 = 20

Now, let's find out how much money Riza has left:

Riza's money left = 60 - 20 = 40

To find the total amount of money they have left, we add Maggie's and Riza's remaining money:

Total money left = Maggie's money left + Riza's money left = 45 + 40 = 85

The final answer is: $85"
"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to first determine how many bananas the first and second monkeys eat each day. 

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day.

Since there are three monkeys in total, the total number of bananas they eat each day is 10 + 14 + x, where x is the number of bananas the third monkey eats. However, we know that the total number of bananas is 315, and they last for a week, which is 7 days. 

So, the total number of bananas eaten in a week is 315 * 7 = 2205 bananas. 

Since the first two monkeys eat 10 + 14 = 24 bananas each day, the total number of bananas they eat in a week is 24 * 7 = 168 bananas. 

Now, we can find the number of bananas the third monkey eats in a week by subtracting the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total number of bananas: 2205 - 168 = 2037 bananas. However, this is the total for the week, not the daily amount. 

To find the daily amount, we divide the total number of bananas eaten by the third monkey in a week by 7: 2037 / 7 = 291. 

However, this is the total for the week, not the daily amount. We need to find the daily amount of bananas the third monkey eats. To do this, we need to find the total number of bananas the third monkey eats in a day. 

Since the first two monkeys eat 24 bananas each day, the total number of bananas left for the third monkey is 315 - 24 = 291 bananas. 

Now, we can find the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day by subtracting the number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total number of bananas: 291 - 24 = 267 bananas. However, this is the total for the day, not the amount eaten by the third monkey.

"To find out how much Jenny paid for the roses, we need to calculate the cost of 15 roses. Since roses cost $2 each, the total cost would be 15 * 2 = $30. However, since she bought a dozen roses for $15, we need to subtract the cost of the dozen from the total cost. 

15 roses - 1 dozen (12 roses) = 3 roses left to buy at $2 each. 
3 * 2 = $6. 
So, the cost of the 3 roses is $6. 
Now, subtract the cost of the dozen roses from the total cost: 
$30 - $15 = $15. 
So, the total cost of the roses is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny arrived with five $5 bills, which is a total of 5 * 5 = $25. 

To find out how much change she gets, we need to subtract the cost of the roses from the amount she paid with: 
$25 - $21 = $4.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the $4 into quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so we multiply $4 by 4 to get the total number of quarters: 
$4 * 4 = 16 quarters.

Jenny leaves with 16 quarters."
"To find the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to calculate the total revenue from each item and then add them together.

"To find the total time Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the time intervals between the trains and the time Paul needs to wait for the fourth train.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the first train leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves the station. Since the first train leaves at 30 minutes, the second train arrives at 30 + 30 = 60 minutes.

3. The second train stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

4. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves the station. Since the second train leaves at 65 minutes, the third train arrives at 65 + 60 = 125 minutes.

5. The third train leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it leaves at 125 minutes.

6. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station. Since the third train leaves at 125 minutes, the fourth train arrives at 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

Now, we need to find the time Paul needs to wait for the fourth train. Since the problem doesn't specify the current time, we'll assume Paul arrives at the station at time 0. The fourth train arrives at 145 minutes, so Paul needs to wait 145 minutes for his train.

"To find out how many more weeks Melanie needs to save toothpicks, we first need to determine how many toothpicks she has saved so far. 

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. 
So, the total number of toothpicks saved = 10 * 12 = 120

Since Melanie needs 200 toothpicks for the sculpture, and she already has 120, we need to find out how many more toothpicks she needs to save. 
Number of toothpicks needed = 200 - 120 = 80

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to save 80 toothpicks at the rate of 10 toothpicks per week. 
Number of weeks = 80 / 10 = 8

"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to first find the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch and then the price at which he sold it to his friend.

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price, so the price he paid is:

$2000 x 0.75 = $1500

Then, he sold it to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, so the price his friend paid is:

$1500 x 1.20 = $1800

Now, to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to find the difference between the original price and the price his friend paid, and then divide it by the original price and multiply by 100:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours and then multiply it by the number of jellyfish each spring creates per second. 

There are 60 seconds in 1 minute, 60 minutes in 1 hour, and 4 hours in the given time frame. 

60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour * 4 hours = 14400 seconds

Since each spring creates 1 jellyfish per second, we multiply the total seconds by the number of springs:

14400 seconds * 5 springs = 72000 jellyfish

The final answer is: 72000"
"To find Frankie's score, we need to first determine what ""twice as high as Binkie's"" means. This means we multiply Binkie's score by 2. 

Binkie's score is 90, so twice as high as Binkie's would be 2 * 90 = 180.

The problem states that Frankie's score is 15 better than twice as high as Binkie's. So, we add 15 to 180 to find Frankie's score.

Frankie's score = 180 + 15 = 195

The final answer is: 195"
"To find the total time James took, we need to calculate the total distance he traveled and then divide it by his speed.

The total distance James traveled is the distance to the store plus the distance back home, which is 4 miles + 4 miles = 8 miles.

Since James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour, we can use the formula time = distance / speed to find the total time.

time = 8 miles / 4 miles per hour = 2 hours

However, this is the total time for the round trip. Since James walked to the store and then back home, we need to find the time it took him to reach the store, which is half of the total time.

Time to reach the store = total time / 2 = 2 hours / 2 = 1 hour

The final answer is: 1"
"To find out how much money Jenny saved, we first need to calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually and then compare it to the cost of buying them in bunches.

If Jenny buys 10 bunches with 4 bananas per bunch, she gets a total of 10 * 4 = 40 bananas.

The cost of buying 40 bananas individually would be 40 * $0.80 = $32.00.

The cost of buying 10 bunches is $3.00 per bunch, so the total cost is 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

To find out how much money Jenny saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations. Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as 'x' and the amount Harry gets as 'y'. We know that the total amount of fence is 100 feet, and Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam. 

We can write the system of equations as:

x + y = 100 (since the total amount of fence is 100 feet)
y = x + 60 (since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for x:

x + (x + 60) = 100
Combine like terms:
2x + 60 = 100
Subtract 60 from both sides:
2x = 40
Divide both sides by 2:
x = 20

Now that we know Sam gets 20 feet of fence, we can find the amount left over for Sam by subtracting the amount he gets from the total amount of fence:
100 - 20 = 80

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the rate of growth per year, we need to divide the growth in inches by the number of years. 

Growth rate per year = 8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches/year

Now, we can multiply the growth rate per year by the number of years to find the total growth in 13 years.

Total growth in 13 years = 2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches

The final answer is: 26"
"To find the total amount Marcel earned from selling bicycles, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply it by its price.

First, let's find the number of each type of bike sold:

- Total bikes sold: 300
- Trekking bikes: Half of 300 = 300 / 2 = 150
- BMX bikes: 15% of 300 = 0.15 * 300 = 45
- MTB bikes: Total bikes - (Trekking bikes + BMX bikes) = 300 - (150 + 45) = 105

Now, let's calculate the total earnings from each type of bike:

- Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500
- BMX bikes: 45 * $250 (half of $500) = 45 * $250 = $11,250
- MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500

Now, let's add up the earnings from each type of bike to find the total amount Marcel earned:

$67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250

The final answer is: $131,250"
"To find the total number of bales made by the farmer, we multiply the number of bales made per hour by the number of hours worked. 

5 bales/hour * 6 hours = 30 bales

To find the total number of bales picked up by the truck, we multiply the number of bales picked up per hour by the number of hours worked.

3 bales/hour * 6 hours = 18 bales

Now, we subtract the total number of bales picked up by the truck from the total number of bales made by the farmer to find the number of bales left in the field.

30 bales - 18 bales = 12 bales

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total minutes John spends in class, we first need to find out how many minutes he spends in class per day. Since he has 2 extra classes and each class is 40 minutes long, he spends 2 * 40 = 80 minutes in class per day.

Since he goes to class for 5 days a week, he spends 5 * 80 = 400 minutes in class per week.

Next, we need to find out how many minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday. Since he spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on these days, we first need to find out his total weekly minutes. There are 24 hours in a day, and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 24 * 60 = 1440 minutes in a day. Since there are 7 days in a week, there are 7 * 1440 = 10080 minutes in a week.

1/16 of 10080 minutes is (1/16) * 10080 = 630 minutes.

So, John spends 630 minutes on Saturday and Sunday.

Now, we add the minutes he spends in class to the minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday to get his total weekly minutes: 400 + 630 = 1030 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 1030 / 60 = 17.17 hours.

The final answer is: 17.17"
"To find the height of the ball on its second bounce, we need to first find the initial height from which it is dropped. Since the third floor is 24 feet high, the initial height is 3 * 24 = 72 feet.

The ball bounces to 2/3rds of its starting height with each bounce. So, on the first bounce, it will reach a height of 2/3 * 72 = 48 feet.

On the second bounce, it will reach a height of 2/3 * 48 = 32 feet.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the height of each child in inches. 

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 6 feet to inches by multiplying 6 by 12. 
6 feet * 12 inches/foot = 72 inches

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so we add 2 inches to the height of the first child.
72 inches + 2 inches = 74 inches

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so we subtract 5 inches from the height of the second child.
74 inches - 5 inches = 69 inches

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so we add 3 inches to the height of the third child.
69 inches + 3 inches = 72 inches

The final answer is: 72"
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to determine how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we can divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10).

2000 ÷ 10 = 200

So, the orchard sold 200 bags of apples.

Since each bag is sold at $5, we can multiply the number of bags sold by the price per bag to find the total earnings.

200 * 5 = 1000

The orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples.

The final answer is: $1000"
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards. 

Let's start with the information that the Allosaurus gulped down the last 270 kilograms of meat. Since they ate the last part, the remaining meat before they ate was 270 kilograms. 

Before the Allosaurus ate, the velociraptors scavenged half of what was left. This means the velociraptors ate half of 270 kilograms, which is 270 / 2 = 135 kilograms. 

So, the remaining meat before the velociraptors ate was 270 + 135 = 405 kilograms.

Before the velociraptors ate, the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops. This means the T-Rex ate half of the 405 kilograms, which is 405 / 2 = 202.5 kilograms.

To find the original weight of the triceratops, we need to add the weight eaten by the T-Rex to the remaining weight. The remaining weight was 405 - 202.5 = 202.5 kilograms. 

So, the original weight of the triceratops was 202.5 + 202.5 = 405 kilograms.

The final answer is: 405"
"To calculate the total cost of painting the room, we need to find the total area of the walls that need to be painted. 

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so their area is 10 * 8 = 80 square feet each. Since there are two of them, their total area is 2 * 80 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so their area is 5 * 8 = 40 square feet each. Since there are two of them, their total area is 2 * 40 = 80 square feet.

The total area of the walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

Each gallon costs $12, so the total cost is 12 * 12 = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To find the probability that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to consider the remaining number of shaken and unshaken sodas after Ellen's brother took some.

Initially, there were 3 shaken sodas and 9 unshaken sodas. Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving us with:

- 2 shaken sodas
- 7 unshaken sodas

Ellen's friend will choose a soda randomly from the remaining 9 sodas (2 shaken + 7 unshaken). The probability of choosing a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas:

Probability = Number of shaken sodas / Total number of sodas
= 2 / 9

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

Probability = (2 / 9) * 100
= 22.22%

The final answer is: 22.22"
"To find the distance between the two trains, we need to calculate the distance each train travels in 3 hours and then add those distances together.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. To find the distance it travels in 3 hours, we multiply its speed by the time:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour x 3 hours
Distance = 180 miles

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. To find the distance it travels in 3 hours, we multiply its speed by the time:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour x 3 hours
Distance = 90 miles

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, we add the distances they traveled to find the total distance between them:

Total Distance = 180 miles + 90 miles
Total Distance = 270 miles

The final answer is: 270"
"To find the total number of days Billy helps, we first need to calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th. 

March has 31 days, and April has 19 days until the 19th. So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, we need to find 20% of 50. To do this, we multiply 50 by 0.20: 50 * 0.20 = 10.

Now, we subtract the number of days off from the total number of days: 50 - 10 = 40.

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

To find the total number of people Billy helps, we multiply the number of days he works by the number of people he can help per day: 40 * 6 = 240.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the total number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people who were transported by the buses and the cars, and then subtract that from the total number of people who were present.

First, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the buses:
12 buses * 35 people per bus = 12 * 35 = 420 people

Next, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the cars:
20 cars * 3 people per car = 20 * 3 = 60 people

Now, let's add the number of people transported by the buses and the cars:
420 people + 60 people = 480 people

Since the question asks for the number of people inside the church, we need to subtract the number of people transported from the total number of people present. However, the question does not provide the total number of people present. It only provides the number of private cars and buses. Therefore, we can only calculate the number of people transported by the buses and the cars.

However, if we assume that the total number of people present is the sum of the number of people transported by the buses and the cars, then the number of people inside the church would be 0.

But if we assume that the total number of people present is the sum of the number of people transported by the buses and the cars plus the number of people who were not transported (i.e., the people who were already inside the church), then we would need more information to calculate the number of people inside the church.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the age of Jeff. We know that Mike is 24 years old, and Martha is 4 years younger than Mike. 

Let's denote Martha's age as M. Since Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, we can write the equation:
M = 24 - 4
M = 20

Now, we know that Jeff is 10 years older than Martha. Let's denote Jeff's age as J. We can write the equation:
J = M + 10
J = 20 + 10
J = 30

So, Jeff is 30 years old.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the time it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of each slide by the speed at which people slide down.

For the biggest slide: 
Time = Length / Speed = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide: 
Time = Length / Speed = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

To find the difference in time, we subtract the time it takes to ride the second biggest slide from the time it takes to ride the biggest slide:
Difference in time = Time for biggest slide - Time for second biggest slide = 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks, we need to calculate the total time spent per day and then multiply it by 5.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 x 15-minute breaks per day. 
Total time spent per day = 30 minutes (lunch) + 2 x 15 minutes (breaks) = 30 + 30 = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60. 
60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Now, we multiply the time spent per day by 5 to find the total time spent in 5 days.
1 hour/day * 5 days = 5 hours

The total time spent on lunch and breaks in 5 days is 5 hours. 

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we first need to determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can multiply 8 by 3.5 to find out how many miles Micah ran.

8 * 3.5 = 28

Now that we know Micah ran 28 miles, we can subtract the total miles run by Amber and Micah from the total miles run by all three to find out how many miles Ahito ran.

Total miles run by all three = 52
Miles run by Amber = 8
Miles run by Micah = 28
Miles run by Ahito = Total miles run by all three - (Miles run by Amber + Miles run by Micah)
Miles run by Ahito = 52 - (8 + 28)
Miles run by Ahito = 52 - 36
Miles run by Ahito = 16

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased after returning the $15.00 item and then add that to the initial charge.

First, let's calculate the amount Sheila got back after returning the item:
$85.00 (initial charge) - $15.00 (returned item) = $70.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of the frying pan with a 20% discount:
Original price of the frying pan = $20.00
Discount = 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
Price after discount = $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

Now, let's calculate the cost of the set of towels with a 10% discount:
Original price of the towels = $30.00
Discount = 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
Price after discount = $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Now, let's add the cost of the frying pan and the towels to the amount Sheila got back after returning the item:
$70.00 (amount after return) + $16.00 (frying pan) + $27.00 (towels) = $113.00

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. 

A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is x/5.

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (x/5) * (1/3) = x/15.

We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color, so we can set up the equation x/15 = 6.

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 15, which gives us x = 6 * 15 = 90.

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find Caroline's age, we need to determine Ben's age first, and then multiply it by 3.

Since Chris is 4 years old, and Ben is two times older than Chris, we can calculate Ben's age as follows:
Ben's age = 2 * Chris's age
Ben's age = 2 * 4
Ben's age = 8

Now that we know Ben's age, we can find Caroline's age by multiplying Ben's age by 3:
Caroline's age = 3 * Ben's age
Caroline's age = 3 * 8
Caroline's age = 24

The final answer is: 24"
"To calculate the number of years Lauren needs to work, we need to determine how much she needs to save for retirement. 

First, let's calculate her desired annual retirement income: 
40% of $100,000 = 0.4 * $100,000 = $40,000 per year.

Since she plans to live for 20 years in retirement, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to save for retirement:
$40,000 * 20 years = $800,000.

Next, let's calculate her annual savings rate as a percentage of her salary:
20% of $100,000 = 0.2 * $100,000 = $20,000 per year.

Now, we can calculate the number of years she needs to work to save $800,000 at a rate of $20,000 per year:
Number of years = Total savings / Annual savings
= $800,000 / $20,000
= 40 years.

However, this is the total number of years she needs to work to save for retirement, but we need to subtract the 20 years she plans to live in retirement. 
Number of years to work = Total years - Retirement years
= 40 years - 20 years
= 20 years.

"To find the length of each final cut, we need to first divide the total length of the ribbon by the number of parts it will be cut into initially, and then divide that result by the number of parts each of those will be cut into.

First, divide the total length of the ribbon (100 cm) by the number of parts it will be cut into initially (4):
100 cm / 4 = 25 cm

Then, divide the result by the number of parts each of those will be cut into (5):
25 cm / 5 = 5 cm

So, each final cut will be 5 cm long.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total population of the school, we can use the information given about the boys. Since 40% of the school population is 240 boys, we can set up the equation:

40% of x = 240

To find x, we can convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100:

0.4x = 240

Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 0.4:

x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

So, the total population of the school is 600.

Since 40% of the school population is boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. We can find the number of girls by multiplying the total population by 0.6 (60% as a decimal):

Number of girls = 0.6 * 600
Number of girls = 360

The final answer is: 360"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to add the cost of the pots and the garden soil, then subtract the coupon discount.

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad needs to hike, we first need to calculate the total number of days in June. June has 30 days.

Since Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in 30 days, we can calculate her daily target by dividing the total miles by the number of days:

9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

Soledad is planning to hike 125 miles twice a day, which is a total of 250 miles per day. To find out how many more miles per day she needs to hike, we subtract her planned daily miles from her target daily miles:

310 miles per day - 250 miles per day = 60 miles per day

So, Soledad needs to hike 60 more miles per day to complete her journey on time.

"To find out how much money Raymond has left, we need to subtract the amount he spent from the amount he had initially, and then add the amount he saved.

Raymond initially had $21. He saved $11, so we add that to his initial amount: $21 + $11 = $32.

Then, he spent $5 on a comic book and $19 on a puzzle, so we subtract the total amount he spent from the new total: $32 - ($5 + $19) = $32 - $24 = $8.

So, Raymond has $8 left.

"To find out how much each book cost, we need to first determine how much money Anna spent on the books. We know she had a budget of $16 and had $2 left, so she spent $16 - $2 = $14 on the books.

Since Anna bought 2 books and they cost the same amount, we can divide the total amount spent ($14) by 2 to find the cost of each book. 

$14 ÷ 2 = $7

So, each book cost $7."
"To find the number of students enrolled this year, we need to calculate 20% of the original number of students and add it to the original number.

20% of 50 is 0.20 x 50 = 10.

So, the increase in enrollment is 10 students.

To find the total number of students this year, we add the increase to the original number:

50 (original number of students) + 10 (increase) = 60.

Therefore, there are 60 students enrolled in the calligraphy class this year.

First, let's find the rate of blinking per minute: 
255 blinks / 5 minutes = 51 blinks per minute

Now, we can use this rate to find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times:
Time = Total blinks / Rate per minute
Time = 459 blinks / 51 blinks per minute
Time = 9 minutes

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 18 hours."
"To find the total distance John drives in a round trip, we need to calculate the distance of one way and then multiply it by 2.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 70 mph * 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles (one way)

Since John visits his parents twice a month, we need to multiply the one-way distance by 2 to get the total round-trip distance.
Total round-trip distance = 140 miles * 2
Total round-trip distance = 280 miles

Since John visits his parents twice a month, we need to multiply the total round-trip distance by 2 to get the total distance driven in a month.
Total distance driven in a month = 280 miles * 2
Total distance driven in a month = 560 miles

Since Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days, we need to divide the total distance Sofie will walk by 2 to find out how far Brian will walk.

70 miles / 2 = 35 miles

Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers and then find out how many toys the fifth worker needs to produce to meet the remaining demand.

First, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the 2 workers who produce 6 toys an hour:

2 workers * 6 toys/hour * 10 hours = 120 toys

Next, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour:

2 workers * 4 toys/hour * 10 hours = 80 toys

Now, let's add the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers:

120 toys + 80 toys = 200 toys

Since the manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to meet the order, the total number of toys needed is 400. We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

200 (toys produced by the first 4 workers) + x (toys produced by the fifth worker) = 400

To find the number of toys produced by the fifth worker, we can subtract 200 from both sides of the equation:

x = 400 - 200
x = 200

However, this is the total number of toys the fifth worker needs to produce in 10 hours. To find the number of toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we can divide the total number of toys by the number of hours:

x / 10 hours = 200 / 10
x = 20 toys/hour

"To find the total weight of Elijah's dogs, we first need to find the weight of each of his dogs. 

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so we multiply 60 by 1/4 to find the weight of Elijah's first dog: 
60 * 1/4 = 60/4 = 15 pounds.

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so we multiply 60 by 1/2 to find the weight of Elijah's second dog: 
60 * 1/2 = 60/2 = 30 pounds.

Now, we add the weights of Elijah's two dogs to find the total weight of his dogs: 
15 + 30 = 45 pounds.

To find the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs, we add the weight of Kory's dog to the total weight of Elijah's dogs: 
45 + 60 = 105 pounds.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find Liam's age two years ago. Since Liam is 16 years old now, two years ago he was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.

Two years ago, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince, so we can set up the equation:

14 = 2x

where x is Vince's age two years ago.

To find x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 14 / 2
x = 7

Since x is Vince's age two years ago, we need to add 2 to find his current age:

Vince's current age = 7 + 2
Vince's current age = 9

"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a system of equations. Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold as A, Madeline as M, Camden as C, and Sarah as S.

We know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so we can write an equation:

A = M

We also know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. We can write another equation:

C + S = 30
C = S + 12

We can substitute the second equation into the first one to get:

S + 12 + S = 30

Combine like terms:

2S + 12 = 30

Subtract 12 from both sides:

2S = 18

Divide by 2:

S = 9

Now that we know Sarah painted 9 eggs, we can find out how many eggs Camden painted:

C = S + 12
C = 9 + 12
C = 21

Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, we can find out how many eggs they painted by subtracting the total number of eggs painted by Camden and Sarah from the total number of eggs:

A + M = 56 - (C + S)
A + M = 56 - (21 + 9)
A + M = 26

Since A = M, we can substitute A for M:

A + A = 26
2A = 26

Divide by 2:

A = 13

Now that we know Arnold painted 13 eggs, we can find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:

C - A = 21 - 13
C - A = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we first need to find the total number of boxes and the total weight of the crayons and boxes in ounces.

Since Nik has 200 crayons and each box can hold 8 crayons, we can divide 200 by 8 to find the total number of boxes: 200 / 8 = 25 boxes.

The total weight of the crayons is the number of crayons multiplied by the weight of each crayon, which is 200 * 1 = 200 ounces.

The total weight of the boxes is the number of boxes multiplied by the weight of each box, which is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

The total weight of the crayons and boxes in ounces is 200 (crayons) + 200 (boxes) = 400 ounces.

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we can divide the total weight in ounces by 16 to find the total weight in pounds: 400 / 16 = 25 pounds.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how much John makes, we first need to calculate the total number of logs he can make from the tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, we multiply 80% by the total length of the tree.

80% of 80 feet = 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet

Since each log is 4 feet long, we divide the total length of the logs by the length of each log to find the total number of logs.

64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs

From each log, he cuts 5 planks, so we multiply the total number of logs by 5 to find the total number of planks.

16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks

He sells each plank for $1.2, so we multiply the total number of planks by the price per plank to find the total amount he makes.

80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96

"To find the total amount of money they all have together, we need to first find the salary of Valerie's brother and their mother.

Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is 1/2 of what her brother earns. So, her brother's salary is 2 times Valerie's salary, which is 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary. The combined salary of Valerie and her brother is $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000. So, their mother's salary is 2 * $15,000 = $30,000.

Now, we add up their salaries to find the total amount of money they all have together: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The final answer is: $40,000"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the speed at which Grandma walks on the beach and the sidewalk. Let's denote the speed on the beach as x miles per minute. Since she walks twice as fast on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.

We know that she walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk, and the total time spent on the beach is 40 minutes. We can set up the equation based on the formula: time = distance/speed.

For the beach: 2 miles / x miles/minute = 40 minutes
For the sidewalk: 1 mile / 2x miles/minute = t minutes (we don't know t yet)

We can solve the first equation for x: 2/x = 40, x = 1/20 miles/minute.

Now we can find the time spent on the sidewalk: 1 / (2 * 1/20) = 1 / (1/10) = 10 minutes.

The total time is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk: 40 + 10 = 50 minutes.

"To find out how many more weeks it will take Jane to save a total of $60, we first need to calculate how much she has saved so far. 

She has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so we multiply the amount she saves per week by the number of weeks: 
$4/week * 8 weeks = $32

Now, we need to find out how much more she needs to save to reach her goal of $60. 
$60 (goal) - $32 (already saved) = $28

Since she saves $4 per week, we can divide the amount she still needs to save by the amount she saves per week to find out how many more weeks it will take:
$28 / $4/week = 7 weeks

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

3 trees * 7 blue birds/tree = 21 blue birds

Next, let's calculate the number of blue birds in the 2 trees with 4 blue birds each:
2 trees * 4 blue birds/tree = 8 blue birds

Then, we add the number of blue birds in the last tree:
1 tree * 3 blue birds/tree = 3 blue birds

Now, let's add the number of blue birds in all the trees together:
21 blue birds + 8 blue birds + 3 blue birds = 32 blue birds

"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation. Let's say the number of marbles Bob has initially is x.

If he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have x + 2 * 12 = x + 24 marbles.

We are given that after receiving 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 24 = 60

To solve for x, we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:

x = 60 - 24
x = 36

So, Bob initially has 36 marbles.

Now, if he loses 10 marbles, he will have 36 - 10 = 26 marbles.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum temperature of the second bottle that will allow Donny to drink the water after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle.

Let's assume the temperature of the second bottle is x degrees. 

When Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug, the remaining temperature of the 33-degree mug will be 33 - (4/8) * (33 - 40) = 33 - (4/8) * 7 = 33 - 3.5 = 29.5 degrees.

The total amount of water poured into the bottle is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle). 

The average temperature of the water in the bottle will be the weighted average of the temperatures of the two mugs. The weight of the 33-degree mug is 4/5 and the weight of the second bottle is 1/5.

The average temperature of the water in the bottle is: (4/5) * 29.5 + (1/5) * x.

Since Donny can now drink the water, the average temperature of the water in the bottle must be at least 40 degrees.

We can set up the inequality: (4/5) * 29.5 + (1/5) * x ≥ 40.

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of cows:

Melanie's father starts with 50 cows. 
Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. 
There are 7 days in a week, so in 3 weeks, there are 3 * 7 = 21 days.
The total number of cows brought by Milkie Cows Limited in 3 weeks is 20 * 21 = 420 cows.
The total number of cows on the farm after 3 weeks is 50 + 420 = 470 cows.

Next, let's calculate the number of chickens:

Melanie's father starts with 20 chickens. 
Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. 
The total number of chickens brought by Broilers Limited in 3 weeks is 10 * 21 = 210 chickens.
The total number of chickens on the farm after 3 weeks is 20 + 210 = 230 chickens.

Now, let's add the total number of cows and chickens to find the total number of animals on the farm after 3 weeks:
Total number of animals = 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700

The final answer is: 700"
"To find the cost of each single bagel, we first need to calculate the total cost of the 4 packs of bagels before the discount, and then subtract the discount to find the total cost after the discount. 

The cost of 4 packs of bagels before the discount is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00.

The discount is 10% of $40.00, which is 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00.

The total cost after the discount is $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Since each pack has 9 bagels, the total number of bagels is 4 * 9 = 36.

To find the cost of each single bagel, we divide the total cost after the discount by the total number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 = $1.00.

The final answer is: $1.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's start by defining the variables:

- Let x be the number of scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate.
- Let y be the number of potatoes it takes to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes.

From the first statement, we know that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. This can be written as an equation:

x = 23 - 5
x = 18

Now, we need to find the relationship between the number of scoops and the number of potatoes. We are told that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. This can be written as:

y = 6 - 3
y = 3

However, this statement is actually describing the relationship between the number of scoops and the number of potatoes, but it's not directly related to the number of scoops Gomer ate. We need to find the relationship between the number of scoops and the number of potatoes for Gomer's case.

"To find the total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days, we need to calculate the number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately, and then add them together.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days is:
3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in the next 30 days is:
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Now, we add the total number of eggs from both periods:
90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens:
240 eggs / 12 = 20 dozens

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we first need to find the total number of green and red jellybeans. We know there are 17 green jellybeans and twice as many red jellybeans, so the number of red jellybeans is 2 * 17 = 34.

The total number of green and red jellybeans is 17 + 34 = 51.

Since there are a total of 60 jellybeans, the number of blue jellybeans is 60 - 51 = 9.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade, we need to calculate the total number of lemons he collects in one year and then multiply it by 10.

First, let's find the total number of lemons he collects in one year: 
5 trees * 6 lemons/tree = 30 lemons/year

Now, let's multiply this by 10 to find the total number of lemons in a decade:
30 lemons/year * 10 years = 300 lemons

The final answer is: 300"
"To solve this problem, we first need to find the total number of men and women on the bus. 

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, we can let the number of men be 5x and the number of women be 9x. 

Since the total number of passengers is 84, we can set up the equation 5x + 9x = 84.

Combine like terms: 14x = 84

Divide both sides by 14: x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of women on the bus: 9x = 9(6) = 54

If 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining is 54 - 20 = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many sunflowers and bouquets Faraday sold per day. 

Let's denote the number of sunflowers sold per day as 's' and the number of bouquets sold per day as 'b'. We know that each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, so the total number of sunflowers sold per day is 12b.

We are given that Faraday earned $26 from the sunflowers and $56 from the bouquets per day. Since each sunflower costs $2 and each bouquet costs $8, we can set up the following equations:

2s + 8b = 26  ... (Equation 1)
12b = s  ... (Equation 2)

We can substitute Equation 2 into Equation 1 to solve for b:
2(12b) + 8b = 26
24b + 8b = 26
32b = 26
b = 26/32
b = 13/16

Now that we have the value of b, we can find the value of s using Equation 2:
s = 12b
s = 12(13/16)
s = 156/16
s = 39/4

Now that we know the number of sunflowers and bouquets sold per day, we can find the total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days:
Total sunflowers sold in 3 days = 3s
Total sunflowers sold in 3 days = 3(39/4)
Total sunflowers sold in 3 days = 117/4
Total sunflowers sold in 3 days = 29.25

The final answer is: 29.25"
"To find out how much money Adam loses, we first need to calculate the total number of rocks he can buy with his $100. 

Since each rock costs $5, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of each rock: 
$100 / $5 = 20 rocks

Now, we know Adam sells 60% of his inventory. To find 60% of 20 rocks, we multiply 20 by 0.6:
20 * 0.6 = 12 rocks

Since Adam sells 12 rocks, he sells them at $7 each. To find the total revenue, we multiply the number of rocks sold by the selling price:
12 * $7 = $84

However, Adam bought 20 rocks, and he only sold 12. So, he has 8 rocks left unsold. Since each rock costs $5, we multiply the number of unsold rocks by the cost of each rock to find the total cost of the unsold rocks:
8 * $5 = $40

Now, we subtract the total revenue from the total cost to find the total loss:
Total cost = Cost of rocks bought - Cost of rocks sold
Total cost = $100 - $40 = $60
Total revenue = $84
Total loss = Total cost - Total revenue
Total loss = $60 - $84
Total loss = -$24

Since we can't have a negative loss, we need to recalculate the total loss by considering the unsold rocks' cost as the loss. 
Total loss = Cost of unsold rocks
Total loss = $40

The final answer is: $40"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of days it takes Lauren to complete each type of picture scene. 

First, let's find the number of days it takes Lauren to complete each type of picture scene:

- Large-sized picture scenes: 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days
- Medium-sized picture scenes: 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days
- Small-sized picture scenes: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days

Now, we need to find the LCM of 9, 6, and 7. 

The prime factorization of 9 is 3^2
The prime factorization of 6 is 2 * 3
The prime factorization of 7 is 7

To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the numbers:
LCM = 2 * 3^2 * 7 = 2 * 9 * 7 = 126

Therefore, it will take Lauren 126 days to complete all the picture scenes.

The final answer is: 126"
"To find out how many eggs each child receives, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of children. 

First, let's determine the total number of eggs. Since Chatty prepared three dozen eggs, we need to convert the dozen to a numerical value. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so three dozen eggs would be 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Now, we divide the total number of eggs (36) by the number of children (4) to find out how many eggs each child receives.

36 ÷ 4 = 9

The final answer is: 9"
"To find out how much Jen spends on food for her fish in May, we need to calculate the total cost of food for one day and then multiply it by the number of days in May.

Since each fish needs $1 worth of food a day, and Jen has 3 fish, the total cost of food for one day is:
3 fish * $1/fish = $3/day

May has 31 days. To find the total cost of food for the month, we multiply the daily cost by the number of days:
$3/day * 31 days = $93

The final answer is: $93"
"To find out how many roses Patricia has now, we need to subtract the number of roses she gave away from the initial number of roses she had, and then add the number of roses she bought.

Initial number of roses: 30
Number of roses given away: 24
Number of roses bought: 15

First, subtract the number of roses given away from the initial number: 
30 - 24 = 6

Then, add the number of roses bought to the result:
6 + 15 = 21

So, Patricia now has 21 roses.

"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken. 

The total distance traveled is the sum of the two distances: 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles.

The total time taken is the sum of the two times: 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours.

Now, we can use the formula for average speed: Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time.

Average Speed = 250 miles / 5 hours = 50 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning. 

The probability of the first ticket winning is 20% or 0.2. 
The probability of the second ticket winning is three times more likely, so it's 3 * 0.2 = 0.6.

The probability of both tickets winning is the product of their individual probabilities: 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

The final answer is: 12"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many seashells Carrey collected. Let's denote the number of seashells Carrey collected as x.

Since Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, the number of seashells Carlos collected is 2x.

We are also given that Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, so the number of seashells Jim collected is 2x + 5.

We know that the total number of seashells collected by all three is the sum of the seashells collected by each of them, which is x + 2x + (2x + 5) = 5x + 5.

Since they divided the seashells equally among themselves, each person got (5x + 5) / 3 seashells.

However, we don't know the value of x yet. To find x, we can use the information that Jim collected 27 seashells. We can set up the equation 2x + 5 = 27 to solve for x.

2x + 5 = 27
2x = 22
x = 11

Now that we know x, we can find the number of seashells each person got by substituting x into the expression (5x + 5) / 3.

(5(11) + 5) / 3 = (55 + 5) / 3 = 60 / 3 = 20

So each person got 20 seashells.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To find out how many carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and add the number of carrots he eats on the weekend.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday). So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is 4 * 5 = 20.

On Saturday and Sunday, Mason eats 5 carrots each day. So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is 5 + 5 = 10.

Now, we add the total number of carrots Mason eats on weekdays and the weekend: 20 + 10 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song first. 

The second song is 60% longer than the first song, which is 5 minutes. To find 60% of 5 minutes, we multiply 5 by 0.6 (since 60% is the same as 60/100 or 0.6).

5 * 0.6 = 3 minutes

So, the second song is 3 minutes longer than the first song. To find the total length of the second song, we add 3 minutes to the length of the first song.

5 + 3 = 8 minutes

Now, we have the lengths of both songs: 5 minutes for the first song and 8 minutes for the second song. To find the total time of the cassette, we add the lengths of both songs.

5 + 8 = 13 minutes

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes.

"To find the total profit, we first need to find the profit from selling one device and then multiply it by the total number of devices sold.

The cost price of one device is $20, and the selling price is twice the cost price, which is 2 * $20 = $40.

The profit from selling one device is the selling price minus the cost price, which is $40 - $20 = $20.

Linus bought 2 devices last Monday and 4 devices last Tuesday, so the total number of devices sold is 2 + 4 = 6.

The total profit is the profit from one device multiplied by the total number of devices sold, which is $20 * 6 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To find the length of Carl's cane, we need to first determine Carl's height. We know that Isabel is 7 feet tall and Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel. 

Isabel's height = 7 feet
Ned's height = Isabel's height - 2 feet
Ned's height = 7 - 2
Ned's height = 5 feet

Since Carl is one foot taller than Ned, we can find Carl's height by adding 1 foot to Ned's height.

Carl's height = Ned's height + 1 foot
Carl's height = 5 + 1
Carl's height = 6 feet

We are given that Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. To find the length of the cane, we can divide Carl's height by 2.

Cane's length = Carl's height / 2
Cane's length = 6 / 2
Cane's length = 3 feet

"To find out how many bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles required to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

Since each bottle covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand, we need to find out how many bottles are required to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand. 

100% / 20% = 5, which means 5 bottles are required to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand.

Now, we need to find out how many bottles are required to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people. 

2300 people * 5 bottles/person = 11500 bottles

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we need to find out how many more bottles it needs to produce to meet the demand of 11500 bottles.

11500 bottles - 4200 bottles = 7300 bottles

The final answer is: 7300"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. 

First, let's find the number of babies wearing purple and the number of babies wearing purple and a bow. 

The total number of babies is 8. 

The number of babies wearing purple is 3/4 * 8 = 6. 

The number of babies wearing purple and a bow is 1/3 * 6 = 2.

Now, let's find the total number of babies wearing a bow. This includes the babies wearing purple and a bow and the babies wearing blue and a bow. 

The number of babies wearing blue is 1/4 * 8 = 2. 

The number of babies wearing blue and a bow is 1/3 * 2 = 2/3. 

So, the total number of babies wearing a bow is 2 (purple and a bow) + 2/3 (blue and a bow) = 8/3.

Now, we can find the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. This is the number of babies wearing purple and a bow divided by the total number of babies wearing a bow.

Probability = 2 / (8/3) = 6/8 = 3/4.

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100.

Probability percentage = (3/4) * 100 = 75%.

Reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

First, subtract the reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total:
5168 - 1907 = 3261

Then, subtract the reports received on Thursday and Friday from the result:

"To find the total amount of money Abraham will earn, we need to calculate the amount of money he earned from each sale and add them together.

First, let's find out how much land he sold in the first two sales. 

He sold half of his land for $50, which is 1/2 of 80 square meters. 
1/2 * 80 = 40 square meters

Then, he sold 1/4 of his land for $30. Since he already sold 40 square meters, he has 80 - 40 = 40 square meters left. 
1/4 * 40 = 10 square meters

So, he sold 40 + 10 = 50 square meters in the first two sales.

Now, let's find out how much land he has left. 
He had 80 square meters initially and sold 50 square meters, so he has 80 - 50 = 30 square meters left.

He sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. 
30 * 3 = $90

Now, let's add the money he earned from all three sales. 
$50 + $30 + $90 = $170

Geb is 3 years old."
"To find out how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to first determine how many face masks he uses in a day. Since he changes his face mask two times every time he goes out and he goes out three times a day, we can multiply the number of times he goes out by the number of face masks he uses each time.

Number of face masks used per day = 2 (face masks per outing) * 3 (outings per day) = 6 face masks per day

Now, to find out how many face masks he uses every 2 days, we multiply the number of face masks used per day by 2.

Number of face masks used every 2 days = 6 face masks per day * 2 days = 12 face masks

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total number of eggs found, we need to calculate the number of eggs each person found and add them up.

Lamar finds 5 eggs.
Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 2 * 5 = 10 eggs.
Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

The total number of eggs found is 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27.

Since Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, we need to convert 3 dozen to a numerical value. 1 dozen is equal to 12, so 3 dozen is equal to 3 * 12 = 36.

The number of eggs still hidden in the yard is 36 - 27 = 9.

"To find the total number of apartments, we first need to calculate the number of apartments in the first two complexes and then add the number of apartments in the last complex.

The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so the total number of apartments in these two complexes is 200 + 200 = 400.

The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, which means it is 160% of the other two combined (100% + 60% = 160%). To find 160% of 400, we multiply 400 by 1.6 (which is the decimal equivalent of 160%).

160% of 400 = 400 * 1.6 = 640

So, the last complex has 640 apartments.

Now, we add the number of apartments in the last complex to the number of apartments in the first two complexes to get the total number of apartments:

400 + 640 = 1040

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so the total number of collections per week is 3 * 1040 = 3120.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection for each apartment, so the total amount he makes per week is 3120 * $0.40 = $1248.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of fruits produced by the tree over its 10-year lifespan.

- In the 5th year, the tree produces 50 fruits.
- In the 6th year, it produces 3 times the initial amount, which is 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
- In the 7th year, it produces 7 times the initial amount, which is 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
- In the 8th year, it produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree, but we don't know the production of a 10-year-old tree yet. Let's denote the production of a 10-year-old tree as 'x'. So, in the 8th year, it produces x - 200 fruits.
- In the 9th year, the tree doesn't produce any fruit.
- In the 10th year, a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

We know that in the 8th year, the tree produces x - 200 fruits. Since the tree is 8 years old, it has already produced 50 + 150 + 350 + (x - 200) fruits in the previous years. However, we are not given the production of a 10-year-old tree in the 8th year. We are given that in the 10th year, a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 1000 fruits. This implies that a 9-year-old tree would produce 10 times the initial amount, which is 10 * 50 = 500 fruits, and an 8-year-old tree would produce 8 times the initial amount, which is 8 * 50 = 400 fruits.

Now, we can calculate the production of the 8th year. Since the 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits, the 9-year-old tree produces 500 fruits, and the 8-year-old tree produces 400 fruits, the 7-year-old tree would produce 350 fruits, the 6-year-old tree would produce 150 fruits, and the 5-year-old tree would produce 50 fruits. The total production of the tree in the first 7 years is 50 + 150 + 350 + 400 + 500 + 1000 = 2350 fruits. 

However, we are given that in the 8th year, the tree produces x - 200 fruits. Since the total production of the tree in the first 8 years is 2350 + (x - 200) fruits, we can set up an equation to solve for x. The total production of the tree in the first 8 years is equal to the sum of the production of the 5-year-old tree, the 6-year-old tree, the 7-year-old tree, the 8-year-old tree, and the 9-year-old tree. The production of the 9-year-old tree is 500 fruits. The production of the 8-year-old tree is x - 200 fruits. The production of the 7-year-old tree is 350 fruits. The production of the 6-year-old tree is 150 fruits. The production of the 5-year-old tree is 50 fruits. Therefore, the total production of the tree in the first 8 years is 50 + 150 + 350 + (x - 200) + 500 = 2350 + (x - 200) fruits.

Now, we can solve for x. 50 + 150 + 350 + (x - 200) + 500 = 2350 + (x - 200). Simplifying the equation, we get 1150 + x - 200 = 2350 + x - 200.

"To find out how much money Jack has now, we need to calculate 1/5 of Sophia's $100 and add it to Jack's initial $100.

First, let's find 1/5 of $100. To do this, we multiply $100 by 1/5, which is the same as dividing $100 by 5.

$100 ÷ 5 = $20

So, Sophia gave Jack $20. Now, let's add this to Jack's initial $100.

$100 + $20 = $120

Therefore, Jack now has $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To solve this problem, we can start by assigning variables to the lengths of the ropes. Let's say the length of the blue rope is x centimeters. Since the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, the length of the red rope is 4x centimeters. The yellow rope is 7 centimeters longer than the blue rope, so its length is x + 7 centimeters.

We are given that the combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters. We can write an equation to represent this:

x + (x + 7) + 4x = 37

Combine like terms:

6x + 7 = 37

Subtract 7 from both sides:

6x = 30

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 5

Now that we know the length of the blue rope, we can find the length of the red rope:

Length of red rope = 4x = 4(5) = 20 centimeters

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume the amount of money Ronnie was given is x. Since Rissa was given thrice as much, Rissa was given 3x.

Initially, Ronnie had x dollars and Rissa had 3x dollars.

After giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, let's call this amount y. So, Ronnie is left with x - y dollars and Rissa is left with 3x - y dollars.

We are given that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, so we can set up the equation:

3x - y = (4/5)(3x)

To solve for y, we can multiply both sides by 5 to get rid of the fraction:

15x - 5y = 12x

Now, let's isolate y by subtracting 12x from both sides:

15x - 12x - 5y = 12x - 12x
3x - 5y = 0

Now, let's add 5y to both sides:

3x = 5y

Now, let's divide both sides by 5:

(3/5)x = y

Now that we have the value of y, we can substitute it back into the equation for Ronnie's remaining money:

Ronnie's remaining money = x - y
= x - (3/5)x
= (2/5)x

We are given that Ronnie was initially given $5, so we can substitute x = 5 into the equation:

Ronnie's remaining money = (2/5)(5)
= 2

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

Let's denote the amount of red, white, and purple paint as R, W, and P respectively. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, we can say R = W = P.

We are also given that half the mural is yellow, which means the other half is made up of red, white, and purple paint. Since the total amount of paint used is 12 pints, we can set up an equation to represent this:

R + W + P + Y = 12

Since half the mural is yellow, we can say Y = 6 (since 12 / 2 = 6). We also know that R = W = P, so we can substitute W and P with R in the equation:

R + R + R + 6 = 12

Combine like terms:

3R + 6 = 12

Subtract 6 from both sides:

3R = 6

Divide both sides by 3:

R = 2

So, the amount of red paint used is 2 pints.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house, then add them together.

First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom: 
Area of one bedroom = length * width = 20 * 12 = 240 square feet

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms = 4 * 240 = 960 square feet

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area = 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet

The rest of the house is given as 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas together: 
Total area = area of bedrooms + area of living room + area of the rest of the house
Total area = 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 square feet

The final answer is: 3160"
"To find the total number of clouds Alice counted, we need to calculate the number of clouds for each day and add them up.

On Monday, Alice counts 3 clouds.
On Tuesday, she counts double the number of clouds from Monday, which is 2 * 3 = 6 clouds.
On Wednesday, she counts double the number of clouds from Tuesday, which is 2 * 6 = 12 clouds.
On Thursday, she counts double the number of clouds from Wednesday, which is 2 * 12 = 24 clouds.
On Friday, she counts double the number of clouds from Thursday, which is 2 * 24 = 48 clouds.

Now, let's add up the number of clouds for each day:
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93

"To find out how many dishwashing cycles you can run with the new box for $1, we first need to find out how many pods are in the new box. 

Since the new box has 20% more pods than the regular box, we need to calculate 20% of 100 and add it to 100. 

20% of 100 = 0.2 * 100 = 20
New number of pods in the new box = 100 + 20 = 120

Now, we know that the new box costs $12 and has 120 pods. To find out how many cycles you can run for $1, we need to divide the number of pods by the cost of the box and then divide the result by the cost per cycle ($1).

First, let's find out how many cycles you can run with the new box for $12:
120 pods / $12 = 10 cycles per dollar

Now, we can find out how many cycles you can run for $1:
10 cycles per dollar * $1 = 10 cycles

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since each bill is $20, the number of bills he has is 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he is left with 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill, which means he uses 40 / 2 = 20 bills. So, he is left with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

4. Thomas then triples his money. Since each bill is $20, tripling his money means tripling the value of the bills. The total value of the bills is 20 * 20 = $400. Tripling this amount gives 400 * 3 = $1200.

5. Since the total value is now $1200, and each bill is $20, the number of bills he has is 1200 / 20 = 60 bills.

6. He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. To find the number of 5 dollar bills, we divide the total number of bills by 5. 60 / 5 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps.

Step 1: Calculate the number of goals scored by team B in the first half.
Team A scores 4 goals in the first half. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals in the first half.

Step 2: Calculate the number of goals scored by team B in the second half.
Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 2 * 4 = 8 goals. 

Step 3: Calculate the number of goals scored by team A in the second half.
Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B in the second half, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of goals scored by each team in the match.
Team A scores 4 goals in the first half and 2 goals in the second half, for a total of 4 + 2 = 6 goals.
Team B scores 2 goals in the first half and 8 goals in the second half, for a total of 2 + 8 = 10 goals.

Step 5: Calculate the total number of goals scored in the match.
The total number of goals scored in the match is the sum of the goals scored by team A and team B, which is 6 + 10 = 16.

"To find out how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we need to determine how much chalk is left after Monday and then calculate how many days it will last at the 20% usage rate.

The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk. On Monday, he used 45% of it. 

First, we need to find 45% of 5 inches:
45% of 5 = 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches

So, the teacher used 2.25 inches of chalk on Monday. To find out how much chalk is left, we subtract this from the original 5 inches:
5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches

Now, we need to find out how many days the remaining 2.75 inches of chalk will last at the 20% usage rate.

Let's assume the number of days is 'x'. Then, 20% of 2.75 inches will be used each day. We can set up the equation:
0.20 * 2.75 * x = 2.75

To solve for 'x', we can divide both sides by 0.20 * 2.75:
x = 2.75 / (0.20 * 2.75)
x = 2.75 / 0.55
x = 5

"To find the number of students not on varsity, we first need to find the number of students on varsity. 

One-third of the girls are on varsity, so the number of girls on varsity is 12 * (1/3) = 4.

One-fourth of the boys are on varsity, so the number of boys on varsity is 12 * (1/4) = 3.

The total number of students on varsity is 4 (girls) + 3 (boys) = 7.

Since there are 12 boys and 12 girls in the class, the total number of students is 12 + 12 = 24.

The number of students not on varsity is 24 (total students) - 7 (students on varsity) = 17.

"To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we need to first determine the total number of teeth the dentist works on. 

The dentist drills 4 teeth, and then caps 7 more teeth than he drills. So, the number of teeth capped is 4 + 7 = 11.

The total number of teeth the dentist works on is 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15.

Now, we need to find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes. To do this, we divide the total number of teeth the dentist works on by the total number of James' teeth and multiply by 100.

Percentage = (15 / 30) * 100
Percentage = 0.5 * 100
Percentage = 50%

"To find the total cost of the milk, we need to multiply the number of gallons sold by the cost per gallon. 

Total gallons sold = 4000
Cost per gallon = $3.5

Total cost = Total gallons sold * Cost per gallon
Total cost = 4000 * 3.5
Total cost = 14000

Since 2/5 of the milk was returned, we need to find 2/5 of the total gallons sold.

2/5 of the total gallons = (2/5) * 4000
2/5 of the total gallons = 1600

The refund amount is equal to the cost of the returned milk, which is 2/5 of the total cost.

Refund amount = 2/5 * Total cost
Refund amount = 2/5 * 14000
Refund amount = 5600

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

We can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:

C + 25 = (5/3)(C + 7)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2:

20 = C

"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we first need to determine the total number of books he can buy with $27000. 

Since he can buy 100 books for $500, we can find the total number of books he can buy by dividing $27000 by $500.

$27000 / $500 = 54

Now that we know Bob can buy 54 books in total, we need to divide this number by the number of schools to find out how many books he can buy per school.

54 books / 3 schools = 18 books per school

The final answer is: 18"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, 2 apples fell out of the tree, and one landed on Newton's head. So, Newton had 2 apples.
2. Newton picked up the two apples, put one in his pocket, and threw the other apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. Now, he has 1 apple in his pocket and 5 new apples, making a total of 6 apples.
3. Newton picked up these 5 new apples and put all but one in his pocket. This means he kept 1 apple and put 4 in his pocket. Now, he has 1 apple in his hand and 4 in his pocket, making a total of 5 apples.
4. He threw the remaining apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out. Now, he has 5 apples (from the previous step) and 6 new apples, making a total of 11 apples.
5. Newton picked up all the remaining apples, which is 11 apples.

Therefore, Newton brought home 11 apples to make a pie.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the total cost of Ali's order, we need to calculate the total number of coal bags and then multiply it by the cost per bag.

First, let's find the total number of coal bags:
Total coal ordered = 850 kg
Weight of each bag = 50 kg
Number of bags = Total coal ordered / Weight of each bag
= 850 kg / 50 kg
= 17 bags

Now, let's find the total cost:
Cost per bag = $18
Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
= 17 bags * $18
= $306

The final answer is: $306"
"To find out how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices each type of pizza is needed for, and then divide that by the number of slices per pizza.

First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices needed: 
6 friends * 6 slices per friend = 36 slices

Since each pizza has 12 slices, we need to divide the total number of slices needed by the number of slices per pizza:
36 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 3 cheese pizzas

Next, let's calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices needed:
6 friends * 4 slices per friend = 24 slices

Since each pizza has 8 slices, we need to divide the total number of slices needed by the number of slices per pizza:
24 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 3 pepperoni pizzas

To find the total number of pizzas Kate needs to buy, we add the number of cheese pizzas and pepperoni pizzas:
3 cheese pizzas + 3 pepperoni pizzas = 6 pizzas

"To find the total number of miles Sam ran this week, we need to calculate the miles run on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and add it to the miles run on Tuesday and Thursday.

Sam ran 3 miles on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Since there are 3 days, we multiply 3 miles by 3 to get the total miles run on these days:
3 miles/day * 3 days = 9 miles

Sam ran 5 miles on Tuesday and Thursday. Since there are 2 days, we multiply 5 miles by 2 to get the total miles run on these days:
5 miles/day * 2 days = 10 miles

Now, we add the total miles run on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday to the total miles run on Tuesday and Thursday:
9 miles + 10 miles = 19 miles

"To solve this problem, we need to find the net rate at which Jay is building snowballs. 

Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, which is equivalent to 20/1 = 20 snowballs per hour. 

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, which is equivalent to 8 snowballs per hour (2 snowballs / 0.25 hours = 8 snowballs per hour). 

The net rate at which Jay is building snowballs is 20 - 8 = 12 snowballs per hour.

To find the time it takes for Jay to build 60 snowballs, we can divide the total number of snowballs by the net rate: 60 / 12 = 5 hours.

"To find Jim's age, we need to first determine the age difference between John and Jim. Since John is 28 now and Digimon came out 20 years ago, we can calculate John's age at that time by subtracting 20 from his current age.

John's age at the time of Digimon's release = 28 - 20 = 8

Since John was twice as old as Jim at that time, we can set up an equation to find Jim's age:

John's age at the time of Digimon's release = 2 * Jim's age at the time of Digimon's release

8 = 2 * Jim's age at the time of Digimon's release

To find Jim's age at the time of Digimon's release, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

Jim's age at the time of Digimon's release = 8 / 2
Jim's age at the time of Digimon's release = 4

Now, to find Jim's current age, we add 20 to his age at the time of Digimon's release:

Jim's current age = Jim's age at the time of Digimon's release + 20
Jim's current age = 4 + 20
Jim's current age = 24

"To find out how many slices of apple they ate, we need to determine the number of slices each person ate. 

Doxa ate 1 slice. 
Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so her sister ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices. 
Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so her brother ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

Now, let's add up the number of slices each person ate: 
Doxa ate 1 slice, her sister ate 2 slices, and her brother ate 3 slices. 
So, the total number of slices they ate is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, the remaining bandages after the first day are x - 38 + 50.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. The remaining bandages after the second day are (x - 38 + 50) - 28.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they had 100 bandages added. They used half a pack, which is 25 bandages. The remaining bandages after the third day are ((x - 38 + 50) - 28) + 100 - 25.

We are given that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. So, we can set up the equation:

(x - 38 + 50) - 28 + 100 - 25 = 78

Simplifying the equation:

x - 38 + 50 - 28 + 100 - 25 = 78
x + 57 = 78

Subtracting 57 from both sides:

x = 21

The initial number of bandages is 21.

"To find the total cost of the haircut, we need to calculate the cost of the color and the cost of the haircut separately.

The cost of the color is $40.

The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch, and May's hair was cut from 10 inches to 8 inches. To find the total inches cut, we subtract the final length from the initial length: 10 - 8 = 2 inches.

Now, we multiply the number of inches cut by the cost per inch: 2 * $30 = $60.

The total cost of the haircut is $60.

The total cost of the cut and color is the sum of the cost of the color and the cost of the haircut: $40 + $60 = $100.

"To calculate Jen's total earnings, we need to calculate her regular pay and her attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her regular pay. Jen works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week. Since there are 4 weeks in April, she works a total of 4 weeks * 6 days/week = 24 days.

Her total hours worked in April is 7.5 hours/day * 24 days = 180 hours.

Her hourly rate is $1.5, so her regular pay is 180 hours * $1.5/hour = $270.

Next, let's calculate her attendance bonus. Since she has complete attendance for the month, she receives an additional $10 for each day. Her total attendance bonus is $10/day * 24 days = $240.

Her total earnings for April is the sum of her regular pay and attendance bonus: $270 + $240 = $510.

The final answer is: $510"
"To find the total amount Jason earned, we need to calculate the earnings for each task and then add them up.

For the dishwasher, Jason emptied it 6 times, and he earns $0.50 each time, so his earnings from the dishwasher are 6 x $0.50 = $3.00.

For the laundry, Jason did it once and earns $3.00, so his earnings from laundry are $3.00.

For the trash, Jason took it out twice and earns $0.75 each time, so his earnings from taking out the trash are 2 x $0.75 = $1.50.

For cleaning his room, Jason did it once and earns $1.50, so his earnings from cleaning his room are $1.50.

Now, let's add up all the earnings: $3.00 (dishwasher) + $3.00 (laundry) + $1.50 (trash) + $1.50 (room) = $8.00.

The final answer is: $8.00"
"To find the total amount of blood in ten sharks, we first need to find the amount of blood in one shark. Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and a whale has 40 gallons of blood, a shark has 3 * 40 = 120 gallons of blood.

Now, we need to find the total amount of blood in ten sharks. To do this, we multiply the amount of blood in one shark by the number of sharks: 120 * 10 = 1200 gallons.

"To find the total number of people who entered the restaurant, we need to calculate the number of people who entered at each time and add them up.

First, 50 people entered in the morning. 
Then, 40 more people entered at 10:00, so the total number of people who entered by 10:00 is 50 + 40 = 90.

Next, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is 2 * 40 = 80 people. So, the total number of people who entered by this point is 90 + 80 = 170.

Finally, 3 times as many people as the number that came in first (50) entered by evening, which is 3 * 50 = 150 people. So, the total number of people who entered by evening is 170 + 150 = 320.

The total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day is 320."
"To find the total number of pens Alain has, we need to calculate the number of red pens and black pens separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of red pens: 
Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens, and each pack has 5 pens. 
So, the total number of red pens = 5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 pens.

Next, let's find the number of black pens: 
Alain's mom bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens. 
So, the total number of black pens = 2 * 25 = 50 pens.

Now, let's add the number of red pens and black pens together to find the total number of pens Alain has: 
Total pens = 25 (red pens) + 50 (black pens) = 75 pens.

"To find the total cost, we first need to find the cost of the scotch and the cognac separately.

The cost of the scotch is $600 for 10 bottles. To find the cost per bottle, we divide the total cost by the number of bottles: $600 / 10 = $60 per bottle.

Since John buys twice as many bottles of cognac, he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The cost of the cognac is 50% more than the scotch, so the cost per bottle of cognac is $60 + ($60 * 0.5) = $60 + $30 = $90 per bottle.

Now, we can find the total cost of the cognac: 20 bottles * $90 per bottle = $1800.

The total cost of everything is the sum of the cost of the scotch and the cognac: $600 + $1800 = $2400.

The final answer is: $2400"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the first day.
Since Mr. Julius planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, and he planted 20 White Oak trees, the number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the first day is 2 * 20 = 40.

Step 2: Calculate the number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day.
Since Mr. Julius planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day than on the first day, we need to find 1/4 of 40 and add it to 40.
1/4 of 40 is 40 / 4 = 10.
So, the number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is 40 + 10 = 50.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of White Oak trees planted over the two days.
Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees on the first day and 10 more on the second day, so the total number of White Oak trees planted is 20 + 10 = 30.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted over the two days.
Mr. Julius planted 40 Lodgepole Pine trees on the first day and 50 on the second day, so the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted is 40 + 50 = 90.

Step 5: Calculate the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius over the two days.
The total number of trees planted is the sum of the total number of White Oak trees and the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees, which is 30 + 90 = 120.

"To find out how much root beer was available for each person to drink, we need to calculate the total amount of root beer remaining after all the incidents. 

Initially, Fred made 24 gallons of root beer. 

On the first day, his children drank 4 gallons, so we subtract 4 from 24: 24 - 4 = 20 gallons.

On the second day, his wife spilled 7 gallons, so we subtract 7 from 20: 20 - 7 = 13 gallons.

On the third day, Ronnie drank 5 gallons, so we subtract 5 from 13: 13 - 5 = 8 gallons.

Now, we have 8 gallons of root beer left. Since 3 people, including Fred, are sharing the root beer, we need to divide 8 by 3 to find out how much each person gets: 8 ÷ 3 = 2.67 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2.67}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to translate the given information into a linear equation. Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge as 'x'.

The statement ""Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" can be written as 4x + 8. This expression represents the total number of coffee mugs after the additional 8 are added.

We are given that this total is equal to 40. So, we can set up the equation:

4x + 8 = 40

To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable x. We can do this by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:

4x = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for x:

x = 32 / 4
x = 8

Therefore, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

"To find out how many eyeshadow colors Amy has left, we need to calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors she initially had and then subtract the ones she lost or used up.

Amy initially had 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each, so she had 2 * 4 = 8 eyeshadow colors from the palettes.

She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 eyeshadow colors each, so she had 3 * 6 = 18 eyeshadow colors from the makeup sets.

In total, Amy had 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors.

Her sister stole one of the palettes, which had 4 colors, so Amy lost 4 eyeshadow colors.

Amy used up half of the colors from one makeup set, which had 6 colors. Half of 6 is 3, so she used up 3 eyeshadow colors.

In total, Amy lost 4 + 3 = 7 eyeshadow colors.

To find out how many eyeshadow colors Amy has left, we subtract the ones she lost from the total: 26 - 7 = 19.

"To find Trinity's profit, we need to first find the selling price of the magazines. 

The cost price of the magazines is $72. 

The selling price is 11/8 of the cost price. 

To find the selling price, we multiply the cost price by 11/8. 

Selling price = (11/8) * 72 

To multiply a fraction by a whole number, we multiply the numerator by the whole number and keep the denominator the same. 

Selling price = (11 * 72) / 8 

Selling price = 792 / 8 

Selling price = 99

"To find the total amount of water removed, we need to calculate the amount of water removed by each setting and then add them together.

The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed by the low setting is:
1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters

The medium setting removes twice as much water as the low setting, so it removes 2 liters of water per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed by the medium setting is:
2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters

The high setting removes twice as much water as the medium setting, so it removes 4 liters of water per day (2 * 2 = 4). Since Brian ran it for 5 days, the total amount of water removed by the high setting is:
4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters

Now, we add the total amount of water removed by each setting to find the total amount of water removed:

"To find the combined capacity of both schools, we first need to find the capacity of John's school. 

Since each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, we can find the capacity of one of John's classes by multiplying Ali's class capacity by 1/8.

Capacity of one of John's classes = 120 * (1/8) = 15

Since John has two classes, we multiply the capacity of one class by 2 to find the total capacity of John's school.

Capacity of John's school = 15 * 2 = 30

Now, we add the capacity of Ali's school (which is 120) to the capacity of John's school to find the combined capacity of both schools.

Combined capacity = 120 + 30 = 150

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total interest Stephen owes his sister and then add it to the principal amount. 

First, let's calculate the total interest Stephen owes. The interest rate is 2% of the principal amount, which is $300. 

Interest = Principal * Rate
Interest = $300 * 0.02
Interest = $6

Since Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, we need to calculate the total amount he will pay in those 11 months.

Total paid in 11 months = $25 * 11
Total paid in 11 months = $275

Now, we need to add the interest to the principal amount to find the total amount Stephen owes.

Total amount owed = Principal + Interest
Total amount owed = $300 + $6
Total amount owed = $306

However, Stephen has already paid $275 in the previous 11 months. So, the remaining amount he needs to pay in the twelfth month is the difference between the total amount owed and the amount he has already paid.

Amount to be paid in the twelfth month = Total amount owed - Total paid in 11 months
Amount to be paid in the twelfth month = $306 - $275
Amount to be paid in the twelfth month = $31

"To find the volume of the jar, we need to calculate the area of the base and multiply it by the height. The base is a square with a side length of 6 inches, so the area is 6 * 6 = 36 square inches. Multiplying this by the height of 15 inches gives us a volume of 36 * 15 = 540 cubic inches.

Since the jelly beans have an efficiency of 80%, we need to divide the volume of the jar by this efficiency to find the effective volume available for packing. 80% is the same as 0.8, so the effective volume is 540 / 0.8 = 675 cubic inches.

Each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, so we can divide the effective volume by the volume of a single jelly bean to find the total number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar. 675 / 0.15 = 4500 jelly beans.

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we can multiply the total number of jelly beans by 0.3 to find the number of red jelly beans. 4500 * 0.3 = 1350 red jelly beans.

However, we are given that the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find how far off Tim's guess was, we need to find the difference between his estimated number of red jelly beans and the true number. 

To find the estimated number of red jelly beans, we need to know the actual number of jelly beans he guessed.  We can find this by dividing the effective volume by the volume of a single jelly bean. 675 / 0.15 = 4500 jelly beans.  Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we can multiply the total number of jelly beans by 0.3 to find the estimated number of red jelly beans. 4500 * 0.3 = 1350 red jelly beans.

The difference between the true number of red jelly beans and the estimated number is 900 - 1350 = -450. The negative sign indicates that his guess was too high.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, the bus had 20 people.
2. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus became 20 + 40 = 60.
3. At the second stop, 3/4 of the people who entered at the first stop (40) entered the bus. 
   3/4 of 40 is (3/4) * 40 = 30.
   So, the total number of people on the bus became 60 + 30 = 90.
4. At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. 
   The current number of people on the bus is 90. 
   Doubling this number gives 90 * 2 = 180.
5. The bus has a capacity of 200 people. To find the remaining spaces, we subtract the current number of people from the capacity:
   200 - 180 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to calculate the cost of visits for the first 5 years and the cost of visits for the next 3 years.

Initially, the cost of one visit is $2. 

In the first 5 years, Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year. So, the total number of visits in 5 years is 3 * 5 = 15 visits.

The cost of one visit increased by 150% after 5 years. This means the new cost of one visit is 2 + (2 * 1.5) = $6.

For the next 3 years, Pauline still visits the museum 3 times a year. So, the total number of visits in 3 years is 3 * 3 = 9 visits.

The total cost for the first 5 years is 15 visits * $2 = $30.
The total cost for the next 3 years is 9 visits * $6 = $54.

The total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is $30 + $54 = $84.

The final answer is: $84"
"To find out how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to determine the total number of groups that will be formed and then calculate the total time required for all groups to try the escape room.

There are 10 students in each grade, and there are 4 grades (4-7). So, the total number of students is 10 * 4 = 40.

Since only 8 students can try the escape room at a time, we need to divide the total number of students by 8 to find the number of groups: 40 / 8 = 5.

Each group uses 45 minutes to try and escape, so the total time required for all groups is the number of groups multiplied by the time per group: 5 * 45 = 225 minutes.

The final numerical answer is: 225"
"To find out how much Ali has to pay John, we need to calculate the total cost of the tables and the total cost of the roof frames, and then add them together.

The cost of the tables is 4 tables * $20 per table = $80.
The cost of the roof frames is 2 frames * $10 per frame = $20.

Now, let's add the cost of the tables and the cost of the roof frames together: $80 + $20 = $100.

The final answer is: $100"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length can be represented as 4x.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, and it is divided into two pieces. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece, we can find the length of the longer piece by multiplying x by 4:

Longer piece = 4x = 4(8) = 32

The final answer is: 32"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many pounds of ground beef Aiden needs to make 80 meatballs and then multiply that by the amount of seasoning he uses per pound.

First, let's find out how many pounds of ground beef Aiden needs to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound:

80 meatballs / 16 meatballs/pound = 5 pounds

Now, we know Aiden needs 5 pounds of ground beef. He uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning per pound of meat, so we multiply the number of pounds by the amount of seasoning per pound:

5 pounds * 2 tablespoons/pound = 10 tablespoons

So, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning to make 80 meatballs.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total width of the windows, we need to multiply the number of windows by the width of each window. 

Number of windows: 5
Width of each window: 35 inches

Total width of windows = Number of windows * Width of each window
Total width of windows = 5 * 35
Total width of windows = 175 inches

Since Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, we need to multiply the total width by 2.

Fabric needed = 2 * Total width of windows
Fabric needed = 2 * 175
Fabric needed = 350 inches

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote the number of cupcakes as C and the number of brownies as B. We are given that Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, so we can write an equation:

B = 3C - 2

We also know that each person gets 2 treats, and there are 5 people in the class. So, the total number of treats is 2 * 5 = 10.

Since the total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, we can write another equation:

C + B = 10

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can substitute the expression for B from the first equation into the second equation:

C + (3C - 2) = 10

Combine like terms:

4C - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides:

4C = 12

Divide both sides by 4:

C = 3

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes."
"To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the 20% discount. 

The original cost of the manicure and pedicure is $35 + $40 = $75.

The 20% discount on $75 is 0.20 * $75 = $15.

So, the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure is $75 - $15 = $60.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the nail art. Since there are 10 fingers (2 hands * 5 fingers per hand), the total cost of the nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost is the sum of the discounted manicure and pedicure cost and the nail art cost, which is $60 + $30 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the total number of magazines Susan gets every year, we need to calculate the total number of issues from the first 3 magazines and the last magazine.

The first 3 magazines send 12 issues a year each, so the total number of issues from these magazines is 3 * 12 = 36.

The last magazine sends 6 issues a year, but it also sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, which means it sends 4 * 6 = 24 issues a year.

Now, we add the total number of issues from the first 3 magazines and the last magazine: 36 + 24 = 60.

So, Susan gets 60 magazines every year.

The final answer is: 60"
"To solve this problem, we can start by using the information that Samantha has 27 paintings and she has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley. This means Shelley has 27 + 12 = 39 paintings.

Now, we know that Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. So, to find out how many paintings Kim has, we need to subtract 8 from Shelley's total number of paintings.

Kim's paintings = Shelley's paintings - 8
Kim's paintings = 39 - 8
Kim's paintings = 31

"To find the price of the toy after the discount in January, we need to follow the order of operations: 

1. Calculate the price increase in December: 
   Initial price in November = $40
   Increase percentage = 80%
   Price increase = 40 * (80/100) = $32
   Price in December = 40 + 32 = $72

2. Calculate the price decrease in January:
   Price in December = $72
   Decrease percentage = 50%
   Price decrease = 72 * (50/100) = $36
   Price in January = 72 - 36 = $36

The final price of the toy after the discount in January is $36."
"To find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to calculate the total amount from the standard rate lessons and the total amount from the veteran lessons, then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total amount from the standard rate lessons. Charlie has 4 lessons at his standard rate of $80 per hour. 

Total amount from standard rate lessons = 4 * $80 = $320

Now, let's calculate the total amount from the veteran lessons. Charlie reduces his rate by 25% for veterans. To find the reduced rate, we need to calculate 25% of $80 and subtract it from $80.

25% of $80 = 0.25 * $80 = $20
Reduced rate for veterans = $80 - $20 = $60

Charlie has 2 lessons with veterans at the reduced rate of $60 per hour.

Total amount from veteran lessons = 2 * $60 = $120

Now, let's add the total amount from the standard rate lessons and the total amount from the veteran lessons to find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day.

Total amount = $320 + $120 = $440

The final answer is: $440"
"To find the mean score, we need to add up all the scores and then divide by the total number of scores.

First, let's add up the scores: 
50 + 80 = 130
130 + 80 = 210
210 + 60 = 270
270 + 40 = 310
310 + 90 = 400
400 + 100 = 500
500 + 70 = 570
570 + 60 = 630

The sum of the scores is 630.

Next, we need to count the total number of scores, which is 9.

Now, we divide the sum by the total number of scores to find the mean:

"To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we need to first determine what 1/4 of the original amount is. 

Since Eve had 20 pieces of pomelos originally, we can calculate 1/4 of 20 by multiplying 20 by 1/4. 

20 * (1/4) = 20 * 1 / 4 = 20 / 4 = 5

This means Eve was left with 5 pomelos. To find out how many pomelos she gave away, we need to subtract the number of pomelos she has left from the original amount.

Number of pomelos given away = Original amount - Number of pomelos left
= 20 - 5

"To find the number of apples Walter ate, we need to calculate 2/5 of 60. 

2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

So, Walter ate 24 apples. Now, we need to find the number of apples remaining. 

60 - 24 = 36

Now, we need to find 25% of 36. 

25% of 36 = (25/100) * 36 = 0.25 * 36 = 9

So, Walter gave his sister 9 apples. Now, we need to find the number of apples remaining. 

36 - 9 = 27

Walter sold 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. 

27 * 3 = 81

"To find the total number of novels Regina wrote this year, we need to determine what 1 whole is, given that 3 quarters of it is 9 novels. 

Let's represent the total number of novels she wrote this year as 'x'. Since 3 quarters of 'x' is 9, we can set up the equation:

(3/4)x = 9

To solve for 'x', we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4/3 to isolate 'x':

x = 9 * (4/3)
x = 12

So, Regina wrote 12 novels this year.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total distance covered by Michael in 3 days, we need to calculate the distance he travels in one day and then multiply it by 3.

First, let's convert the speed from km/hr to km/day:
Speed = 50 km/hr
Time = 24 hours (in a day)
Distance = Speed * Time = 50 km/hr * 24 hr = 1200 km/day

Now, let's calculate the total distance covered in 3 days:
Total Distance = Distance/day * 3 = 1200 km/day * 3 = 3600 km

Now, let's find the percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered:
Percentage = (Total Distance / Total Distance between Alaska and Texas) * 100
= (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100
= 0.6 * 100

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. Madeline ate 6 grapes.
2. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, so he used 6 * 5 = 30 grapes.
3. The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.
4. The remaining grapes are the total number of grapes at the beginning minus the grapes used by Madeline and her brother, which is x - 36.
5. Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie requires 12 grapes. So, the total number of grapes used by their mother is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.
6. Since the remaining grapes were used by their mother, we can set up the equation: x - 36 = 48.
7. To solve for x, we add 36 to both sides of the equation: x = 48 + 36.
8. x = 84.

"To find the total number of minutes the custodian works in a day, we multiply the number of hours they work by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). 

8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes/day

The total number of minutes it takes to clean all classrooms is the product of the number of classrooms and the time per classroom. 

80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes

To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms, we divide the total minutes spent cleaning by the total minutes worked in a day, and then multiply by 100.

(1200 minutes / 480 minutes/day) * 100 = 250%

The custodian spends 250% of their day cleaning classrooms, which is equivalent to 2.5 times their workday.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many books each shelf can hold and then divide the total number of books by the total capacity of the shelves.

The middle shelves can hold 10 books each. 
The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.
The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

The total capacity of one bookcase is 10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55 books.

Since Elly has 110 books, we need to divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase to find out how many bookcases she needs.

110 / 55 = 2

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books."
"To find Rose's profit, we first need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

The cost of 5 dozens of eggs is 5 * $2.40 = $12.

Since 1 dozen has 12 eggs, 5 dozens will have 5 * 12 = 60 eggs.

Rose will sell each egg for $1 for 3 eggs, so the selling price per egg is $1 / 3 = $0.33.

The total revenue from selling 60 eggs is 60 * $0.33 = $20.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $20 - $12 = $8.

We are also given that the total number of ice cubes is 116, which is the sum of strawberry and blueberry cubes:

s + b = 116

Now, we can substitute the expression for b from the first equation into the second equation:

s + (5s - 4) = 116

Combine like terms:

6s - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides:

6s = 120

Divide both sides by 6:

s = 20

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting s into the first equation:

"To find the total cost of the phone plan, we need to first determine the cost of the additional phones. 

Let's assume the cost of each additional phone is x. Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of the main phone is 2x.

We are given that the main phone costs $20, so we can set up the equation 2x = 20 to find the cost of each additional phone.

Solving for x, we get x = 20 / 2 = 10.

Now that we know the cost of each additional phone, we can find the total cost of the additional phones by multiplying the cost of one phone by the number of additional phones, which is 4 (since there are 5 phones in total and 1 is the main phone). 

The total cost of the additional phones is 4 * 10 = 40.

Finally, we add the cost of the main phone to the cost of the additional phones to find the total cost of the phone plan: 20 + 40 = 60.

The final answer is: $60"
"To find out how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to calculate the total number of doughnuts he sells in a day and then multiply it by the number of days in June.

First, let's calculate the total number of doughnuts Derrick makes in a day. Since he makes 10 dozen doughnuts, and 1 dozen is equal to 12, we can multiply 10 by 12 to get the total number of doughnuts:

10 dozen * 12 doughnuts/dozen = 120 doughnuts

Since Derrick sells all the doughnuts, he sells 120 doughnuts per day.

Now, let's calculate the total number of days in June. June has 30 days.

To find out how much money Derrick makes in a day, we multiply the number of doughnuts he sells per day by the price per doughnut:

120 doughnuts/day * $2/doughnut = $240/day

Now, we multiply the daily earnings by the number of days in June:

$240/day * 30 days = $7200

The final answer is: $7200"
"To find out how many days Jade needs to upload all her photos, we need to divide the total number of photos by the number of photos she uploads per day.

First, let's find out how many photos Jade uploads per day. Since she uploads 6 batches of 7 photos each day, we multiply the number of batches by the number of photos per batch:

6 batches/day * 7 photos/batch = 42 photos/day

Now, we divide the total number of photos by the number of photos uploaded per day:

210 photos / 42 photos/day = 5 days

So, Jade will need 5 days to upload all her photos.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount pop, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.
3. So, the total number of kernels popped in the first 2 minutes is 20 + 60 = 80.
4. In the next 30 seconds, the kernels pop at a rate four times the initial rate, which is 4 * 20 = 80 kernels.
5. So, the total number of kernels popped in the first 3 minutes is 80 + 80 = 160.
6. In the final 30 seconds, the kernels pop at half the rate of the past 30 seconds, which is 80 / 2 = 40 kernels.
7. So, the total number of kernels popped in the first 4 minutes is 160 + 40 = 200.
8. After Garrett takes the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat, which is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.
9. Therefore, the total number of kernels that popped is 200 + 10 = 210.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many lemons Tim needs for the regular lemonade and the extra tart lemonade.

First, let's find out how many cups of lemon juice Tim needs for 5 gallons of lemonade (4 regular + 1 extra). Since 1 gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice, 5 gallons will require 5 cups of lemon juice.

Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can set up a proportion to find out how many lemons are needed for 5 cups of juice:

6 lemons / 1 cup = x lemons / 5 cups

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

6 * 5 = 1 * x
30 = x

So, Tim needs 30 lemons for 5 gallons of lemonade.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of red blocks as 'r'. We know that there are 4 blue blocks and twice as many yellow blocks, which means there are 2 * 4 = 8 yellow blocks. 

The total number of blocks is the sum of blue, yellow, and red blocks, which is given as 32. So, we can set up the equation:

4 (blue blocks) + 8 (yellow blocks) + r (red blocks) = 32

Combine the constants on the left side of the equation:

12 + r = 32

Now, we need to isolate 'r' by subtracting 12 from both sides of the equation:

r = 32 - 12
r = 20

"To calculate the depreciation of the boat over the three years, we need to calculate the value of the boat after each year.

Year 1:
Initial value = $9000
Depreciation rate = 30%
Value after year 1 = Initial value - (Initial value * Depreciation rate)
= $9000 - ($9000 * 0.30)
= $9000 - $2700
= $6300

Year 2:
Value after year 1 = $6300
Depreciation rate = 30%
Value after year 2 = Value after year 1 - (Value after year 1 * Depreciation rate)
= $6300 - ($6300 * 0.30)
= $6300 - $1890
= $4410

Year 3:
Value after year 2 = $4410
Depreciation rate = 20%
Value after year 3 = Value after year 2 - (Value after year 2 * Depreciation rate)
= $4410 - ($4410 * 0.20)
= $4410 - $882
= $3528

The final value of the boat after the three years is $3528."
"To find the number of pink candies, we first need to determine the number of orange and yellow candies. 

We are given that there are 54 red candies. Since there are twice as many orange candies as red candies, we can calculate the number of orange candies as follows:
Orange candies = 2 * Red candies
Orange candies = 2 * 54
Orange candies = 108

We are also given that there are half as many yellow candies as red candies. We can calculate the number of yellow candies as follows:
Yellow candies = Red candies / 2
Yellow candies = 54 / 2
Yellow candies = 27

Now, we know the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies:
Total red, orange, and yellow candies = Red candies + Orange candies + Yellow candies
Total red, orange, and yellow candies = 54 + 108 + 27
Total red, orange, and yellow candies = 189

Since the total number of candies in the bag is 232, we can find the number of pink candies by subtracting the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies:
Pink candies = Total candies - Total red, orange, and yellow candies
Pink candies = 232 - 189
Pink candies = 43

- 95 dimes = 95 x $0.10 = $9.50
- 120 nickels = 120 x $0.05 = $6.00
- 750 pennies = 750 x $0.01 = $7.50

Now, let's add the values together:
$8.00 + $9.50 = $17.50
$17.50 + $6.00 = $23.50
$23.50 + $7.50 = $31.00

The total dollar amount in the jar is $31.00."
"To find out how much money Janet has left, we need to calculate the total amount she spent and subtract that from the amount her parents gave her.

First, let's calculate the total amount she spent:

- Ice cream: $3.50
- Movie tickets (2 tickets): 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
- Bracelet: $8.50
Total spent: $3.50 + $15.00 + $8.50 = $27.00

Now, let's subtract the total amount spent from the amount her parents gave her:

$40.00 (initial amount) - $27.00 (total spent) = $13.00

Janet has $13.00 left."
"To find out how much Josh makes in 2 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of days he works and then multiply it by the number of cars he services per day and his hourly wage.

Josh is open every day except Sunday and Wednesday, so he works 5 days a week. In 2 weeks, he works 5 days/week * 2 weeks = 10 days.

Since Josh services 3 cars a day, in 10 days, he services 3 cars/day * 10 days = 30 cars.

Josh gets paid $4 per car, so in 10 days, he makes 30 cars * $4/car = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To find the total number of cookies Randy has now, we need to calculate the number of cookies he has after each event and subtract the ones he ate or gave away, and add the ones he baked.

Initially, Randy has 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies. 

He ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor. So, he has:
- 9 - 1 = 8 oatmeal cookies
- 4 - 1 = 3 chocolate chip cookies
- 5 - 1 = 4 sugar cookies

He ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch. So, he has:
- 8 - 2 = 6 oatmeal cookies
- 3 chocolate chip cookies (no change)
- 4 sugar cookies (no change)

He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends. So, he has:
- 6 oatmeal cookies (no change)
- 3 chocolate chip cookies (no change)
- 4 - 2 = 2 sugar cookies

He bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner. So, he has:
- 6 + 4 = 10 oatmeal cookies
- 3 + 4 = 7 chocolate chip cookies
- 2 + 4 = 6 sugar cookies

Now, let's add up the total number of cookies Randy has:
10 (oatmeal) + 7 (chocolate chip) + 6 (sugar) = 23

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we need to calculate the amount he would get for the first half of the collection and the second half separately, and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of toys in each half: 12 / 2 = 6 toys in each half.

For the first half, Matthew would get 6 toys * $5 per toy = $30.

For the second half, Matthew would get 6 toys * $7 per toy = $42.

Now, let's add the amounts together: $30 + $42 = $72.

The final answer is: $72"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog and then determine how many holes Nate fills in per day. 

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes is 6 * 14 = 84 holes.

Now, let's calculate the net number of holes filled in per day. Nate fills in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night. So, the net number of holes filled in per day is 9 - 6 = 3 holes.

To find out how many days it takes to fill in all the holes, we divide the total number of holes by the net number of holes filled in per day: 84 / 3 = 28 days.

Since we are asked to find the number of weeks, we need to convert the number of days to weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide 28 by 7: 28 / 7 = 4 weeks.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the average enrollment at Butler High School, we need to calculate 3/4 of the average enrollment at Norman High School. 

3/4 of 4000 is calculated as (3/4) * 4000 = 3000.

Now, we need to find the difference between the average enrollment at Norman High School and Butler High School. 

The difference is 4000 - 3000 = 1000.

The final answer is: 1000"
"To find the number of chocolate chip cookies, we need to subtract the total number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies made.

Total cookies made = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

First, let's add the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies:
2595 + 3075 = 5670

Now, subtract the total number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies made:
7995 - 5670 = 2325

So, the Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies.

"Let's denote the number of test tubes as T, the number of beakers as B, and the number of Petri dishes as P. We are given the following information:

1. T = 16 (initially requested)
2. T = 0.5 * 16 = 8 (Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested)
3. P = 14 (initially requested)
4. P = 8 + 2 = 10 (Igor gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested)
5. B = 7 (initially requested)
6. T + B + P = 29 (total number of items on the lab bench)

We can substitute the values of T and P from equations 2 and 4 into equation 6:

8 + B + 10 = 29

Combine like terms:

18 + B = 29

Subtract 18 from both sides:

B = 11

However, we know that B = 7 (initially requested). This means that Igor lost 7 - 11 = -4 beakers. Since we can't lose a negative number of beakers, this is a contradiction. However, we can re-examine the problem and find the correct solution.

Let's re-evaluate the information:

1. T = 16 (initially requested)
2. T = 0.5 * 16 = 8 (Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested)
3. P = 14 (initially requested)
4. P = 8 + 2 = 10 (Igor gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested)
5. T + B + P = 29 (total number of items on the lab bench)

We can substitute the values of T and P from equations 2 and 4 into equation 5:

8 + B + 10 = 29

Combine like terms:

18 + B = 29

Subtract 18 from both sides:

B = 11

However, we know that B = 7 (initially requested). This means that Igor lost 11 - 7 = 4 beakers.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws needed for the tables and subtract that from the total number of screws he has.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws, so each table needs 4 x 2 = 8 screws.

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws needed is 8 x 4 = 32 screws.

James has 40 screws, so to find out how many he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the total number of screws he has: 40 - 32 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we need to first determine the number of eggs in the second basket. Since there are twice as many eggs in the second basket as in the first, we can multiply the number of eggs in the first basket by 2.

Number of eggs in the first basket: 10
Number of eggs in the second basket: 10 * 2 = 20

Now, we add the number of eggs in both baskets to find the total:

Total number of eggs = 10 + 20 = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to calculate the individual amounts raised by each girl and then add them together.

Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, who raises $430. So, Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750.

Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, who raises $300. So, Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, we add up the amounts raised by each girl: $750 (Kim) + $430 (Alexandra) + $700 (Maryam) + $300 (Sarah) = $2180.

The final answer is: $2180"
"To solve this problem, we need to first establish the relationship between Aaron's and Vanessa's running speeds and distances. Let's denote Aaron's speed as A and Vanessa's speed as V. We know that Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, so A = 2V.

We also know that Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron, so if Vanessa runs 4 miles, Aaron runs 2 miles.

Since Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed. For Aaron, this becomes 16 = 2 / A. Since A = 2V, we can substitute this into the equation to get 16 = 2 / (2V), which simplifies to 16 = 1 / V.

To find V, we can rearrange the equation to get V = 1 / 16.

Now that we know Vanessa's speed, we can find the time it took her to complete her part of the race. We know that Time = Distance / Speed, and Vanessa's distance is 4 miles. So, the time it took her to complete her part of the race is 4 / (1/16), which simplifies to 4 * 16 = 64 minutes.

The final answer is: 64"
"To find out how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of line required for the existing dock. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock, we multiply 3 by 200.

3 * 200 = 600

This means he needs 600 feet of line for the existing dock. Since he already has 6 feet of line, we need to subtract that from the total amount needed.

600 - 6 = 594

So, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total. 

594"
"To find out how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to calculate their daily revenue and then multiply it by the number of days they are open.

First, let's calculate the daily revenue:

- Number of reservations per night: 6
- Meals per reservation: 2
- Cost of each meal: $5
- Cost of wine: $5
- Total cost per reservation: 2 * $5 + $5 = $15
- Daily revenue: 6 reservations * $15 = $90

Now, let's calculate the weekly revenue:
- Number of days open per week: 2
- Weekly revenue: $90 * 2 = $180

The final answer is: $180"
"To find the selling price of each watermelon, we first need to find the total cost of the watermelons. The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80, so the cost per watermelon is $80 / 50 = $1.60.

Since the vendor sold the watermelons at a 25% profit, the selling price of each watermelon is the cost per watermelon plus 25% of the cost per watermelon. 

25% of $1.60 is 0.25 * $1.60 = $0.40. 

The selling price of each watermelon is $1.60 + $0.40 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the current age of James and then use that information to find the current age of John's youngest son.

First, let's find James' current age. We know that James is twice as old as Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years. This means that Dora's current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

We also know that John had James when he was 19, so the difference in their ages is 18 - 19 = -1. However, this is not possible since James is older than John. This means that John must have been older than 19 when James was born. Let's assume John was x years old when James was born. Then, the difference in their ages is x - 19.

We also know that James is 18 years old now, so the difference in their ages is 18 - (x - 19) = 37. Solving for x, we get x = 37 - 18 + 19 = 38. This means John was 38 years old when James was born.

Now, let's find the current age of John's youngest son. We know that John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so the difference in their ages is 38 - 32 = 6 years. This means John's youngest son is currently 6 years old.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 6 + 3 = 9 years old.

The final answer is: 9"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many oranges each person can peel in an hour and then find the difference.

Ana peels 1 orange in 3 minutes, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges.

Jane peels 1 orange in 4 minutes, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

The difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane in an hour is 20 - 15 = 5 oranges.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the discounted price of the radiator. 

The original price of the radiator is $400. Mark gets it for 80% off, which means he pays 20% of the original price. 

20% of $400 is calculated as 0.2 * 400 = $80. 

So, Mark pays $80 for the radiator.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of hiring a mechanic to install the radiator. The mechanic works for 3 hours at $50 an hour. 

The total cost of hiring the mechanic is 3 * 50 = $150.

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the cost of hiring the mechanic to find the total cost.

Total cost = $80 (radiator) + $150 (mechanic) = $230.

The final answer is: $230"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as W.

We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write the equation:

C + W = 20

We also know that the total number of legs is 70. Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, so we can write the equation:

2C + 4W = 70

Now we have a system of two linear equations with two variables. We can solve this system using substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution.

From the first equation, we can express W in terms of C:

W = 20 - C

Now, substitute this expression for W into the second equation:

2C + 4(20 - C) = 70

Expand and simplify:

2C + 80 - 4C = 70

Combine like terms:

-2C + 80 = 70

Subtract 80 from both sides:

-2C = -10

Divide both sides by -2:

C = 5

So, there are 5 chickens on the farm.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

First, let's find the total number of slices. There are 7 pizzas, and each pizza is cut into 8 slices. 

Total number of slices = 7 pizzas * 8 slices/pizza = 56 slices

There are 4 people in total, including Henry and his 3 friends. 

Number of people = 4

Now, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people to find out how many slices each person can have.

Slices per person = Total number of slices / Number of people
= 56 slices / 4 people
= 14 slices/person

The final answer is: 14"
