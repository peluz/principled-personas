"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to first determine how many eggs she has left after eating and baking. 

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast and bakes 4 for muffins, so she uses a total of 3 + 4 = 7 eggs. 

Now, let's subtract the number of eggs she uses from the total number of eggs she lays: 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.

Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at $2 each. To find out how much she makes, we multiply the number of eggs she sells by the price per egg: 9 * 2 = 18.

The final answer is: $18"
"To find the total number of bolts needed, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber first. Since it's half the amount of blue fiber, and there are 2 bolts of blue fiber, we can calculate the white fiber as follows:

White fiber = 2 bolts (blue fiber) / 2 = 1 bolt

Now, we add the blue fiber and white fiber to get the total number of bolts:

Total bolts = 2 bolts (blue fiber) + 1 bolt (white fiber) = 3 bolts

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the profit Josh made, we first need to determine the total value of the house after the repairs. 

The original value of the house was $80,000. Josh put in $50,000 in repairs, which increased the value of the house by 150%. 

Let's denote the increased value as x. We can set up the equation: 
80,000 + 50,000 = x + 1.5x (since 150% is the same as multiplying by 1.5)

Combine like terms: 
130,000 = 2.5x

Now, divide both sides by 2.5 to solve for x: 
x = 130,000 / 2.5
x = 52,000

So, the total value of the house after the repairs is $52,000. 

To find the profit, we need to subtract the original cost of the house from the new value: 
Profit = New value - Original cost
Profit = 52,000 - 80,000
Profit = -28,000

However, since Josh put in $50,000 in repairs, we need to add this to the profit to get the total profit: 
Total profit = Profit + Repairs
Total profit = -28,000 + 50,000
Total profit = 22,000

The final answer is: $22,000"
"To find the total number of meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total meters he runs in one sprint session and then multiply it by the number of sessions he has in a week.

Since James runs 3 sprints in one session, and each sprint is 60 meters, the total meters he runs in one session is:
3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/session

Since James runs 3 times a week, the total meters he runs in a week is:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

The final answer is: 540"
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to determine the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon meals. 

In the morning, Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups of feed. In the afternoon, she gives her chickens 25 cups of feed. 

The total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon meals is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

Since Wendi feeds each chicken 3 cups of feed per day, and she has 20 chickens, the total amount of feed needed per day is 3 * 20 = 60 cups.

To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we subtract the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon meals from the total amount of feed needed per day. 

60 - 40 = 20 cups.

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining glasses. 

The first glass costs $5. 
The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3. 
The third glass costs 60% of $3, which is 0.6 * $3 = $1.8. 
We can see that the cost of each subsequent glass is 60% of the previous glass. 

The sequence of the cost of the glasses is: $5, $3, $1.8, $1.08, $0.64, $0.384, $0.2304, $0.13824, $0.082944, $0.0497664, $0.02986584, $0.017949504, $0.0107949032, $0.00646784192, $0.003863960576, $0.0023281813456, $0.0014005088.

To find the total cost, we need to sum up the cost of all the glasses. 
Total cost = $5 + $3 + $1.8 + $1.08 + $0.64 + $0.384 + $0.2304 + $0.13824 + $0.082944 + $0.0497664 + $0.02986584 + $0.017949504 + $0.0107949032 + $0.00646784192 + $0.003863960576 + $0.0023281813456 + $0.0014005088.

Total cost ≈ $24.999999999999996.

However, we can simplify this process by using a formula. The cost of the first glass is $5, and the cost of the second glass is 60% of $5. The cost of the third glass is 60% of the second glass, which is 60% of 60% of $5. This can be represented as 0.6 * 0.6 * $5 = 0.36 * $5. 

The cost of the fourth glass is 60% of the third glass, which is 60% of 60% of 60% of $5. This can be represented as 0.6 * 0.6 * 0.6 * $5 = 0.216 * $5.

We can see that the cost of each subsequent glass is 60% of the previous glass. This can be represented as 0.6^n * $5, where n is the position of the glass.

The total cost can be represented as the sum of the cost of the first glass and the sum of the cost of the remaining glasses. The sum of the cost of the remaining glasses can be represented as the sum of the geometric series 0.6^1 * $5 + 0.6^2 * $5 + 0.6^3 * $5 + ... + 0.6^15 * $5.

The sum of a geometric series can be calculated using the formula S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.

In this case, a = 0.6 * $5, r = 0.6, and n = 15. 

S = 0.6 * $5 * (1 - 0.6^15) / (1 - 0.6)

"To find the number of sheep in Toulouse, we first need to find the number of sheep in Charleston. Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, and Seattle has 20 sheep, Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.

Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

To find the total number of sheep, we add the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle: 160 + 80 + 20 = 260.

The final answer is: 260"
"To find the total time it takes Carla to download the file, we need to calculate the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file, the time it takes to install the updates, and the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file:
40% of 200 GB is 0.4 x 200 = 80 GB. 
Since Carla can download 2 GB/minute, the time it takes to download 80 GB is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to install the updates:
The time it takes to install the updates is given as 20 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file:
60% of 200 GB is 0.6 x 200 = 120 GB. 
Since Carla can download 2 GB/minute, the time it takes to download 120 GB is 120 / 2 = 60 minutes.

The total time it takes to download the file is the sum of the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file, the time it takes to install the updates, and the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file:
Total time = 40 + 20 + 60 = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: 120"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and calculate the distance covered in each segment.

1. First, John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph. The distance covered in this segment is:
   Distance = Speed * Time = 60 mph * 3 hours = 180 miles

2. Then, he spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so no distance is covered in this segment.

3. Next, he drives for 0.5 hours (half an hour) at 30 mph. The distance covered in this segment is:
   Distance = Speed * Time = 30 mph * 0.5 hours = 15 miles

4. Finally, he drives for the remaining 1.5 hours (4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours) at 80 mph. The distance covered in this segment is:
   Distance = Speed * Time = 80 mph * 1.5 hours = 120 miles

Now, we add up the distances covered in each segment to find the total distance from home:
Total distance = 180 miles + 0 miles + 15 miles + 120 miles = 315 miles

The final answer is: 315"
"To find Eliza's total earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings are:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours, she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours. Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, so her overtime rate is:
$10/hour * 1.2 = $12/hour

Her earnings for the overtime hours are:
5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Total earnings for the week are the sum of her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours:
$400 + $60 = $460

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and then add them together.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the downloads were reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which is 54. Then, we subtract 54 from 180 to get 126 downloads in the third month.

Now, we add the downloads from each month together: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The final answer is: 366"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then add them together.

The cost of 3 dozen donuts is 3 * $68 = $204.
The cost of 2 dozen mini cupcakes is 2 * $80 = $160.
The cost of 6 dozen mini cheesecakes is 6 * $55 = $330.

Now, let's add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The final answer is: $694"
"To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the total cost of the tree and the total revenue it generates each year.

The initial cost of the tree is $90. 

Each year, the tree generates revenue from selling lemons. Since the tree grows 7 lemons per year and each lemon sells for $1.5, the total revenue per year is 7 * $1.5 = $10.5.

However, it also costs $3 to water and feed the tree each year. So, the net revenue per year is $10.5 - $3 = $7.5.

To find out how many years it will take for the tree to start earning money, we need to find the break-even point, which is when the total revenue equals the initial cost of the tree. 

Let's denote the number of years as 'x'. The total revenue after 'x' years is $7.5x, and the total cost is $90. We set up the equation:

$7.5x = $90

To solve for 'x', we divide both sides by $7.5:

x = $90 / $7.5
x = 12

Since the tree will start earning money after the 13th year (when the total revenue exceeds the initial cost), it will take 13 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

The final answer is: 13"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume Melanie started with x vacuum cleaners.

At the green house, she sold a third of her vacuum cleaners, which is x/3.

At the red house, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners.

At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, which is (x - x/3 - 2)/2.

We know that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we can set up the equation:

x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

To simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 6 to eliminate the fractions:

6x - 2x - 12 - 3(x - x/3 - 2) = 30

Combine like terms:

4x - 12 - 3x + x + 6 = 30

Combine like terms:

2x - 6 = 30

Add 6 to both sides:

2x = 36

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 18

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to find the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance, and then subtract that from the total number of students.

20% of 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance:
20 * 0.2 = 4 students

The remaining students are 20 - 4 = 16 students.

25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:
16 * 0.25 = 4 students

The number of students enrolled in jazz dance is 4, and the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance is 4. So, the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance is 16 - 4 - 4 = 8 students.

To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100:
(8 / 20) * 100 = 40%

The final answer is: 40"
"To determine the maximum profit, we need to calculate the potential value of each purchase option after the market fluctuation.

For the jewelry option:
Initial value: $5,000
Market increase: 2.5%
New value: $5,000 + ($5,000 * 0.025) = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125

For the electronic gadgets option:
Initial value: $8,000
Market increase: 1.2%
New value: $8,000 + ($8,000 * 0.012) = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096

Since the merchant wants to maximize profit, we need to consider the difference between the new values and the initial purchase price for each option.

Profit from jewelry: $5,125 - $5,000 = $125
Profit from electronic gadgets: $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

However, the merchant will only choose the option that results in the higher profit. In this case, the profit from the jewelry option ($125) is higher than the profit from the electronic gadgets option ($96). 

The final answer is: $125"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance covered on the first day and the distance covered on the second day.

On the first day, both trains travel 80 miles westward. Since they are traveling in the same direction, they cover the same distance. 

On the second day, they travel 150 miles northward. Again, since they are traveling in the same direction, they cover the same distance.

So, the distance covered by each train in the two days is:

Day 1: 80 miles (westward)
Day 2: 150 miles (northward)

The total distance covered by each train in the two days is 80 + 150 = 230 miles.

The final answer is: 230"
"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:

- Hourly wage: $20
- Hours worked per week: 35
- Weeks worked per year: 50
- Total hours worked per year: 35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year
- Annual earnings from teaching: 1750 hours/year * $20/hour = $35,000/year

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:

- Hourly wage: $30
- Hours worked per week: 15
- Weeks worked per year: 50
- Total hours worked per year: 15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year
- Annual earnings from coaching: 750 hours/year * $30/hour = $22,500/year

Now, let's add her earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary:

Annual salary = Annual earnings from teaching + Annual earnings from coaching
= $35,000/year + $22,500/year
= $57,500/year

The final answer is: $57,500"
"To find out how many eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in a week and then multiply it by 4.

Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning, so in a week, she eats 3 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 21 eggs/week.

In 4 weeks, she will eat 21 eggs/week * 4 weeks = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens she will eat in 4 weeks.

84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozens.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total time Marissa has taken to walk the first 6 miles. She took 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles and another hour to walk the next 2 miles, so the total time taken for the first 6 miles is 1 + 1 = 2 hours.

The total distance of the trail is 12 miles, and she has already walked 6 miles. So, the remaining distance is 12 - 6 = 6 miles.

Since Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail, and she has already walked 6 miles in 2 hours, her average speed for the entire trail is 12 miles / 3 hours = 4 miles per hour.

However, we are asked to find the speed she needs to walk the remaining 6 miles. We know that the total time she has to complete the entire trail is 12 miles / 4 mph = 3 hours. Since she has already taken 2 hours, she has 3 - 2 = 1 hour left to walk the remaining 6 miles.

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance, we divide the remaining distance by the remaining time: 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total amount of water in the orange drink, we first need to calculate two-thirds of 10 liters. 

Two-thirds of 10 liters is (2/3) * 10 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters.

Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the remaining one-third is non-water. So, the non-water content in the orange drink is 10 - 6.67 = 3.33 liters.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water in the pineapple drink. Three-fifths of 15 liters is (3/5) * 15 = 45/5 = 9 liters.

The total amount of water in the orange drink after spilling 1 liter is 6.67 - 1 = 5.67 liters.

The total amount of water in the mixture is the sum of the water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink, which is 5.67 + 9 = 14.67 liters.

However, we need to find the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters. Since 1 liter of the orange drink was spilled, the total amount of the mixture is 10 + 15 - 1 = 24 liters.

The amount of non-water in the orange drink is 3.33 liters, and the amount of non-water in the pineapple drink is 15 - 9 = 6 liters.

The total amount of non-water in the mixture is 3.33 + 6 = 9.33 liters.

The amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is the total amount of water minus the non-water content, which is 24 - 9.33 = 14.67 liters.

However, we need to find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, not the total amount of water in the mixture. Since 1 liter of the orange drink was spilled, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 5.67 + 9 = 14.67 liters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14.67}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how old Raymond was when his son was born and then subtract that from the current age of Samantha to find out how many years ago it was.

First, let's find out how old Raymond is now. Since Samantha is 31 and Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, Raymond is 31 - 6 = 25 years old.

Since Raymond had a son at the age of 23, we need to find out how many years have passed since then. Raymond is currently 25, so he was 23 when his son was born. This means 25 - 23 = 2 years have passed since his son was born.

However, the question asks how many years ago Raymond's son was born, not how many years have passed since he was born. Since Samantha is 31, and we know that Raymond is 25, we can find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born by subtracting the age of Raymond when his son was born from the current age of Samantha. However, we know that Samantha is 8 years older than Raymond's son's age at birth.

"To find the total number of DVDs sold, we need to calculate the number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers.

The first 3 customers buy one DVD each, so they bought a total of 3 DVDs.
The next 2 customers buy 2 DVDs each, so they bought a total of 2 * 2 = 4 DVDs.

Now, let's add the number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers: 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs.

The last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs, so we don't need to add anything to the total.

The total number of DVDs sold on Tuesday is 7."
"To find the total number of centimeters the candle will be shorter, we need to calculate the total time it burns and multiply it by the rate at which it melts.

"To find the original price of the book, we need to determine the amount of the discount and add it to the discounted price. 

First, let's find the amount of the discount: 
Discount = 25% of the original price
Let the original price be x
Discount = 0.25x

Since the discounted price is $19.50, we can set up the equation:
x - 0.25x = 19.50
0.75x = 19.50

Now, we can solve for x:
x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book was $26.

The final answer is: $26"
"To find the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples, we need to multiply the cost of each item by the quantity and add them together.

Cost of chicken meal: $12
Cost of milk: 5 packs * $3 = $15
Cost of apples: 4 apples * $1.50 = $6
Total cost of chicken, milk, and apples: $12 + $15 + $6 = $33

Now, we know that Marie paid a total of $50. To find the cost of the pizza boxes, we subtract the total cost of the chicken, milk, and apples from the total amount paid.

Cost of pizza boxes: $50 - $33 = $17

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, we can find the number of boxes by dividing the total cost of pizza boxes by the cost of each box.

Number of boxes of pizza: $17 / $8.50 = 2

The final answer is: 2"

"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream, we need to calculate the total number of cartons she buys and multiply it by the cost per carton.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she will go through 60 servings in 60 days. 

Each carton has 15 servings, so to find out how many cartons she buys, we divide the total number of servings by the number of servings per carton: 
60 servings / 15 servings per carton = 4 cartons

Now, we multiply the number of cartons by the cost per carton to find the total cost:
4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00

"To find the distance traveled between Henry's first and second stops, we need to determine the distance between the two stops. 

First, we know that Henry's second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total distance of the trip is 60 miles, we can find the distance from the start to the second stop by subtracting 15 miles from the total distance: 60 - 15 = 45 miles.

However, this is the distance from the start to the second stop. To find the distance between the first and second stops, we need to subtract the distance traveled before the first stop, which is 20 miles. 

So, the distance between the first and second stops is 45 - 20 = 25 miles.

"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given ratio and total age. Let's assume Darrell's age is 7x and Allen's age is 11x, where x is a common multiplier.

Since their total age is 162, we can write the equation: 7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms: 18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18: x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Darrell's and Allen's current ages:
Darrell's age = 7x = 7(9) = 63
Allen's age = 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

The third person guesses 25% more than the first one: 80 * 0.25 = 20, then 80 + 20 = 100.

Now, let's add up all the guesses: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

There are 3 people, so we divide the total by 3 to find the average: 240 / 3 = 80.

"To find the total hours John spends taking care of dogs per week, we need to calculate the total hours he spends per day and then multiply it by 7 (the number of days in a week).

Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business. Since John takes care of 10 dogs, the total hours he spends per day is:
10 dogs * 0.5 hours/dog = 5 hours/day

Now, we multiply the total hours per day by 7 to get the total hours per week:
5 hours/day * 7 days/week = 35 hours/week

The final answer is: 35"
"To find the number of gold coins, we need to set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of silver coins as S and the number of gold coins as G.

We know that G = S + 30 (since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins).

We also know that the total number of coins is 110, so S + G = 110.

Substituting G = S + 30 into the second equation, we get S + (S + 30) = 110.

Combine like terms: 2S + 30 = 110.

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2S = 80.

Divide both sides by 2: S = 40.

Now that we know S = 40, we can find G by substituting S into the equation G = S + 30: G = 40 + 30 = 70.

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

The final answer is: 70"
"To find out how many jewels Siobhan has, we need to first determine how many jewels Aaron has. 

Since Raymond has 40 jewels, half of Raymond's jewels would be 40 / 2 = 20. 

Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, so Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.

Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, so Siobhan has 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.

"To find the total points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points he scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes separately, and then add them together.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% of 4, we multiply 4 by 0.25, which is 1. Then, we add this to the original 4 points to get the total points scored in the second 20 minutes: 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Now, we add the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes: 4 + 5 = 9 points.

The total points Mike scored is 9.

"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to first determine how many yogurts he eats in 30 days and then calculate the cost.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

Since the yogurts are on sale at 4 for $5.00, we need to find out how many sets of 4 yogurts Terry buys in 30 days. To do this, we divide the total number of yogurts he eats by 4: 60 / 4 = 15 sets.

Now, we multiply the number of sets by the cost per set: 15 sets * $5.00 = $75.00.

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days.

The final answer is: $75.00"
"To find out how many Lego sets John sold, we need to calculate the total amount of money he made from selling the Lego sets and then subtract the amount he spent on video games and the remaining amount he has.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money John made from selling the Lego sets:
13 Lego sets * $15 each = $195

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money John spent on video games:
8 video games * $20 each = $160

Now, let's subtract the amount he spent on video games from the total amount he made:
$195 - $160 = $35

Since John has $5 left, we need to subtract this from the amount he made after buying video games:
$35 - $5 = $30

This means John spent $30 on video games and had $5 left, which is the amount he made from selling 2 Lego sets:
$30 / $15 = 2

Since John started with 13 Lego sets, we subtract the number of sets he sold:
13 - 2 = 11

John still has 11 Lego sets.

"To find John's running speed, we first need to calculate the total hours he runs per week. 

He runs 3 hours on the first day. The other two days, he runs half as much as the first day, which is 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours per day. 

So, the total hours he runs per week is 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours.

Since John runs 60 miles a week and runs for 6 hours a week, we can find his speed by dividing the total miles by the total hours:

Speed = Total miles / Total hours
Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
Speed = 10 miles per hour

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Dana's walking speed. Since she can skip at half the speed of running and skip at 3 miles per hour, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour. 

Since she can run four times faster than she can walk, her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, we need to find the time she spends running and walking. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. So, the time she spends running is 6 hours * 1/3 = 2 hours, and the time she spends walking is 6 hours * 2/3 = 4 hours.

The distance she travels while running is her running speed * time spent running = 6 miles per hour * 2 hours = 12 miles. The distance she travels while walking is her walking speed * time spent walking = 1.5 miles per hour * 4 hours = 6 miles.

The total distance she can travel in six hours is the sum of the distances she travels while running and walking, which is 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles.

The final answer is: 18"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the age of Brandon's iPhone. 

First, we know that Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old. 
Since Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, we can calculate Ben's iPhone age as 2 * 1 = 2 years.

Next, we know that Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. 
So, we can calculate Brandon's iPhone age as 4 * 2 = 8 years.

The final answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the distance Polly can throw the javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone, and then subtract the dragon's reach from that distance.

When Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone. Since she can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone, she can throw it 3 * 400 = 1200 feet with the gemstone.

The dragon's reach is 1000 feet, so Polly can stand 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet outside of the dragon's reach and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

The final answer is: 200"
"To find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we need to subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces. 

First, let's calculate the total number of pieces. Since Grandma Jones cut each pie into 8 pieces and she baked 5 pies, the total number of pieces is 5 * 8 = 40.

Now, we subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces to find out how many were taken by the guests. 

40 (total pieces) - 14 (remaining pieces) = 26

The final answer is: 26"
"To find out how many calories you can still consume, subtract the calories you've already consumed from your daily target: 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories.

Since each serving of chips has 250 calories, divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving: 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings.

Since a 300g bag has 5 servings, multiply the number of servings you can still consume by the total weight of the bag: 0.8 * 300g = 240g.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost.

First, let's calculate the total cost. Since one pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10.00, and Charlie makes 10 candles per pound, the cost per candle is $1.00 ($10.00 / 10 candles). 

For 20 candles, the total cost is 20 * $1.00 = $20.00.

Next, let's calculate the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, so for 20 candles, the total revenue is 20 * $2.00 = $40.00.

Now, we can calculate the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.

The final answer is: $20.00"
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply it by the time it takes to write one article (4 hours).

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. To find 2/5 of 5, we multiply 5 by 2/5:
5 * (2/5) = 2
So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 7 * 2 = 14 articles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles she wrote in the three days:
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles

Since it takes 4 hours to write one article, the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours

The final answer is: 104"
"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we need to first determine how many Post-it notes she used in total. 

Candice started with 80 Post-it notes. She used 220 Post-it notes at work. To find the total number of Post-it notes she used, we add these two numbers together: 80 + 220 = 300. 

Since she had 23 Post-it notes remaining, we need to subtract this from the total number of Post-it notes she used to find out how many she purchased: 300 - 23 = 277.

The final answer is: 277"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many blue ties John bought. Since he spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is:

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
= 2 * 5
= 10

Now, we need to find the cost of each red tie. Since the red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, the cost of each red tie is:

Cost of each red tie = Cost of each blue tie + (50% of the cost of each blue tie)
= $40 + (0.5 * $40)
= $40 + $20
= $60

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent on red ties:

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of each red tie
= 10 * $60
= $600

Finally, we can calculate the total amount spent on ties by adding the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties:

Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
= $200 + $600
= $800

The final answer is: $800"
"To find the number of pieces Tracy obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches, since the pieces are 6 inches long. 

1 foot is equal to 12 inches. 

So, 4 feet is equal to 4 x 12 = 48 inches.

Now, we can divide the total length of the wire (48 inches) by the length of each piece (6 inches) to find the number of pieces:

48 ÷ 6 = 8

Tracy obtained 8 pieces."
"To find the total number of units in the building, we need to multiply the number of floors by the number of units per floor. 

Number of floors: 15
Number of units per floor: 8

Total units = Number of floors * Number of units per floor
Total units = 15 * 8
Total units = 120

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we need to find 1/4 of the total units to determine the number of unoccupied units.

1/4 of the total units = (1/4) * Total units
1/4 of the total units = (1/4) * 120
1/4 of the total units = 30

The total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"To find out how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to calculate the total number of eggs produced per week and then multiply it by the price per dozen.

First, let's calculate the total number of eggs produced per week:
252 eggs per day * 7 days per week = 1764 eggs per week

Since Lloyd sells eggs by the dozen, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens:
1764 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 147 dozen eggs per week

Now, let's calculate the total revenue per week:
147 dozen eggs per week * $2 per dozen = $294 per week

The final answer is: $294"
"To find the total time Tom takes to travel back, we need to first determine the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM. Since the distance is not given, we can assume it's a fixed distance, but for the sake of this problem, let's assume it's a round trip, so the distance is the same in both directions.

Let's denote the distance as 'd'. Since the speed is 10 mph, the time taken to travel from 1 to 4 PM is d/10. 

The time from 1 to 4 PM is 3 hours. So, d/10 = 3. This means the distance 'd' is 30 miles.

Now, to find the time taken to travel back at 6 mph, we use the formula time = distance/speed. The distance is the same, 30 miles, and the speed is 6 mph. 

Time = 30/6 = 5 hours.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he removes 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is:

30 * 1/4 = 30 * 0.25 = 7.5 pounds

Since Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds, and the comic books weigh 7.5 pounds, the remaining weight that needs to be removed from toys is:

15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, the number of toys Uriah needs to remove is:

7.5 / 0.5 = 15

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the revenue earned on each day, we need to calculate the total revenue from truck tires and car tires separately for both days.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. 
- Revenue from truck tires on Thursday: 6 * $60 = $360
- Revenue from car tires on Thursday: 4 * $40 = $160
- Total revenue on Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires. 
- Revenue from car tires on Friday: 12 * $40 = $480
- Total revenue on Friday: $480

To find the day with higher revenue, we compare the total revenue on both days. 
- Thursday's revenue: $520
- Friday's revenue: $480

Since $520 is greater than $480, Thursday is the day with higher revenue. 
The difference in revenue between the two days is $520 - $480 = $40.

"To find the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to calculate the amount she paid for the first half of the year and the second half of the year separately and then add them together.

The streaming service charges $140 per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the first half of the year consists of 6 months. 

The amount paid for the first half of the year is 6 * $140 = $840.

For the second half of the year, the company charges 10% less than the initial amount. To find the amount charged for the second half, we need to calculate 10% of $140 and subtract it from $140.

10% of $140 = 0.1 * $140 = $14

The amount charged for the second half of the year is $140 - $14 = $126.

"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to determine the car's miles per gallon (mpg) rating. We can do this by dividing the distance traveled since the last fill-up (100 miles) by the amount of gas used (4 gallons).

mpg = distance / gas used
mpg = 100 miles / 4 gallons
mpg = 25 miles per gallon

Now that we know the car's mpg rating, we can calculate the total distance Sophia can drive on a full tank by multiplying the tank capacity (12 gallons) by the mpg rating.

total distance = tank capacity * mpg
total distance = 12 gallons * 25 miles/gallon

$2.50 / 3 flowers = $0.8333 per flower

For the package of 2 flowers for $1, the cost per flower is:
$1 / 2 flowers = $0.50 per flower

Since $0.50 per flower is less than $0.8333 per flower, the package of 2 flowers for $1 is the better option.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price:
18 flowers * $0.50 per flower = $9

To find the cost of buying 18 flowers at the original price, we need to calculate the number of packages of 3 flowers:
18 flowers / 3 flowers per package = 6 packages

The total cost of buying 18 flowers at the original price is:
6 packages * $2.50 per package = $15

The amount of money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price is:
$15 - $9 = $6

The final answer is: $6"
"To find the cost of the grooming after the discount, we need to calculate 30% of the original price and subtract it from the original price.

The original price is $100. 
30% of $100 is 0.3 x $100 = $30.

Now, subtract the discount from the original price: $100 - $30 = $70.

The final cost of the grooming is $70.

The final answer is: $70"
"To find out how much water the girls got, we need to calculate 1/6 of 24 liters for each girl. 

1/6 of 24 liters is 24 / 6 = 4 liters. Since there are two girls, they got a total of 4 * 2 = 8 liters.

Now, we subtract the total amount of water the girls got from the initial 24 liters: 24 - 8 = 16 liters.

Then, the boy got 6 liters of water. We subtract this from the remaining 16 liters: 16 - 6 = 10 liters.

So, the amount of water left is 10 liters.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many stickers Charlie has left, we need to calculate the total number of stickers he had initially and then subtract the number of stickers he gave away and used.

Initially, Charlie had 10 stickers.

He bought 21 stickers from a store, so now he has 10 + 21 = 31 stickers.

He got 23 stickers for his birthday, so now he has 31 + 23 = 54 stickers.

Then, he gave 9 stickers to his sister, so now he has 54 - 9 = 45 stickers.

Finally, he used 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card, so now he has 45 - 28 = 17 stickers.

Therefore, Charlie has 17 stickers left.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find Alex's weight, we need to calculate 4 times Grace's weight and then subtract 2 pounds from that result. 

First, we multiply Grace's weight by 4: 125 * 4 = 500 pounds. 

Then, we subtract 2 pounds from that result: 500 - 2 = 498 pounds.

Now, we know Alex's weight is 498 pounds. 

To find their combined weights, we add Grace's weight and Alex's weight: 125 + 498 = 623 pounds.

The final answer is: 623"
"To find the total number of thorns, we need to multiply the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush, and then multiply that result by the number of thorns per rose.

First, we multiply the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush: 3 * 25 = 75

Then, we multiply the result by the number of thorns per rose: 75 * 8 = 600

So, there are 600 thorns in total. 

600"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the number of games they lost is x. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games they won is x + 8.

We know that the total number of games played is 22, which is the sum of the games won and lost. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:

2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 7

Since x represents the number of games lost, and they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games they won is x + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total number of quilt blocks, we need to calculate the total number of years Gene has been vacationing and multiply it by the number of vacations he goes on per year.

Gene is 34 years old and started vacationing at 23, so he has been vacationing for 34 - 23 = 11 years.

Since he goes on 4 vacations per year, the total number of quilt blocks is 11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 quilt blocks.

The final answer is: 44"
"To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the number of times it rang each time it went off and add them up.

The first time it went off, it rang 4 times.

The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time, so it rang 3 * 4 = 12 times.

The third time it went off, it rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we add up the number of times it rang each time: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To find Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate her salary after the 5th year and then calculate the increase for the next three years.

Initially, Sylvie's salary is $600. 

After 5 years, her salary is increased by 10% of $600 for each year. 
Year 1: $600 * 0.10 = $60, $600 + $60 = $660
Year 2: $660 * 0.10 = $66, $660 + $66 = $726
Year 3: $726 * 0.10 = $72.60, $726 + $72.60 = $798.60
Year 4: $798.60 * 0.10 = $79.86, $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46
Year 5: $878.46 * 0.10 = $87.85, $878.46 + $87.85 = $966.31

Now, for the next three years, her salary will continue to increase by 10% of the current salary.

Year 6: $966.31 * 0.10 = $96.63, $966.31 + $96.63 = $1062.94
Year 7: $1062.94 * 0.10 = $106.29, $1062.94 + $106.29 = $1169.23
Year 8: $1169.23 * 0.10 = $116.92, $1169.23 + $116.92 = $1286.15

Her annual salary after three more years of service is $1286.15."
"To find out how many copies Harald sold, we need to first determine the number of copies Marilyn sold. Since Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, let's represent the number of copies Harald sold as 'x'. 

Marilyn's copies = 10x

The total number of copies sold is 88,000, which is the sum of Marilyn's and Harald's copies. So, we can write the equation as:

x + 10x = 88,000

Combine like terms:
11x = 88,000

Now, divide both sides by 11 to solve for x:
x = 88,000 / 11
x = 8,000

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

The final answer is: 8000"
"To find out how many gift bags Christina needs, we first need to calculate the number of guests she expects to attend. Since 1/4 of the invited guests don't show up, we can find the number of expected attendees by subtracting 1/4 from the total number of invited guests.

Number of invited guests = 16
Number of guests not showing up = 1/4 * 16 = 4
Number of expected attendees = 16 - 4 = 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we multiply the number of expected attendees by 0.75 to find the total number of gift bags needed.

Number of gift bags needed = 12 * 0.75 = 9

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of gift bags needed by the cost per gift bag.

Cost per gift bag = $2
Total cost = 9 * $2 = $18

The final answer is: $18"
"To find the total amount of potato salad needed, we need to calculate the amount eaten by adults and children separately and then add them together.

Adults will eat 20 * 10 lbs = 200 lbs of potato salad.

Children will eat half as much as adults, so each child will eat 10 / 2 = 5 lbs of potato salad. Since there are 5 children, they will eat 5 * 5 lbs = 25 lbs of potato salad.

The total amount of potato salad needed is 200 lbs (for adults) + 25 lbs (for children) = 225 lbs.

The final answer is: 225"
"To find the total number of pets, we need to determine the number of pets each person has. 

Since Cindy has 4 pets, Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy. So, Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.

Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia. Since Marcia has 6 pets, Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets.

Now, we add up the number of pets each person has: 4 (Cindy) + 6 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan) = 28.

"To find Jackson's age, we need to determine Corey's age first. Since James is 10 and 1 year younger than Corey, Corey must be 10 + 1 = 11 years old.

We know Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy's age is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

Since Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, Jackson's age is 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find Gerald's new time, we first need to find his original time. Since Lee runs 2 seconds faster than Gerald, we can set up an equation: Lee's time = Gerald's time + 2. We know Lee's time is 38 seconds, so we can substitute that in: 38 = Gerald's time + 2.

To find Gerald's original time, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: Gerald's time = 38 - 2 = 36 seconds.

Gerald's speed improved by 10%, so we need to find 10% of his original time and add it to his original time. 10% of 36 is 0.1 * 36 = 3.6 seconds.

Gerald's new time is his original time plus the improvement: 36 + 3.6 = 39.6 seconds.

The final answer is: 39.6"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of cats, then the number of rabbits, and finally add them up with the number of dogs to get the total number of pets.

Given that there are two cats for every dog, and the number of dogs is 60, we can find the number of cats by multiplying the number of dogs by 2.

Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
= 2 * 60
= 120

Now, we know that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. We can find the combined number of dogs and cats by adding the number of dogs and cats.

Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
= 60 + 120
= 180

Now, we can find the number of rabbits by subtracting 12 from the combined number of dogs and cats.

Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
= 180 - 12
= 168

Finally, we can find the total number of pets in the neighborhood by adding the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits.

Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
= 60 + 120 + 168
= 348

"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we first need to determine the total volume of the tomatoes before they were cooked. Since the sauce made 32 ounces and it's half the volume of the tomatoes, the total volume of the tomatoes must be 32 * 2 = 64 ounces.

Since each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces, we can divide the total volume of the tomatoes by the volume of each can to find out how many cans were used: 64 / 16 = 4 cans.

Each can contains 3 tomatoes, so we multiply the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can: 4 * 3 = 12 tomatoes.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we need to first determine the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam. 

We know that 20 cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. 

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as x. 

Since 5 cars took an exit, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the original number of cars minus the cars that took an exit: 30 - 5 = 25.

We also know that the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the sum of the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes: x + 20 = 25.

Now, we can solve for x: x = 25 - 20
x = 5

"To find out how many potted plants Mary will have left, we need to first determine how many potted plants she has initially and then subtract the number of plants she gives away.

Initially, Mary has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, so she has 2 * 40 = 80 potted plants.

She also received 18 new potted plants from the nursery, so now she has 80 + 18 = 98 potted plants.

Tomorrow, she will give away 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges, so she will give away 40 potted plants.

To find out how many potted plants Mary will have left, we subtract the number of plants she gives away from the total number of plants she has: 98 - 40 = 58.

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to find the inner volume of one box and then multiply it by 3.

The dimensions of the box are given as 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches, but the walls are 1 inch thick. This means that the inner dimensions of the box will be (5-2) inches by (6-2) inches by (4-2) inches, since 1 inch is subtracted from each side for the wall thickness.

So, the inner dimensions of the box are 3 inches by 4 inches by 2 inches.

The formula to find the volume of a rectangular box is length x width x height. 

Inner volume of one box = 3 x 4 x 2 = 24 cubic inches.

Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes = 24 x 3 = 72 cubic inches.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 2 episodes of a 1-hour show, which is a total of 2 * 1 = 2 hours.

On Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. Let's call the number of episodes x. Since each episode is 30 minutes, the total time he watched on Wednesday is 30x minutes.

On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, which is a total of 1.5 hours.

On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, which is a total of 2 hours.

The total time Frankie watched TV is 7 hours. We can set up an equation to represent this:

2 (Monday and Tuesday) + 30x (Wednesday) + 1.5 (Thursday) + 2 (Friday) = 7

Combine like terms:

2 + 30x + 1.5 + 2 = 7

Combine the constants:

5.5 + 30x = 7

Subtract 5.5 from both sides:

30x = 1.5

Divide both sides by 30:

x = 0.05

Since x represents the number of episodes, and each episode is 30 minutes, we can multiply x by 30 to find the total time Frankie watched on Wednesday in minutes, but we want the number of episodes, so we just need to round down to the nearest whole number because you can't watch a fraction of an episode. However, in this case, we can see that 0.05 is less than 1, so we can safely say that Frankie watched 0 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as 'x'. Since Henry wants to make twice as many cookies this year, he plans to bake 2x cookies.

However, he actually baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the total number of cookies he baked is 2x + 15.

After dropping 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies left. This can be represented as:

2x + 15 - 5 = 110

Combine like terms:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2x = 100

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 50

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To find the total cost of gas after the cashback rewards, we need to first calculate the total cost of gas without the rewards, and then subtract the cashback amount.

The cost of gas per gallon is $3.00, and the person is buying 10 gallons. 

Total cost of gas = cost per gallon * number of gallons
Total cost of gas = $3.00 * 10
Total cost of gas = $30.00

The cashback reward is $0.20 per gallon, and the person is buying 10 gallons.

Total cashback = cashback per gallon * number of gallons
Total cashback = $0.20 * 10
Total cashback = $2.00

Now, we subtract the total cashback from the total cost of gas to find the final cost.

Final cost = Total cost of gas - Total cashback
Final cost = $30.00 - $2.00
Final cost = $28.00

"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to calculate the rate at which the boat is taking on water and then multiply it by the total time it took to reach the shore.

First, let's find the rate at which the boat is taking on water. It takes 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. Since it took 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can find the rate per second as follows:

Rate per 10 feet = 2 liters
Rate per 20 feet = 4 liters (since it's double the distance)
Time taken to row 20 feet = 16 seconds
Rate per second = 4 liters / 16 seconds = 0.25 liters/second

Now, we know the boat takes on 0.25 liters of water per second. The total time it took to reach the shore is 64 seconds. 

Total water taken on = Rate per second * Total time
Total water taken on = 0.25 liters/second * 64 seconds

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold as B, and the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as D.

We know that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, so we can write an equation:

1800 = 6B

To find the value of B, we can divide both sides of the equation by 6:

B = 1800 / 6
B = 300

Now, we know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph. We can write another equation:

300 = 50D

To find the value of D, we can divide both sides of the equation by 50:

D = 300 / 50
D = 6

Therefore, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.

"To find the total cost of the lumber, we need to calculate the cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards and the 4 x 4 x 10 boards separately.

The cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $10 per board = $100.

The cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $16 per board = $80.

The total cost of the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since prices have gone up by 50%, the new price of the lumber is 1.5 times the original price. 

The new price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 per board.
The new price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 per board.

The total revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $15 per board = $150.
The total revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $24 per board = $120.

The total revenue is $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

"To find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, we need to determine the total parts in the ratio and then find the fraction of the total that represents the sugar.

The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, so the total parts in the ratio is 7 + 13 = 20.

Since Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and water, we can set up the equation:

(7/20) * Total = 120

To find the total number of teaspoons of sugar, we can multiply 7/20 by 120:

First, we find the cost of shoes for one child: 2 pairs * $60 per pair = $120.

Then, we multiply this by the number of children: $120 * 3 = $360.

So, John paid $360 in total.

The final answer is: $360"
"To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we first need to find the total number of vehicles that were already at the port. We know that there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles initially is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of vehicles at the port after the second day is 30. To find the number of vehicles brought in on the second day, we subtract the initial number of vehicles from the total number of vehicles: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can find the number of containers brought in on the second day by dividing the number of vehicles brought in by the number of vehicles per container: 20 / 5 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. If we let Lylah's salary be x, then Adrien's salary is 1.3x (since 100% + 30% = 130%, or 1.3 times).

We are also given that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. Since Adrien's salary four years ago was 1.3x, we can set up the equation:

1.3x = 40,000

To find x, we can divide both sides by 1.3:

x = 40,000 / 1.3
x = 30,769.23

So Lylah's salary four years ago was $30,769.23.

Now, we know that Adrien's salary increased by 40% four years later. This means his new salary is 140% of his old salary (100% + 40% = 140%, or 1.4 times). We can calculate his new salary as follows:

New Adrien's salary = 1.4 * 40,000
New Adrien's salary = 56,000

Similarly, Lylah's salary also increased by 40% four years later. We can calculate her new salary as follows:

New Lylah's salary = 1.4 * 30,769.23
New Lylah's salary = 43,079.22

The total salary the two were receiving four years later is the sum of their new salaries:

Total salary = New Adrien's salary + New Lylah's salary
Total salary = 56,000 + 43,079.22
Total salary = 99,079.22

The final answer is: $99079.22"
"To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we need to first calculate how many sheets he uses in a week and then multiply that by the number of weeks in a month.

Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad has 30 sheets. So, the total number of sheets he uses in a week is:
2 pads/week * 30 sheets/pad = 60 sheets/week

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we can multiply the number of sheets used in a week by 4 to get the total number of sheets used in a month:
60 sheets/week * 4 weeks/month = 240 sheets/month

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the total number of fruits, we need to calculate the number of fruits each person brought and then add them together.

Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges. 

Kael brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette, so Kael brought 2 * 5 = 10 apples. 
Kael brought half the number of oranges as Morisette, so Kael brought 8 / 2 = 4 oranges.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits each person brought:
Morisette: 5 apples + 8 oranges = 13 fruits
Kael: 10 apples + 4 oranges = 14 fruits

The total number of fruits they have is 13 + 14 = 27. 

The final answer is: 27"
"To find the total hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we need to calculate the hours she slept on each day and add them up.

On Monday, Sadie slept 8 hours.

For the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday), she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours each day.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Sunday), she slept 1 hour more than the previous two days, so she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours each day.

Now, let's calculate the total hours for each part of the week:
- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday and Wednesday: 2 days * 6 hours = 12 hours
- Thursday to Sunday: 5 days * 7 hours = 35 hours

Now, let's add up the total hours:
8 + 12 + 35 = 55

"To find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to calculate the distance she covers in the first 3 hours and the remaining 4 hours separately.

In the first 3 hours, Rosie runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour. So, the distance covered in 3 hours is:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour x 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

In the remaining 4 hours, Rosie runs at a speed of 5 miles per hour. So, the distance covered in 4 hours is:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour x 4 hours
Distance = 20 miles

Now, we add the distances covered in both periods to find the total distance:
Total Distance = 30 miles + 20 miles
Total Distance = 50 miles

Therefore, Rosie can run a total of 50 miles in 7 hours.

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the number of letters already in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began is x.

Since Jennie puts stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, she stamps 60 / 3 = 20 letters.

The total number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters now is the sum of the letters already there and the letters Jennie stamped, which is x + 20.

We are given that there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters, so we can set up the equation:

x + 20 = 30

To solve for x, we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

x = 30 - 20
x = 10

So, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Julia initially had 0 spoons (since she was out of them).
2. She bought a package of spoons, but we don't know the quantity yet. Let's call this quantity 'x'.
3. Her husband bought 5 new spoons and gave them to her, so now she has x + 5 spoons.
4. Julia used 3 spoons while making the stew, so she has (x + 5) - 3 spoons left.
5. When she set the table, she had a total of 12 spoons. This means that (x + 5) - 3 = 12.
6. To find the value of x, we need to solve the equation (x + 5) - 3 = 12.
7. Simplifying the equation, we get x + 2 = 12.
8. Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get x = 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we need to add the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages. 

First, let's find the number of fish sausages. Since Dylan bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, we add 6 to the number of chicken sausages: 
38 (chicken sausages) + 6 = 44 (fish sausages)

Now, we add the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages to find the total number of sausages:
38 (chicken sausages) + 44 (fish sausages) = 82

The final answer is: 82"
"To find the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together, we first need to determine the number of friends Amy has. Since Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, and Lily has 50 friends, we can calculate Amy's friends by adding 20 to Lily's friends.

Amy's friends = Lily's friends + 20
Amy's friends = 50 + 20
Amy's friends = 70

Now, to find the total number of friends they have together, we add the number of friends Lily and Amy have.

Total friends = Lily's friends + Amy's friends
Total friends = 50 + 70
Total friends = 120

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to determine the cost of each item and then multiply it by the quantity.

First, let's find the cost of a watermelon. Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, and each pepper costs $15, the cost of a watermelon is 3 * $15 = $45.

Next, we find the cost of an orange. An orange costs 5 dollars less than a watermelon, so the cost of an orange is $45 - $5 = $40.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of each item:

- 4 watermelons: 4 * $45 = $180
- 20 peppers: 20 * $15 = $300
- 10 oranges: 10 * $40 = $400

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is the sum of the costs of all items: $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

The final answer is: $880"
"To calculate the profit, we need to first find the total time spent by doctors and the total amount charged to patients.

The hospital sees 500 people a day, and each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes. 

First, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. 
24 minutes = 24/60 = 0.4 hours

The total time spent by doctors is the number of patients multiplied by the time per patient.
Total time spent by doctors = 500 * 0.4 = 200 hours

The hospital charges $150 an hour to the doctors, so the total cost to the hospital is:
Total cost to the hospital = 200 * $150 = $30,000

The hospital charges $200 an hour to the patients, and the total time spent by patients is the same as the time spent by doctors (since the hospital charges patients for the time spent by doctors). 
Total amount charged to patients = 200 * $200 = $40,000

The profit made by the hospital is the total amount charged to patients minus the total cost to the hospital.
Profit = $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000

The hospital makes a profit of $10,000 from these visits.

"To find the number of elves left, we first need to calculate the number of elves who quit after the children vomit on them. A third of the 60 elves quit, so we calculate this as 60 / 3 = 20 elves.

Now, we subtract the 20 elves who quit from the original 60 to find the remaining number of elves: 60 - 20 = 40 elves.

Then, 10 more elves quit after kids kick their shins, so we subtract 10 from the remaining 40 elves: 40 - 10 = 30 elves.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total expenditure for the two months, we need to add the expenditure in May and June. 

The expenditure in May was $500. 
The expenditure in June was $60 less than May, so it is $500 - $60 = $440.

"To find the total number of tickets used, we need to calculate the total number of rides taken by Pam and Fred and then multiply it by the cost of each ride.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, so she took a total of 2 + 2 = 4 rides.
Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, so he took a total of 4 + 2 = 6 rides.

The total number of rides taken by both Pam and Fred is 4 + 6 = 10 rides.

Since each ride costs 6 tickets, the total number of tickets used is 10 * 6 = 60.

"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we need to first determine how many miles he walked on Tuesday. 

On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. 
On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, which is 4 * 6 = 24 miles.

Now, we know that his total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. We already know that he walked 4 miles on Monday and 24 miles on Tuesday. 

So, the total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday is 4 + 24 = 28 miles. 

To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we subtract the total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage for the three days: 41 - 28 = 13 miles.

Brian initially had 20 video games but lost 5, so he has 20 - 5 = 15 video games.

Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian. To find out how many video games Bobby has, we multiply the number of video games Brian has by 3 and then subtract 5.

3 times the number of video games Brian has is 3 * 15 = 45.

5 fewer than 45 is 45 - 5 = 40.

Bobby has 40 video games.

- 2 bags of chips for $1.50 each: 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
- 2 cookies for $1.00 each: 2 x $1.00 = $2.00
Total cost of items: $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

Next, let's calculate the delivery fee: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 x $20.00 = $4.00

Now, let's add the delivery fee to the total cost of items: $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

For the first test, Mark had 8 hours to complete 75 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour. 

First, let's find out how many questions Mark completed in 8 hours: 
8 hours * 5 questions/hour = 40 questions

Since Mark completed 40 questions in 8 hours, he left 75 - 40 = 35 questions incomplete in the first test.

For the second test, Mark had 6 hours to complete 100 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour.

Now, let's find out how many questions Mark completed in 6 hours: 
6 hours * 5 questions/hour = 30 questions

Since Mark completed 30 questions in 6 hours, he left 100 - 30 = 70 questions incomplete in the second test.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W.

We are given that there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so B = 2Q.

We are also given that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so W = 2B.

We know that the total number of bees in the hive is 700, so Q + B + W = 700.

Substituting B = 2Q and W = 2B into the equation, we get Q + 2Q + 2(2Q) = 700.

Simplifying the equation, we get Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700, which is 7Q = 700.

Dividing both sides by 7, we get Q = 100.

Now that we know Q = 100, we can find B by substituting Q into the equation B = 2Q, so B = 2(100) = 200.

Finally, we can find W by substituting B into the equation W = 2B, so W = 2(200) = 400.

Non-food items: 
- Light bulbs: 3 dollars
- Cups: 3 dollars
- Roach traps: 4 dollars
Since there is a 10% tax on non-food items, we need to calculate the tax first.
Tax on non-food items: 10% of (3 + 3 + 4) = 10% of 10 = 0.1 * 10 = 1 dollar
Total cost of non-food items: 3 + 3 + 4 + 1 = 11 dollars

"To calculate the total income, we need to consider all 8 clients (3 current and 5 potential). 

Each client will need 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. So, the total number of bottles of bleach needed is 8 * 2 = 16, and the total number of packs of cloths needed is 8 * 1 = 8.

The cost of bleach is $2 per bottle, so the total cost of bleach is 16 * $2 = $32. The cost of cloths is $5 per pack, so the total cost of cloths is 8 * $5 = $40.

The total expenses are the sum of the cost of bleach and the cost of cloths, which is $32 + $40 = $72.

Since the total income is $92, the profit is the difference between the total income and the total expenses, which is $92 - $72 = $20.

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of the bees that left in the first 6 hours return. So, 1/2 * 30 = 15 bees return.
3. The number of bees that have left but not returned is 30 - 15 = 15 bees.
4. In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees as the ones that left in the first 6 hours fly from the hive and leave. So, 2 * 30 = 60 bees leave.
5. However, we are interested in the bees that return in the last 6 hours. We know that every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive in the last 6 hours. This means all the bees that left in the first 6 hours and not returned in the next 6 hours will return in the last 6 hours. That is 15 bees.

Therefore, the number of bees Debra sees return to the hive in the last 6 hours is 15."

"To find out who will win the race, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school.

First, let's convert the distance from miles to feet for both Steve and Tim. Since 1 mile is equal to 5280 feet, we can convert their distances as follows:

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15,840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10,560 feet

Now, let's calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school:

Steve's time: distance / speed = 15,840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: distance / speed = 10,560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 36 minutes to get home and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve will win the race. To find out how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to subtract the winner's time from the loser's time:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Dave ate 14 french fries initially.
2. The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 french fries.
   Now, the total amount eaten by Dave and the seagull is 14 + 7 = 21 french fries.
3. Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate a total of 3 * 3 = 9 french fries.
   Now, the total amount eaten is 21 + 9 = 30 french fries.
4. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries. Let's denote the initial amount of fries as x. 
   After the seagull and pigeons ate, (x - 30) fries were left. The raccoon stole 2/3 of (x - 30), which is (2/3)(x - 30).
   The remaining amount after the raccoon ate is (x - 30) - (2/3)(x - 30).
   Simplifying this, we get (1/3)(x - 30).
5. After the raccoon ate, ants carried off 1 french fry, leaving 5 behind. 
   So, (1/3)(x - 30) - 1 = 5.
   Solving for x, we get (1/3)(x - 30) = 6.
   Multiplying both sides by 3, we get x - 30 = 18.
   Adding 30 to both sides, we get x = 48.

The total hours Kimo spends in a week is the sum of the hours spent on these two sets of days:
9 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours

Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, the total hours Kimo spends attending classes in a semester is:
17 hours/week * 16 weeks = 272 hours

The final answer is: 272"
"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the length of each type of baked good in inches and then convert it to feet. 

First, let's calculate the total length of the rolls: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches.

Next, let's calculate the total length of the croissants: 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches.

Now, let's calculate the total length of the baguettes. Since each baguette is 2 feet long, we need to convert this to inches: 2 feet * 12 inches/foot = 24 inches. Then, we multiply this by the number of baguettes: 60 baguettes * 24 inches/baguette = 1440 inches.

Now, let's add up the total length of all the baked goods: 1200 inches + 720 inches + 1440 inches = 3360 inches.

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12: 3360 inches / 12 = 280 feet.

The final answer is: 280"
"To determine the total number of bananas needed for 2 months, we need to calculate the monthly consumption of all the apes and then multiply it by 2.

The monkeys need 200 bananas per month, the gorillas need 400 bananas per month, and the baboons need 100 bananas per month. 

Total monthly consumption = 200 (monkeys) + 400 (gorillas) + 100 (baboons) = 700 bananas per month.

Since the zookeeper needs to order bananas for 2 months, we multiply the total monthly consumption by 2.

Total bananas needed for 2 months = 700 bananas/month * 2 months = 1400 bananas.

The final answer is: 1400"
"To find out who the winner is, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Since he's running back and forth, the total distance he covers is 2 times the length of the field for each run. So, the total distance Blake ran is 15 * 2 * 100 = 3000 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 2 * 100 = 200 yards. Then, she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 2 * 40 = 80 yards. She does this 34 times, so the total distance she ran is 200 + (80 * 34) = 200 + 2720 = 2920 yards.

Since 3000 is greater than 2920, Blake is the winner.

To find out how much farther the winner ran than the loser, we subtract the loser's distance from the winner's distance: 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the total amount Raphael spent, we need to calculate the cost of the pens, notebooks, and the bond paper separately and then add them together.

The cost of the pens is 4 * $1.5 = $6.

"To find the number of tadpoles Finn can see in the pond now, we need to subtract the number of tadpoles that hid from the number of tadpoles that came out of hiding.

Initially, Finn saw 11 tadpoles. 
6 tadpoles came out of hiding, so now there are 11 + 6 = 17 tadpoles.
Then, 2 tadpoles hid under a rock, so we subtract 2 from 17: 17 - 2 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the depth of the water on Wednesday, we need to first find the depth of the water on Tuesday. 

The depth of the water on Monday is 17 feet. On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water, so the depth of the water on Tuesday is 17 + 7 = 24 feet.

On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. To find two thirds of 24, we multiply 24 by 2/3.

24 * (2/3) = 16

So, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total number of fish caught by Anakin, we need to add the number of starfish, sea horses, and clownfish he caught. 

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. 
Total fish caught by Anakin = 10 + 6 + 3 = 19

Now, let's find the number of fish caught by Locsin. 
Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so he caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.
Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so he caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.
Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so he caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Total fish caught by Locsin = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

Now, let's find the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin.
Total fish caught = Total fish caught by Anakin + Total fish caught by Locsin
Total fish caught = 19 + 13
Total fish caught = 32

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the cost of the bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to calculate the price increase every two months and add it to the original price.

Initial price = $20
Increase rate = 20% of the original price = 0.20 * $20 = $4
New price after 2 months = $20 + $4 = $24
Increase rate for the next 2 months = 20% of $24 = 0.20 * $24 = $4.80
New price after 4 months = $24 + $4.80 = $28.80
Increase rate for the next 2 months = 20% of $28.80 = 0.20 * $28.80 = $5.76
New price after 6 months = $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56
Increase rate for the next 2 months = 20% of $34.56 = 0.20 * $34.56 = $6.912
New price after 8 months = $34.56 + $6.912 = $41.472
Increase rate for the next 2 months = 20% of $41.472 = 0.20 * $41.472 = $8.2944

"To find the total worth of all the toys, we need to calculate the cost of each type of toy and then add them together.

The doll costs as much as 3 action figures. Since an action figure costs $5, the doll costs 3 * $5 = $15.

One red car costs $4. Since there are 5 red cars, the total cost of the red cars is 5 * $4 = $20.

The total cost of the action figures is 3 * $5 = $15.

Now, we add the cost of the doll, the red cars, and the action figures together: $15 (doll) + $20 (red cars) + $15 (action figures) = $50.

The total worth of all the toys is $50.

"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the lost income from doing her taxes herself and compare it to the cost of hiring the accountant.

First, let's calculate the lost income from doing her taxes herself:

Lost income = 3 hours * $35/hour = $105

Now, let's compare this to the cost of hiring the accountant:

Cost of hiring the accountant = $90

Since the lost income is greater than the cost of hiring the accountant, Jackie will have more money if she hires the accountant. To find out how much more, we subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the lost income:

Difference = Lost income - Cost of hiring the accountant
= $105 - $90
= $15

So, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

"Let's denote Brooke's current age as B and Seth's current age as S. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we can write an equation:

S = 2B

In 2 years, their ages will be B + 2 and S + 2. According to the problem, the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28:

(B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28

Substituting S = 2B into the equation:

(B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28

Combine like terms:

3B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3B = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age:

S = 2B
S = 2(8)
S = 16

The final answer is: 16"

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much they made in total from selling lemonade and then subtract the cost of sugar to find the cost of lemons.

Let's start by finding the total revenue from selling lemonade. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. So, the revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10.

Since they made $25 in profit, and we know that profit is revenue minus cost, we can set up an equation to find the total revenue. Let's denote the number of gallons as 'g'. The total revenue is $10g. The cost of lemons and sugar per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5. The total cost is $5g. The profit is $25, so we can set up the equation:

$10g - $5g = $25

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$5g = $25

Dividing both sides by 5, we get:

g = 5

Now that we know they made 5 gallons, we can find the total revenue:

Total revenue = $10g = $10 * 5 = $50

The cost of lemons and sugar per gallon is $5, so the total cost is $5g = $5 * 5 = $25. The cost of sugar is $2 per gallon, so the cost of lemons is $5 - $2 = $3 per gallon.

The total cost of lemons is $3 * 5 = $15.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. According to the problem, Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, so the number of red roses is 4x.

It's also mentioned that Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations. This means the number of white carnations (x) is 200 / 5 = 40.

Now that we know the number of white carnations (x) is 40, we can find the number of red roses, which is 4x = 4 * 40 = 160.

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jean is two years older than Mark.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age.
3. Jan is 30 years old.

From point 3, we know Jan's current age is 30. 

Two years ago, Jan's age would be 30 - 2 = 28.

From point 2, we know that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. Half of Jan's age two years ago is 28 / 2 = 14. 

So, two years ago, Mark's age was 14 + 5 = 19.

Since Mark's age two years ago was 19, his current age is 19 + 2 = 21.

From point 1, we know Jean is two years older than Mark. Therefore, Jean's current age is 21 + 2 = 23.

"To find the total time for each team, we need to calculate the time for each runner and add them up.

The well-rounded team's total time is 4 x 55 seconds = 220 seconds.

The less well-rounded team's first runner runs 60 seconds. The second runner is 3 seconds faster, so they run 60 - 3 = 57 seconds. The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so they run 57 - 3 = 54 seconds. The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so they run 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

The less well-rounded team's total time is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 162 seconds.

The difference in time between the two teams is 220 - 162 = 58 seconds.

The faster team will win by 58 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, and then find the difference between these two probabilities.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die is the number of favorable outcomes (4, 5, 6) divided by the total number of possible outcomes (6). So, the probability is 3/6 = 0.5 or 50%.

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is the product of the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll and the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll. The probability of rolling an even number on a six-sided die is 3/6 = 0.5. So, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (3/6) * (3/6) = 0.25 or 25%.

Now, we need to find the difference between these two probabilities. The difference is 50% - 25% = 25%.

To find the total number of apples they both picked, we need to add the number of apples Jenna picked to the number of apples her mom picked. 10 (Jenna's apples) + 20 (her mom's apples) = 30 apples.

The final answer is: 30"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of small rodents (rats and hamsters) and the total number of straw pieces given to them. 

Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as 'r'. Since there are 3 cages of rats, the total number of rats is 3r. 

The total number of hamsters is 10. 

The total number of straw pieces given to rats is 3r * 6 = 18r. 
The total number of straw pieces given to hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50. 

The total number of straw pieces given to small rodents is 160. So, we can set up the equation: 18r + 50 = 160.

Now, let's solve for 'r'. 
18r = 160 - 50
18r = 110
r = 110 / 18

"To calculate the total amount Mandy should pay, we need to calculate the interest for 3 months and add it to the initial amount.

The monthly interest rate is 2%, which is 0.02 as a decimal. 

The interest for the first month is $100 * 0.02 = $2.
The interest for the second month is $102 * 0.02 = $2.04.
The interest for the third month is $104.04 * 0.02 = $2.0808.

The total interest is $2 + $2.04 + $2.0808 = $6.1208.

The total amount Mandy should pay is the initial amount plus the total interest: $100 + $6.1208 = $106.1208.

Rounding to two decimal places, the total amount Mandy should pay is $106.12.

The final answer is: $106.12"
"To find the number of bags the trader sold, we need to first calculate the total cost and total revenue.

Let's denote the number of bags as 'x'. 

The total cost of buying the bags is $20x (since each bag costs $20).
The total cost of transportation is $2x (since each bag costs $2 to transport).
The total cost is the sum of the cost of buying and transportation: $20x + $2x = $22x.

The total revenue from selling the bags is $30x (since each bag is sold at $30).

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost: $30x - $22x = $8x.

We are given that the profit is $400, so we can set up the equation: $8x = $400.

To find the number of bags, we can divide both sides of the equation by $8: x = $400 / $8.

x = 50

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how much each friend paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets, food, and rides, and then divide it by 3.

First, let's find the cost of the food. They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. Since they spent $20.25 on tickets, the cost of food is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.

The cost of the rides is 2 rides * $33 per ride = $66.

Now, let's add up the total cost: $20.25 (tickets) + $15.75 (food) + $66 (rides) = $102.

Since they split the cost evenly, each friend paid $102 / 3 = $34.

The final answer is: $34"
"To find the total number of peaches John collects, we need to calculate the total minutes he collects peaches and then multiply it by the number of peaches he collects per minute.

John collects peaches for 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 3 hours by 60 minutes:

3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Now, we know John collects 2 peaches per minute. To find the total number of peaches, we multiply the total minutes by the peaches collected per minute:

180 minutes * 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches

The final answer is: 360"
"To find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ducks needs per day, we first need to calculate the total pounds of insects needed per week for the entire flock. 

Since each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week, and there are ten ducks, the total pounds of insects needed per week is 3.5 pounds/duck * 10 ducks = 35 pounds/week.

To find out how many pounds of insects the flock needs per day, we need to divide the total pounds of insects needed per week by 7 (the number of days in a week). 

35 pounds/week / 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day.

"To find the total number of trees Tom has left, we need to calculate the net change in the number of trees over 10 years.

Initially, Tom has 50 trees.

Each year, he plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees, resulting in a net gain of 10 - 2 = 8 trees per year.

Over 10 years, the net gain would be 8 * 10 = 80 trees.

So, the total number of trees after 10 years would be 50 (initial trees) + 80 (net gain) = 130 trees.

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find the number of trees that die, we multiply 130 by 0.3 (which is 30% as a decimal).

Number of trees that die = 130 * 0.3 = 39 trees.

Now, we subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees after 10 years to find the final number of trees Tom has left.

Number of trees left = 130 - 39 = 91 trees.

The final answer is: 91"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos on Sue's front yard.

On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. They painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back out on Sue's front yard. So, now there are 6 white flamingos and 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos.

On Sunday morning, the neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection. Now, there are 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos.

The total number of flamingos on Sue's front yard is 30 pink + 6 white = 36 flamingos.

To find out how many more pink plastic flamingos were out than white plastic flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

Total pounds of carrots used = 40 * 2
Total pounds of carrots used = 80 pounds

Now, we subtract the total pounds of carrots used from the total pounds of carrots available to find out how many pounds will not be used.

Pounds of carrots not used = Total pounds of carrots - Total pounds of carrots used
Pounds of carrots not used = 200 - 80
Pounds of carrots not used = 120

In the first month, she collected three times the number of cards she initially had: 3 * 20 = 60 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month: 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months: (60 + 40) * 2 = 200 cards.

To find the total number of cards Elaine has now, we need to add the cards she had initially to the cards she collected in each month: 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, he edits 1000 / 2 = 500 sentences for each publisher.

Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence, so the total amount Mark earns from Publisher A is 500 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents.

Since Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, Publisher B pays 2 * 5 cents/sentence = 10 cents per sentence. The total amount Mark earns from Publisher B is 500 sentences * 10 cents/sentence = 5000 cents.

To find the total amount Mark makes in a week, we add the amounts from both publishers: 2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents.

"To calculate John's total earnings for the year, we need to consider both the one-time monetary reward and the 5% raise in salary.

First, let's calculate the total amount John would earn in a year without the raise. Since he makes $2000 per week, and there are 52 weeks in a year, his total earnings would be:

2000 * 52 = 104,000

Now, let's calculate the 5% raise in salary. A 5% raise means his new salary will be 105% of his original salary. To find the new salary, we multiply his original salary by 1.05:

2000 * 1.05 = 2100

Since the raise is effective from the first day of the year, we need to calculate his total earnings for the year with the new salary:

2100 * 52 = 109,200

Now, let's add the one-time monetary reward of $5000 to his total earnings:

109,200 + 5000 = 114,200

However, we also need to consider the one-time reward as a separate payment, so we should add it to his total earnings for the year. Since it's a one-time payment, it's not included in the weekly earnings, but it's a separate payment. Therefore, his total earnings for the year would be:

114,200 + 5000 = 119,200

"To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the slices used for the sandwiches, omelets, and the macaroni and cheese dish separately and then add them together.

For the sandwiches, Carl ate 7 days' worth of sandwiches (since he ate one every day) and used 2 slices per sandwich. So, the total slices used for sandwiches = 7 days * 2 slices/day = 14 slices.

For the omelets, Carl ate 3 days' worth of omelets and used one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 3 slices per omelet. So, the total slices used for omelets = 3 days * 3 slices/day = 9 slices.

For the macaroni and cheese dish, Carl used 8 slices.

Now, let's add the slices used for sandwiches, omelets, and the macaroni and cheese dish together: 14 slices (sandwiches) + 9 slices (omelets) + 8 slices (macaroni and cheese) = 31 slices.

The final answer is: 31"
"To find the total number of pens Janet has now, we need to calculate the number of blue and red pens she bought and add them to the initial number of pens she had.

Janet initially had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, so she had a total of 22 + 10 = 32 pens.

She bought 6 bags of blue pens, with 9 pens in each bag, so she bought 6 x 9 = 54 blue pens.

She bought 2 bags of red pens, with 6 pens in each bag, so she bought 2 x 6 = 12 red pens.

Now, let's add the number of blue and red pens she bought to the initial number of pens she had: 54 (blue) + 12 (red) = 66.

Adding the blue and red pens to the initial number of pens, we get: 32 (initial pens) + 66 (new pens) = 98.

So, Janet now has 98 pens.

The final answer is: 98"
"To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we first need to find the total score she needs for the semester. Since Mr. Bert allows the students to remove the lowest score, we will first arrange the scores in ascending order: 71, 86, 89, 92, 100. 

The lowest score is 71, so we will remove it from the total. The remaining scores are 86, 89, 92, 100. 

Now, we will add these scores: 86 + 89 + 92 + 100 = 267.

Since there are 4 remaining scores, we will divide the total by 4 to get the average: 267 / 4 = 66.75.

Since Brinley wants an average of 93, we will multiply 93 by 6 (the total number of tests) to get the total score she needs: 93 * 6 = 558.

Now, we will subtract the total score she has so far (267) from the total score she needs (558): 558 - 267 = 291.

This is the total score she needs for the remaining 4 tests. Since we know the lowest score is 71, we will subtract 71 from the total to find the minimum score she needs on the sixth test: 291 - 71 = 220.

The final answer is: 220"
"To find the total number of kilometers Michael rode his bike, we need to calculate the distance he covered in the two different periods.

First, let's calculate the distance he covered in the first four weeks when he rode 25 kilometers each time, 5 times a week.

Distance in the first four weeks = 25 km * 5 times/week * 4 weeks = 25 * 5 * 4 = 500 km

Next, let's calculate the distance he covered in the next three weeks when he rode 60 kilometers each time, 2 times a week.

Distance in the next three weeks = 60 km * 2 times/week * 3 weeks = 60 * 2 * 3 = 360 km

Now, let's add the distances covered in both periods to find the total distance.

Total distance = Distance in the first four weeks + Distance in the next three weeks
Total distance = 500 km + 360 km
Total distance = 860 km

The final answer is: 860"
"To find the total weight of the bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the weight of the chocolate bars. Since there are 25 chocolate bars and each weighs 40g, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
25 * 40g = 1000g

Next, let's find the weight of the candied apples. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, the weight of each candied apple is:
40g / 2 = 20g

Now, let's find the total weight of the candied apples:
80 * 20g = 1600g

Finally, let's add the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag of candy:
1000g + 1600g = 2600g

The final answer is: 2600"
"To find the total number of cakes Rose bought, we need to calculate the number of cakes she bought each day and add them together.

On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.

On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 cakes.

On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is 5 * 12 = 60 cakes.

Now, let's add the number of cakes she bought each day: 4 + 12 + 60 = 76.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total cost of half a dozen plates. 

Half a dozen plates cost 6 * $6000 = $36,000.

Now, we know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, the total cost of twenty dozen cups is $36,000 - $1200 = $34,800.

Since twenty dozen cups is equal to 20 * 12 = 240 cups, we can find the cost of each cup by dividing the total cost by the number of cups.

Cost of each cup = $34,800 / 240 cups = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy and the total amount of money she has earned so far. 

The total cost of the items is the cost of the jacket plus the cost of 2 pairs of shoes: 
$30 (jacket) + 2 * $20 (shoes) = $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved before she started babysitting. She earns $5 each time she babysits the kids, so the total amount she has earned from babysitting is:
$5 * 4 (number of times she babysits) = $20.

The total amount of money Sara has is the sum of the money she already had and the money she earned from babysitting:
$10 (initial savings) + $20 (babysitting earnings) = $30.

To find out how much more money Sara needs, we subtract the total amount she has from the total cost of the items:
$70 (total cost) - $30 (total amount she has) = $40.

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn the remaining amount, we divide the remaining amount by the amount she earns per lawn mowing:
$40 (remaining amount) / $4 (lawn mowing earnings) = 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's denote the number of red chickens as R and the number of white chickens as W. We know that W = R + 2.

We also know that the total number of eggs collected is 42. Since each red chicken produces 3 eggs and each white chicken produces 5 eggs, we can set up the following equation:

3R + 5W = 42

Substituting W = R + 2 into the equation, we get:

3R + 5(R + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3R + 5R + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8R + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8R = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

R = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total distance Gary walks, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the dimensions of the park, the length (l) is 6 miles and the width (w) is 1.5 miles. 

Perimeter = 2(l + w)
Perimeter = 2(6 + 1.5)
Perimeter = 2(7.5)
Perimeter = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles/hour, we can find the time he spends walking by dividing the total distance by his speed.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. On the first day, Sloane counts 100 customers.
2. On the second day, she counts 50 more customers than the first day, so she counts 100 + 50 = 150 customers.
3. The total number of customers by the third day is 500.
4. To find the number of customers on the third day, we need to subtract the total number of customers on the first two days from the total number of customers by the third day. 
   Total customers by the third day = Customers on the first day + Customers on the second day + Customers on the third day
   500 = 100 + 150 + Customers on the third day
   Customers on the third day = 500 - 250
   Customers on the third day = 250

The final answer is: 250"
"Let's denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as 'x' gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the initial amount of water in the big pool is 2x gallons.

Since both pools leak at 4 gallons/minute, the rate of water loss for both pools is 8 gallons/minute (4 gallons/minute each).

In 4 minutes, the total amount of water lost from both pools is 8 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 32 gallons.

The initial total amount of water in both pools is x + 2x = 3x gallons.

Since the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool, we can set up the equation: 2x - 32 = 4(x - 32).

Simplifying the equation: 
2x - 32 = 4x - 128
32 + 128 = 4x - 2x
160 = 2x
x = 80

The initial amount of water in the small pool is 80 gallons. Since 32 gallons were lost in 4 minutes, the amount of water in the small pool now is 80 - 8 = 72 gallons.

The final answer is: 72"
"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy and then divide that by her hourly wage.

Total cost of items = Cost of shoes + Cost of belt
Total cost of items = $320.00 + $32.00
Total cost of items = $352.00

Now, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage to find out how many hours she needs to work:
Hours to work = Total cost of items / Hourly wage
Hours to work = $352.00 / $8.00
Hours to work = 44 hours

The final answer is: 44"
"To find the remaining balance, we first need to calculate the total amount Janeth will pay in 12 months. 

Janeth pays $165 per month for 12 months, so the total amount she pays is:
$165 * 12 = $1980

Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. The additional amount is 10% of $2000, which is:
$2000 * 0.10 = $200

So, the total amount Janeth needs to pay is $2000 (initial amount) + $200 (additional amount) = $2200

Now, let's subtract the total amount she pays ($1980) from the total amount she needs to pay ($2200):
$2200 - $1980 = $220

Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months will be $220."
"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to determine the number of dahlias and add it to the number of roses. 

First, we know there are 4 roses. Then, we are told there are 7 more dahlias than roses. So, the number of dahlias is 4 (number of roses) + 7 (additional dahlias) = 11 dahlias.

Now, we add the number of roses and dahlias to find the total number of flowers: 4 (roses) + 11 (dahlias) = 15.

"To find the average age of the three in three years, we first need to find their current ages and then add 3 to each age. 

Given that Harriet is 21 years old, and she is half the age of Zack, Zack's age is 2 * 21 = 42 years.

Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, so Adrian's age is 3 * 21 = 63 years.

Now, we have the current ages of the three: Harriet (21), Zack (42), and Adrian (63). 

In three years, their ages will be: Harriet (21 + 3 = 24), Zack (42 + 3 = 45), and Adrian (63 + 3 = 66).

To find the average age, we add their ages and divide by 3: (24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45.

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Yuri and Brianna. 

Naomi scored 68 points. 
Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. 10 more than that is 34 + 10 = 44. 
Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

The total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna is 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points. 
Since the total points scored by all four students is 251, Jojo scored 251 - 197 = 54 points.

"To find the amount of water left in the tank after Celine used 90 liters, we subtract 90 from the initial 120 liters. 

120 - 90 = 30 liters

Since Celine collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left, we multiply the remaining 30 liters by 2.

30 * 2 = 60 liters

The amount of rainwater collected is 60 liters. To find the total amount of water in the tank now, we add the remaining 30 liters to the collected 60 liters.

30 + 60 = 90 liters

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the total number of flowers Andy plants, we need to calculate the number of petunias first. Since he plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, we subtract 40 from the number of geraniums.

Number of geraniums: 90
Number of petunias = Number of geraniums - 40
Number of petunias = 90 - 40
Number of petunias = 50

Now, we add the number of geraniums and petunias to find the total number of flowers.

Total flowers = Number of geraniums + Number of petunias
Total flowers = 90 + 50
Total flowers = 140

"To find out how many vines Steve needs, we first need to determine how many tomatoes he eats per week. Since Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, we multiply this by 7 to get the total number of tomatoes he eats per week.

6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, we can assume his girlfriend eats half the amount he does. So, his girlfriend eats 6 / 2 = 3 tomatoes per day. 

3 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 21 tomatoes/week

The total number of tomatoes they both eat per week is 42 (Steve) + 21 (girlfriend) = 63 tomatoes/week.

Each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week. To find out how many vines they need, we divide the total number of tomatoes they eat per week by the number of tomatoes each vine produces per week.

"To find the sum of the ages of the three girls, we need to determine the ages of Mary and Joan first.

Since Jessa is 20 years old, and Joan is five years older than Jessa, we can calculate Joan's age by adding 5 to Jessa's age:
Joan's age = Jessa's age + 5
Joan's age = 20 + 5
Joan's age = 25

Now, we know that Mary is two years younger than Joan, so we can calculate Mary's age by subtracting 2 from Joan's age:
Mary's age = Joan's age - 2
Mary's age = 25 - 2
Mary's age = 23

Now that we have the ages of all three girls, we can find the sum of their ages:
Sum of ages = Jessa's age + Joan's age + Mary's age
Sum of ages = 20 + 25 + 23
Sum of ages = 68

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many candies Robert has, and then compare the number of candies John and James have.

Since John has twice as many candies as Robert, and John has 54 candies, we can set up an equation to find out how many candies Robert has:

Let R be the number of candies Robert has.
John has 2R candies, which is equal to 54.
2R = 54
R = 54 / 2
R = 27

So, Robert has 27 candies.

Since James has 6 more candies than Robert, we can find out how many candies James has:
James has R + 6 candies, which is equal to 27 + 6.
James has 33 candies.

Now, we can compare the number of candies John and James have:
John has 54 candies, and James has 33 candies.
The difference is 54 - 33 = 21.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Dolly has 2 books and Pandora has 1 book. 

Dolly will read her own 2 books and Pandora's 1 book, so Dolly will read a total of 3 books.

Pandora will read her own 1 book and Dolly's 2 books, so Pandora will read a total of 3 books.

In total, they will read 3 (Dolly's total) + 3 (Pandora's total) = 6 books.

However, we need to consider that they also read each other's books. So, Dolly will read Pandora's book and Pandora will read Dolly's book. This means they will read 2 more books.

Therefore, the total number of books they will read is 6 (initial books) + 2 (each other's books) = 8 books.

First, let's find out how many letters Mike writes in a week. He has 3 pen pals left, and each of them sends 2 letters a week. So, the total number of letters he receives is 3 * 2 = 6 letters.

Since he responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters a week.

Each letter is 5 pages long, so the total number of pages he writes in a week is 6 (letters he sends) * 5 (pages per letter) = 30 pages.

Since he can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time he spends writing a week is 30 pages * 6 minutes/page = 180 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). So, 180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours.

Therefore, Mike spends 3 hours writing a week. 

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many minutes Jason has left, we need to calculate the total minutes used for the calls with his boss and the extra minutes.

The number of minutes used for calls with his boss is 15 minutes per day for 30 days, which is 15 * 30 = 450 minutes.

The total minutes used for calls with his boss and extra minutes is 450 + 300 = 750 minutes.

Since Jason's phone plan is 1000 minutes per month, we subtract the total minutes used from the total minutes available: 1000 - 750 = 250 minutes.

The final answer is: 250"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Griffin had 24 fries.

Kyle took 5 fries from Griffin. So, Griffin was left with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.

Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, which means Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Now, Griffin is left with 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

Ginger gave Griffin some fries, and then Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had taken. Since Kyle took 5 fries, Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries.

After Colby took 2 fries, Griffin was left with 9 - 2 = 7 fries. However, we know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. This means that Ginger gave Griffin 27 - 7 = 20 fries.

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as x. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28.

According to the problem, this difference is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums, so we can set up the equation:

28 = 2(2x)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

28 = 4x

Dividing both sides by 4, we get:

x = 7

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the total hours worked. The makeup artist works 6 hours a day, 4 times a week, for 5 weeks. 

Total hours worked per week = 6 hours/day * 4 days/week = 24 hours/week
Total hours worked in 5 weeks = 24 hours/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours

The makeup artist charges $250 per hour. 

Total cost before discount = 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000

After the movie is done, the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount. 

Discount amount = 10% of $30,000 = 0.1 * $30,000 = $3,000

Total amount Jean paid = Total cost before discount - Discount amount
= $30,000 - $3,000
= $27,000

The final answer is: $27,000"
"To find out how much each person paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the party supplies and then divide it by 3.

Total cost = $12 (cake) + $43 (presents) + $15 (decorations) + $4 (invitations) + $22 (goodie bags)
Total cost = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22
Total cost = $96

Since Isabelle and her two parents split the cost evenly, we divide the total cost by 3.
Cost per person = Total cost / 3
Cost per person = $96 / 3
Cost per person = $32

The final answer is: $32"
"To find out how much the chef spent, we need to calculate the total weight of the onions and then multiply it by the cost per pound.

The chef bought 4 bags of onions, and each bag weighs 50 pounds. So, the total weight of the onions is:
4 bags * 50 pounds/bag = 200 pounds

Since a pound of onions costs $1.50, the total cost is:
200 pounds * $1.50/pound = $300

The chef spent $300."
"To find out how many calories Sue consumed, we first need to determine how many cookies she ate. 

On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 5 cookies, so Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday.

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 13 cookies, so Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.

In total, Sue ate 20 + 26 = 46 cookies. 

Her sister ate 5 + 13 = 18 cookies.

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, Sue consumed 46 * 200 = 9200 calories, and her sister consumed 18 * 200 = 3600 calories.

The difference in calories consumed is 9200 - 3600 = 5600.

The final answer is: 5600"
"To find the number of boys in the third class, we first need to determine the total number of girls in the school. 

Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, and there are 3 classes with 20 students each, the total number of students in the school is 3 * 20 = 60.

The total number of girls in the school is 50% of 60, which is 0.5 * 60 = 30.

We already know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27.

The number of girls in the third class can be found by subtracting the total number of girls in the first two classes from the total number of girls in the school: 30 - 27 = 3.

Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, the total number of boys in the school is also 30. 

The number of boys in the first two classes is 60 - 27 = 33. 

The number of boys in the third class can be found by subtracting the number of boys in the first two classes from the total number of boys in the school: 30 - 33 is incorrect, we need to find the number of boys in the third class. 

The total number of students in the third class is 20. The number of girls in the third class is 3. The number of boys in the third class is 20 - 3 = 17.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars. 

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's represent the number of cougars killed today as 'x'. Then, the number of wolves killed today is 3x.

We also know that Rick killed three fewer cougars today than the previous night. So, the number of cougars killed today is 15 - 3 = 12.

Since we know the number of cougars killed today is 12, we can set up the equation 3x = 12 to find the number of wolves killed today. Solving for x, we get x = 4.

Now that we know x, we can find the number of wolves killed today by multiplying 3 and x, which is 3 * 4 = 12.

To find the total number of animals killed, we add the number of animals killed last night and today. The total number of wolves killed is 10 + 12 = 22. The total number of cougars killed is 15 + 12 = 27.

The total number of animals killed is 22 + 27 = 49.

"To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we first need to determine how many times Anne went down the slide. 

Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we need to calculate 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30. 

30% of 30 is 0.3 x 30 = 9. 

So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne, so we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4. 

21 x 4 = 84.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we first need to determine how many cows Mr. Sylas added to each stall. 

Initially, each stall had 20 cows. Mr. Sylas bought 40 cows and divided them equally among the 10 stalls. 

Number of cows added to each stall = Total cows bought / Number of stalls
= 40 / 10
= 4

Now, each stall has 20 (initial cows) + 4 (new cows) = 24 cows.

To find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows in one stall by 8:
Number of cows in 8 stalls = 24 * 8
= 192

"To find the total amount of money in Brady's piggy bank, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and bill, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the value of the pennies:
100 pennies = 100 x $0.01 = $1.00

Next, let's calculate the value of the nickels:
40 nickels = 40 x $0.05 = $2.00

Now, let's calculate the value of the dimes:
20 dimes = 20 x $0.10 = $2.00

"To find the total weight of the redwood tree, we need to calculate the total number of 10-foot sections and then multiply it by the weight of each section. 

The redwood is 200 feet tall, so we divide 200 by 10 to get the total number of sections: 200 / 10 = 20 sections.

Each section weighs 400 pounds, so we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section: 20 * 400 = 8000 pounds.

However, termites ate 30% of the wood, so we need to subtract 30% of 8000 from the total weight. To find 30% of 8000, we multiply 8000 by 0.3: 8000 * 0.3 = 2400.

Now, we subtract 2400 from the total weight: 8000 - 2400 = 5600 pounds.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, and Andrea has 52 apples. 
   So, Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.

2. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, and Jamal has 44 apples. 
   So, Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.

3. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, and Jamal has 48 bananas. 
   So, Andrea has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits:
Total fruits = (Andrea's apples + Jamal's apples + Andrea's bananas + Jamal's bananas)

"To determine the total amount of flour needed, we need to calculate the amount needed for each day and then add them together.

For today, Carla is making 36 cookies. Since 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many cups are needed for 36 cookies. 

First, let's find out how many dozens are in 36 cookies: 36 / 12 = 3. This means Carla needs 3 dozen cookies' worth of flour for today. Since 2 cups are needed for a dozen, Carla will need 3 * 2 = 6 cups of flour for today.

For tomorrow, Carla is making 30 cookies. Again, we need to find out how many dozens are in 30 cookies: 30 / 12 = 2.5. Since 2 cups are needed for a dozen, Carla will need 2.5 * 2 = 5 cups of flour for tomorrow.

"To find the total time, we first need to determine the time it takes to heat the oil to 400 degrees. 

It takes 20 minutes to heat the oil to 300 degrees. Since it takes 40% longer to heat it to 400 degrees, we need to find 40% of 20 minutes and add it to 20 minutes. 

40% of 20 minutes is 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes. 

So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat the oil to 400 degrees.

After warming the oil, it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil. Therefore, the cooking time is 28 - 5 = 23 minutes.

The total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is the sum of the time it takes to warm the oil and the time it takes to cook.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Ruby's current age as R and Sam's current age as S.

From the first statement, we know that Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, so we can write an equation:

R = 6S

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9, and Sam's age will be S + 9. According to the second statement, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can write another equation:

R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Now, let's simplify the second equation:

R + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtract 9 from both sides:

R = 3S + 18

Now we have two equations:

R = 6S
R = 3S + 18

Since both equations are equal to R, we can set them equal to each other:

6S = 3S + 18

Subtract 3S from both sides:

3S = 18

Divide both sides by 3:

S = 6

So, Sam is 6 years old now.

"To find out how many pizzas Maddy needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of people she needs to serve. 

There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, so the total number of team members and coaches is 12 + 3 = 15. 

Each team member brings 2 guests, so the total number of guests is 12 * 2 = 24. 

The total number of people Maddy needs to serve is 15 (team members and coaches) + 24 (guests) = 39.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, the total number of pizzas needed is 39 / 3 = 13.

Each pizza costs $15, so the total amount Maddy will spend is 13 * 15 = $195.

The final answer is: $195"
"To find the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace, we need to calculate the total space occupied by the topaz gemstones and subtract it from the total length of the necklace. 

Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and there are 8 gemstones per necklace. So, the total space occupied by the gemstones is 8 inches. 

The remaining space for the sterling silver beads is 25 inches (total length) - 8 inches (space occupied by gemstones) = 17 inches.

Each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long, so the number of beads that can fit in 17 inches is 17 / 0.25 = 68.

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

The final answer is: 68"
"To find the total number of stories written in the first week, we need to add the number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot.

Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week.
Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week.
Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week.

Total stories in the first week = 20 + 40 + 60 = 120

In the second week, each of them doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week. 

Alani doubled her stories from 20 to 20 * 2 = 40.
Braylen doubled his stories from 40 to 40 * 2 = 80.
Margot doubled her stories from 60 to 60 * 2 = 120.

Total stories in the second week = 40 + 80 + 120 = 240

To find the total number of stories written altogether, we need to add the total number of stories written in the first week and the second week.

Total stories = Total stories in the first week + Total stories in the second week
Total stories = 120 + 240
Total stories = 360

The final answer is: 360"
"To find the current age of Ann's brother, we need to multiply Ann's age by 2. 

Ann's age is 9 years, so her brother's current age is 9 * 2 = 18 years.

The final answer is: 21"
"To find out how many cents Kelly has left, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has and subtract the cost of the can of pop.

Kelly has 5 quarters, which is equivalent to 5 x 25 cents = 125 cents. 
She also has 2 dimes, which is equivalent to 2 x 10 cents = 20 cents.

The total amount of money Kelly has is 125 cents + 20 cents = 145 cents.

The cost of the can of pop is 55 cents. 

To find out how many cents Kelly will have left, we subtract the cost of the can of pop from the total amount of money she has: 145 cents - 55 cents = 90 cents.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the number of rows of 5-star stars, we first need to find the total number of stars and then subtract the number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows.

The total number of stars in the 8-star rows is 3 * 8 = 24.
The total number of stars in the 6-star rows is 2 * 6 = 12.

The total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows is 24 + 12 = 36.

The total number of stars in the flag is 76.

The number of stars in the 5-star rows is 76 - 36 = 40.

Since each row has 5 stars, the number of rows of 5-star stars is 40 / 5 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the number of trucks needed, we need to calculate the total weight of the flagstones and divide it by the weight capacity of each truck.

The weight of one flagstone is 75 pounds, and there are 80 flagstones. 

Total weight of flagstones = 80 flagstones * 75 pounds/flagstone = 6000 pounds

The weight capacity of each truck is 2000 pounds. 

Number of trucks needed = Total weight of flagstones / Weight capacity of each truck
= 6000 pounds / 2000 pounds

"To find the time taken by the car in the slow lane, we first need to determine its speed. Since it's traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, its speed is 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

The distance covered by both cars is the same, which is 480 miles. We can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed to find the time taken by the car in the slow lane.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour
Time = 16 hours

The final answer is: 16"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Ali has 22 medals.
2. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.
3. Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.
4. Together, they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting, which means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have together.

Let x be the total number of medals given out. Then, 10x = 39 (since Ali and Izzy have 39 medals together).

To find x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 10:

x = 39 / 10
x = 3.9

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is 3.9. However, since medals are whole objects, it's more likely that the question is asking for the total number of medals given out, which would be a whole number. In this case, we can round up to the nearest whole number, but since the question does not specify, we will provide the exact answer.

The final answer is: 3.9"
"To find out how many chocolate bars each child will get, we first need to determine the total number of chocolate bars available. 

There are 8 packets of chocolate bars, each containing 5 chocolate bars. So, the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, and there are 4 adults. So, the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 * 6 = 24.

Now, we need to find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children. This is 40 - 24 = 16.

There are 8 children, and they will share the remaining 16 chocolate bars equally. To find out how many each child will get, we divide 16 by 8, which is 2.

Therefore, each child will get 2 chocolate bars.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much Susan earns, we need to calculate the total time she works and then multiply it by her hourly wage.

First, let's find the total time she works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total time.

Total time worked = 3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to convert the total time to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Now, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes:

150 minutes / 10 minutes/interval = 15 intervals

Since she earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by her earnings per interval:

15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

Therefore, Susan earns $75 for the online task.

The final answer is: $75"
"To find the total points of all three players after the extra points are distributed, we need to first calculate their points after the fourth round.

Initially, Mike has 21 points. 
Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

After the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. 
Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point. Now Mike has 21 + 1 = 22 points.
Jim has 18 points, so he doesn't get an extra point. Jim still has 18 points.
Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point. Now Tony has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

Now, let's calculate the total points of all three players after the extra points are distributed:
Mike has 22 points, Jim has 18 points, and Tony has 43 points.
Total points = 22 + 18 + 43 = 83

The final answer is: 83"
"To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we first need to determine how many oranges the sons washed. 

The oldest son is 8 years old, and he washes as many oranges as he is years old, so he washes 8 oranges. 

The youngest son is half as old as the oldest son, which means he is 8 / 2 = 4 years old. He also washes as many oranges as he is years old, so he washes 4 oranges.

In total, the sons wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

Since Will buys 15 oranges, and the sons wash 12, the number of oranges left unwashed is 15 - 12 = 3.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the total count of activities, we need to calculate the number of each activity done on both days and then add them up.

On the first day, Darren does:
- 100 pushups
- 50 squats
- 20 dumbbell presses

On the second day, he does:
- 20 more pushups than the first day: 100 + 20 = 120 pushups
- 10 fewer squats than the first day: 50 - 10 = 40 squats
- Doubles the number of dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses

Now, let's add up the activities for both days:
- Pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

Total count of activities: 220 + 90 + 60 = 370

The final answer is: 370"
"To find out how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day and then divide the total amount of rice available by that amount.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day (lunch and dinner). So, the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg.

Since there are 5 members in the household who eat rice every lunch and dinner, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 0.4 kg * 5 = 2 kg.

There are 7 days in a week, so the total amount of rice consumed per week is 2 kg * 7 = 14 kg.

Now, we can divide the total amount of rice available (42 kg) by the amount consumed per week (14 kg) to find out how many weeks it will last:

42 kg / 14 kg/week = 3 weeks

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we first need to calculate the total number of crates he sold in the week. 

Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he sold bread for 5 days. 

He sold 20 crates over the weekend, which is 2 days. 
He sold 15 crates on Tuesday, 12 crates on Wednesday, and 18 crates on Thursday.

Total crates sold = 20 (weekend) + 15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday) = 65 crates

Since he was closed on Monday and Friday, he had 5 working days. His target for the week is 120 crates. 

To find out how many crates he should have sold in 5 days, we can divide the target by 7 and multiply by 5. 

Target per day = 120 / 7 = 17.14 (approximately)
Crates he should have sold in 5 days = 17.14 * 5 = 85.7 (approximately)

However, since we can't sell a fraction of a crate, we will consider the nearest whole number. 

Crates he should have sold in 5 days = 86 crates

Now, let's find out how many crates he was off from his target. 

Crates he was off from his target = Target - Crates he sold = 120 - 65 = 55 crates

The final answer is: 55"
"To find the total cost of the desk, we need to determine the last bid made by Carmen. 

The initial bid is $200. The bids rise by $50 each time. Since there are 3 other people who bid once, there are a total of 4 people who bid before Carmen makes her last bid. 

The sequence of bids would be: $200, $250, $300, $350, $400, $450, $500. 

Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, so she makes 4 bids. The last bid is made by Carmen, which is $500. 

The total cost of the desk is $500. 

The final answer is: $500"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to find the total miles driven per year, the total cost of driving per year, and then add the bonus.

First, let's find the total miles driven per year. Since John goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year, he makes a total of 5 * 50 = 250 trips per year. Each trip is 30 miles (there and back), so the total miles driven per year is 250 * 30 = 7500 miles.

The cost of driving per year is the total miles driven per year multiplied by the cost per mile, which is $2. So, the cost of driving per year is 7500 * $2 = $15,000.

John also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus per year is 12 * $150 = $1800.

The total cost per year is the cost of driving per year plus the bonus per year, which is $15,000 + $1800 = $16,800.

The final numerical answer is: $16,800"
"To find out how many minutes Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to add the minutes he exercised on both days. 

Monday: 16 minutes
Sunday: 23 minutes
Combined: 16 + 23 = 39 minutes

Since Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to multiply the combined minutes by 2.

Combined minutes: 39
Twice the combined minutes: 39 * 2 = 78 minutes

Therefore, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal.

The final answer is: 78"
"To determine the number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider the folding process. 

When a piece of paper is folded vertically, it creates two layers: the front and the back. 

For a 32-page tabloid, we need to have 32 pages in total. Since each piece of paper can be used to create two pages (front and back), we can calculate the number of pieces of paper needed by dividing the total number of pages by 2.

However, we need to consider that the first and last pages (pages 1 and 32) will be on the outside of the folded paper, and the remaining pages will be on the inside. 

Since pages 1 and 32 are on the outside, we can use one piece of paper for these two pages. The remaining 30 pages (pages 2-31) will be on the inside, and we can use one piece of paper for these pages as well.

Therefore, we need 1 piece of paper for the outside pages (1 and 32) and 1 piece of paper for the inside pages (2-31), making a total of 1 + 1 = 2 pieces of paper.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find out how much money Annika has left, we need to calculate the amount she spent on food and snacks, and then subtract that from the initial amount she brought.

Annika spent half of $50 on food and snacks, which is $50 / 2 = $25.

She also spent an additional $10 on rides.

So, the total amount she spent is $25 (food and snacks) + $10 (rides) = $35.

Now, let's subtract the total amount she spent from the initial amount she brought: $50 - $35 = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to first determine how many books she sold in the first year and the second year.

We know that Elise sold 45 books this year. 

Since she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, the number of books she sold in the first year is 2 * 45 = 90.

We also know that there are 50 unsold books left, and the total number of books is 250. So, the total number of books sold is 250 - 50 = 200.

We can now find the number of books sold in the second year by subtracting the number of books sold in the first year and the current year from the total number of books sold: 200 - 90 - 45 = 65.

The total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is the number of books sold in the second year multiplied by the price of each book, which is 65 * 20 = 1300.

The final answer is: $1300"
"To calculate Watson's total earnings for April, we need to calculate his weekly earnings and then multiply it by the number of weeks in April.

Watson works 10 hours a day, 5 days a week, so his weekly hours are 10 * 5 = 50 hours. He earns $10 per hour, so his weekly earnings are 50 * $10 = $500.

Since Watson gets a $300 bonus each week, his total weekly earnings are $500 + $300 = $800.

April has 4 weeks, so Watson's total earnings for April are 4 * $800 = $3200.

The final answer is: $3200"

"To find out how many loaves are sold in the afternoon, we first need to determine how many loaves are left after the morning sales. 

The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. 

Two-thirds of 60 is calculated as (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves sold in the morning.

Now, we need to find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales. The total number of loaves left is 60 - 40 = 20 loaves.

Half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening. Half of 20 is calculated as (1/2) * 20 = 10 loaves.

Since the remaining loaves are divided equally between the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is 10.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much weight Joey loses per week and then multiply that by the number of weeks it takes Sandy to lose the same amount of weight.

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. To find out how much weight Joey loses per week, we divide the total weight lost by the number of weeks:

Weight lost per week = Total weight lost / Number of weeks
Weight lost per week = 8 pounds / 4 weeks
Weight lost per week = 2 pounds per week

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, we multiply the weight lost per week by the number of weeks it takes Sandy:

Total weight lost = Weight lost per week * Number of weeks for Sandy
Total weight lost = 2 pounds/week * 4 weeks
Total weight lost = 8 pounds

Since Sandy loses the same amount of weight as Joey in 4 weeks, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total savings, we need to calculate the savings on the tubs of ice cream and the packets of milk separately and then add them together.

The original price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $13 = $26. The discounted price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $11 = $22. The savings on 2 tubs of ice cream is $26 - $22 = $4.

The original price of 4 packets of milk is 4 x $1 = $4. The discounted price of 4 packets of milk is 4 x ($1 - $0.5) = 4 x $0.5 = $2. The savings on 4 packets of milk is $4 - $2 = $2.

The total savings is $4 + $2 = $6.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of new arms and legs grown by Helena's serum after 15 days.

The serum grows an extra arm every 3 days. To find out how many arms are grown in 15 days, we divide 15 by 3. 
15 / 3 = 5

The serum grows an extra leg every 5 days. To find out how many legs are grown in 15 days, we divide 15 by 5.
15 / 5 = 3

Since the person already has 2 arms and 2 legs, we need to add the new limbs to the existing ones. 
New arms: 2 (existing) + 5 (new) = 7 arms
New legs: 2 (existing) + 3 (new) = 5 legs

Total new limbs: 7 (arms) + 5 (legs) = 12

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount spent by Theo on the business suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket, and then subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount he had, and then subtract the amount he wishes to save.

First, let's calculate the total amount spent on business suits:
6 suits * $100 each = $600

Next, let's calculate the total amount spent on suitcases:
3 suitcases * $50 each = $150

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket. The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. 
Cost of a business suit = $100
5 times the cost of a business suit = 5 * $100 = $500
Cost of the flight ticket = $500 + $700 = $1200

Now, let's calculate the total amount spent on business suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket:
$600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight ticket) = $1950

Now, let's subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount he had:
$6000 (initial amount) - $1950 (total spent) = $4050

Finally, let's subtract the amount he wishes to save from the remaining amount:

"To find the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we first need to calculate the number of eggs consumed by each group per day and then multiply it by 7 (the number of days in a week).

Three people eat 3 eggs each day, so the total number of eggs consumed by this group per day is 3 * 3 = 9 eggs.

The rest of the family members are 5 - 3 = 2. They eat 2 eggs each day, so the total number of eggs consumed by this group per day is 2 * 2 = 4 eggs.

The total number of eggs consumed by the family per day is 9 + 4 = 13 eggs.

To find the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7: 13 * 7 = 91 eggs.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. Let's denote Noah's current age as N. Since Cera is 46 years old, six years ago, Cera's age was 40. According to the problem, six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so we can write the equation: N - 6 = 0.5 * (40).

2. Solving the equation, we get N - 6 = 20, which means N = 26. So, Noah is currently 26 years old.

3. The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah, which is 3000 * 20 = 60,000.

4. Since the population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now, the current population of Chile is 2 * 60,000 = 120,000.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Let's denote the number of players on the defense as D.
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so it's 2D.
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it's D/2.

We know that the total number of players on the team is 105. Since the team consists of offense, defense, and special teams, we can set up the equation:

D + 2D + D/2 = 105

To simplify the equation, we can multiply all terms by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2D + 4D + D = 210

Combine like terms:

7D = 210

Now, divide both sides by 7:

D = 210 / 7
D = 30

The number of players on the defense is 30.

"To find the total number of people invited, we first need to calculate the number of people from the 2 families with 6 people and the 3 families with 4 people.

For the 2 families with 6 people, the total number of people is 2 * 6 = 12.
For the 3 families with 4 people, the total number of people is 3 * 4 = 12.
The total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.

However, 8 people couldn't come due to illness. So, we subtract 8 from the total number of people invited: 24 - 8 = 16.

Then, 1/4 of the people who couldn't come had previous commitments. 1/4 of 8 is 2. So, we subtract 2 from the number of people who couldn't come due to illness: 8 - 2 = 6.

The total number of people who couldn't come is 6. We subtract this from the total number of people invited: 24 - 6 = 18.

"To find the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store, we need to calculate the total number of marbles first.

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and added them to a store that had 50. So, the total number of marbles in the store after buying from Johanna is 20 + 50 = 70.

His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna, his father gave him 2/5 * 20 = 8 marbles.

Now, the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store is 70 (initial marbles) + 20 (bought from Johanna) + 8 (given by his father) = 98 marbles.

Since each marble weighs 2kgs, the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store is 98 * 2 = 196 kgs.

Given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles:

1 (electric pole) : 3 (electric wires) = x (electric poles) : 45 (electric wires)

We can cross-multiply to solve for x:

1 * 45 = 3x
45 = 3x
x = 45 / 3
x = 15

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of people who left the party. 

Let's start by finding the total number of people at the beginning: 
Total people = men + women = 25 + 15 = 40

Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, we can find the number of people who left by multiplying the total number of people by 1/4:
People who left = Total people * 1/4 = 40 * 1/4 = 10

Now, we know that 22 men stayed at the party. Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, 3/4 of the total number of people stayed. We can set up an equation to find the total number of people who stayed:
Men who stayed + (Total people - people who stayed) = Total people
22 + (40 - people who stayed) = 40
40 - people who stayed = 18
people who stayed = 22

However, we know that people who stayed is 3/4 of the total number of people. So, we can set up an equation to find the total number of people who stayed:
people who stayed = Total people * 3/4
22 = Total people * 3/4
Total people = 22 * 4/3
Total people = 29.33 (round down to 29 since we can't have a fraction of a person)

Now that we know the total number of people who stayed, we can find the number of women who stayed:
Women who stayed = Total people - men who stayed = 29 - 22 = 7

However, we know that 10 people left, and 1/4 of the total number of people left. So, 3/4 of the women left. We can set up an equation to find the number of women who left:
Women who left = Total women * 3/4
Women who left = 15 * 3/4
Women who left = 11.25 (round down to 11 since we can't have a fraction of a person)

Now that we know the number of women who left, we can find the number of women who stayed:
Women who stayed = Total women - women who left = 15 - 11 = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the cost of the pen, we need to first find the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book, and the book costs $4, the magazine costs $4 / 2 = $2.

The pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so the pen costs $2 - $1 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To find the total number of pencils Jam has, we know she has 3 boxes and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils. We can set up an equation to represent this: 3x + 2 = 26, where x is the number of pencils in each box.

To solve for x, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: 3x = 26 - 2, 3x = 24.

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 3 to find the value of x: x = 24 / 3, x = 8.

Now that we know each box has 8 pencils, we can find the total number of pencils Jam has: 3 boxes * 8 pencils per box = 24 pencils.

We also know Meg has 46 pencils. To find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have, we add their pencils together: 24 pencils (Jam) + 46 pencils (Meg) = 70 pencils.

Since each box holds 8 pencils, we can find the total number of boxes needed by dividing the total number of pencils by 8: 70 pencils / 8 pencils per box = 8.75 boxes.

Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we round up to the nearest whole number to ensure all pencils fit. Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

The final answer is: 9"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total weakening effect of the ice cubes and the added cream.

Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and weakens it by 12 milliliters. Since the coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, we need to find out how many ice cubes are required to achieve this. 

Let's assume the initial temperature of the coffee is 100 degrees (for simplicity). To cool it down to 35 degrees (100 - 65 = 35), we need to use ice cubes that cool the coffee by 13 degrees each. 

Number of ice cubes = (100 - 35) / 13 = 65 / 13 = 5

Since each ice cube weakens the coffee by 12 milliliters, 5 ice cubes will weaken it by 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters.

Now, let's consider the added cream. The coffee is weakened by 15 milliliters due to the cream.

Total weakening effect = weakening effect of ice cubes + weakening effect of cream
= 60 + 15
= 75 milliliters

The final answer is: 75"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the trade ratio. For every 2 old records, 1 new record is given. Since 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of new records as 7. 

Now, we need to find out how many old records were traded for these 7 new records. Since the trade ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record, we can multiply the number of new records by 2 to find the total number of old records traded.

Total old records = 7 new records * 2 = 14

So, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to calculate the total amount paid to junior programmers and senior programmers separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of junior programmers:
Number of junior programmers = 2/5 * Total number of employees
= 2/5 * 100
= 40

Since there are 100 employees in total, the number of senior programmers is:
Number of senior programmers = Total number of employees - Number of junior programmers
= 100 - 40
= 60

Now, let's find the total amount paid to junior programmers:
Total amount paid to junior programmers = Number of junior programmers * Salary of junior programmers
= 40 * $2000
= $80,000

Since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, their salary is:
Salary of senior programmers = $2000 + $400
= $2400

Now, let's find the total amount paid to senior programmers:
Total amount paid to senior programmers = Number of senior programmers * Salary of senior programmers
= 60 * $2400
= $144,000

Now, let's add the total amount paid to junior programmers and senior programmers to find the total amount paid to all programmers:
Total amount paid to all programmers = Total amount paid to junior programmers + Total amount paid to senior programmers
= $80,000 + $144,000
= $224,000

The final answer is: $224,000"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as 'x'.

Initially, there were x people on the bus.

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the total number of people became x + 5.

At the second bus stop, 7 people got down, so the total number of people became (x + 5) - 7 = x - 2.

Then, 8 more people got in, so the total number of people became (x - 2) + 8 = x + 6.

We are given that the total number of people heading to the third stop is 20, so we can set up the equation:

x + 6 = 20

To solve for x, we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:

x = 20 - 6
x = 14

The final answer is: 14"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left.
3. He passes 14 out to his friends, so he has 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops left.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.
5. He eats 3 more that night, so he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops left.
6. He eats 2 more in the morning, so he has 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops left.

"To find the time it takes to fully charge the phone, we need to first find out how many percentage points are left to charge. Since the phone is already at 60% charged, it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more to be fully charged.

Since the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can find the time it takes to charge 40% by multiplying the rate by the amount left to charge: 40% * 3 minutes/percentage-point = 120 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours.

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we need to first calculate the total number of lollipops she has after her mother gives her 10 more. 

Erin initially has 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her 10 more, so Erin now has 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops.

Then, Erin gives 3 lollipops to Ella. To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we subtract 3 from 17. 

17 - 3 = 14

So, Erin has 14 lollipops left.

"To find out how much the customer paid, we need to calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip, apply the rewards and the coupon to the current shopping trip, and then subtract the total from the amount spent.

The customer spent $80 on their last shopping trip, so they earned $80 / $20 = 4 rewards. 

On this shopping trip, they spent $43 and used their rewards. Since they had 4 rewards, they used $4 off the price. 

The coupon took twice the amount of rewards off the price, which is 2 * $4 = $8. 

So, the total discount is $4 (from rewards) + $8 (from the coupon) = $12.

The amount the customer paid is $43 (spent) - $12 (discount) = $31.

"To determine which job pays more, we need to calculate the net pay for each job.

For Job A:
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours worked per year: 2000
- Annual income: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- State tax rate: 20%
- Tax amount: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net income: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

For Job B:
- Annual income: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income before tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- State tax rate: 10%
- Tax amount: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net income: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Comparing the net incomes, Job B pays more than Job A. To find the difference in net pay, we subtract the net income of Job A from the net income of Job B:

"To find the final value of Maria's shares, we need to calculate the price of the shares after the first year and then after the second year.

Initially, Maria buys 8 shares for $8 each, so the total cost is 8 * 8 = $64.

The stock price increases by 50% in the first year. To find the new price, we multiply the original price by 1.5 (100% + 50% = 150%, or 1 + 0.5 = 1.5).
New price after the first year = $8 * 1.5 = $12.

The stock price decreases by 25% in the second year. To find the new price, we multiply the price after the first year by 0.75 (100% - 25% = 75%, or 1 - 0.25 = 0.75).
New price after the second year = $12 * 0.75 = $9.

Now, we multiply the new price after the second year by the number of shares to find the final value of Maria's shares.
Final value = 8 * $9 = $72.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume the number of students in the two equal groups is x. Since the last group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the last group is x - 10.

We know that the total number of students in the class is 200. Since the two equal groups have the same number of students, we can write the equation:

2x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 70

Now that we know the number of students in each of the two equal groups, we can find the number of students in the smallest group:

Number of students in the smallest group = x - 10
= 70 - 10
= 60

The final answer is: 60"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of chickens and cows on the farm. Let's denote the number of cows as C and the number of chickens as 2C (since there are twice as many chickens as cows).

C + 2C = 60

Combine like terms:

3C = 60

Divide both sides by 3:

C = 20

Now that we know there are 20 cows, we can find the number of chickens:

Number of chickens = 2C = 2(20) = 40

Since cows have 4 legs and chickens have 2 legs, we can calculate the total number of legs:

Total legs = (Number of cows * 4) + (Number of chickens * 2)

Jenny's husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so he eats 1 * 7 = 7 cookies per week.

The total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband is 20 + 7 = 27 cookies per week.

Since there are 36 cookies in a bag, and 27 are consumed by her son and husband, Jenny eats the remaining cookies. 

36 (total cookies) - 27 (cookies consumed by son and husband) = 9 cookies.

"To find the total time John spent, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and then add them up.

John spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours swimming. 

He watched 3 shows, each 2 hours long, so the total time spent watching shows is 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

The total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows is 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours.

We are given that watching shows was 30% of the total time, so we can set up the equation: 30% of total time = 15 hours. 

To find the total time, we can convert 30% to a decimal by dividing by 100: 30 / 100 = 0.3. 

Now we can set up the equation: 0.3 * total time = 15. 

To find the total time, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.3: total time = 15 / 0.3 = 50 hours.

We are also given that John spent 40% of his time sightseeing. To find the time spent sightseeing, we can convert 40% to a decimal by dividing by 100: 40 / 100 = 0.4.

Dean started with $28, so we subtract the amount he spent from the initial amount: $28 - $17 = $11.

His mother then gave him an extra $10, so we add that to the remaining amount: $11 + $10 = $21.

The final answer is: $21"
"To find out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to first calculate the total cost of the activities. 

The cost of mini-golf for Morgan and her friends is 1 round * $5 = $5. 
Since there are 'x' friends, the total cost for mini-golf for all of them will be $5 + $5x.

The cost of arcade tokens for Morgan and her friends is $5. 
The cost of go-karts for Morgan and her friends is 2 rides * $10 = $20. 
Since there are 'x' friends, the total cost for go-karts for all of them will be $20 + $20x.

The total cost for all activities is the sum of the costs for mini-golf, arcade tokens, and go-karts: $5 + $5x + $5 + $20 + $20x = $25 + $25x.

We know that Morgan's dad has a budget of $90. So, we can set up the equation: $25 + $25x = $90.

To solve for 'x', we subtract $25 from both sides of the equation: $25x = $65.

Now, we divide both sides by $25 to find the value of 'x': x = $65 / $25.

x = 2.6

Since we can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. 

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much money Marisa saves in her piggy bank, we need to calculate the total amount she spends on lollipops and subtract that from the total amount she receives as pocket money.

Marisa receives $5 as pocket money every day. 

She buys 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each, so the total amount she spends on lollipops per day is 4 * 0.25 = $1.

The change she saves per day is $5 - $1 = $4.

Since she saves for 5 days, the total amount she saves is 5 * $4 = $20.

The final answer is: $20"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. First, let's find out how much change Billy has after buying the candy. Since he spent $1.5 per pound and he has $10, we can divide $10 by $1.5 to find out how many pounds of candy he can buy.

$10 / $1.5 = 6.67 pounds (round down to 6 pounds since you can't buy a fraction of a pound)

So, Billy has $10 - ($1.5 * 6) = $10 - $9 = $1 left as change.

2. Since Billy takes half of his change and spends it on gumballs, he spends $1 / 2 = $0.5 on gumballs.

3. We know that gumballs cost $0.05 each, and Billy bought 40 gumballs. To find out how much he spent on gumballs, we multiply the cost per gumball by the number of gumballs:

$0.05 * 40 = $2

However, we know that Billy only spent $0.5 on gumballs, not $2. This means that he must have had more money initially. Let's recalculate the initial amount of money Billy had.

Since Billy spent $0.5 on gumballs, and gumballs cost $0.05 each, we can divide $0.5 by $0.05 to find out how many gumballs he bought:

$0.5 / $0.05 = 10 gumballs

However, we know that Billy bought 40 gumballs. This means that he must have spent more money on gumballs than $0.5. Let's recalculate the amount of money Billy spent on gumballs:

$0.05 * 40 = $2

Since Billy spent $2 on gumballs, and he had $0.5 left after buying candy, we can find out how much he had initially by adding the money he spent on gumballs and the money he had left:

$2 (spent on gumballs) + $0.5 (left after buying candy) = $2.5

Now, let's find out how much money Billy had initially:

$2.5 (initial money) + $1.5 (spent on candy) = $4

"To find the age of Carver's son, we need to first determine Carver's age and then calculate the son's age based on the given information.

Let's denote Carver's age as C and his son's age as S. We know that Carver is 45 years old, so C = 45.

We are also given that Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son. This can be expressed as an equation:

C = 2S - 5

Substituting the value of C, we get:

45 = 2S - 5

To solve for S, we need to isolate S on one side of the equation. We can do this by adding 5 to both sides:

45 + 5 = 2S
50 = 2S

Next, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for S:

S = 50 / 2
S = 25

Therefore, Carver's son is 25 years old.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the total distance the train travels in one trip, we need to add the distances between the three cities. 

Distance from the first city to the second city = 75 miles
Distance from the second city to the third city = 100 miles
Distance from the third city to the first city = 100 - 50 = 50 miles (since it's 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs)
Total distance in one trip = 75 + 100 + 50 = 225 miles

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance it travels in a day is:
Total daily distance = 225 miles/trip * 3 trips/day = 675 miles/day

To find out how many days the train goes between services, we need to divide the total distance it can travel before needing service (18,000 miles) by the total daily distance:
Days between services = Total distance before service / Total daily distance
= 18,000 miles / 675 miles/day
= 26.67 days

"To find the total time taken for the trip, we need to calculate the time taken for each part of the trip and add them together.

First, let's calculate the time taken for the trip to his friend's house:
Distance = 200 miles
Speed = 70 mph
Time = Distance / Speed = 200 / 70 = 2.86 hours (approximately)

However, he took a detour that added 10 miles to his trip. So, the actual distance traveled to his friend's house is 200 + 10 = 210 miles. 
Time taken for the detour part = 10 / 70 = 0.14 hours (approximately)

Now, let's calculate the time taken for the trip back home:
Distance = 240 miles
Speed = 80 mph
Time = Distance / Speed = 240 / 80 = 3 hours

Total time taken for the trip = Time taken to friend's house + Time taken for detour + Time taken back home

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as M, the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting as S, and the number of customers kicked out for physical violence as V.

We are given that M = 3.

We are also given that the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting (S) equals four times the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks minus 5. So, S = 4M - 5 = 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7.

We are also given that the number of customers kicked out for physical violence (V) is three times the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting. So, V = 3S = 3(7) = 21.

We are given that a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart. The total number of people kicked out is the sum of the people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence. So, M + S + V = 50.

Substituting the values we found earlier, we get 3 + 7 + 21 = 31. This is the sum of the people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence.

To find the number of people kicked out for other reasons, we subtract the sum from the total number of people kicked out. So, 50 - 31 = 19.

"To find the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to calculate the cost of the picture frames, the etching, the pins, and the cords separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames. There are 44 seniors, and each picture frame costs $20. So, the total cost of the picture frames is 44 * $20 = $880.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of etching the logo on the picture frames. The etching costs an additional 20% of the cost of the picture frame, which is $20. 20% of $20 is 0.2 * $20 = $4. So, the total cost of etching the logo on all the picture frames is 44 * $4 = $176.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the pins. 2 seniors will receive pins, and each pin costs $5. So, the total cost of the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the cords. 1/4 of the seniors are officers, which is 44 / 4 = 11 officers. Each officer will receive a cord that costs $12. So, the total cost of the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, let's add up the costs of the picture frames, etching, pins, and cords to find the total cost of the senior gifts. $880 + $176 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the number of shoes they sold on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six people returned their pairs on Sunday, so we need to subtract those from the total number of shoes sold on Sunday. 14 - 6 = 8 pairs.

Now, let's add up the total number of shoes sold: 14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 8 (Sunday) = 50 pairs.

Value of faulty equipment = $400,000 * 0.4 = $160,000

Now, we subtract the value of the faulty equipment from the total value to find the value of the functioning equipment.
Value of functioning equipment = Total value - Value of faulty equipment
= $400,000 - $160,000
= $240,000

The final answer is: $240,000"
"To find the total amount of milk Mary collects every day, we need to calculate the milk from the half of the sheep that gives 1 kg of milk and the half that gives 2 kg of milk.

Half of the 30 sheep is 30 / 2 = 15 sheep. 
These 15 sheep give 1 kg of milk each, so the total milk from this half is 15 * 1 = 15 kg.

The other half of the sheep also gives 2 kg of milk each, so the total milk from this half is 15 * 2 = 30 kg.

The total milk collected every day is the sum of the milk from both halves, which is 15 + 30 = 45 kg.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find out how many pieces of rolls Mrs. Sherman fed to the chickens, we first need to determine how many rolls were left after feeding her children. 

Mrs. Sherman started with a dozen rolls, which is 12 rolls. She fed 6 children, so she had 12 - 6 = 6 rolls left. 

Since she broke each of the remaining rolls into 8 pieces, we multiply the number of rolls left by 8. 6 rolls * 8 pieces per roll = 48 pieces.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the number of pupils who like the color yellow, we need to first find the number of pupils who like blue, then the number of pupils who like green, and finally subtract the sum of these two from the total number of pupils.

First, half of the class likes blue: 40 / 2 = 20 pupils like blue.

One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green. The remaining pupils are 40 - 20 = 20. One-fourth of 20 is 20 / 4 = 5 pupils who like green.

Now, we subtract the number of pupils who like blue and green from the total number of pupils to find the number of pupils who like yellow: 40 - 20 - 5 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we need to calculate the number of apples picked each day and add them together.

On Monday, we don't know the number of apples picked, but we know that Lucy sold them all for $56 at $4 per apple. So, the number of apples picked on Monday is 56 / 4 = 14.

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she did the previous day, which is 2 * 12 = 24 apples.

Now, we add the number of apples picked each day: 14 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 24 (Wednesday) = 50.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how many socks Lindsay has washed, we need to calculate the total number of socks she has washed. 

She washed 10 pairs of socks, and since each pair has 2 socks, she washed 10 * 2 = 20 socks from the pairs. 

She also washed 15 loose socks. 

So, the total number of socks she has washed is 20 + 15 = 35 socks.

Since there are 50 socks in total, the number of socks Lindsay has missed is 50 - 35 = 15 socks.

The final answer is: 15"

First, let's add the number of cookies Rachel bought to the number of cookies Janet gave her: 
23 (initial cookies) + 42 (cookies from Janet) = 65 cookies

Now, let's subtract the number of cookies her brother ate:
65 (total cookies) - 44 (cookies eaten) = 21 cookies

So, there are 21 cookies left for Rachel. 

21"
"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total interest she has to pay and then divide it by the number of months.

First, let's calculate the total interest:

Interest = Principal * Rate * Time
Principal = $3,650
Rate = 10% or 0.10
Time = 5 months

Interest = $3,650 * 0.10 * 5
Interest = $1,825

Now, let's calculate the total amount Karan has to pay, which is the principal plus the interest:

Total Amount = Principal + Interest
Total Amount = $3,650 + $1,825
Total Amount = $5,475

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month for 5 months, we can divide the total amount by the number of months:

Monthly Payment = Total Amount / Number of Months
Monthly Payment = $5,475 / 5
Monthly Payment = $1,095

The final answer is: $1,095"
"To find out how many kilometers Cho hiked, we need to multiply the speed by the time. 

Cho's distance = 14 km/h * 8 h = 112 km

To find out how many kilometers Chloe hiked, we need to multiply her speed by the time she hiked.

Chloe's distance = 9 km/h * 5 h = 45 km

Now, we need to find the difference between Cho's distance and Chloe's distance to determine how many kilometers farther Cho hiked.

Difference = Cho's distance - Chloe's distance
Difference = 112 km - 45 km

"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to calculate the total number of pesos each of them has and then add them together.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. 

Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos. 
Anna also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pesos each of them has:
Axel's total pesos = 50 (silver) + 80 (gold) = 130 pesos
Anna's total pesos = 100 (silver) + 120 (gold) = 220 pesos

The total number of pesos they have together is the sum of their individual totals:
Total pesos = Axel's total + Anna's total = 130 + 220 = 350

The final answer is: 350"
"To find the total profit per hour, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost.

First, let's find the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make with the supplies she bought. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups and she bought enough supplies to make 3 pitchers, she can make 3 * 12 = 36 cups of lemonade.

Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue will be the number of cups sold multiplied by the price per cup. However, we need to know how many hours she operates the stand to find the total revenue. Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, and she has 36 cups, she will sell all of the lemonade in 36 / 4 = 9 hours.

The total revenue will be 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

Now, let's find the total cost. Millie spent $18 to buy the supplies.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. So, the profit per hour will be the total profit divided by the number of hours she operates the stand.

Total profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Total profit = $36 - $18
Total profit = $18

Since she operates the stand for 9 hours, the profit per hour will be:
Profit per hour = Total profit / Number of hours
Profit per hour = $18 / 9
Profit per hour = $2

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the initial amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the initial amount of land as 'x'. Since he sold 3/5 of his land, he was left with 2/5 of the initial amount. We are given that the remaining land is 12.8 hectares.

We can set up the equation as follows:

2/5 * x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2 to isolate x:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land initially.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the number of female members in the choir, we first need to calculate 50% of 52, which is the total number of members. 

50% of 52 = 0.5 * 52 = 26

Since there are 26 female members, and half of them can't make it to the show, we need to find half of 26.

Half of 26 = 26 / 2 = 13

Now, we have 13 female members who can make it to the show. The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them. 

Total number of people who sang in the performance = 13 (female members) + 3 (teachers) = 16

"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to calculate the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu and add it to the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson.

First, let's find the number of messages James delivers to Mr. Yu. Since he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can multiply the number of messages to Ms. Thompson by 1/3.

Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * Messages to Ms. Thompson
Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * 66
Messages to Mr. Yu = 22

Now, we can add the number of messages to Mr. Yu and Ms. Thompson to find the total number of messages James delivers.

Total messages = Messages to Ms. Thompson + Messages to Mr. Yu
Total messages = 66 + 22
Total messages = 88

The final answer is: 88"
"To find out how much money David saves, we need to calculate the cost of the rides for Dasha and compare it to the cost of the ride bracelet for David.

Each ride costs 2 tickets at $2 per ticket, so the cost of one ride is 2 * $2 = $4.

Since they ride all 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha to buy tickets for all 9 rides is 9 * $4 = $36.

David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides. 

The cost of the rides for Dasha is $36, and the cost for David is $30. 

To find out how much money David saves, we subtract the cost for David from the cost for Dasha: $36 - $30 = $6.

David saves $6.

"To find out how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we need to first determine the total number of gifts she needs to wrap and then divide the total amount of ribbon by the total number of gifts.

Total gifts = 6 (family) + 4 (friends) + 2 (teachers) = 12 gifts

Since Monica wants to make a bow for each gift, she will need to make 12 bows.

Now, let's divide the total amount of ribbon by the total number of gifts to find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each bow:

Total ribbon = 144 inches
Total gifts = 12

Ribbon per bow = Total ribbon / Total gifts
= 144 / 12
= 12 inches

So, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow. 

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the number of popsicles each person has, we need to first find the total parts in the ratio, which is 5 + 6 = 11. 

We can then divide the total number of popsicles (165) by the total parts in the ratio (11) to find the value of one part. 

165 / 11 = 15

Now, we can multiply the value of one part (15) by the number of parts each person has in the ratio to find the number of popsicles each person has. 

Betty has 5 parts, so she has 5 x 15 = 75 popsicles.
Sam has 6 parts, so he has 6 x 15 = 90 popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has.

90 - 75 = 15

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total cost of the streaming services, we need to calculate the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus. 

The normal cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 each, so together they cost $20. However, Tim saves 20% by bundling them. 

20% of $20 is 0.2 * $20 = $4. 

So, the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $20 - $4 = $16. 

The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $16 (bundled Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26. 

Since Tim was paying $60 for the cable package, he saves $60 - $26 = $34 by cancelling his cable subscription. 

The final answer is: $34"
"To find the total time spent, we need to add up the time spent writing, recording, and editing the song. 

Time spent writing: 4 hours
Time spent recording: 4 hours / 2 = 2 hours
Time spent editing: 90 minutes = 1.5 hours

Total time spent = 4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5 hours

Now, to find the percentage of time spent editing, we need to divide the time spent editing by the total time and multiply by 100.

Percentage of time spent editing = (1.5 / 7.5) * 100 = 20%

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total number of books Wendy needs to carry, we first need to determine the total number of books in the shelving system. Since it has 6 rows and 6 columns, we can multiply the number of rows by the number of columns to find the total number of spaces for books.

6 rows * 6 columns = 36 spaces

However, Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books in the system. First, we need to find double the number of spaces, which is 2 * 36 = 72. Then, we add 20 to this number to find the total number of books Wendy needs to carry.

72 + 20 = 92

So, Wendy will need to carry 92 books to complete her task.

The final answer is: 92"
"To find out how many Valentine's Day cards Erica has now, we need to calculate the total number of cards she initially had, added to the cards her dad brought, and then subtract the cards she passed out and add the cards she received.

Initially, Erica made 20 Valentine's cards.

Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards that had 15 cards each, so she received 2 * 15 = 30 cards.

She passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 to her family, so in total, she gave away 24 + 5 = 29 cards.

She received 17 cards from family and friends.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards Erica has now:

Initial cards + cards from dad - cards given away + cards received
= 20 + 30 - 29 + 17
= 38

So, Erica now has 38 Valentine's Day cards."
"To find out how many slices are left, we first need to determine how many slices Jenny gave away. 

Jenny gave 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices, we can calculate the number of slices Bill received as follows:
1/3 * 12 = 4 slices

Jenny gave 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. We can calculate the number of slices Mark received as follows:
1/4 * 12 = 3 slices

In total, Jenny gave away 4 + 3 = 7 slices.

Jenny ate 2 slices, so the total number of slices she gave away and ate is 7 + 2 = 9 slices.

To find out how many slices are left, we subtract the total number of slices given away and eaten from the total number of slices:
12 - 9 = 3 slices

The final answer is: 3"

"To find the total number of bugs, we need to calculate the number of millipedes and stink bugs first.

Nancy saw 90 spiders. The number of millipedes is 1/3rd of the number of spiders, so the number of millipedes is 90 / 3 = 30.

The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12, so the number of stink bugs is (2 * 30) - 12 = 48.

Now, we add the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs to find the total number of bugs: 90 + 30 + 48 = 168.

The final answer is: 168"

"To determine the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of flour and milk required for the quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. Since Mark is making a quadruple batch, he will need 4 times the amount of each ingredient. 

For flour: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups
For milk: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark will need to buy:
12 cups / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags of flour

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so Mark will need to buy:
4 cups / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles of milk

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour:
6 bags of flour - 2 bottles of milk = 4

"To find the energy saved, we first need to calculate the energy used by the air conditioner in a day. 

The air conditioner uses 900 watts of energy per hour. Since there are 8 hours of usage, the total energy used in a day is:
900 watts/hour * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours or 7.2 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per day.

If Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours, the new usage time is:
8 hours - 5 hours = 3 hours per day.

The new energy used in a day is:
900 watts/hour * 3 hours = 2700 watt-hours or 2.7 kWh per day.

The energy saved per day is the difference between the original and new usage:
7.2 kWh - 2.7 kWh = 4.5 kWh per day.

To find the total energy saved in 30 days, we multiply the daily energy saved by 30:
4.5 kWh/day * 30 days = 135 kWh.

"To determine the total cost of the meat and cheese, we first need to calculate the total number of sandwiches required to serve 20 people. Since each sandwich serves 4 people, we divide 20 by 4 to get the total number of sandwiches needed.

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, we need a total of 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

The cost of the meat is $7.00 per pound, so the total cost of the meat is:
5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00

The cost of the cheese is $3.00 per pound, so the total cost of the cheese is:
5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

The total cost of the meat and cheese is the sum of the cost of the meat and the cost of the cheese:
$35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the initial number of corns and cannolis Allan has at home. 

Since Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis and he has 40 cannolis, the initial number of corns is 2 * 40 = 80.

Allan bought 60 more cannolis and 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. So, he bought 60 cannolis and 60 - 40 = 20 corns.

Now, we add the initial and the new quantities: 
Initial cannolis: 40
Initial corns: 80
New cannolis: 60
New corns: 20

Total cannolis: 40 + 60 = 100
Total corns: 80 + 20 = 100

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is: 100 + 100 = 200

"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to first determine how many steps he had completed before the jog. 

Elliott finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. Since he wants to walk 10,000 steps, half of that would be 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps. 

He also took an additional 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So, before the jog, he had completed 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

After the jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal of 10,000 steps. This means that before the jog, he had completed 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 steps.

However, we already know that before the jog, he had completed 6,000 steps. To find out how many steps he took during the jog, we need to subtract the steps he had already completed from the total steps he had completed before the jog. 

So, steps taken during the jog = 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000 steps.

"To find out how many minutes Toby will be early, we need to calculate the total time it takes for him to read the book and travel to the airport.

First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book: 
45 pages * 200 words per page = 9000 words

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Toby to read the book:
9000 words / 300 words per minute = 30 minutes

Now, let's add the time it takes to get to the airport:
30 minutes (reading time) + 10 minutes (travel time) = 40 minutes

Since Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to leave, we subtract the total time from the available time:
60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes

Toby will be 20 minutes early."
"To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately and then add them together.

In May, the company hired 40 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, so the total hours worked by each employee in May is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in May is 160 * $15 = $2400. Since there are 40 employees, the total amount paid in May is 40 * $2400 = $96,000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 1/4 * 40 = 10 employees left. So, the company had 40 - 10 = 30 employees in June. Each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, so the total hours worked by each employee in June is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in June is 160 * $15 = $2400. Since there are 30 employees, the total amount paid in June is 30 * $2400 = $72,000.

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000.

"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. Since she bought 2 pounds and the sale is ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off,"" we can consider it as a 2-pound purchase with a discount on the second pound. The first pound costs $3, and the second pound is half off, which is $3 * 0.5 = $1.5. So, the total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.5 = $4.5.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the magnets. She bought 4 magnets at $0.25 each, so the total cost of the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items: $4.5 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1 (magnets) = $7.

Sally started with $10, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from the initial amount: $10 - $7 = $3.

"To find the total amount spent by Tim, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks and the finale firework separately and then add them together.

The first package of fireworks costs $400, and the second package costs twice that much, which is 2 * $400 = $800. 

The total cost of the fireworks is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Since Tim gets a 20% discount on the fireworks, we need to calculate the discount amount first. The discount amount is 20% of $1200, which is 0.20 * $1200 = $240.

The discounted cost of the fireworks is $1200 - $240 = $960.

Now, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted cost of the fireworks. The total amount spent by Tim is $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To determine how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we need to calculate how many cookies she will eat in 30 days. 

Since Shannon eats 2 cookies per night, we multiply the number of cookies she eats per night by the number of nights in 30 days. 

There are 30 nights in 30 days. 

2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies

Since Shannon's recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies she needs by 12 to find out how many dozens she needs to make.

60 cookies / 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozen cookies

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozen cookies to have enough for 30 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. 

First, let's find the number of candles that smell like wet dog. Since 5% of the candles have this defect, we can calculate it as follows:

Number of candles that smell like wet dog = Total number of candles * Percentage of candles with the defect
= 50000 * 0.05
= 2500

Now, we need to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. Since Marcy guarantees that 99% of the candles will not explode, the percentage of candles that will explode is 1% (100% - 99%). However, this 1% is out of the total number of candles, not the number of candles that smell like wet dog. 

To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to find 1% of the number of candles that smell like wet dog:

Number of candles that smell like wet dog and explode = Number of candles that smell like wet dog * Percentage of candles that will explode
= 2500 * 0.01
= 25

"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we first need to find the price of each blouse after the 30% discount. 

The discount amount is 30% of the regular price, which is 0.3 * $20 = $6. 

So, the discounted price of each blouse is $20 - $6 = $14.

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses is 4 * $14 = $56.

The final answer is: $56"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathered from the tallest trees as T, from the average trees as A, and from the shortest trees as S. 

Since Joanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees, we have T = 30.

From the shortest trees, Joanne gathered half the amount she gathered from the tallest trees, so S = 30 / 2 = 15.

Now, let's denote the number of apples Joanne's sister gathered from the tallest trees as 2T and from the shortest trees as 3S.

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne is T + A + S, and the total number of apples gathered by her sister is 2T + 3S.

We know that the combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, so we can write the equation: T + A + S + 2T + 3S = 500.

Substituting the values of T and S, we get 30 + A + 15 + 2(30) + 3(15) = 500.

Combine like terms: 30 + A + 15 + 60 + 45 = 500.

Combine the constants: 150 + A = 500.

Subtract 150 from both sides: A = 350.

The final answer is: 350"
"Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D. We know that camels have two humps each and dromedaries have one hump each. 

We are given two pieces of information: 
1. The total number of heads is 180. Since each animal has one head, we can write this as C + D = 180.
2. The total number of bumps is 304. Since camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump, we can write this as 2C + D = 304.

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve this system by subtracting the first equation from the second equation to eliminate D:

2C + D - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know C, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find D:

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

Therefore, there are 56 dromedaries in the herd.

The final answer is: 56"
"To find the total distance traveled by Tom, we need to break down the information given.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day. So, the total distance covered in the first 4 days is:
200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. 
30% of 800 km = 0.3 * 800 = 240 km
So, the total distance covered in the next two days is 240 km.

The total distance covered in the first 6 days is:
800 km + 240 km = 1040 km

On the next day, he wasn't traveling at all, so the distance covered is 0 km.

During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total distance covered in the second week is:
300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

The total distance covered during the two-week-long trip is the sum of the distances covered in the first week and the second week:
1040 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

The final answer is: 3140"
"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to work backwards from Peter's locker size. 

Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, and Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, we can find Zack's locker size by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4. 

Zack's locker size = 5 * 4 = 20 cubic inches.

Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can find Timothy's locker size by multiplying Zack's locker size by 2.

Timothy's locker size = 20 * 2 = 40 cubic inches.

"To find the elevation where Stanley's comb fell, we need to subtract the distance it fell from Stanley's initial elevation. 

Stanley's initial elevation: 10,000 feet
Distance the comb fell: 4,000 feet
Elevation where the comb fell: 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet

Now, we need to find the difference between the elevation where the comb fell and Oliver's elevation to determine how much Oliver needs to climb.

Elevation where the comb fell: 6,000 feet
Oliver's elevation: 3,000 feet
Distance Oliver must climb: 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet

"To find the total amount of money Mr. Josue has now, we need to calculate the amount he received from the second bank and add it to the initial capital and the amount from the first bank.

The first bank gave him $4000. 
The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, so the second bank gave him 2 * $4000 = $8000.

Now, let's add the amounts from both banks to the initial capital: 
$4000 (from the first bank) + $8000 (from the second bank) = $12000
$12000 + $5000 (initial capital) = $17000

"To find the number of cats left on the rock, we first need to determine the number of cats taken away by the boats and then subtract that from the initial number of cats. 

Initially, there were 50 cats. Four boats came and each took 5 cats, so the total number of cats taken away is 4 * 5 = 20. 

Now, we subtract the number of cats taken away from the initial number of cats: 50 - 20 = 30.

After that, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find the number of cats that ran after the mouse, we multiply the remaining cats by 3/5: 30 * (3/5) = 18.

Now, we subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats: 30 - 18 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into the different periods and calculate the cost for each period.

1. The first 6 months were $8 a month, so the cost for this period is:
6 months * $8/month = $48

2. The next 8 months were $12 a month, so the cost for this period is:
8 months * $12/month = $96

3. After that, the price increased to $14 a month. Since 2 years is 24 months, and we've already accounted for 14 months, there are 10 months left at the new price. The cost for this period is:
10 months * $14/month = $140

Now, let's add up the costs for each period to find the total cost for 2 years:
$48 + $96 + $140 = $284

The total cost for 2 years of the service is: $284"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the cost of the jogger jeans as J and the cost of the tattered jeans as T. We know that T = $28.

We also know that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so we can write an equation: J = T - 6.

Substituting the value of T, we get J = 28 - 6, which simplifies to J = 22.

We are also given that Cole saved a total of $6. Since he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, we can set up the following equation:

(1/3) * (J - T) + (2/3) * (T - T) = 6

Simplifying the equation, we get (1/3) * (J - T) = 6.

Substituting the value of J, we get (1/3) * (22 - 28) = 6.

"To find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders and the store-bought feeders separately and then add them together.

Since Lillian made 3 homemade feeders and bought 3 store-bought feeders, there are a total of 6 feeders. 

The store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each, so the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3 * 20 = 60.

The homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, so they attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each. The total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3 * 30 = 90.

To find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we add the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders and the homemade feeders: 60 + 90 = 150.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cards Kenny sold to get the remaining $50. Since he sold the cards for $1.5 each, we can divide the remaining money by the price per card to find the number of cards sold.

Let's denote the total number of cards as 'x'. Since Kenny keeps 1/3 of the cards, he sells 2/3 of the cards. The number of cards sold is 2/3x.

The total money earned from selling the cards is $50. Since each card is sold for $1.5, we can set up the equation:

2/3x * 1.5 = 50

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3/2 to get:

x = 50 * (3/2)
x = 75

So, Kenny started with 75 cards.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, the caterer prepared enough hot dogs for half of the guests to have two hot dogs. Since there are 36 guests, half of them would be 36 / 2 = 18 guests. 

For these 18 guests, the caterer prepared 2 hot dogs each, so the total number of hot dogs prepared for these 18 guests is 18 * 2 = 36 hot dogs.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hot dog. This means that the caterer had to provide an additional 40 - 36 = 4 hot dogs for the extra 4 guests.

Since the caterer had already prepared 36 hot dogs for the initial 18 guests, and now needs to provide 4 more hot dogs for the extra 4 guests, the total number of hot dogs prepared is 36 + 4 = 40 hot dogs.

Now, we know that the caterer prepared enough hot dogs for 36 guests to have 2 hot dogs each, but only had enough hot dogs for 40 guests to have 2 hot dogs. This means that the 4 extra guests who showed up were able to get a second hot dog, but the remaining guests who were originally supposed to have only 1 hot dog were not able to get a second hot dog.

Since there are 36 guests in total, and 4 extra guests showed up, the number of guests who were originally supposed to have only 1 hot dog is 36 - 4 = 32 guests.

Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hot dog is 32.

To find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost: $19 (total cost) - $18 (amount she has) = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To find out how many dragons Prince Bruce slew, we need to first determine how many dragons Prince Arthur and Prince Walter slew, and then calculate one-fifth of that number.

Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons. 
Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, so Prince Arthur slew 3/4 * 100 = 75 dragons.

Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so Prince Walter slew 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.

Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so Prince Bruce slew 1/5 * 150 = 30 dragons.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we first need to determine how much gas was in one container. Since 15 gallons were equally divided into 5 containers, we divide 15 gallons by 5.

15 gallons / 5 = 3 gallons per container

Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we multiply the number of gallons per container by 8 to find the number of pints per container.

3 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 24 pints per container

Josey needed 1/4 of a container to run her lawnmower. To find out how many pints she needed, we multiply the number of pints per container by 1/4.

24 pints/container * 1/4 = 6 pints

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money George had initially. Since he had 1% of his money left after spending $5, we can set up an equation to find the initial amount.

Let's denote the initial amount of money George had as 'x'. Since he had 1% of his money left after spending $5, we can write the equation as:

x - 5 = 0.01x

To solve for x, we can add 5 to both sides of the equation:

x = 5 / (1 - 0.01)
x = 5 / 0.99
x = 5.05

So, George had $5.05 initially.

Now, let's find out how much he spent on chips. He bought 3 bags of chips for 40 cents each, so the total amount spent on chips is:

3 * 0.40 = $1.20

Since he spent $5 in total, the amount spent on candy bars is:

5 - 1.20 = $3.80

Now, we can find out how many candy bars he bought by dividing the amount spent on candy bars by the cost of each candy bar:

3.80 / 0.75 = 5.07

Since we can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can see that 5 candy bars would cost 3.75, and 6 candy bars would cost 4.50, so the amount spent on candy bars is between 5 and 6. Therefore, George must have bought 5 candy bars.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many lollipops each of Ray's friends received, we need to first determine how many lollipops he shared with his friends. 

Ray had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself, so he shared 25 - 5 = 20 lollipops with his friends.

Since he shared the lollipops equally among his four friends, we need to divide the total number of lollipops shared (20) by the number of friends (4).

20 lollipops / 4 friends = 5 lollipops per friend.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the remaining weight of the cake, we first need to determine the total weight of the pieces that Rory and her mom each had. 

Since each piece is equal, we can divide the total weight of the cake by the number of pieces to find the weight of one piece. 

Weight of the cake: 20 ounces
Number of pieces: 8

Weight of one piece = Total weight / Number of pieces
Weight of one piece = 20 ounces / 8
Weight of one piece = 2.5 ounces

Since Rory and her mom each had a piece, we need to find the total weight of the two pieces they had. 

Weight of two pieces = Weight of one piece * 2
Weight of two pieces = 2.5 ounces * 2
Weight of two pieces = 5 ounces

Now, we subtract the weight of the two pieces from the total weight of the cake to find the remaining weight.

Remaining weight = Total weight - Weight of two pieces
Remaining weight = 20 ounces - 5 ounces
Remaining weight = 15 ounces

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how many oranges each person will get, we need to first calculate the total number of oranges Sitti and Juris have. 

Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges. 

Total oranges = 34 + 22 = 56

Since they are sharing the oranges with 6 other friends, including themselves, the total number of people sharing the oranges is 8 (Sitti, Juris, and 6 friends).

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people.

Oranges per person = Total oranges / Total people
= 56 / 8
= 7

So, everyone will get 7 oranges. 

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the cost per serving, we first need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients. 

Antoine wants to double the amount of onions, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The cost of onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, which costs 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

Since the soup serves 6 people, the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes Bernadette to get to the theater and then calculate how much earlier she needs to leave than Wayne.

Since it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, and Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's, Bernadette's drive will take 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, and it takes her 16 minutes to get to the theater, she needs to leave 16 + 5 = 21 minutes before Wayne.

However, since Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, Bernadette needs to leave 21 minutes before Wayne's 4 minutes, which is 21 - 4 = 17 minutes.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 17 minutes earlier than Wayne to get to the theater first.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the perimeter of the room, we first need to find the width of the room. Since the area of the room is given as 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. 

1 yard = 3 feet, so 3 yards = 3 * 3 = 9 feet.

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle: Area = Length * Width. We know the area (360 square feet) and the length (9 feet), so we can solve for the width:

360 = 9 * Width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the width, we can find the perimeter of the room using the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98 feet

The final answer is: 98"
"To find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we need to calculate the total number of beads each sister has.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, Elizabeth has:
1 pack of red beads = 1 x 20 = 20 beads
2 packs of clear beads = 2 x 20 = 40 beads
Total beads Elizabeth has = 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, Margareth has:
3 packs of blue beads = 3 x 20 = 60 beads
4 packs of red beads = 4 x 20 = 80 beads
Total beads Margareth has = 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, let's find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth:
Margareth's beads - Elizabeth's beads = 140 - 60 = 80

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the final temperature of the house, we need to calculate the temperature increase due to the oven and the temperature decrease due to the open window.

First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to the oven:

The oven is on for 3 hours, and it raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. So, the total temperature increase is:
3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees

Now, let's calculate the temperature decrease due to the open window:

The window is open for 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes, so for 30 minutes, it cools down:
(30 minutes / 10 minutes) * 2 degrees = 6 degrees

Now, let's calculate the final temperature of the house:
Initial temperature = 40 degrees
Temperature increase due to oven = 15 degrees
Temperature decrease due to window = 6 degrees
Final temperature = Initial temperature + Temperature increase - Temperature decrease
= 40 + 15 - 6
= 49 degrees

The final answer is: 49"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it took James to complete each segment of the triathlon. 

Let's start with the swim. Since James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon, and Jon took 40 minutes, we can calculate James' swim time as follows:

James' swim time = Jon's swim time - (10% of Jon's swim time)
= 40 - (0.1 * 40)
= 40 - 4
= 36 minutes

Next, we know that James took 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. Since Jon took 1 hour and 20 minutes (or 80 minutes) on the bike, we can calculate James' bike time as follows:

James' bike time = Jon's bike time + 5 minutes
= 80 + 5
= 85 minutes

Now, we know that Jon won by 10 minutes. This means that the total time it took James to complete the triathlon was 10 minutes more than Jon's total time. We can calculate Jon's total time as follows:

Jon's total time = Swim time + Bike time + Run time
= 40 + 80 + 50
= 170 minutes

Since James' total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's, we can calculate James' total time as follows:

James' total time = Jon's total time + 10 minutes
= 170 + 10
= 180 minutes

Now, we can calculate James' run time as follows:

James' run time = James' total time - (James' swim time + James' bike time)
= 180 - (36 + 85)
= 180 - 121
= 59 minutes

The final answer is: 59"
"To find the length of Movie A, we need to first find the length of Movie B and then calculate one-fourth of that length.

Movie C is 1.25 hours, which is equal to 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes.

Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so Movie B is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes.

Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, so Movie A is 80 / 4 = 20 minutes.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay, we need to calculate the total cost of the hay and subtract it from the amount of money he has.

First, let's calculate the distance the horse runs in 30 minutes. Since the horse runs at 32MPH, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. 

30 minutes is 0.5 hours (since 1 hour = 60 minutes).

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 32MPH * 0.5 hours
Distance = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile, the total hay consumed is:
Total Hay = Distance * (1/2 bail/mile)
Total Hay = 16 miles * (1/2 bail/mile)
Total Hay = 8 bails

Each bail costs $3, so the total cost of the hay is:
Total Cost = Total Hay * Cost per bail
Total Cost = 8 bails * $3/bail
Total Cost = $24

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of:
Total Money = 6 * $5
Total Money = $30

Now, let's calculate the change:
Change = Total Money - Total Cost
Change = $30 - $24
Change = $6

The final answer is: $6"
"To find out how many eggs Rozanne has in total, we need to calculate the number of eggs from the cases and the loose eggs separately. 

4 dozen eggs is equal to 4 x 12 = 48 eggs. 
Adding the 2 loose eggs, Rozanne has a total of 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Since each glass needs 5 eggs, we can divide the total number of eggs by 5 to find out how many glasses of eggnog Rozanne can make. 
50 eggs / 5 eggs per glass = 10 glasses.

Each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog, so we can divide the total number of glasses by 5 to find out how many trays Rozanne can put out. 
10 glasses / 5 glasses per tray = 2 trays.

"To find the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total revenue from the sale of the sneakers and subtract the initial cost.

First, let's calculate the revenue from the flash sale on Monday: 
17 sneakers were sold for $20 each, so the revenue from the flash sale is 17 * $20 = $340.

Next, let's calculate the revenue from the sale to the department store:
There were 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers left, and they were sold for $25 each. The revenue from the department store sale is 31 * $25 = $775.

The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from the flash sale and the department store sale: $340 + $775 = $1115.

The initial cost of the case of sneakers was $576. To find the profit, we subtract the initial cost from the total revenue: $1115 - $576 = $539.

Next, let's calculate the total number of crayons in the four packets with 16 pieces each:
4 packets * 16 crayons/packet = 64 crayons

Now, we add the total number of crayons from both types of packets to find the overall total:
48 crayons + 64 crayons = 112 crayons

The final answer is: 112"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the regular price of popcorn as P. 

The total cost of buying a movie ticket and popcorn and soda at regular price is 12 + P + 3 = 15 + P.

The total cost of buying a super ticket is 20. If you didn't buy the super ticket and ended up saving $2, then the cost of buying a movie ticket and popcorn and soda at regular price is 2 less than the cost of the super ticket. 

So, 15 + P = 20 - 2
15 + P = 18

Now, let's solve for P:
P = 18 - 15
P = 3

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the cost of filling one balloon before the price increase. 

Let's denote the original cost of filling one balloon as x. Since the total cost of filling 20 balloons was $900, we can set up the equation:

20x = 900

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 20:

x = 900 / 20
x = 45

So, the original cost of filling one balloon was $45.

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20, making the new cost of filling one balloon $65.

Now, we need to find the total cost of filling 170 balloons at the new price. We can multiply the new cost per balloon by the number of balloons:

Total cost = 65 * 170
Total cost = 11050

The final answer is: $11050"
"To find the average speed of the car during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled at 60 mph for 2 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 60 mph x 2 hours
Distance = 120 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled at 30 mph for 1 hour:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 30 mph x 1 hour
Distance = 30 miles

Now, let's find the total distance traveled:
Total Distance = 120 miles + 30 miles
Total Distance = 150 miles

The total time taken is the sum of the time taken at 60 mph and 30 mph:
Total Time = 2 hours + 1 hour
Total Time = 3 hours

Finally, we can calculate the average speed:
Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
Average Speed = 150 miles / 3 hours
Average Speed = 50 mph

"To find the total value of Jenna's jewels, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires and rubies separately and then add them together.

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. Each sapphire is worth $800, so the total value of her sapphires is:
8 sapphires * $800/sapphire = $6400

Jenna trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. This means she now has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left. The value of the sapphires remains the same, $6400.

The value of the 2 rubies she received in the trade is:
2 rubies * $1200/ruby = $2400

Now, we add the value of the sapphires and rubies together:
$6400 (sapphires) + $2400 (rubies) = $8800

The total value of Jenna's jewels is $8800.

"To find the total volume of soil needed, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed and then multiply it by the number of beds. 

The volume of one raised bed is calculated as length * width * height. 
Volume = 2 feet * 8 feet * 2 feet = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:
Total Volume = 32 cubic feet/bed * 10 beds = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. To find the number of bags needed, we divide the total volume by the volume of one bag:
Number of bags = Total Volume / Volume per bag = 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet/bag = 160 bags.

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:
Total Cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag = 160 bags * $12/bag = $1920.

"To find the total number of cards, we first need to determine the number of green cards. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:

Number of red cards = 15
60% of 15 = 0.6 * 15 = 9
Number of green cards = 15 + 9 = 24

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards:
Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
= 15 + 24
= 39

To find the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards:
Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards

The total weight of hay is 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds.

The total weight of oats is 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds.

The total weight of all the feed is 2 pounds + 48 pounds + 3150 pounds + 1300 pounds = 3400 pounds.

Since the farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, we need to divide the total weight of the feed by the truck's capacity to find the number of trips needed.

3400 pounds / 2250 pounds/trip = 1.51 trips.

Since we can't make a fraction of a trip, the farmer will need to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To find out how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate her earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles separately and then add them together.

Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans of soda per week. Since an aluminum can is worth 2 cents, her weekly earnings from aluminum cans are 3 * 2 = 6 cents.

Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles of water per week. Since a plastic bottle is worth 3 cents, her weekly earnings from plastic bottles are 5 * 3 = 15 cents.

"To find the total number of pencils used, we first need to find the total number of pencils initially available. Since each of the 30 students started with 10 pencils, the total number of pencils is 30 * 10 = 300.

After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used. This means 1/5 * 300 = 60 pencils were used.

The remaining pencils after two months are 300 - 60 = 240.

At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. This means 1/3 * 240 = 80 pencils were left.

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. 

Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt has to eat as 'x'. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, which is x/2. He also gets two extra cookies for cleaning his room. So, the total number of cookies he gets is x/2 + 2.

The problem states that Matt wants to eat five cookies in total. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x/2 + 2 = 5.

To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. First, we subtract 2 from both sides: x/2 = 5 - 2, which simplifies to x/2 = 3.

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction: x = 3 * 2, which simplifies to x = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the combined length of the remoras, we need to convert the length of the shark and the remoras to the same unit. Since the shark's length is given in feet, we'll convert the remoras' length from inches to feet. 

1 foot = 12 inches
6 inches = 6 / 12 = 0.5 feet

There are 2 remoras, each 0.5 feet long, so the combined length of the remoras is 2 * 0.5 = 1 foot.

Now, we need to find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy. 

Combined length of remoras = 1 foot
Length of the shark = 10 feet

Percentage = (Combined length of remoras / Length of the shark) * 100
= (1 / 10) * 100
= 10%

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of students, we need to determine the number of students with desktop computers and then add the number of students without desktop computers.

Since three-fourths of the students have desktop computers, one-fourth do not have desktop computers. We know that 20 students do not have desktop computers, which represents one-fourth of the total number of students.

Let's set up an equation to find the total number of students:

1/4 * Total number of students = 20

To find the total number of students, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4:

Total number of students = 20 * 4
Total number of students = 80

"To find out how long Jason has to spend walking each day, we need to first calculate the total number of minutes he has available to walk in three weeks. 

There are 7 days in a week, so in three weeks, there are 3 * 7 = 21 days. 

Since Jason can walk 4 days a week, the total number of days he can walk in three weeks is 21 * 4 = 84 days.

Now, we need to find out how many minutes he needs to walk each day to break in the shoes in 84 days. 

The total number of minutes he needs to walk is 240 minutes. 

To find out how many minutes he needs to walk each day, we divide the total number of minutes by the total number of days: 240 / 84 = 2.86 minutes.

The final answer is: 2.86"
"To find out how many books each child got, we need to first determine the total number of books Sarah bought. Since each book costs $15 and she spent $300, we can divide the total amount spent by the cost of each book.

Total amount spent = $300
Cost of each book = $15

Total number of books = Total amount spent / Cost of each book
Total number of books = $300 / $15
Total number of books = 20

Since Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, we can divide the total number of books by 4 to find out how many books each child got.

Number of books per child = Total number of books / 4
Number of books per child = 20 / 4
Number of books per child = 5

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we need to first find the total number of kids who are allergic to at least one thing. 

We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find this. The formula is Total = A + B - Both, where A is the number of kids allergic to dairy, B is the number of kids allergic to peanuts, and Both is the number of kids allergic to both.

A = 9 (kids allergic to dairy)
B = 6 (kids allergic to peanuts)
Both = 3 (kids allergic to both)

Total allergic = A + B - Both = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12

Now, to find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we subtract the total number of kids allergic from the total number of kids in the class.

Total kids = 32
Kids not allergic = Total kids - Total allergic = 32 - 12 = 20

"To find the total cost of the trip, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel.

The cost of the plane tickets is $5000 each, and since there are two people, the total cost of the plane tickets is 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

The hotel is 20% more expensive than normal, so the new price is 1.2 * $1500 = $1800 per day. Since they are there for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is the sum of the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel, which is $10,000 + $5400 = $16,400.

The final answer is: $16,400."
"To find out how many tubes of paint Jasper has, we need to determine the number of tubes of blue and yellow paint he has.

Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint. Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, so Jasper has 4 / 2 = 2 tubes of blue paint.

Ben has 3 tubes of yellow paint. Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, so Jasper has 3 * 3 = 9 tubes of yellow paint.

To find the total number of tubes of paint Jasper has, we add the number of blue and yellow tubes: 2 (blue) + 9 (yellow) = 11.

"To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we first need to find the weight of the 2010 penny. 

Since the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can calculate its weight by multiplying the weight of the 1959 penny by 3/4.

Weight of 1959 penny = 48 grains
Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * 48 grains
Weight of 2010 penny = 36 grains

Now, we can find the combined weight of the two pennies by adding their individual weights.

Combined weight = Weight of 1959 penny + Weight of 2010 penny
Combined weight = 48 grains + 36 grains
Combined weight = 84 grains

"To find out how many hours James runs a week, we need to calculate the total distance he runs in a week and then divide it by his speed.

First, let's find the total distance James runs in a week: 
Distance per day = 12 miles
Number of days per week = 5
Total distance per week = Distance per day * Number of days per week
Total distance per week = 12 miles/day * 5 days/week = 60 miles/week

Now, let's find the total time James runs in a week:
Speed = 10 miles/hour
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 60 miles / 10 miles/hour = 6 hours

Therefore, James runs 6 hours a week.

"To determine the total amount of oats needed, we need to calculate the daily consumption of oats by the horses and then multiply it by the number of days.

Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and Uncle Ben feeds his horses twice a day. So, the daily consumption per horse is 5 pounds/meal * 2 meals = 10 pounds/day.

Since Uncle Ben has 4 horses, the total daily consumption is 10 pounds/day * 4 horses = 40 pounds/day.

For 5 days, the total consumption would be 40 pounds/day * 5 days = 200 pounds.

Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats, so the number of bags needed is 200 pounds / 50 pounds/bag = 4 bags.

"To find the cost per individual razor after the discount, we need to calculate the total cost of 2 packs of razors with the sale and coupon applied.

First, let's calculate the cost of 2 packs of razors at the sale price. Since it's buy one get one free, Heather will only pay for 1 pack. The cost of 1 pack is $4.00. 

Now, let's apply the $2.00 coupon to the cost of 1 pack. The new cost is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since Heather buys 2 packs, but only pays for 1 pack at the sale price, the total cost is $2.00.

Now, let's find the total number of razors. 2 packs of razors contain 2 * 4 = 8 razors.

To find the cost per individual razor, we divide the total cost by the total number of razors. The total cost is $2.00, which is equivalent to 200 cents. The cost per individual razor is 200 cents / 8 = 25 cents.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation for each venue and then equate them to find the break-even point.

Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'.

For the first venue, the total cost is the flat fee of $200 plus the cost of food for each guest, which is $5x. So, the total cost for the first venue is:

Cost1 = 200 + 5x

For the second venue, the total cost is the cost per guest, which is $25, multiplied by the number of guests, x. So, the total cost for the second venue is:

Cost2 = 25x

Since we want to find the break-even point, we set the two costs equal to each other:

200 + 5x = 25x

Now, we can solve for x:

200 = 25x - 5x
200 = 20x
x = 200 / 20
x = 10

So, Mark needs 10 guests for the two venues to be equal in cost.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of insects David found as D, the number of insects Bodhi found as B, and the number of insects Lily found as L.

We know that Lily found 7 more than David, so we can write an equation: L = D + 7.

We also know that David found half of what Bodhi found, so we can write another equation: D = B/2.

We are also given that together they collected 43 insects, so the total number of insects is the sum of what each of them found: L + D + B = 43.

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the total equation: (D + 7) + D + B = 43.

Combine like terms: 2D + B + 7 = 43.

Subtract 7 from both sides: 2D + B = 36.

Now, substitute the second equation into this one: 2(D) + B = 36, and since D = B/2, we can substitute D with B/2: 2(B/2) + B = 36.

Simplify the equation: B + B = 36.

Combine like terms: 2B = 36.

Divide both sides by 2: B = 18.

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find out how many David found: D = B/2 = 18/2 = 9.

Finally, we can find out how many Lily found: L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total yards of yarn used, we need to calculate the yards used by Mariah and her grandma separately and then add them together.

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, and there are 364 yards in a skein. To find 1/4 of 364, we multiply 364 by 1/4 (which is the same as dividing by 4).

364 yards / 4 = 91 yards

So, Mariah used 91 yards of yarn.

Mariah's grandma used 1/2 of a skein, which is the same as 2/4. To find 2/4 of 364, we multiply 364 by 2 and then divide by 4.

364 * 2 = 728
728 / 4 = 182 yards

The cost of the green apple gum is half of the grape gum, which is $2 / 2 = $1.

The total cost of the grape and green apple gum is $2 + $1 = $3.

Since Suzie bought four packs of gum in total and two of them were strawberry, the total cost of the strawberry gum is the total cost minus the cost of the grape and green apple gum, which is $7 - $3 = $4.

Since there are two packs of strawberry gum, the cost of each pack is $4 / 2 = $2.

"To find the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to determine which type of wood gives him the most sticks per dollar spent. 

Let's calculate the cost per stick for each type of wood:

For a 2 x 4 piece of wood, Frederick can get 200 sticks for $4. 
Cost per stick = $4 / 200 sticks = $0.02 per stick

For a 2 x 8 piece of wood, Frederick can get 400 sticks for $6.
Cost per stick = $6 / 400 sticks = $0.015 per stick

Since the 2 x 8 piece of wood gives him the most sticks per dollar, we should prioritize buying this type of wood. 

Now, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces of wood Frederick can buy with his $24:

Number of 2 x 8 pieces of wood = $24 / $6 = 4

Since each 2 x 8 piece of wood gives him 400 sticks, the total number of sticks he can make is:

Total sticks = 4 * 400 = 1600

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of cows and sheep at both the farm and the zoo, and then add them together.

The farm has 30 cows. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo. Since the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, we need to find the total number of animals at the farm and the zoo. The farm has 30 cows and 10 sheep, for a total of 30 + 10 = 40 animals. The zoo has 60 cows and 20 sheep, for a total of 60 + 20 = 80 animals.

The total number of animals at the farm and the zoo is 40 + 80 = 120.

"To find out how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we need to determine the number of onions and potatoes she bought first. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can set up an equation.

Let's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as 'x' and the number of potatoes she bought as 'y'. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can write the equation as:

x + y = (1/4) * (12 + 4)

We know that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, so the total number of onions and potatoes she bought is 12 + 4 = 16. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can rewrite the equation as:

x + y = (1/4) * 16

x + y = 4

Since we don't know the individual values of x and y, we can represent the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought as x + y. We can rewrite the equation as:

x + y = 4

However, we know that the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is not 4. We need to find the individual values of x and y. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can set up a proportion:

12/x = 4/y

We can cross-multiply to get:

12y = 4x

We can rewrite the equation as:

3y = x

Now we can substitute this expression for x in the equation x + y = 4:

3y + y = 4

Combine like terms:

4y = 4

Divide both sides by 4:

y = 1

Now that we know y, we can find x:

x = 3y
x = 3(1)
x = 3

So Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato. The total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is:

December has 31 days, and his birthday is on the 19th of July, which is in the month of July. July has 31 days. So, the total number of days Andy has to reach his goal is 31 (December) + 31 (January) + 30 (February) + 31 (March) + 30 (April) + 31 (May) + 31 (June) + 19 (July) = 184 days.

Since Andy wants to lose 30 pounds, and he needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound, the total number of calories he needs to burn is 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories.

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories needed by the number of days: 105,000 / 184 ≈ 571 calories.

The final answer is: 571"
"To find out how much Gerald has left, we need to calculate his total earnings for the week and then subtract the amount he spent.

Gerald works 7 days a week, and he earns $30 per day. So, his total earnings for the week are:

7 days * $30/day = $210

Gerald spent a total of $100. To find out how much he has left, we subtract the amount he spent from his total earnings:

$210 - $100 = $110

Gerald has $110 left."
"To find out how many milliliters of water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total distance she will run. 

Since each lap is 0.25 km and she needs to run 8 laps, we multiply the number of laps by the distance per lap: 
8 laps * 0.25 km/lap = 2 km

Now, we know Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs. To find out the total amount of water she needs, we multiply the total distance by the amount of water per kilometer:
2 km * 60 ml/km = 120 ml

The final answer is: 120"
"To find out how much money Julie had left, we need to calculate the amount she spent on clothes and CDs, and then subtract that from the initial amount.

First, Julie spent 20% of $500 on clothes. 
20% of $500 = 0.20 * $500 = $100

Now, we subtract the amount spent on clothes from the initial amount:
$500 - $100 = $400

Next, Julie spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs.
25% of $400 = 0.25 * $400 = $100

Now, we subtract the amount spent on CDs from the remaining amount:
$400 - $100 = $300

So, Julie had $300 left.

The final answer is: $300"
"To find the cost of the house, we need to set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the cost of the lot as 'x'. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write the equation as x + 3x = 120,000.

Combining like terms, we get 4x = 120,000.

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 4: x = 120,000 / 4 = 30,000.

Since the cost of the house is 3x, we multiply x by 3: 3 * 30,000 = 90,000.

The final answer is: $90,000"
"To find the profit, we first need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

The total cost is the cost of the canvas bags, which is 8 packs * 5 bags per pack * $4 per bag = 8 * 5 * 4 = $160.

The total revenue is the selling price of the bags, which is 8 bags * $8 per bag = 8 * 8 = $64.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $64 - $160 = -$96. However, since profit cannot be negative, it seems there is an error in the problem. Assuming the problem is asking for the profit per bag, we can calculate it as ($8 - $4) per bag, which is $4 per bag. The total profit would be 8 bags * $4 per bag = $32.

However, if we consider the original problem as is, the correct answer would be the total profit for all the bags, which is $32."
"To find the total number of punches Joe threw, we need to calculate the total time of the fight and multiply it by the number of punches he throws per minute.

The fight lasts for 5 rounds of 3 minutes each, so the total time is 5 rounds * 3 minutes/round = 15 minutes.

Since Joe throws 25 punches per minute, the total number of punches he threw is 15 minutes * 25 punches/minute = 375 punches.

The final answer is: 375"
"To find out how many cookies Kelsie made, we need to first determine how many cookies Josh made. Since Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, and Suzanne made 36 cookies, we can calculate Josh's cookies as follows:

Josh's cookies = Suzanne's cookies / 4
Josh's cookies = 36 / 4
Josh's cookies = 9

Now that we know Josh made 9 cookies, we can find out how many Kelsie made. Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh, so we can calculate Kelsie's cookies as follows:

Kelsie's cookies = 2 * Josh's cookies
Kelsie's cookies = 2 * 9
Kelsie's cookies = 18

The final answer is: 18"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Ali has: 
   Ali has 4 $10 bills and 6 $20 bills. 
   Total money from $10 bills = 4 * $10 = $40
   Total money from $20 bills = 6 * $20 = $120
   Total money = $40 + $120 = $160

2. Ali gives his sister half of the total money:
   Half of the total money = $160 / 2 = $80
   Money left after giving his sister half = $160 - $80 = $80

3. Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining money to buy dinner:
   3/5 of the remaining money = (3/5) * $80 = $48
   Money left after buying dinner = $80 - $48 = $32

The final answer is: $32"
"To solve this problem, we need to first convert the time it takes Rob to shingle a house into minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, Rob takes 2 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 120 minutes.

We are told that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time it takes Rob. Double the time it takes Rob is 2 * 120 minutes = 240 minutes. 

Adding 40 minutes to this gives us the time it takes Royce: 240 minutes + 40 minutes = 280 minutes.

The final answer is: 280"
"To determine the total number of skeins of wool needed, we need to calculate the total number of skeins required for each item and then add them together.

For each child, Martha needs:
- 2 skeins for a hat
- 4 skeins for a scarf
- 12 skeins for a sweater
- 1 skein for a pair of mittens
- 2 skeins for a pair of socks

Total skeins per child: 2 + 4 + 12 + 1 + 2 = 19 skeins

Since there are 3 children, we multiply the total skeins per child by 3:
19 skeins/child * 3 children = 57 skeins

Therefore, Martha will need to buy 57 skeins of wool.

The final answer is: 57"
"To find out how many math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday, we need to calculate the total number of problems he completed and subtract that from the initial total of 100.

On Monday, Chris completed 12 problems. 
On Tuesday, he completed 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, which is 3 * 12 = 36 problems.
So, in total, Chris completed 12 + 36 = 48 problems on Monday and Tuesday.

The remaining problems after Monday and Tuesday are 100 - 48 = 52.

On Wednesday, Chris completed one-quarter of the remaining problems, which is 52 / 4 = 13 problems.

So, the total number of problems Chris completed by Wednesday is 48 + 13 = 61.

To find out how many problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday, we subtract the total problems completed from the initial total: 100 - 61 = 39.

"To find the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour, we need to calculate the individual rates of each person and then add them together.

Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Bobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony, so Bobby can pick 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.

Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy can pick 2 * 5 = 10 quarts per hour.

Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy, so Ricky can pick 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

Now, let's add the individual rates together to find the total number of quarts of strawberries that they can pick per hour:

6 (Tony) + 5 (Bobby) + 10 (Kathy) + 8 (Ricky) = 29

"To find out how many loaves of bread the bakers had left, we need to subtract the number of loaves sold and returned from the total number of loaves baked.

First, let's calculate the total number of loaves sold: 
93 (morning) + 39 (afternoon) = 132 loaves sold

Now, let's add the number of loaves returned by the grocery store: 
132 (sold) + 6 (returned) = 138 loaves

Now, let's subtract the total number of loaves sold and returned from the initial number of loaves baked: 
200 (initial) - 138 (sold and returned) = 62 loaves

The bakers had 62 loaves of bread left."
"To find the number of rows of red tulips, we divide the total number of red tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row: 36 / 6 = 6 rows.

To find the number of rows of blue tulips, we divide the total number of blue tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row: 24 / 8 = 3 rows.

Since the question asks for the total number of rows, we add the number of rows of red tulips and blue tulips: 6 + 3 = 9.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to first determine how many cups of raisins she has available for the oatmeal cookies. 

Since she divides the raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, we can divide the total number of cups of raisins by 3. 

Total cups of raisins = 27
Cups of raisins for oatmeal cookies = Total cups of raisins / 3
Cups of raisins for oatmeal cookies = 27 / 3
Cups of raisins for oatmeal cookies = 9

Now, we need to find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make with 9 cups of raisins. Each batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins. 

Number of batches = Cups of raisins for oatmeal cookies / Cups of raisins per batch
Number of batches = 9 / (3/4)
To divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal.
Number of batches = 9 * (4/3)
Number of batches = 12

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we first need to calculate her daily and weekly electric consumption before and after adding the new device.

Before adding the new device, Ada's daily electric consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. Since there are 24 hours in a day, her daily consumption is 12 * 24 = 288 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per day.

After adding the new device, her daily electric consumption will be 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour. So, her daily consumption will be 14 * 24 = 336 kWh per day.

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7. 

Before adding the new device, Ada's weekly consumption is 288 * 7 = 2016 kWh.
After adding the new device, her weekly consumption is 336 * 7 = 2352 kWh.

The cost of electricity is $1.50 per kWh. So, the weekly cost before adding the new device is 2016 * $1.50 = $3024.
The weekly cost after adding the new device is 2352 * $1.50 = $3528.

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is $3528 - $3024 = $504.

The final answer is: $504"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how long it would take one person to paint a whole house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, it would take them 10 days to paint a whole house (since it would take twice as long to paint the entire house).

Next, we need to calculate how many hours it would take for one person to paint a whole house. There are 24 hours in a day, so 10 days would be 10 x 24 = 240 hours.

Now, we need to determine how long it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house. If one person can paint a whole house in 240 hours, 5 people can paint a whole house in 240 / 5 = 48 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many chairs Ophelia and Jenna have. 

Since Ophelia has 20 sofas and she has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, we can set up an equation to find the number of chairs Ophelia has. Let's denote the number of chairs Ophelia has as 'x'. Then, the number of sofas she has is x - 2. We know that the number of sofas Ophelia has is 20, so we can write the equation as x - 2 = 20. Solving for x, we get x = 22.

Now that we know Ophelia has 22 chairs, we can find out how many chairs Jenna has. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.

Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, we can find the number of sofas Jenna has by subtracting 2 from the number of chairs she has. So, Jenna has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Now, we can find the total number of sofas and chairs they have by adding the number of sofas and chairs Ophelia and Jenna have. The total number of sofas is 20 (Ophelia's sofas) + 64 (Jenna's sofas) = 84. The total number of chairs is 22 (Ophelia's chairs) + 66 (Jenna's chairs) = 88.

The total number of sofas and chairs is 84 + 88 = 172.

"To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought, we first need to determine the cost of the headphone set. 

Let's subtract the cost of the CD from the total amount Tom paid: $48 - $4 = $44. 

This is the cost of the headphone set. 

Now, we can find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with the money he saved by not buying the headphone set. 

$44 / $4 = 11 CDs. 

Since Tom already bought 1 CD, we subtract 1 from the total number of CDs he could have bought: 11 - 1 = 10.

- 5 hours per week for 2 weeks: 5 * 2 = 10 hours
- 6 hours in 1 week: 6 * 1 = 6 hours

Now, let's add up the total hours: 24 + 10 + 6 = 40 hours

The total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is 40."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off. So, the number of people left on the bus is:
48 - 8 = 40

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (which is 8) get into the bus. So, 5 * 8 = 40 people get in. Now, the total number of people on the bus is:
40 (remaining) + 40 (new passengers) = 80

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off. So, the number of people left on the bus is:
80 - 21 = 59

Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on. Since 21 got off, 3 times fewer would be 21 / 3 = 7. So, 7 passengers get in. Now, the total number of people on the bus is:
59 (remaining) + 7 (new passengers) = 66

The final number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop is 66."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, so his current age is 27 - 5 = 22 years.
2. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. 
   Jame's age in 8 years will be 22 + 8 = 30 years.
   Twice Jame's age in 8 years will be 2 * 30 = 60 years.
   So, Jame's cousin's age in 8 years will be 60 - 5 = 55 years.
3. Since Jame's cousin will be 55 in 8 years, his current age is 55 - 8 = 47 years.

Now, let's find the difference in their current ages: 
Current age of Jame = 22 years
Current age of his cousin = 47 years
Age difference = 47 - 22 = 25 years

"To find the cost of one monitor, we first need to determine the cost of the printer. Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, and the computer cost $1,100, the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700.

The total cost of the computer and the printer is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800. 

Since Errol bought 2 monitors, the cost of the two monitors is $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.

To find the cost of one monitor, we divide the total cost of the two monitors by 2: $600 / 2 = $300.

The final answer is: $300"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many shells the boys brought in total. Since there are 10 boys (half of 20 kids) and each boy brought 60 shells, the total number of shells brought by the boys is 10 * 60 = 600.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 600 + 4 * 60 shells. 

First, we calculate 4 times the number of shells brought by the boys: 4 * 60 = 240.

Then, we add this to the number of shells brought by the boys: 600 + 240 = 840.

Since there are 10 girls (half of 20 kids), we need to find out how many shells each girl brought. To do this, we divide the total number of shells brought by the girls by the number of girls: 840 / 10 = 84.

The final answer is: 84"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume the number of candies George had initially is 'x'. Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, Nick had 2x candies initially.

George ate 5 candies, so the number of candies George has left is x - 5. We are given that George has 3 candies left, so we can set up the equation:

x - 5 = 3

To solve for x, we add 5 to both sides of the equation:

x = 3 + 5
x = 8

Now that we know George had 8 candies initially, we can find out how many candies Nick had initially. Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, Nick had 2x candies:

2x = 2 * 8
2x = 16

So, Nick has 16 candies."
"To find Anne's age, we first need to find Alyana's age. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, Alyana's age is 10 - 4 = 6 years.

The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 * 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add the thickness of all four books together:
31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188

"To find out how many vlogs Emma needs to make to complete 72 vlogs per month, we need to subtract the total number of vlogs she has already made from the target number of vlogs.

Emma made 18 vlogs in the first week, 21 vlogs in the second week, and 15 vlogs in the third week. 

Total vlogs made = 18 + 21 + 15 = 54

Since Emma's target is 72 vlogs per month, we subtract the total vlogs made from the target:

72 (target) - 54 (total vlogs made) = 18

Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to complete 72 vlogs per month.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, $18 is shared among 3 boys. This means each boy gets $18 / 3 = $6.

The eldest boy added $5 to his share, so he now has $6 + $5 = $11.

The following day, he added another $10, so he now has $11 + $10 = $21.

Then, he spent $8, so he has $21 - $8 = $13 left.

After saving some more, he tripled the amount he had left after spending the $8. This means he now has 3 * $13 = $39.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much Elvis needs to save in the first half of the month. 

Let's assume the number of days in the first half of April is x. Since April has 30 days, the number of days in the second half will also be 30 - x.

Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half as in the first half. Let's denote the amount he saves in the first half as y. Then, the amount he saves in the second half will be 2y.

The total amount Elvis needs to save in the month is $1125. So, the sum of the amounts he saves in the first and second half should be equal to $1125.

We can write the equation as: xy + 2y(30 - x) = 1125

Simplifying the equation, we get: xy + 60y - 2xy = 1125
Combine like terms: -xy + 60y = 1125
Factor out y: y(-x + 60) = 1125
Divide both sides by (-x + 60): y = 1125 / (-x + 60)

However, we don't know the value of x yet. We know that the total number of days in April is 30, so x + (30 - x) = 30. This means x = 15.

Now we can substitute x = 15 into the equation y = 1125 / (-x + 60) to find the amount Elvis saves in the first half: y = 1125 / (60 - 15) = 1125 / 45 = 25.

Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half as in the first half, the amount he saves in the second half will be 2y = 2 * 25 = 50.

"To solve this problem, let's use algebra. Let's say Brad gets x dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x dollars.

We know that the total amount of money they have is $100, and they are dividing it between them. So, the sum of the money Jeff and Brad get should be equal to $100.

We can write this as an equation: x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms: 5x = 100

Now, divide both sides by 5: x = 20

Since x represents the amount Brad gets, and Jeff gets 4 times as much, Jeff gets 4x = 4(20) = 80 dollars.

The final answer is: $80"
"To find the total miles Jeff walks in a week, we need to calculate the total miles he walks in a day and then multiply it by the number of days he works in a week.

Since Jeff walks to work and back each day, the distance he walks in a day is 2 times the distance to work, which is 2 * 3 miles = 6 miles.

Now, we multiply the daily miles by the number of days he works in a week: 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week.

"To find the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to break down the process step by step.

1. Elise writes the alphabet in full twice, which means she writes 26 letters each time. So, in total, she writes 26 * 2 = 52 letters.

2. Then, she writes half of the alphabet once. Half of the alphabet is 26 / 2 = 13 letters.

3. So, in total, she has written 52 + 13 = 65 letters so far.

4. Finally, she re-writes everything she has already written. This means she re-writes 65 letters.

5. To find the total number of letters Elise has written, we add the letters she wrote initially (52) to the letters she wrote in the second step (13) and the letters she re-wrote (65). 

Total letters = 52 + 13 + 65 = 130

In the first round, 3 families are notified directly by Ali. 

In the second round, each of the 3 families notifies 3 other families, resulting in 3 * 3 = 9 new families notified. 

In the third round, each of the 9 families notifies 3 other families, resulting in 9 * 3 = 27 new families notified.

In the fourth round, each of the 27 families notifies 3 other families, resulting in 27 * 3 = 81 new families notified.

The total number of families notified in the fourth round is 81."
"To find Mark's initial weight, we need to calculate the total weight he lost and then add that to his final weight.

Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, so the total weight he lost is:
10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds

Since Mark's final weight is 70 pounds, we can find his initial weight by adding the weight he lost to his final weight:
Initial weight = Final weight + Weight lost
Initial weight = 70 pounds + 30 pounds
Initial weight = 100 pounds

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of toys in the larger play set that Jonathan wants. Since James's play set has 80 toys and Jonathan wants a play set five times larger, we can multiply 80 by 5.

80 * 5 = 400

This means Jonathan wants a play set with 400 toys. Since he needs 2 more toys than he already has to reach this number, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

x + 2 = 400

Where x is the number of toys Jonathan currently has. To solve for x, we can subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

x = 400 - 2
x = 398

So, Jonathan currently has 398 toys.

Cost of 2 pens: 2 * $0.25 = $0.50
Cost of 1 calculator: $12
Cost of 1 geometry set: $10
Total cost before discount: $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30

Now, we need to apply the 10% discount. 
Discount amount: 10% of $30 = 0.10 * $30 = $3
Total cost after discount: $30 - $3 = $27

"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we need to calculate the commission for the first $1000 and the additional commission for the sales above $1000.

Commission for the first $1000: 30% of $1000 = 0.3 * $1000 = $300

Commission for the sales above $1000: $2500 - $1000 = $1500
Additional commission: 10% of $1500 = 0.1 * $1500 = $150

Total commission: $300 + $150 = $450

Therefore, Antonella earned $450."
"To determine how many additional bottles of water Bill needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles he already has and the total number of bottles he needs.

Bill started with 2 cases of water, each containing 24 bottles. So, the total number of bottles he has is 2 * 24 = 48 bottles.

Since Bill wants to have 2 bottles of water for each of his 70 guests, the total number of bottles he needs is 70 * 2 = 140 bottles.

To find out how many additional bottles he needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles he needs: 140 - 48 = 92 bottles.

Therefore, Bill needs to buy 92 additional bottles of water.

The final answer is: 92"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. 

When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as in cold water. Since it takes Ray 16 minutes to swim a mile in cold water, twice that time is 2 * 16 = 32 minutes. Adding 2 minutes to that gives us 32 + 2 = 34 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water. 

In cold water, it takes Ray 16 minutes to swim a mile, so for 3 miles it would be 3 * 16 = 48 minutes.

In warm water, it takes Ray 34 minutes to swim a mile, so for 3 miles it would be 3 * 34 = 102 minutes.

The difference in time between swimming 3 miles in warm water and cold water is 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

"To find out how many cups Juan needs to reduce, we first need to determine how many cups he currently drinks. Since Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, and Octavia drinks half the daily recommended amount, we need to find the daily recommended amount first.

Let's assume the daily recommended amount is x cups. Since Octavia drinks half of this, she drinks x/2 cups. Since Juan drinks 10 times the amount Octavia drinks, Juan drinks 10 * (x/2) = 5x cups.

We are given that the daily recommended amount is 4 cups. So, x = 4. 

Now, we can find out how many cups Juan currently drinks: 5x = 5 * 4 = 20 cups.

Since Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups, we need to find the difference between his current intake and the recommended intake: 20 - 4 = 16 cups.

Therefore, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups.

"To find the average weight of the 3 friends, we need to first find their individual weights. 

Mark's weight is given as 150 pounds. 
Susan's weight is 20 pounds less than Mark's, so Susan's weight is 150 - 20 = 130 pounds. 
Bob's weight is twice as much as Susan's, so Bob's weight is 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, we need to find the average weight of the 3 friends. To do this, we add their weights and divide by 3. 
Average weight = (Mark's weight + Susan's weight + Bob's weight) / 3 
Average weight = (150 + 130 + 260) / 3 
Average weight = 540 / 3 
Average weight = 180

"To find out how many packs of candles James needs to buy, we first need to determine the total number of candles required. Since one son is 12 and the other is 4 years younger, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Typically, birthday candles are used in the same number as the person's age. So, James needs 12 candles for the older son and 8 candles for the younger son, making a total of 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we need to find out how many packs James needs to buy. To do this, we divide the total number of candles needed (20) by the number of candles in a pack (5). 

20 / 5 = 4

So, James needs to buy 4 packs of candles. 

The cost of 4 packs of candles is 4 * $3 = $12.

"To find out how many pages Judy read in the first week, we need to calculate the total minutes she read in the first week and then convert that to pages. 

In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night. Since there are 7 nights in a week, she read for a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes in the first week.

Given that she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we can find out how many pages she read in 105 minutes. First, let's find out how many 1.5-minute intervals are in 105 minutes. We can do this by dividing 105 by 1.5, which equals 70. 

Now, we know that she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes. Since there are 70 intervals of 1.5 minutes in 105 minutes, she can read 70 * 2 = 140 pages in the first week.

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages.

To find the total number of pages she read in two weeks, we add the pages read in the first week and the second week: 140 + 100 = 240.

The final answer is: 240"

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let's denote Shiloh's nephew's current age as 'x'. 

In 7 years, Shiloh will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old. 

In 7 years, his nephew will be x + 7 years old. 

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, we can set up the equation: 51 = 3(x + 7).

Now, let's solve for x. 

51 = 3x + 21

Subtract 21 from both sides: 
30 = 3x

Divide both sides by 3: 
x = 10

So, Shiloh's nephew is 10 years old today.

"To find the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we need to calculate the amount for each set of teeth and add them together.

For the first tooth, the tooth fairy left $5.00.

For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy left $1.00 each, so the total is 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.

For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy left half the amount of the previous three teeth, which is $1.00 / 2 = $0.50 per tooth. So, the total for the last two teeth is 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up the amounts: $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"To find the total number of goals scored by the three teenagers, we need to find the number of goals scored by Mark and Anna, and then add them to Richie's goals.

Let's start by finding the number of goals scored by Mark. We know that Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, and Richie scored 80 goals. So, we can set up the equation:

Richie's goals = Mark's goals + 20
80 = Mark's goals + 20

To find Mark's goals, we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

Mark's goals = 80 - 20
Mark's goals = 60

Now, we know that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna. We can set up another equation:

Richie's goals = Anna's goals + 45
80 = Anna's goals + 45

To find Anna's goals, we subtract 45 from both sides of the equation:

Anna's goals = 80 - 45
Anna's goals = 35

Now that we have the number of goals scored by each teenager, we can find the total number of goals scored by adding their individual goals:

Total goals = Richie's goals + Mark's goals + Anna's goals
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35
Total goals = 175

The final answer is: 175"
"To find out how much more money Mitchell made than Liam, we need to first calculate the total amount of money each of them made.

Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 apiece, so we multiply the number of lemonades by the price per lemonade: 21 * 4 = 84.

Now, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings to find the difference: 84 - 63 = 21.

The final answer is: $21"
"To find the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate how much money he has left after buying the wooden action figures and then determine how many plastic action figures he can buy with the remaining money.

Peter spent $5 each day for 4 days (Sunday through Wednesday) on wooden action figures. So, the total amount spent on wooden action figures is 4 * $5 = $20.

Peter initially had $70. After spending $20 on wooden action figures, he has $70 - $20 = $50 left.

For the rest of the week (Thursday through Saturday), Peter will buy plastic action figures, which cost $2 each. Since there are 3 days left in the week, he can buy 3 * $2 = $6 worth of plastic action figures.

However, Peter only has $50 left, and he can only spend $6 on plastic action figures. This means he will not be able to buy any plastic action figures with the remaining money.

So, Peter will have 4 wooden action figures (1 for each of the 4 days he spent money on them) and 0 plastic action figures.

The total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is 4 + 0 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"

"To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we first need to calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week and then per month.

The total number of roses ordered per week is 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered per month is 65 * 4 = 260 roses.

Ford grows 40 roses every week, so the total number of roses he grows per month is 40 * 4 = 160 roses.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the total number of roses he grows per month from the total number of roses ordered per month: 260 - 160 = 100 roses.

There are 12 months in a year, so in 2 years, there are 2 x 12 = 24 months.

Katina removes $100 from the account every month, so the total amount removed in 24 months is 24 x $100 = $2400.

Now, we subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount in the account: $3000 - $2400 = $600.

So, after 2 years, Katina will have $600 remaining in her account.

"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost.

Total revenue = Number of sandwiches sold * Price per sandwich
Total revenue = 10 sandwiches * $7.00/sandwich = $70.00

Now, let's calculate the cost of bread and cheese per sandwich:
Cost of bread per loaf = $3.00
Number of sandwiches per loaf = 10
Cost of bread per sandwich = $3.00 / 10 sandwiches = $0.30/sandwich

Cost of cheese and condiments per 10 sandwiches = $30.00
Cost of cheese and condiments per sandwich = $30.00 / 10 sandwiches = $3.00/sandwich

Total cost per sandwich = Cost of bread per sandwich + Cost of cheese and condiments per sandwich
Total cost per sandwich = $0.30 + $3.00 = $3.30

Now, let's calculate the total cost for 10 sandwiches:
Total cost = Total cost per sandwich * Number of sandwiches
Total cost = $3.30/sandwich * 10 sandwiches = $33.00

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00

The final answer is: $37.00"
"To find out how much money Kate can make, we need to determine the total number of muffin crayons she can make and then multiply that by the price of each muffin crayon.

3 boxes * 64 crayons/box = 192 crayon pieces

Since Kate melts 8 small pieces of crayons together to make one muffin crayon, we divide the total number of crayon pieces by 8 to find the total number of muffin crayons:

192 crayon pieces / 8 pieces/muffin crayon = 24 muffin crayons

Now, we multiply the number of muffin crayons by the price of each muffin crayon to find the total amount of money Kate can make:

24 muffin crayons * $1.50/muffin crayon = $36

"To find the percentage by which the oven is off, we need to calculate the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature, and then divide it by the set temperature.

The difference between the actual and set temperature is 468 - 450 = 18 degrees.

The percentage by which the oven is off is (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%.

Since the oven is off by 4% for any recipe, we need to find the temperature that is 4% higher than 520 degrees.

First, we calculate 4% of 520: 0.04 * 520 = 20.8.

Then, we add this value to 520: 520 + 20.8 = 540.8.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume the number of blue jelly beans is x. 

Since there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans, the number of red jelly beans is 0.99x.

Since there are 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans, the number of green jelly beans is 1.01x.

The total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can set up the equation:

x + 0.99x + 1.01x = 4500

Combine like terms:

2.99x = 4500

Divide both sides by 2.99:

x = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

Red jelly beans: 0.99x = 0.99(1500) = 1485
Green jelly beans: 1.01x = 1.01(1500) = 1515

To find the difference between the number of green and red jelly beans, subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

Weight change in 5 weeks = 1.75 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 8.75 pounds

Difference in weight = Weight change in 5 weeks (donuts) - Weight change in 5 weeks (Cheerios)
= 8.75 pounds - (-6.25 pounds)
= 8.75 pounds + 6.25 pounds
= 15 pounds

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total number of people attending, we need to calculate the number of people invited via email, the number of friends Alex's friends will bring, and the number of Alex's friends and their spouses.

First, let's calculate the number of people invited via email. Each of the 100 people invited will bring 2 friends, so the total number of people invited via email is 100 + (100 * 2) = 300.

Next, Alex calls 10 friends and 8 of them will bring their spouses, so the total number of Alex's friends and their spouses is 10 + 8 = 18.

Now, we add the number of people invited via email and the number of Alex's friends and their spouses to get the total number of people attending. 

Total number of people = 300 + 18 = 318

However, we also need to include Alex herself, so the total number of people attending is 318 + 1 = 319.

Therefore, Alex will need 319 seats.

The final answer is: 319"
"To find the weight of the Mastiff, we need to start from the Papillon's weight. The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund. Since the Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, the Dachshund's weight is 2 * 10 pounds = 20 pounds. 

The Papillon's weight is one-fourth of the Dachshund's weight, so the Papillon's weight is 20 pounds / 4 = 5 pounds.

The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff's weight is 44 * 5 pounds = 220 pounds.

The final answer is: 220"
"To find the total cost of the boots on eBay, we need to add the cost of the boots and the shipping cost. The shipping cost on eBay is twice as much as on Amazon, which is $4. So, the shipping cost on eBay is 2 * $4 = $8.

The total cost of the boots on eBay is $13 (boots) + $8 (shipping) = $21.

The total cost of the boots on Amazon is $16 (boots) + $4 (shipping) = $20.

To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we subtract the cost on Amazon from the cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many days it will take for the beanstalk to reach or exceed 20 feet. 

Since the beanstalk doubles in height every day and starts at 4 feet, we can calculate its height for each day as follows:

Day 1: 4 feet
Day 2: 4 * 2 = 8 feet
Day 3: 8 * 2 = 16 feet
Day 4: 16 * 2 = 32 feet

As we can see, on the 4th day, the beanstalk will be taller than Mark's window, which is 20 feet off the ground.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to first find out how many grams of protein he gets per day. 

Since a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein, we can find the protein content per gram of mushroom by dividing the protein content by the weight of the mushroom: 3 grams / 100 grams = 0.03 grams of protein per gram of mushroom.

Now, we know John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day. To find out how many grams of protein he gets per day, we multiply the weight of mushrooms he eats by the protein content per gram of mushroom: 200 grams * 0.03 grams/gram = 6 grams of protein per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7 to find the weekly protein intake: 6 grams/day * 7 days/week = 42 grams of protein per week.

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's break down the information given. If Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can represent his current age as 'x'. 

Five years ago, Jerry's age would be 'x - 5'. According to the given information, Jerry's current age is twice his age 5 years ago, so we can write the equation as:

x = 2(x - 5)

Expanding the equation, we get:
x = 2x - 10

Subtracting '2x' from both sides of the equation gives us:
-x = -10

Dividing both sides by -1, we get:
x = 10

So, Jerry's current age is 10 years. 

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
10 + 3 = 13

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years. 

The final answer is: 13"
"To find out how many hours George needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the dental work. 

The base price for 2 implants is 2 * $2000 = $4000. 
For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain, which costs an extra $500. So, the total cost for the implants with the crown is $4000 + $500 = $4500. 
However, since he's getting two implants, he will need two crowns, so the total cost for the crowns is 2 * $500 = $1000. 
The total cost for the dental work is $4500 + $1000 = $5500. 

George has already put down a deposit of $600. So, he still needs to pay $5500 - $600 = $4900.

Since he makes $15 per hour at work, to find out how many hours he needs to work, we divide the remaining amount he needs to pay ($4900) by his hourly wage ($15). 

$4900 / $15 = 326.67 hours.

The final answer is: 327"
"Let's denote the smallest angle as x. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is 2x. The other angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is 3x.

We know that the sum of the three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:

One angle is 2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees
The other angle is 3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has in cents. 

First, let's convert the coins to cents:
- 8 quarters = 8 * 25 = 200 cents
- 6 dimes = 6 * 10 = 60 cents
- 14 nickels = 14 * 5 = 70 cents
- 15 pennies = 15 * 1 = 15 cents

Now, let's add up the total amount of money Colby has:
200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs a nickel (5 cents), we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball:
345 / 5 = 69

Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

69"
"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of pet and then add them together.

Dogs have 4 legs each, so 5 dogs have 5 x 4 = 20 legs.
Cats have 4 legs each, so 2 cats have 2 x 4 = 8 legs.
Birds have 2 legs each, so 10 birds have 10 x 2 = 20 legs.

Now, let's add the total number of legs together: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the weight Jamaal uses after increasing the 8-pound weight by 50%, we first need to calculate 50% of 8 pounds. 

50% of 8 pounds is 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds. 

Now, we add this to the original weight: 8 pounds + 4 pounds = 12 pounds. 

However, Jamaal finds this weight too heavy, so he uses a weight two pounds lighter than this. 

The weight he now uses is 12 pounds - 2 pounds = 10 pounds.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into three parts: the first year, the second year, and the third year.

In the first year, Steve gets 5 games as a birthday gift and 5 games as Christmas gifts, for a total of 10 games. He also buys 1 game per month for 12 months, which is 12 games. So, in total, he has 10 + 12 = 22 games at the end of the first year.

In the second year, Steve gets 5 games as a birthday gift and 5 games as Christmas gifts, for a total of 10 games. He also buys 2 games per month for 12 months, which is 24 games. So, in total, he has 10 + 24 = 34 games at the end of the second year.

In the third year, Steve gets 5 games as a birthday gift and 5 games as Christmas gifts, for a total of 10 games. He also buys 4 games per month for 12 months, which is 48 games. So, in total, he has 10 + 48 = 58 games at the end of the third year.

Now, let's add up the total number of games Steve has at the end of the third year: 22 (from the first year) + 34 (from the second year) + 58 (from the third year) = 114 games.

The final answer is: 114"
"To find the rate at which the plane travels, we need to divide the distance it traveled by the time it took. 

Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Rate = 400 miles per hour

Now, we need to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this rate.

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

Since the question asks for the additional hours, we need to subtract the initial time from the total time.

Additional hours = Total time - Initial time
Additional hours = 5 hours - 3 hours
Additional hours = 2 hours

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much Marissa makes in an hour, we need to first find out how much Ruiz makes in an hour. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, we divide 120 by 2 to get the amount made in 1 hour.

Ruiz's hourly production = 120 / 2 = 60 pounds per hour.

Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in 2 hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, we multiply 120 by 3/4 to find Marissa's hourly production.

Marissa's hourly production = (3/4) * 120 = 90 pounds per hour.

Now, we know that both Ruiz and Marissa work for 12 hours a day. To find the total amount of chocolate they make together, we add their individual hourly productions and multiply by the number of hours they work.

Ruiz's total production = 60 * 12 = 720 pounds
Marissa's total production = 90 * 12 = 1080 pounds

Total production = Ruiz's production + Marissa's production = 720 + 1080 = 1800 pounds

"To find the total amount of money Patrick earned, we need to calculate the total number of cups sold and the total revenue from each period, then add them together.

In the first four hours, Patrick sold 15 cups per hour at $0.50 per cup. 
Total cups sold in the first four hours = 15 cups/hour * 4 hours = 60 cups
Total revenue in the first four hours = 60 cups * $0.50/cup = $30

In the next two hours, Patrick sold 10 cups per hour at $0.60 per cup.
Total cups sold in the next two hours = 10 cups/hour * 2 hours = 20 cups
Total revenue in the next two hours = 20 cups * $0.60/cup = $12

Total revenue from selling lemonade for 6 hours = Total revenue in the first four hours + Total revenue in the next two hours

"To find out how much money Joe will have left after the purchase, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he wants to buy and then subtract that from the initial amount of money he has.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount. The shirt costs $25 and the shorts cost $35, so the total cost is $25 + $35 = $60.

Since there is a 30% off sale, we need to calculate the discount amount. To do this, we multiply the total cost by the discount percentage (30% or 0.3). The discount amount is $60 * 0.3 = $18.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final cost of the items. $60 - $18 = $42.

Since sales tax is included, we don't need to add any additional tax to the final cost. Joe will pay $42 for the items.

To find out how much money Joe will have left, we subtract the final cost from the initial amount of money he has. $50 - $42 = $8.

"To find the total amount of butter needed, we first need to calculate the total number of croissants Juan wants to make in a week. Since he wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day, and there are 7 days in a week, we multiply 4 dozen by 7.

4 dozen/day * 7 days = 28 dozen

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, we can convert 28 dozen to individual croissants:

28 dozen * 12 croissants/dozen = 336 croissants

Now, we know it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. To find the total amount of butter needed for 336 croissants, we need to multiply the number of croissants by the amount of butter per dozen:

336 croissants * (1/4 pound/croissants) = 336 * 0.25 = 84 pounds

"To find out how much James made, we need to calculate the profit from selling the cars, then apply his commission.

First, let's find the total cost of the cars: 10 cars * $25,000 = $250,000.

The company paid 30% of the cost to acquire the cars, so the amount they paid is 0.3 * $250,000 = $75,000.

The profit from selling the cars is the selling price minus the cost: $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.

James gets a 10% commission on the profit, so his commission is 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

Therefore, James made $17,500.

The final answer is: $17,500."
"To find the number of men who can stay upright, we first need to find the total number of riders who can stay upright. 

Given that 25% of the riders can stay upright, and there are 100 riders, we can calculate the number of riders who can stay upright as follows:

25% of 100 = 0.25 * 100 = 25

Now, we know that 60% of these 25 riders are women. To find the number of women, we can calculate:

60% of 25 = 0.6 * 25 = 15

Since the remaining riders who can stay upright are men, we can find the number of men by subtracting the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:

25 - 15 = 10

Therefore, 10 men can stay upright on the wave.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total price for all three jewels, we need to find the prices of the gold and silver jewels first.

Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, and the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond jewel, we can calculate the price of the gold jewel as follows:

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * Price of diamond jewel
= (4/5) * $2000
= $1600

The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold, so we can calculate the price of the silver jewel as follows:

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
= $1600 - $400
= $1200

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

The final answer is: $4800"
"To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to calculate the number of each type of stamp and add them together.

Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.

He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

To find the total number of stamps, we add the number of each type of stamp together: 16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45.

The final answer is: 45"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the relative speed between Bob and Tom. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract Tom's speed from Bob's speed to get the relative speed.

Relative speed = Bob's speed - Tom's speed
Relative speed = 55 mph - 70 mph
Relative speed = -15 mph

However, since speed cannot be negative, we need to take the absolute value of the relative speed.

Relative speed = | -15 mph | = 15 mph

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed to find the time it will take for Tom to catch up with Bob.

Time = Distance / Relative speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many fish Tommy caught, we need to first determine how many fish Darren caught. Since Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish, we can calculate Darren's catch by subtracting 6 from Naomi's total.

Darren's catch = Naomi's catch - 6
Darren's catch = 17 - 6
Darren's catch = 11

Now that we know Darren caught 11 fish, we can find out how many Tommy caught by adding 3 to Darren's total.

Tommy's catch = Darren's catch + 3
Tommy's catch = 11 + 3
Tommy's catch = 14

The final answer is: 14"
"To find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to determine the maximum number of classes he can attend without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Let's assume the cost per class is $10. If Manny attends all 10 classes, the total cost would be 10 classes * $10 per class = $100. However, the total cost of the classes is $60, so he can attend fewer than 10 classes.

Let's calculate the number of classes he can attend for $60:

$60 / $10 per class = 6 classes

Since Manny signed up for 10 classes, he can miss 10 - 6 = 4 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we first need to determine their individual daily production and then multiply it by 7 (the number of days in a week).

Jewel processes 50 customers per day. Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, Julie's daily production is 2 * 50 = 100 customers.

The total daily production for both Julie and Jewel is 50 + 100 = 150 customers.

To find the total weekly production, we multiply the daily production by 7: 150 * 7 = 1050.

The final answer is: 1050"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Paisley ran 4 miles.
2. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so Reggie ran 5 * 4 = 20 miles.
3. Reggie also ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, so we can set up an equation to represent this relationship: Reggie's distance = Lynn's distance + 3.
4. Since we know Reggie ran 20 miles, we can substitute this value into the equation: 20 = Lynn's distance + 3.
5. To find Lynn's distance, we need to isolate the variable (Lynn's distance) by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation: Lynn's distance = 20 - 3.
6. Therefore, Lynn's distance = 17 miles.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges, we need to first find the cost of one apple and one orange.

The cost of 4 apples is $5.20, so the cost of one apple is $5.20 / 4 = $1.30.

The cost of 3 oranges is $3.30, so the cost of one orange is $3.30 / 3 = $1.10.

Now, we can find the cost of 5 apples: 5 apples * $1.30/apple = $6.50.

Next, we can find the cost of 5 oranges: 5 oranges * $1.10/orange = $5.50.

Finally, we can add the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges to find the total cost: $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To find the volume of the hole, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth. 

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Since it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we can multiply the volume by the time it takes to shovel one cubic foot.

Total time = Volume * time per cubic foot
Total time = 72 * 3
Total time = 216 seconds

Therefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add them to the base price.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade costs $7,500.

The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of the leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of the running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the features and the base price:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"To find the total amount Tim will make in a year, we need to calculate his new monthly salary and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's calculate the 5% raise on his monthly salary:
5% of $20,000 = 0.05 * $20,000 = $1,000
New monthly salary = $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000

Next, let's calculate the bonus:
Bonus = half a month's salary = $20,000 / 2 = $10,000

Now, let's add the bonus to the new monthly salary:
New monthly salary + bonus = $21,000 + $10,000 = $31,000

Finally, let's multiply the new monthly salary by 12 to find the total amount Tim will make in a year:
$31,000 * 12 = $372,000

"To find the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley, we need to calculate the distance each of them biked and then add them together.

Alisa biked at 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours. To find the distance she biked, we multiply her speed by the time:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 12 miles/hour x 4.5 hours
Distance = 54 miles

Stanley biked at 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours. To find the distance he biked, we multiply his speed by the time:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour x 2.5 hours
Distance = 25 miles

Now, we add the distances biked by Alisa and Stanley to find the total distance:
Total Distance = Distance biked by Alisa + Distance biked by Stanley
Total Distance = 54 miles + 25 miles
Total Distance = 79 miles

"To find the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay, then add those times together.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil. Bill can dig 4 feet/hour through soil, and he needs to dig 24 feet of soil. 

Time to dig through soil = Total soil depth / Rate of digging through soil
Time to dig through soil = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour
Time to dig through soil = 6 hours

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the clay. Bill can dig half as fast through clay as he can through soil, so his rate of digging through clay is 4 / 2 = 2 feet/hour. He needs to dig 8 feet of clay.

Time to dig through clay = Total clay depth / Rate of digging through clay
Time to dig through clay = 8 feet / 2 feet/hour
Time to dig through clay = 4 hours

Now, we add the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay to find the total time.

Total time = Time to dig through soil + Time to dig through clay
Total time = 6 hours + 4 hours
Total time = 10 hours

"To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost for each day and then subtract the two amounts.

On the first day, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, but she got a $2 discount. The total cost for the first day is:
20 pomegranates * $20 = $400
Discount: $2
Total cost for the first day: $400 - $2 = $398

On the second day, the price per pomegranate is $30, and there's a 10% discount on the total cost. The total cost for the second day is:
20 pomegranates * $30 = $600
Discount: 10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
Total cost for the second day: $600 - $60 = $540

Now, let's find the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days:
Difference = Total cost for the second day - Total cost for the first day
Difference = $540 - $398
Difference = $142

The final answer is: $142"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find the total sales from green hats in the first month. Since the sales from red hats were half the total amount she earned from selling green hats, let's denote the total sales from green hats as G. Then, the sales from red hats, which is half of G, is G/2. We are given that G/2 = $400. 

To find G, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2, which gives us G = 2 * 400 = $800.

Now, we know that the total sales in the first month is the sum of the sales from red and green hats, which is G + G/2. Substituting the value of G, we get 800 + 400 = $1200.

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. So, the sales in the second month are (3/4) * 1200 = $900.

The total amount she made in two months is the sum of the sales in the first and second months, which is 1200 + 900 = $2100.

"To find the total cost of the plane for the first year, we need to calculate the cost of the plane itself, the cost of renting the hanger, and the cost of fuel.

The cost of the plane is $150,000.

The cost of renting the hanger is $5000 per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total cost of renting the hanger for the first year is $5000 * 12 = $60,000.

The cost of fuel is twice the cost of renting the hanger, which is $5000 * 2 = $10,000 per month. The total cost of fuel for the first year is $10,000 * 12 = $120,000.

The total cost of getting and maintaining the plane for the first year is the sum of the cost of the plane, the cost of renting the hanger, and the cost of fuel: $150,000 + $60,000 + $120,000 = $330,000.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the cooking time for pork and beans. 

Given that it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice, and it took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, we can calculate the cooking time for pork as follows:
Pork's cooking time = Rice's cooking time + 20 minutes
Pork's cooking time = 30 minutes + 20 minutes
Pork's cooking time = 50 minutes

Now, we know that beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is:
Combined cooking time = Pork's cooking time + Rice's cooking time
Combined cooking time = 50 minutes + 30 minutes
Combined cooking time = 80 minutes

Now, we can find the cooking time for beans:
Beans' cooking time = Combined cooking time / 2
Beans' cooking time = 80 minutes / 2
Beans' cooking time = 40 minutes

Now, we can find the total cooking time by adding the cooking times of rice, pork, and beans:
Total cooking time = Rice's cooking time + Pork's cooking time + Beans' cooking time
Total cooking time = 30 minutes + 50 minutes + 40 minutes
Total cooking time = 120 minutes

"Let's denote the number of sheep as S and the number of geese as G. Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, we can set up the following equation based on the total number of legs:

4S + 2G = 70

We are also given that the total number of animal heads is 20. Since each sheep and goose has one head, we can set up another equation:

S + G = 20

We can solve this system of equations by multiplying the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of G in both equations the same:

2S + 2G = 40

Now we can subtract this equation from the first equation to eliminate G:

(4S + 2G) - (2S + 2G) = 70 - 40
2S = 30

Divide both sides by 2:

S = 15

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much money Kassidy and Rayna have. 

First, we know Aurelia has $120. Since Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, we can calculate Kassidy's money as follows:
Kassidy's money = 3/4 * Aurelia's money
Kassidy's money = 3/4 * 120
Kassidy's money = 90

Now, we know Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy. So, we can calculate Rayna's money as follows:
Rayna's money = Kassidy's money + 60
Rayna's money = 90 + 60
Rayna's money = 150

Now, we have the money of all three: Aurelia ($120), Kassidy ($90), and Rayna ($150). To find out how much they would have if they decided to add together their money and share equally among them, we need to add their money and divide by 3.

Total money = Aurelia's money + Kassidy's money + Rayna's money
Total money = 120 + 90 + 150
Total money = 360

Now, let's divide the total money by 3 to find out how much each would have:

0.3 * 10 = 3

So, 3 employees oversee the company.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the total amount of dry ingredients needed, we need to calculate the total amount of flour, sugar, and salt required for 16 muffins.

For flour, Svetlana needs 5 tablespoons per muffin, so for 16 muffins, she needs 5 * 16 = 80 tablespoons of flour.

For sugar, Svetlana needs 3 tablespoons per muffin, so for 16 muffins, she needs 3 * 16 = 48 tablespoons of sugar.

For salt, Svetlana needs 0.25 tablespoons per muffin, so for 16 muffins, she needs 0.25 * 16 = 4 tablespoons of salt.

Now, we add up the total amount of dry ingredients: 80 (flour) + 48 (sugar) + 4 (salt) = 132 tablespoons.

The total amount of dry ingredients Svetlana needs to make 16 muffins is 132.

"To find out how much candy each person would have after sharing, we need to first find the total amount of candy they have together. 

Robert had 3 pounds of candy, Cindy had 5 pounds of candy, and Aaron had 4 pounds of candy. 

Total candy = 3 + 5 + 4 = 12 pounds

Since they are sharing the candy equally among themselves, we need to divide the total amount of candy by the number of people. 

Number of people = 3 (Robert, Cindy, and Aaron)

Candy per person = Total candy / Number of people
= 12 / 3
= 4

So, each of them would have 4 pounds of candy after sharing. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"

"To find the number of good days left in the month, we need to first determine the total number of good days recorded by Christina. We know that she had 12 good days in the first 30 days. However, we also know that her first 8 days were good, her second 8 days were bad, and her third 8 days were neutral. This means that the good days in the first 30 days are only the first 8 days.

So, the total number of good days in the first 30 days is 8. 

Now, we are given that the next 3 days were good, neutral, and good. We need to add these 3 days to the total number of good days. 

Total good days = 8 (initial good days) + 3 (additional good days) = 11

However, we are asked to find the number of good days left in the month. Since we are considering the next 3 days as part of the month, we need to subtract these 3 days from the total number of good days.

Good days left in the month = Total good days - 3 = 11 - 3 = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how many books Sally has, we need to work backwards from the information given about Janey. 

Janey has 21 books, and it's stated that she has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. Let's represent the number of books Sally has as 'x'. 

The statement ""Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has"" can be written as an equation: 2x + 3 = 21.

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x' on one side of the equation. 

First, subtract 3 from both sides: 2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Next, divide both sides by 2: x = 18 / 2
x = 9

So, Sally has 9 books.

"To find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches, we need to first convert the initial height from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so we multiply 20 feet by 12 inches per foot.

20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now, we know the bamboo grows 30 inches per day and its current height is 240 inches. To find out how many days it will take to reach 600 inches, we subtract the current height from the target height and divide by the growth rate.

600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Now, we divide the remaining height by the growth rate:

360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. James initially has 4 toys for 4 dogs, so each dog has 1 toy. 
2. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so James needs 8 more toys for these dogs. Now, he has a total of 4 (initial toys) + 8 (new toys) = 12 toys for 12 dogs.
3. When James comes back, there are twice as many more dogs than when he left, which means there are 2 * 8 = 16 more dogs. Since he already had 12 dogs, now he has 12 + 16 = 28 dogs. 
4. Since each dog needs one toy, James needs 28 toys for these 28 dogs. However, he already has 12 toys, so he needs 28 - 12 = 16 more toys.
5. When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs 3 toys. This means he needs 16 - 3 = 13 more toys.

In total, James needs 4 (initial toys) + 8 (new toys) + 16 (additional toys) - 3 (unnecessary toys) = 25 toys.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how much money Skyler invested, we need to calculate the remaining amount after Dylan and Frances' investments.

"To find out how many signatures the sisters need to collect, we first need to determine how many signatures they currently have in total. Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44 signatures. 

Total signatures currently = 20 (Carol's signatures) + 44 (Jennifer's signatures) = 64 signatures

Since they want to reach a total of 100 signatures by the end of the summer, we need to find out how many signatures they still need to collect.

Signatures needed = Total signatures desired - Total signatures currently
= 100 - 64
= 36

The sisters need to collect 36 signatures to reach their goal."
"To find out how much Karen earns in two days, we first need to determine her hourly wage. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns 2 * $10 = $20 per hour.

Next, we need to find out how many hours Karen works in two days. Since she works 3 hours per day, in two days she works 2 * 3 = 6 hours.

Now, we can calculate Karen's total earnings by multiplying her hourly wage by the number of hours she works: $20 * 6 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes, we need to determine the ratio of potatoes to hash browns. 

Given that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, we can calculate the ratio as follows:

6 potatoes / 36 hash browns = 1 potato / 6 hash browns

Now, we can use this ratio to find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes:

96 potatoes * (6 hash browns / 1 potato) = 96 * 6
= 576 hash browns

Therefore, 96 potatoes can make 576 hash browns.

"To find the total weight of the 9 adults, we need to multiply the average weight of an adult by the number of adults. 

Total weight = average weight of an adult * number of adults
Total weight = 80 kg * 9
Total weight = 720 kg

Since the elevator supports a maximum load of 700 kg, we need to find the excess weight by subtracting the maximum load from the total weight.

Excess weight = Total weight - Maximum load
Excess weight = 720 kg - 700 kg
Excess weight = 20 kg

"To find the total number of cookies, we need to determine the number of cookies each person has. 

We know that Katarina has 68 cookies. 

Since Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.

Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so the Cookie Monster has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.

Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

To find the total number of cookies, we add the number of cookies each person has: 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298.

The final answer is: 298"
"To find the original length of the dress, we need to consider the two changes made to the dress. 

First, the dress is extended by 50% of its original length. If we let the original length be 'x', then the extended length is x + 0.5x = 1.5x.

Next, 20cm is added to the bottom of the dress. So, the final length is 1.5x + 20.

We are given that the final length is 140cm. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

1.5x + 20 = 140

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. Subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

1.5x = 120

Now, divide both sides by 1.5:

x = 120 / 1.5
x = 80

The original length of the dress is 80cm.

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes to mow half the lawn in each mode and then add them together.

First, let's find the time it takes to mow half the lawn in turtle mode. Since it takes 1 hour to mow the entire lawn in turtle mode, it will take 0.5 hours to mow half the lawn. We need to convert 0.5 hours to minutes: 0.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 30 minutes.

Next, let's find the time it takes to mow half the lawn in rabbit mode. Since it takes 40 minutes to mow the entire lawn in rabbit mode, it will take 20 minutes to mow half the lawn (40 minutes / 2 = 20 minutes).

Now, we add the time it takes to mow half the lawn in each mode: 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes.

The final answer is: 50"

"Let's denote the age of the younger twin as T, the age of the older twin as T+7, and the age of the triplet as T+7 as well, since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet. 

We have three equations based on the given information: 
1. T + (T+7) + (T+7) = 44 (combined ages of the twins and the triplet)
2. T + (T+7) = T+7 (since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, the triplet's age is T+7)
3. T + (T+7) + (T+7) = 44 (combined ages of the twins and the triplet)

Simplifying equation 1: 
3T + 14 = 44

Subtracting 14 from both sides: 
3T = 30

Dividing both sides by 3: 
T = 10

Now that we know the age of the younger twin (T), we can find the age of the older twin: 
T+7 = 10+7 = 17

"To find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we first need to find the cost of one candy. 

We know that 5 lollipops and 4 candies cost $3.20. Since each lollipop costs $0.40, the total cost of 5 lollipops is 5 * $0.40 = $2. 

Now, we subtract the cost of 5 lollipops from the total cost to find the cost of 4 candies: $3.20 - $2 = $1.20. 

To find the cost of one candy, we divide the total cost of 4 candies by 4: $1.20 / 4 = $0.30 per candy.

Now, we can find the total cost of 10 lollipops: 10 * $0.40 = $4.

The total cost of 10 candies is 10 * $0.30 = $3.

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $4 + $3 = $7.

"To find out how many coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years, we need to calculate their monthly savings and then multiply it by 12 (the number of months in a year) and 10 (the number of years).

Rong saves 20 coins per month. 
Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, which is 2/5 * 20 = 8 coins more than Rong. 
So, Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Now, let's calculate their total savings per year:
Rong's savings per year = 20 * 12 = 240 coins
Neil's savings per year = 28 * 12 = 336 coins

Now, let's calculate their total savings after 10 years:
Rong's total savings = 240 * 10 = 2400 coins
Neil's total savings = 336 * 10 = 3360 coins

The total number of coins they have after 10 years is the sum of their individual savings: 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins.

"To find the total bill, we first need to calculate the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check. 

The cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40. 

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, but we don't know the total bill yet. Let's call the total bill 'x'. The heartworm check is 0.6x.

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check: x = $40 + 0.6x.

To find the total bill, we need to solve for x. Subtract 0.6x from both sides: 0.4x = $40. 

Now, divide both sides by 0.4: x = $100.

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, which is 0.6 * $100 = $60.

The total bill is $100, and John brought $125. To find out how much he leaves with, we subtract the total bill from the amount he brought: $125 - $100 = $25.

"To find out how many chairs Mia needs, we first need to determine the total number of chairs she has. Since there are 8 high chairs and the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs, we can calculate the number of regular chairs by multiplying 8 by 5.

8 high chairs * 5 = 40 regular chairs

Now, we add the number of high chairs and regular chairs to find the total number of chairs.

8 high chairs + 40 regular chairs = 48 chairs

Since there will be 42 adults and 15 babies attending, we need to find the total number of chairs required. Babies will use high chairs, so we add the number of adults and babies.

42 adults + 15 babies = 57 people

Since each person needs a chair, we need 57 chairs. To find out how many more chairs Mia needs, we subtract the total number of chairs she has from the total number of chairs required.

57 chairs required - 48 chairs available = 9 chairs

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many dumplings each male ate and then add the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry.

First, let's find out how many dumplings each male ate. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, and each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32.

Since there are 6 females and each female ate 3 dumplings, the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.

The total number of dumplings eaten is 32 (by males) + 18 (by females) = 50.

Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is equal to the total number of dumplings eaten, which is 50.

"To find the total number of hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we need to first determine how much they need to raise per hour to reach their goal. 

The total amount they need to raise is $6300, and they have already raised $2100 in 3 hours. 

The amount they need to raise in total is $6300 - $2100 = $4200.

Since they need to raise $4200 in total and they have already raised $2100 in 3 hours, we can find the amount they need to raise per hour by dividing the remaining amount by the number of hours they have already worked.

$4200 / 3 hours = $1400 per hour.

Now, we can find the total number of hours they need to fundraise by dividing the total amount they need to raise by the amount they need to raise per hour.

$4200 / $1400 per hour = 3 hours.

However, this is the amount of time they need to raise the remaining $4200. Since they have already worked 3 hours, we need to add this to the remaining time.

Total hours = 3 hours (already worked) + 3 hours (remaining time) = 6 hours.

"To find the total number of quarts made in 48 hours, we need to calculate the production rate of each type of ice cream and then add them together.

The factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours. To find the production rate per hour, we divide 100 quarts by 2 hours:

100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts per hour (chocolate)

The factory makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours. To find the production rate per hour, we divide 50 quarts by 4 hours:

50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts per hour (vanilla)

Now, we need to find the total production rate per hour for both flavors combined:

50 quarts per hour (chocolate) + 12.5 quarts per hour (vanilla) = 62.5 quarts per hour

To find the total number of quarts made in 48 hours, we multiply the total production rate per hour by 48:

62.5 quarts per hour * 48 hours = 3000 quarts

The final answer is: 3000"
"To find Marcus' total bill, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he ordered and then apply the 10% discount.

First, let's calculate the total cost of each item:

- 5 croissants at $3.00 apiece: 5 x $3.00 = $15.00
- 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each: 4 x $2.50 = $10.00
- 3 mini quiches at $4.00 apiece: 3 x $4.00 = $12.00
- 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 apiece: 13 x $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items: $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Since Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him 10% off his purchase, we need to calculate the discount amount: 10% of $50.00 = 0.10 x $50.00 = $5.00

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total cost: $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

The final answer is: $45.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many scoops Erin can buy with her $6.00. Since each scoop costs $1.50, we can divide the total amount of money Erin has by the cost of each scoop.

$6.00 ÷ $1.50 = 4

This means Erin can buy 4 scoops of ice cream. However, the deal is buy 2 scoops get 1 free, so we need to consider this when calculating the total number of scoops Erin can get.

If Erin buys 2 scoops, she will get 1 free, making it 3 scoops for the price of 2. If she buys 4 scoops, she will get 2 free, making it 6 scoops for the price of 4. Since Erin has $6.00, she can buy 4 scoops and get 2 free, which is the best deal for her.

Therefore, Erin should buy 4 scoops of ice cream.

"To find out how much more candy Amy has after two weeks, we need to calculate the total amount of candy each person eats in two weeks and subtract the difference from the initial amount.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces.

Initially, both Ginger and Amy had 100 pieces of candy. After two weeks, Ginger has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces, and Amy has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces.

The difference in the amount of candy Amy has compared to Ginger is 58 - 44 = 14 pieces.

"To find out how much James saved, we need to calculate the cost of buying the blueberries at the store and compare it to the cost of picking them.

First, let's calculate the cost of picking the blueberries:

Cost of picking = $20 (initial cost) + ($1.5 per pound * 30 pounds)
Cost of picking = $20 + $45
Cost of picking = $65

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying the blueberries at the store:

Cost of buying at the store = $2.5 per pound * 30 pounds
Cost of buying at the store = $75

To find out how much James saved, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying at the store:

Amount saved = Cost of buying at the store - Cost of picking
Amount saved = $75 - $65
Amount saved = $10

"To find the new price of each computer, we need to calculate 10% of the original price and add it to the original price. 

Original price per computer = $700
Increase in price = 10% of $700 = 0.1 * $700 = $70
New price per computer = Original price + Increase in price = $700 + $70 = $770

Now, we can find the total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices.

Total number of computers = 500
Total amount paid = New price per computer * Total number of computers = $770 * 500 = $385,000

"To find the total number of slices eaten, we first need to determine the number of slices each group ate.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 5 people in this group (Bryce and 4 friends), they ate 2/3 of 5 pizzas. 

2/3 * 5 = 10/3 = 3.33 (approximately)

Since each pizza has 12 slices, 3.33 pizzas would be approximately 3.33 * 12 = 40 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 friends, they ate ¾ of 2 pizzas.

3/4 * 2 = 1.5

1.5 pizzas would be 1.5 * 12 = 18 slices.

Now, we add the total number of slices eaten by both groups: 40 + 18 = 58 slices.

Since there were a total of 5 pizzas (one for each person), and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is 5 * 12 = 60.

To find the number of slices left, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices: 60 - 58 = 2.

"To find the average time the cat and dog take to eat the sausages, we first need to find the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages. 

The cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes. Since the dog eats the same number of sausages in 2/3 the amount of time the cat takes, we can calculate the dog's time as follows:

Dog's time = (2/3) * Cat's time
Dog's time = (2/3) * 30 minutes
Dog's time = 20 minutes

Now, we have the time taken by both the cat and the dog. To find the average time, we add their times and divide by 2:

Average time = (Cat's time + Dog's time) / 2
Average time = (30 minutes + 20 minutes) / 2
Average time = 50 minutes / 2
Average time = 25 minutes

"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to first convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. 

1 foot is equal to 12 inches, so 8 feet is equal to 8 * 12 = 96 inches. Adding the 4 inches, we get 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 100 inches, and it is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's represent the length of one of Bobby's shoes as 'x'. 

We can write the equation as: 100 = 9x + 10

Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation, we get: 90 = 9x

Dividing both sides of the equation by 9, we get: x = 10

"To find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to first determine their individual ages.

Given that Dora is 15 years old, we can find her father's age by using the information that her father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. 

Father's age = 2 * Dora's age + 8
Father's age = 2 * 15 + 8
Father's age = 30 + 8
Father's age = 38

Next, we know that Dora's mother is four years younger than her father. 

Mother's age = Father's age - 4
Mother's age = 38 - 4
Mother's age = 34

Now that we have the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother, we can calculate their total combined age.

"To find out how many more groups are needed, we first need to determine the number of students per group. Since there are 54 students to be separated into 6 groups of equal size, we divide 54 by 6.

54 ÷ 6 = 9

This means each group will have 9 students. Now, we need to find out how many groups are needed for 54 students if each group has 9 students. We can do this by dividing 54 by 9.

54 ÷ 9 = 6

Since the activity requires 12 groups, we need to find out how many more groups are needed beyond the 6 groups we already have. 

12 (required groups) - 6 (already formed groups) = 6

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the number of chairs rented in a week and then multiply it by 8 (2 months * 4 weeks/month).

First, let's calculate the number of chairs rented in a week:

- Weekdays: 5 days * 60 chairs/day = 300 chairs
- Weekends: 2 days * 100 chairs/day = 200 chairs
- Total chairs rented in a week: 300 + 200 = 500 chairs

Now, let's multiply the number of chairs rented in a week by 8:

500 chairs/week * 8 weeks = 4000 chairs

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Gunther had 48 bananas.

1. Arnold stole half of the bananas from the pile. Half of 48 is 48 / 2 = 24. So, after Arnold's first theft, Gunther had 48 - 24 = 24 bananas left.

2. Gunther added 25 bananas to his pile. Now, he has 24 + 25 = 49 bananas.

3. Arnold stole 12 bananas from the pile. So, after Arnold's second theft, Gunther had 49 - 12 = 37 bananas left.

4. Gunther added 6 bananas to his pile. Now, he has 37 + 6 = 43 bananas.

Therefore, when Gunther began counting bananas on the third day, he found 43 bananas in the pile.

The final answer is: 43"
"To find out how much each roommate will pay per year, we first need to calculate the total annual electricity bill. Since the monthly bill is $100, we multiply this by 12 to get the annual bill.

Annual electricity bill = $100/month * 12 months/year = $1200/year

Since there are 4 roommates, we divide the annual bill by 4 to find out how much each roommate will pay.

Annual payment per roommate = $1200/year / 4 roommates = $300/year

The final answer is: $300"

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, Lorraine has 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

1. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
   90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
   Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons from trading small stickers.

2. She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
   50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
   Since each large sticker is worth one large button, she gets 20 large buttons from trading large stickers.

3. She trades the rest of her large stickers (40 - 20 = 20) for small buttons. 
   Since each large sticker is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons from trading large stickers.

Now, let's calculate the total number of buttons she has:
- Small buttons: 27 (from small stickers) + 60 (from large stickers) = 87 small buttons
- Large buttons: 20

Total buttons = 87 (small buttons) + 20 (large buttons) = 107 buttons

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as x. Since the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice as many as the votes against it, the number of votes in favor can be represented as 2x.

We know that the total number of council members is 33. The total number of votes is the sum of the votes in favor and against the new regulation. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:

3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 11

Since x represents the number of votes against the new regulation, the number of votes in favor is 2x. 

2x = 2 * 11
2x = 22

The final answer is: 22"

"To find the total number of hours the 20 playlists will last, we need to first find the total number of songs in all the playlists. 

Number of songs in one playlist = 300
Number of playlists = 20
Total number of songs = Number of songs in one playlist * Number of playlists
Total number of songs = 300 * 20
Total number of songs = 6000

Since each song is 10 hours long, the total number of hours the playlists will last is the total number of songs multiplied by the length of each song.

Total hours = Total number of songs * Length of each song
Total hours = 6000 * 10
Total hours = 60000

The final answer is: 60000"

"To find the total number of puppies Jana has, we first need to determine the total number of Pomeranians. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls and there are 6 Pomeranian girls, we can set up the equation:

1/3 * Total Pomeranians = 6

To find the total number of Pomeranians, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3:

Total Pomeranians = 6 * 3
Total Pomeranians = 18

Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can set up another equation:

2/3 * Total Puppies = Total Pomeranians
2/3 * Total Puppies = 18

To find the total number of puppies, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3/2:

Total Puppies = 18 * (3/2)
Total Puppies = 27

The final answer is: 27"
"To find out how much more Jayden needs to buy the camera, we first need to calculate how much money he has after receiving the money from his sister. 

Jayden initially had $70. His sister gave him half of her $90 allowance, which is $45. 

So, Jayden now has $70 + $45 = $115.

The camera costs $200. To find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the amount he has from the cost of the camera: $200 - $115 = $85.

Therefore, Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house as x. Since the first house needs 1/2 of the second house, the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house is x/2.

We are given that the third house needs double the first house, so the number of cases of shingles needed for the third house is 2 * (x/2) = x.

We know that the total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x/2 + x + x = 250

Combine like terms:

(3x)/2 = 250

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

3x = 500

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 500/3
x = 166.67

Since x represents the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house, and the third house needs double the first house, the number of cases of shingles needed for the third house is 2 * (x/2) = x = 166.67.

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a case of shingles, we round up to the nearest whole number. 

The final answer is: 167"

45% of 200 = 0.45 * 200 = 90

Now, let's add 90 to the number of bananas:
200 + 90 = 290

Since George has 45% more pears than bananas, the number of pears is 290.

To find the total number of fruits, we need to add the number of bananas and pears:
200 (bananas) + 290 (pears) = 490

The final answer is: 490"
"To find out how many candy bars Marissa bought for Jimmy, we need to subtract the cost of the ball from the amount of money Marissa had initially. 

Marissa had $80 initially and spent $20 on the ball.

"To find out how many books Ahmed read, we need to divide the number of books Ezra read by 2, since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed. 

Ezra read 300 books, so Ahmed read 300 / 2 = 150 books.

Now, we need to add the number of books Ezra decided to read to the number of books he has already read. Ezra decided to read 150 more books, so he will have read 300 + 150 = 450 books.

To find the total number of books they have read altogether, we need to add the number of books Ezra has read to the number of books Ahmed has read. 

Total books read = 450 (Ezra) + 150 (Ahmed) = 600

"To calculate Tanya's earnings, we need to break it down into two parts: her hourly earnings and her daily bonus.

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Since she earns $15 per hour, her total hourly earnings for Monday are 5 hours * $15/hour = $75.

However, she also earns a daily bonus of $5 for teaching more than 3 classes. Since she teaches 4 classes on Monday, she earns the daily bonus, which is $5.

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Her hourly earnings for Wednesday are 2 hours * $15/hour = $30.

Since she teaches less than 3 classes on Wednesday, she does not earn the daily bonus.

Now, let's calculate her total earnings for the two days:

Monday: $75 (hourly earnings) + $5 (daily bonus) = $80
Wednesday: $30 (hourly earnings) + $0 (daily bonus) = $30

Total earnings for the two days: $80 + $30 = $110

The company sold 5 vanilla scents and there are 4 vanilla scents available, so the total number of vanilla scents sold is 5 * 4 = 20.

The company sold 2 fruity scents and there are 8 fruity scents available, so the total number of fruity scents sold is 2 * 8 = 16.

Now, we need to find the difference between the total number of vanilla scents sold and the total number of fruity scents sold. 

Difference = Total vanilla scents sold - Total fruity scents sold
Difference = 20 - 16
Difference = 4

"To find out how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for, we first need to calculate how much money he makes from selling the eggplants. 

He sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total amount he makes from eggplants is 20 * 3 = $60.

Since Bennet wants to make a total of $135, and he already makes $60 from selling the eggplants, he needs to make $135 - $60 = $75 from selling the corn.

He has 25 ears of corn, so to find out how much he should sell each ear for, we divide the total amount he needs to make from corn ($75) by the number of ears of corn (25). 

$75 / 25 = $3.

Therefore, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

"To find the total time Tatiana has available for soccer, video games, and reading, we need to add the hours she has on Saturday and Sunday. 

Total time available = 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

She reads for 3 hours, so the remaining time for soccer and video games is:
Remaining time = Total time available - Time spent reading
Remaining time = 12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours

She plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time:
Time spent playing video games = 1/3 * 9 hours = 3 hours

Now, we can find the time spent playing soccer:
Time spent playing soccer = Remaining time - Time spent playing video games
Time spent playing soccer = 9 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours

To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we need to divide the time spent playing soccer by the total time available and multiply by 100:
Percentage of weekend spent playing soccer = (Time spent playing soccer / Total time available) * 100
Percentage of weekend spent playing soccer = (6 hours / 12 hours) * 100 = 50%

"To find the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time it takes for him to drive to the museum and back, and then add the time he spends at the museum.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Jack to drive to the museum:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 150 miles / 75 mph
Time = 2 hours

Since he drives to the museum and back, we need to multiply the time by 2:

Total driving time = 2 hours * 2 = 4 hours

Now, we add the time he spends at the museum to the total driving time:

Total time = Total driving time + Time at the museum
Total time = 4 hours + 6 hours
Total time = 10 hours

"To find the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection, we need to calculate the cost of the movies in series, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the remaining movies.

First, let's find the number of movies in series. A third of the movies are in series, so:
600 / 3 = 200 movies in series

Since Mike can get these movies for $6 each, the total cost of the movies in series is:
200 * $6 = $1200

Next, let's find the number of older movies. 40% of the remaining movies (after removing the movies in series) are older movies. The number of remaining movies is:
600 - 200 = 400 movies
40% of 400 is:
400 * 0.4 = 160 movies

The cost of the older movies is:
160 * $5 = $800

Now, let's find the number of remaining movies that are not in series and not older movies. This is:
400 - 160 = 240 movies

The cost of the remaining movies is:
240 * $10 = $2400

The total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection is the sum of the cost of the movies in series, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the remaining movies:

"To find the distance to the vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance traveled by driving and hiking separately, and then add them together.

First, let's find the speed at which they hiked. They hiked at an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Their driving speed was 50 miles per hour. Half of 50 is 25, and 5 miles per hour less than that is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

Now, let's calculate the distance they traveled by driving. They drove for 6 hours at 50 miles per hour. Distance = speed * time, so the distance they drove is 50 * 6 = 300 miles.

Next, let's calculate the distance they traveled by hiking. They hiked for 1.5 hours at 20 miles per hour. Distance = speed * time, so the distance they hiked is 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

Now, we add the distance they drove and the distance they hiked to find the total distance to their vacation spot. Total distance = 300 + 30 = 330 miles.

The final answer is: 330"
"To find the difference in their scores, we need to calculate the points each of them gets from enemies, berries, and the timer.

Let's assume Emma's score from enemies is x. Since Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, Ava's score from enemies will be x + 8.

Emma's score from berries is 3 (since she collects 3 berries), and Ava collects 3 + 3 = 6 berries.

Now, let's consider the timer. The longer Ava takes, the more points she gets. Let's assume Emma finishes the level in t seconds. Since Ava finishes 4 seconds slower, Ava takes t + 4 seconds. The points from the timer for Emma will be 30t, and for Ava will be 30(t + 4).

The total score for Emma is x + 3 + 30t, and for Ava is x + 8 + 6 + 30(t + 4).

Simplifying Ava's total score: x + 8 + 6 + 30t + 120 = x + 14 + 30t + 120.

Now, let's find the difference between their scores: (x + 14 + 30t + 120) - (x + 3 + 30t) = x + 14 + 30t + 120 - x - 3 - 30t = 11 + 120 = 131.

"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we first need to determine the total cost of the two pizzas that are already known. 

The two pizzas that cost 30 dollars each will be 2 x 30 = 60 dollars.

Now, we subtract the cost of these two pizzas from the total cost of all four pizzas to find the cost of the other two pizzas. 

Total cost of all four pizzas = 64 dollars
Cost of the two known pizzas = 60 dollars
Cost of the other two pizzas = Total cost of all four pizzas - Cost of the two known pizzas
Cost of the other two pizzas = 64 - 60
Cost of the other two pizzas = 4 dollars

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the total cost of the other two pizzas by 2 to find the cost of each pizza.

Cost of each pizza = Cost of the other two pizzas / 2
Cost of each pizza = 4 / 2
Cost of each pizza = 2 dollars

"To find the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we need to calculate the number of times they ride on the usual days and the extra days.

On usual days, they ride thrice a day for 5 days. So, the total number of times they ride on usual days is 3 * 5 = 15.

On the two extra days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, which is 3 * 2 = 6 times a day. Since there are 2 extra days, the total number of times they ride on these days is 6 * 2 = 12.

Now, we add the total number of times they ride on usual days and the extra days to get the total number of times they ride in a week: 15 + 12 = 27.

"Let's break down the information given:

Initially, Bob had 7 fish in his pond, with 3 orange and 4 white.

After buying more fish, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Let's denote the number of white fish he bought as 'x'. Since he had 3 orange fish initially, and he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish, the total number of orange fish is 2 times the number of white fish. 

The total number of orange fish is 3 (initial) + the number of orange fish he bought (which is also 'x'). Since he bought a total of 17 fish, the number of white fish he bought is 17 - the number of orange fish he bought (which is 'x'). 

We can set up the equation: 3 + x = 2(4 + x + (17 - x)).

Simplifying the equation: 3 + x = 2(4 + 17 - x) 
3 + x = 2(21 - x) 
3 + x = 42 - 2x 
3 + x + 2x = 42 
3 + 3x = 42 
3x = 39 
x = 13

The number of white fish Bob bought at the store is 13.

"To calculate the weekly fuel consumption, we need to determine the total miles driven per week and then divide it by the car's fuel efficiency.

The one-way distance between home and office is 5 miles, and Andy drives to and from work, so the total daily distance is 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles.

Since Andy drives to work from Monday to Friday, the total weekly distance is 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.

Now, we can calculate the weekly fuel consumption by dividing the total weekly distance by the car's fuel efficiency: 50 miles/week / 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week.

The price of regular gas is $3/gallon, so the weekly fuel cost is 5 gallons/week * $3/gallon = $15/week.

"To find the total amount of money Carrie spent, we need to calculate the value of the quarters and the value of the twenties she spent, then add them together.

First, let's calculate the value of the quarters. Carrie was given 140 quarters. Each quarter is worth $0.25. 

Value of quarters = 140 * $0.25 = $35

Next, let's calculate the value of the twenties she spent. Carrie was given 10 twenties, and she spent 3/5 of them. 

Number of twenties spent = 10 * (3/5) = 6

Value of twenties spent = 6 * $20 = $120

The school will cover half the cost of the trip, which is $300 / 2 = $150.

The total cost of the trip is $300, and John has $50. So, the amount John is missing is $300 - $50 = $250.

The final answer is: $250"
"To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we first need to determine the temperature difference between the current temperature and the freezing point. 

The current temperature during the day is 45 degrees. The temperature during the night is 33 degrees colder than the day, so it's 45 - 33 = 12 degrees. 

The temperature difference between the freezing point and the night temperature is 32 - 12 = 20 degrees. 

Since each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees, we need to divide the temperature difference by the heat provided by each log. 

20 degrees / 5 degrees per log = 4 logs.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total number of seashells brought back, we first need to determine the number of groups formed and then calculate 3/5 of that number multiplied by 2.

First, we find the number of groups formed by dividing the total number of people (90) by the number of people in each group (9). 

Number of groups = Total people / People per group
Number of groups = 90 / 9
Number of groups = 10

Now, we find 3/5 of the number of groups.

3/5 * Number of groups = 3/5 * 10
3/5 * 10 = 6

Now, we multiply the result by 2 to find the total number of seashells brought back.

Total seashells = 6 * 2
Total seashells = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the number of people on the train after the two stops, we need to subtract the number of people who got off and add the number of people who got on.

Initially, there were 172 people on the train.

At the first stop, 47 people got off, so we subtract 47 from 172:
172 - 47 = 125

Then, 13 people got on, so we add 13 to 125:
125 + 13 = 138

At the next stop, 38 people got off, so we subtract 38 from 138:
138 - 38 = 100

Therefore, there are 100 people on the train.

The final answer is: 100"

10 bottle caps/day * 30 days = 300 bottle caps

Each bottle cap is worth $0.25. So, the total amount of money Damien makes in 30 days is:
300 bottle caps * $0.25/bottle cap = $75

The final answer is: $75"
"To find Jamie's total earnings for the day, we need to calculate her earnings for the regular 8 hours and the additional 3 hours.

Her regular hourly rate is $20. For the first 8 hours, she earns 8 * $20 = $160.

For the additional 3 hours, she is paid 150% of her regular hourly rate, which is 1.5 * $20 = $30 per hour. For the additional 3 hours, she earns 3 * $30 = $90.

To find her total earnings for the day, we add the earnings from the regular hours and the additional hours: $160 + $90 = $250.

"To find the total number of lions in the enclosure, we need to add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs.

First, we know there are 12 female lions. 

Since there are half as many male lions as female lions, we can calculate the number of male lions by dividing the number of female lions by 2: 12 / 2 = 6 male lions.

Next, we add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs: 12 (female lions) + 6 (male lions) + 14 (lion cubs) = 32.

The total number of lions in the enclosure is 32."
"To find out how much money Mike will have left over, we need to calculate the discounted price of the jeans and then subtract that from the $50 bill.

First, let's calculate the discount amount: 
Discount = 25% of $40 = 0.25 * $40 = $10

Now, let's calculate the discounted price of the jeans:
Discounted price = Original price - Discount = $40 - $10 = $30

Now, let's calculate how much money Mike will have left over:
Money left over = $50 - $30 = $20

"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to first determine the total number of employees after three months and then multiply it by the monthly salary of each employee.

The company initially has 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. So, after one month, the total number of employees will be 200 + 20 = 220. After two months, it will be 220 + 20 = 240, and after three months, it will be 240 + 20 = 260.

Now, we multiply the total number of employees after three months (260) by the monthly salary of each employee ($4000).

Total amount = 260 * 4000
Total amount = 1040000

The final answer is: $1040000"

"To find out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we need to calculate their total earnings after working 20 hours.

Billy's initial hourly wage was $10. After 2 months, he got a raise of $0.50 per hour, making his new hourly wage $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. After another year, he got a raise of $1.00 per hour, making his final hourly wage $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50.

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary, which was $10. So, Sally's starting salary is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. 

Now, let's calculate their total earnings after working 20 hours:

Billy's total earnings = 20 hours * $11.50 per hour = $230
Sally's total earnings = 20 hours * $10.50 per hour = $210

The difference in their earnings is $230 - $210 = $20.

"To find the total number of trees planted by the students, we need to multiply the number of classes by the average number of students per class and then multiply the result by 1 (since each student plants 1 tree).

Total students = 40 classes * 25 students/class = 1000 students
Total trees planted by students = 1000 students * 1 tree/student = 1000 trees

To find the total number of trees planted by the teachers, we need to multiply the number of classes by the average number of teachers per class and then multiply the result by 2 (since each teacher plants 2 trees).

Total teachers = 40 classes * 3 teachers/class = 120 teachers
Total trees planted by teachers = 120 teachers * 2 trees/teacher = 240 trees

Now, we add the total number of trees planted by the students and the teachers to find the overall total.

Total trees = 1000 trees (by students) + 240 trees (by teachers) = 1240 trees

"To find the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy, we first need to find the total number of stuffed animals she currently has. 

Bubbles has 3 stuffed puppies, 5 stuffed koalas, 2 stuffed zebras, and 4 stuffed frogs. 

Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Now, we need to find 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. 

30% of 14 = 0.3 * 14 = 4.2

Since Bubbles can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, we round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we will calculate the exact number of stuffed goats she needs to buy to reach 30% of the total number of stuffed animals.

To find the total number of stuffed animals after buying the goats, we can set up the equation: 

0.3 * (14 + x) = 4.2, where x is the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy.

"To find out how many hours Kris has played, we need to calculate the total hours played in the first 2 weeks and the additional week.

In 2 weeks, there are 14 days. If Kris plays for half an hour every day, she plays 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours in the first 2 weeks.

In the additional week, Kris plays for 2 hours every day, so she plays 7 * 2 = 14 hours in the additional week.

Total hours played so far is 7 + 14 = 21 hours.

To earn the achievement, Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours. Therefore, she still needs to play 30 - 21 = 9 hours to earn the achievement.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time.

The first car travels at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel:
Distance = Speed x Time = 60 miles/hour x 2 hours = 120 miles

The second car travels at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel:
Distance = Speed x Time = 70 miles/hour x 2 hours = 140 miles

Since the second car was initially passing the first car, we need to find the distance between them after 2 hours. The second car has traveled 140 miles, and the first car has traveled 120 miles. The distance between them is the difference between the two distances:
Distance = 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

"To find the total cost James paid for the ring, we need to calculate the premium first. The premium is 30% of the total cost of the diamond and gold, which is $600 + $300 = $900.

The premium is 30% of $900, which is 0.3 x $900 = $270.

The total cost of the ring is the sum of the cost of the diamond and gold, plus the premium: $900 + $270 = $1170.

Therefore, James paid $1170 for the ring.

"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school.

First, let's find the number of students who passed in each grade:

- Third-graders: 340 out of 500 passed
- Fourth-graders: 40 out of 100 passed
- Fifth-graders: The pass rate is twice the fourth-graders', so it's 2 * 40 = 80 out of 100 passed

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who passed:
340 (third-graders) + 40 (fourth-graders) + 80 (fifth-graders) = 460 students passed

Next, let's calculate the total number of students in the school:
500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000 students

Now, we can find the overall pass rate:

"To find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we first need to determine how many square inches of mosaic he can make with the glass chips he has. 

Since it takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic, and each bag holds 72 chips, we need to find out how many chips Milo has in total. 

Milo has 2 bags of glass chips, so he has 2 * 72 = 144 chips.

Since it takes 12 chips to make 1 square inch, we can divide the total number of chips by 12 to find out how many square inches Milo can make: 144 / 12 = 12 square inches.

Since Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall, and he can make 12 square inches of mosaic, we can find the length of the mosaic by dividing the total square inches by the height: 12 square inches / 3 inches = 4 inches.

Therefore, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total amount of tea consumed, we need to calculate the amount each group of students drank and add them together.

Four students drank 1.5 quarts each, so the total amount they drank is 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts.

16 students drank 2 quarts each, so the total amount they drank is 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

The total amount of tea consumed is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 10 quarts of tea left, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is 38 + 10 = 48 quarts.

To convert quarts to gallons, we know that 1 gallon is equal to 4 quarts. 

48 quarts / 4 = 12 gallons.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to first determine how many candies he has in total. 

Dale initially ordered 100 candies and then ordered 100 more. So, the total number of candies he has is 100 + 100 = 200.

However, he has already sold 150 candies. To find out how many he still needs to sell, we subtract the number of candies sold from the total number of candies he has:

200 (total candies) - 150 (candies sold) = 50

So, Dale still needs to sell 50 candies to sell all of his candy.

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students at the end of each month and then subtract the initial number of students from it.

At the beginning of the year, there are 10 students.

- At the end of January, the number of students doubles, so there are 10 * 2 = 20 students.
- At the end of February, the number of students doubles again, so there are 20 * 2 = 40 students.
- At the end of March, the number of students doubles again, so there are 40 * 2 = 80 students.
- At the end of April, the number of students doubles again, so there are 80 * 2 = 160 students.
- At the end of May, the number of students doubles again, so there are 160 * 2 = 320 students.

Now, let's subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May: 320 - 10 = 310.

The number of additional students who joined by the end of May is 310."
"To find the total number of branches Felix climbed, we need to divide the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch. 

Total money made: $105
Cost per branch: $0.25

Total branches climbed = Total money made / Cost per branch
Total branches climbed = $105 / $0.25
Total branches climbed = 420

Since Felix worked during the week (7 days), we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day.

Average branches per day = Total branches climbed / Number of days
Average branches per day = 420 / 7
Average branches per day = 60

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the total number of petals, we need to calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers and then subtract the petals that were dropped.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers:

- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 * 5 = 15 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 * 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 * 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 * 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add up the total number of petals: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 petal from each set of flowers, we need to subtract 4 petals (1 from each set) from the total: 101 - 4 = 97 petals

The final answer is: 97"
"To find out how many marshmallows are left in the bag, we need to subtract the total number of marshmallows used and the ones dropped from the initial amount.

Total marshmallows used = 9 (John) + 9 (DeSean) = 18
Marshmallows dropped = 3
Total marshmallows used and dropped = 18 + 3 = 21

Initial marshmallows = 35
Marshmallows left = 35 - 21 = 14

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, the number of S'mores each kid can have is equal to the number of marshmallows left divided by 2 (since there are two kids).

S'mores each kid can have = 14 / 2 = 7

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time each person plays and then determine how many quarters are used.

Jack plays for 4 hours, which is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes. Since he can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter, he uses 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.

One of his friends is significantly worse and can play for half as long as Jack, so they play for 240 / 2 = 120 minutes. This friend uses 120 / 20 = 6 quarters.

The other two friends are significantly better and can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they play for 240 * 1.5 = 360 minutes each. Each of these friends uses 360 / 20 = 18 quarters.

Since there are two friends who play for 360 minutes, they use a total of 2 * 18 = 36 quarters.

The total number of quarters used is 12 (Jack) + 6 (worse friend) + 36 (better friends) = 54 quarters.

The cost of each quarter is $0.25, so the total amount of money used is 54 * $0.25 = $13.50.

The final answer is: $13.50"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the amount of citrus zest as Z, the amount of fragrance as F, the amount of salt as S, the amount of sugar as S (since it's the same as salt), and the amount of oil as O.

We know that Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, so F = Z.

We also know that she uses twice as much salt as zest, so S = 2Z.

Since she uses twice as much oil as salt, O = 2S.

Substituting S = 2Z into O = 2S, we get O = 2(2Z) = 4Z.

We know that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, and it's a combination of Z, F, S, S, and O. Since F = Z and S = 2Z, we can rewrite the total amount as Z + Z + 2Z + 2Z + 4Z = 10.

Combining like terms, we get 10Z = 10.

Dividing both sides by 10, we get Z = 1.

Now that we know Z = 1, we can find O by substituting Z into O = 4Z. O = 4(1) = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total amount of money John spent, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows separately and then add them together.

The cost of the goats is 3 * $500 = $1500.
The cost of the cows is 2 * $1500 = $3000.

Now, we add the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows together: $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

The final answer is: $4500"
"To find out how many more cupcakes Paul needs to buy, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs.

Total cupcakes needed = 63
Cupcakes already have = 8 (chocolate) + 40 (toffee) = 48

Now, subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs:
63 - 48 = 15

Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cars Joe has initially, then calculate the number of cars he sells and gives away, and finally subtract that from the initial number of cars he had.

Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

Joe sells 20% of his cars, which is 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars.

He gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold, which is 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

So, Joe gives away a total of 8 (sold) + 16 (given away) = 24 cars.

To find out how many cars Joe remains with, we subtract the number of cars he gave away from his initial number of cars: 40 - 24 = 16.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to first determine the total amount raised by the students. Since the charity raised a total of $175,000 and $50,000 came from organizations, the amount raised by the students is $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000.

Now, we know that there are 20 students and they all raised the same amount. To find the amount each student raised, we divide the total amount raised by the number of students: $125,000 / 20 = $6,250.

The final answer is: $6,250"
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the first day and the second day, and then add them together.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. 

On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she walked on the first day, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

To find the total time in minutes, we need to convert the hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

8 hours = 8 * 60 = 480 minutes
4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes

Now, we add the time from both days:
480 minutes + 240 minutes = 720 minutes

The final answer is: 720"
"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to first determine the total number of cars in the parking lot after the first break. 

Initially, there were 50 cars. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, so the total number of cars after the first break is 50 + 20 = 70.

When Hunter got out of class for the lunch break, he realized that 1/2 the number of cars in the parking lot had gone. This means that 1/2 of 70 cars left, and the remaining 1/2 stayed. 

To find the number of cars that left, we multiply 70 by 1/2: 70 * 1/2 = 35. 

Since 35 cars left, the number of cars that stayed is 70 - 35 = 35. 

However, the question asks for the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break. This would be the number of cars that left, which is 35. 

The total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is 35."
"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of tasks he completes in a day and then multiply it by the number of days he works in a week.

John does 30 cycles of work a day, and each cycle has 5 different tasks. So, the total number of tasks he completes in a day is:
30 cycles/day * 5 tasks/cycle = 150 tasks/day

Since each task pays $1.20, the total amount John makes in a day is:
150 tasks/day * $1.20/task = $180/day

John works a full 7-day week, so the total amount he makes in a week is:
$180/day * 7 days/week = $1260/week

The final answer is: $1260"
"To find the total points Sasha scored in both games, we need to calculate her points in each game and add them together.

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. 

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points in the first game. Therefore, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

To find the total points Sasha scored in both games, we add her points from each game: 14 + 4 = 18.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the total number of tins of cat food, we multiply the number of packages of cat food by the number of tins per package: 8 * 11 = 88 tins of cat food.

To find the total number of tins of dog food, we multiply the number of packages of dog food by the number of tins per package: 6 * 6 = 36 tins of dog food.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of tins of cat food and dog food: 88 - 36 = 52.

The final answer is: 52"
"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as x. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is 341, which is the sum of the cards Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

Since PJ has x cards, Smendrick has 3x cards, and Becca has 3x + 12 cards, we can find the number of cards Becca has by substituting x = 47 into the expression 3x + 12:

Becca has 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

The final answer is: 153"
"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color of eggs and then add them together.

Cindy had 5 green eggs. 
She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.
She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.
She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add the number of eggs of each color together: 
5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27

The final answer is: 27"
"To find out how much Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total cost of shipping the book and subtract the refund amount from the purchase price.

First, let's calculate the shipping cost:

Shipping cost per pound: $0.35
Total weight of the book: 4 pounds
Shipping cost = 4 pounds * $0.35/pound = $1.40

Shipping cost per mile: $0.08
Distance to the distribution center: 20 miles
Additional shipping cost = 20 miles * $0.08/mile = $1.60

Total shipping cost = $1.40 + $1.60 = $2.00

Now, let's calculate the refund amount:

Purchase price of the book: $32
Refund percentage: 75%
Refund amount = $32 * 0.75 = $24

Now, let's calculate the total loss:

Total loss = Total shipping cost - Refund amount
Total loss = $2.00 - $24
However, since the refund amount is greater than the shipping cost, the total loss will be the difference between the shipping cost and the refund amount. 

Total loss = $2.00 - $24 = -$22.00
However, since the total loss is negative, it means that Milly will actually gain $22.00."
"To find out how much money Mulan has left, we need to calculate the total amount of money she spent and subtract it from the initial amount she had, including the money her father gave her.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Mulan had initially: $40 (initial money) + $100 (money from her father) = $140.

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money she spent: 2 pairs of jeans at $30 each = 2 x $30 = $60, and a bag for $20. So, the total amount spent is $60 + $20 = $80.

Now, let's subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $140 - $80 = $60.

Mulan has $60 left."
"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the production for the first three weeks and then determine the pattern.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.
In the second week, he produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.
In the third week, he produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Now, let's add up the production for the first three weeks: 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in total each month, we can find out how much he produces in the fourth week by subtracting the production of the first three weeks from the total production: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

The final answer is: 14,000"
"To find the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends on TikTok in a week and then multiply it by 4.

First, let's calculate the time she spends on TikTok in a week:

- Time spent recording videos: 18 videos * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes
- Time spent writing songs: 2 hours = 120 minutes
- Time spent doing makeup: 15 minutes * 6 days = 90 minutes

Total time spent on TikTok in a week = 72 + 120 + 90 = 282 minutes

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly time by 4:
282 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 1128 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:
1128 minutes / 60 = 18.8 hours

The final answer is: 18.8"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the initial installation and the cost of the additional items.

The initial installation includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. The cost of the initial installation is $129.00.

Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures that she needs installed. Since the initial installation already includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, and 1 chandelier, we need to subtract these from the total number of items she has:

- Mirrors: 6 - 4 = 2
- Chandeliers: 2 - 1 = 1
- Pictures: 20 - 10 = 10

The number of additional items is 2 mirrors, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. The cost of the additional items is $15.00 per item, so the total cost of the additional items is:

2 (mirrors) * $15.00 = $30.00
1 (chandelier) * $15.00 = $15.00
10 (pictures) * $15.00 = $150.00

The total cost of the additional items is $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00.

The total cost is the sum of the initial installation and the cost of the additional items: $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much money Anthony has saved, and then calculate 40% more than that amount for Roy.

Eva has saved $20.00. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, so Anthony has saved $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.

Since Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony, we need to find 40% of $30.00 and add it to $30.00. 

40% of $30.00 is 0.4 x $30.00 = $12.00. 

So, Roy has saved $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

The final answer is: $42.00"
"To find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to determine the lifting capacity of each person relative to Pompei. 

Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch. 
Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift 12 inches. 
Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches. 
Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we need to convert 480 inches to feet. 
480 inches / 12 = 40 feet.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the time it takes for one kangaroo to travel across the highway. Since three kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, one kangaroo would take 18 hours multiplied by 3, which equals 54 hours.

Now, we know that the turtles travel at half the speed of a kangaroo. This means that the time it takes for a turtle to travel across the highway will be twice as long as it takes a kangaroo. 

Since one kangaroo takes 54 hours, one turtle will take 54 hours multiplied by 2, which equals 108 hours. 

However, the question asks for the time it takes for four turtles to travel across the highway. Since four turtles are traveling at the same speed, we can multiply the time it takes for one turtle by 4. 

So, 108 hours multiplied by 4 equals 432 hours.

The final answer is: 432"
"To find the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora, we need to determine the number of dishes each person made.

We know that Kora made 20 dishes. 
Rory made 20 more dishes than Kora, so Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.
Jada made twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

Now, we add up the number of dishes made by each person: 
20 (Kora) + 40 (Rory) + 80 (Jada) = 140

The final answer is: 140"
"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has after receiving her payment and her mom's contribution.

First, let's calculate the price of the new laptop after trading in her old one: $600 - $200 = $400.

Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job and her mom has given her $80. So, the total amount of money she has received is $150 + $80 = $230.

Since Erika now only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, we can set up an equation to find out how much money she had initially: Initial money + $230 = $400 + $50.

Simplifying the equation, we get: Initial money + $230 = $450.

To find the initial money, we subtract $230 from both sides of the equation: Initial money = $450 - $230.

Initial money = $220.

Therefore, Erika has $220 in her purse.

"To find the total number of apple slices, we first need to calculate the total number of slices from the large and small apples. 

3 large apples can be sliced into 3 * 5 = 15 slices.
5 small apples can be sliced into 5 * 3 = 15 slices.

Total slices from large and small apples = 15 + 15 = 30 slices.

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is 30 - 15 = 15.

"To find out how many cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to calculate the total amount of milk the farmer currently produces. 

The farmer extracts 5 liters of milk a day from each cow, and he has 3 cows. So, the total amount of milk he currently produces is 5 liters/cow * 3 cows = 15 liters/day.

To find out how many more cows he needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we subtract the current production from the target production: 25 liters/day - 15 liters/day = 10 liters/day.

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, we need to find out how many cows are needed to produce 10 liters of milk a day. We can do this by dividing the target production by the amount of milk each cow produces: 10 liters/day / 5 liters/cow = 2 cows.

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the unused portion of each stick and add them together.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, which is 1/6 of 12 millimeters. To find this, we multiply 12 by 1/6: 
12 * (1/6) = 12/6 = 2 millimeters.

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, which is 2/3 of 12 millimeters. To find this, we multiply 12 by 2/3: 
12 * (2/3) = 24/3 = 8 millimeters.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, which is 1/2 of 12 millimeters. To find this, we multiply 12 by 1/2: 
12 * (1/2) = 12/2 = 6 millimeters.

Now, we add the unused portions of the glue sticks together: 
2 + 8 + 6 = 16 millimeters.

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 16 millimeters.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so the number of socks Jack has is 60 / 2 = 30 socks.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has 2 * 30 = 60 socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.
5. To find the total number of socks and dishes they have together, we add the number of socks and dishes Jack and Peter have: 30 (Jack's socks) + 60 (Jack's dishes) + 60 (Peter's socks) + 30 (Peter's dishes) = 180.

"To find the number of students good at math, we need to consider the total number of students and the number of students good at both subjects. 

Let's denote the number of students good at both math and English as x. We know that the total number of students is 20, and the number of students good at math only is 5, and the number of students good at English only is 8.

We can set up the equation: 5 (math only) + 8 (English only) + x (both) = 20 (total)

Simplifying the equation, we get: 13 + x = 20

Subtracting 13 from both sides, we get: x = 7

This means that 7 students are good at both math and English. To find the total number of students good at math, we need to add the number of students good at math only (5) and the number of students good at both subjects (7).

"To find the total time available for performances, we need to subtract the intermission time from the total concert time. 

Total concert time = 2 hours = 2 * 60 minutes = 120 minutes
Intermission time = 10 minutes
Time available for performances = Total concert time - Intermission time = 120 - 10 = 110 minutes

Each group takes 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit the stage. So, the total time taken by each group = 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes.

Now, we can find the number of groups that can perform in the given time by dividing the time available for performances by the time taken by each group.

Number of groups = Time available for performances / Time taken by each group = 110 / 10 = 11

The final answer is: 11"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the interest earned each year and add it to the principal amount. 

The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount, which is 0.75 * $300 = $225 per year.

After the first year, Brenda will have:
$300 (initial investment) + $225 (interest) = $525

After the second year, the interest will be 0.75 * $525 = $393.75, and the total amount will be:
$525 + $393.75 = $918.75

After the third year, the interest will be 0.75 * $918.75 = $688.0625, and the total amount will be:
$918.75 + $688.0625 = $1606.8125

"To find the number of white shirts with no collars, we need to find the total number of white shirts and divide it by 2 since half of them have collars. 

Total white shirts = 40
White shirts with collars = 40 / 2 = 20
White shirts with no collars = 40 - 20 = 20

To find the number of floral shirts with no buttons, we need to find the total number of floral shirts and subtract the number of floral shirts with buttons.

Total floral shirts = 50
Floral shirts with buttons = 20
Floral shirts with no buttons = 50 - 20 = 30

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars.

Difference = Floral shirts with no buttons - White shirts with no collars
= 30 - 20

From Farm X, Mr. Smith sold 10 goats. 
From Farm Y, he sold twice as many goats as from Farm X, which is 2 * 10 = 20 goats.

Now, let's calculate the number of goats left in each farm:
- Farm X: 55 - 10 = 45 goats
- Farm Y: 45 - 20 = 25 goats

To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the number of goats in Farm X and Farm Y:
45 (Farm X) + 25 (Farm Y) = 70 goats

The final answer is: 70"

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food, then subtract the discount for the red baskets.

The cost of 3 baskets of green food is 3 * $25 = $75.
The cost of 3 baskets of red food is 3 * $18 = $54.
The total cost before discount is $75 + $54 = $129.
Since you get $2 off for each basket of red food, the total discount is 3 * $2 = $6.
The total cost after discount is $129 - $6 = $123.

The final answer is: $123"
"To find the time it takes to clean one-half of the rooms, we first need to determine the number of rooms that is half of 90. 

90 / 2 = 45 rooms

Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, we multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room.

45 rooms * 20 minutes/room = 900 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours

"To find the total number of homes built over the next three years, we need to calculate the number of homes built in each year and then add them together.

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will double the total number of homes built in the first two years, which is 12 + 36 = 48 homes. Then, they will double this amount, so 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. I am three years younger than my brother, so if my age is x, my brother's age is x + 3.
2. I am 2 years older than my sister, so my sister's age is x - 2.
3. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so my mom's age is 3(x + 3) - 1.
4. When you add all our ages, you get 87: x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + 3(x + 3) - 1 = 87.

Combine like terms: 
x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 9 - 1 = 87
Combine x terms: 
6x + 9 = 87

Subtract 9 from both sides: 
6x = 78

Divide both sides by 6: 
x = 13

So, I am 13 years old.

"To find out how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs, we first need to determine the total number of glue sticks required. Since each student needs 2 glue sticks and there are 27 students, the total number of glue sticks needed is 27 * 2 = 54.

Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks required by the number of glue sticks per pack to find out how many packs are needed. However, since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs and expects to have some extra glue sticks left over, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.

To do this, we can divide 54 by 8, which gives us 6.75. Since we can't buy a fraction of a pack, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 7.

Therefore, Mr. Jackson will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water passing through the river at the given point over the three days.

Day 1: 4000 gallons
Day 2: 4000 * 2 = 8000 gallons
Day 3: 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons

The total amount of water passing through the river at that point is the sum of the water passing through each day.

Total = 4000 + 8000 + 14000 = 24000 gallons

The final answer is: 24000"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of exponential growth. Since each infected person infects six others, the number of new infections each day will be 6 times the number of infected people from the previous day.

Day 1: 10 people are initially infected. They infect 6 * 10 = 60 new people, making a total of 70 people infected.

Day 2: The 10 initial people are still infected, and they infect 6 * 10 = 60 new people. However, the 60 people infected on Day 1 are also still infected and will infect 6 * 60 = 360 new people. So, the total number of new infections on Day 2 is 60 + 360 = 420. Adding the 10 people from Day 1, we have a total of 70 + 420 = 490 people infected.

Day 3: The 10 initial people are still infected, and they infect 6 * 10 = 60 new people. The 60 people infected on Day 1 are still infected and will infect 6 * 60 = 360 new people. The 420 people infected on Day 2 are also still infected and will infect 6 * 420 = 2520 new people. So, the total number of new infections on Day 3 is 60 + 360 + 2520 = 2840. Adding the 490 people from Day 2, we have a total of 490 + 2840 = 3330 people infected.

The final answer is: 3330"

"To find out how many oranges Jennifer remained with, we need to calculate the total number of oranges given to her children. 

She gave her 3 daughters 2 oranges each, so the total number of oranges given to her daughters is 3 * 2 = 6 oranges. 

Her son received 3 oranges. 

In total, she gave away 6 (to daughters) + 3 (to son) = 9 oranges.

Jennifer bought 12 oranges initially. To find out how many she remained with, we subtract the number of oranges given away from the initial number: 12 - 9 = 3 oranges.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Claire earns 1 badge per month. 
Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge, so Amber earns 1/2 badge per month.
Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so Wendy earns 3 badges per month.

In a 1-year time frame (12 months), Claire will earn 1 * 12 = 12 badges.
Amber will earn 1/2 * 12 = 6 badges.
Wendy will earn 3 * 12 = 36 badges.

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns: 36 - 6 = 30.

"To find out how much Paige raised, we need to calculate the total number of slices she baked and sold. 

First, let's find out how many hours she baked. She baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is 5 hours.

Since she can bake 2 loaves per hour, she baked 2 loaves/hour * 5 hours = 10 loaves.

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so she baked 10 loaves * 8 slices/loaf = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, and there are 100 cents in a dollar. So, we need to convert the total amount of money from cents to dollars. 

The total amount of money in cents is 80 slices * 50 cents/slice = 4000 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100: 4000 cents / 100 = 40 dollars.

Therefore, Paige raised $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find the total number of coins Gretchen has, we need to determine the number of silver coins first. 

Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, and Gretchen has 70 gold coins, we can set up an equation to represent the relationship between the number of gold and silver coins. Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. 

The equation would be: x + (x + 30) = 70 (since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, and the total number of gold coins is 70)

Combine like terms: 2x + 30 = 70

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2: x = 20

So, Gretchen has 20 silver coins. 

Now, to find the total number of coins, we add the number of gold coins and silver coins: 70 (gold coins) + 20 (silver coins) = 90

"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we first need to determine the total number of burritos consumed. 

There were 50 students at the picnic, and each student was given 10 burritos. So, the total number of burritos given to the students is 50 * 10 = 500.

Mr. George also ate 20 burritos. 

The total number of burritos consumed is 500 (given to students) + 20 (eaten by Mr. George) = 520.

Since there were 600 burritos ordered initially, the total number of leftover burritos is 600 - 520 = 80.

"To find the number of yellow cars, we need to first determine the number of green and blue cars. 

We know that there are 12 red cars. The rink has 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so the number of green cars is 12 - 2 = 10.

The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars, so the number of blue cars is 3 * 10 = 30.

Now, we know the total number of red, green, and blue cars: 12 (red) + 10 (green) + 30 (blue) = 52.

Since the rink has 75 cars in total, the number of yellow cars is 75 - 52 = 23.

"To solve this problem, let's start by assigning variables to the number of books each person has. Let's say Anne has x books. Since Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, Sofie has x + 25 books. Fawn has 12 more books than Anne, so Fawn has x + 12 books.

We know that together, Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have 85 books. We can write an equation to represent this:

x + (x + 25) + (x + 12) = 85

Combine like terms:

3x + 37 = 85

Subtract 37 from both sides:

3x = 48

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 16

Now that we know Anne has 16 books, we can find out how many books Fawn has by adding 12 to x:

Fawn has x + 12 = 16 + 12 = 28 books.

The final answer is: 28"

"To find out how many pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he ate on each day and add them together.

On the first day, he ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces. To find 2/5 of 60, we multiply 60 by 2 and divide by 5:
(60 * 2) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

So, on the first day, he ate 24 pieces.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces. To find the remaining pieces after the first two days, we subtract the pieces eaten on the first two days from the total:
60 - 24 - 10 = 26

Now, we need to find 7/13 of 26:
(26 * 7) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14

So, on the third day, he ate 14 pieces.

Now, we add the pieces eaten on each day to find the total:
24 + 10 + 14 = 48

"To find the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water, we first need to determine the cost per bottle of soda and the cost per bottle of water.

The cost of 7 bottles of soda is $21.00, so the cost per bottle of soda is $21.00 / 7 = $3.00 per bottle.

The cost of 4 bottles of water is $8.00, so the cost per bottle of water is $8.00 / 4 = $2.00 per bottle.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:

Cost of 3 bottles of soda = 3 * $3.00 = $9.00
Cost of 2 bottles of water = 2 * $2.00 = $4.00
Total cost = $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00

The total cost will be $13.00."

The cost of each bolt is $0.03, and David wants to buy 16 bolts. 

Total cost of bolts = Number of bolts * Cost per bolt
Total cost of bolts = 16 * $0.03
Total cost of bolts = $0.48

Now, we subtract the total cost of the bolts from the initial amount of money David has:

Initial amount of money = $12.48
Total cost of bolts = $0.48
Money left = Initial amount of money - Total cost of bolts
Money left = $12.48 - $0.48
Money left = $12.00

"To find Amy's total score, we need to calculate the points she scored from each type of question and add them together.

For multiple-choice questions: 
Amy correctly answers 80% of 10 questions, so she answers 0.8 * 10 = 8 questions correctly.
Each multiple-choice question is worth 1 point, so she scores 8 * 1 = 8 points from multiple-choice questions.

For true/false questions: 
Amy correctly answers 90% of 20 questions, so she answers 0.9 * 20 = 18 questions correctly.
Each true/false question is worth 1 point, so she scores 18 * 1 = 18 points from true/false questions.

For long-answer questions: 
Amy correctly answers 60% of 5 questions, so she answers 0.6 * 5 = 3 questions correctly.
Each long-answer question is worth 5 points, so she scores 3 * 5 = 15 points from long-answer questions.

Now, we add the points from each type of question to find Amy's total score:

"To find out how much money Isaias bought the chickens for, we first need to determine how many chickens he plans to sell. Since he has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them, we can calculate the number of chickens he plans to sell as follows:

Number of chickens to sell = 300 * (3/5)
= 300 * 0.6
= 180 chickens

Since Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000 by selling the chickens at $50 each, we can calculate the total revenue he expects to get from selling the chickens:

Total revenue = Number of chickens to sell * Price per chicken
= 180 * $50
= $9000

Now, to find out how much he bought the chickens for, we need to subtract the profit from the total revenue:

Total cost = Total revenue - Profit

"To solve this problem, we need to first find Melanie's current age. Since in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old, we can subtract 10 from 18 to find her current age.

Current age = 18 - 10 = 8 years

Now, we need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her present age. Let's assume the number of years is 'x'. 

In 'x' years, Melanie's age will be her current age + 'x'. This should be equal to three times her current age.

Current age + x = 3 * Current age

8 + x = 3 * 8

8 + x = 24

"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's find the cost of the chicken. Since each pack of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, and the 5 packs of bacon cost $10, the cost of one pack of bacon is $10 / 5 = $2. Therefore, the cost of one pack of chicken is $2 * 2 = $4. Since Kelly has 6 packs of chicken, the total cost of the chicken is 6 * $4 = $24.

Next, let's find the cost of the strawberries. Each pack of strawberries costs $4, and Kelly has 3 packs, so the total cost of the strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.

Now, let's find the cost of the apples. Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is $4 / 2 = $2. Since Kelly has 7 packs of apples, the total cost of the apples is 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items in Kelly's cart: $10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60.

Finally, let's subtract the total cost of the items from Kelly's budget: $65 - $60 = $5.

"To find the runtime of Elaina's usual concerts, we need to first subtract the encore time from the total runtime of the final concert. 

Total runtime of the final concert = 65 minutes
Encore time = 15 minutes
Runtime of the final concert without encore = 65 - 15 = 50 minutes

Since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, we can set up an equation to find the runtime of her usual concerts:

Let x be the runtime of her usual concerts
2x = 50 (since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts)

To find x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 50 / 2
x = 25

So, Elaina's usual concerts run for 25 minutes.

The final answer is: 25"

"To find the number of pairs of microphones that can be arranged, we first need to find the total number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs. 

Let's assume the total number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs is x. Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the total number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs is 2x.

However, we know that the singer has 50 microphones in total. Since 20% of the microphones won't find any space to fit in, the number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs is 80% of 50, which is 0.8 * 50 = 40.

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs is 40 / 2 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total number of birds, we need to calculate the number of birds in each group and add them together.

First, Jerry counts 6 birds nesting in the bushes.

Then, 2/3rd of 6 birds are flying overhead. To find 2/3rd of 6, we multiply 6 by 2 and divide by 3:
(6 * 2) / 3 = 12 / 3 = 4

So, 4 birds are flying overhead.

Next, Jerry sees 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. To find the total number of birds in these groups, we multiply the number of groups by the number of birds in each group:
3 * 8 = 24

Now, we add the number of birds in each group together:
6 (nesting) + 4 (flying) + 24 (feeding) = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To find out how many cookies were in each jar, we need to subtract the number of cookies Lani ate from the total number of cookies she baked, and then divide the result by the number of jars.

First, subtract the number of cookies Lani ate from the total number of cookies: 
55 (total cookies) - 5 (cookies eaten) = 50 cookies

Next, divide the remaining cookies by the number of jars:
50 cookies / 5 jars = 10 cookies per jar

"To find the total number of petals on the orchids, we multiply the number of orchids by the number of petals per orchid: 5 orchids * 5 petals/orchid = 25 petals.

To find the total number of petals on the daisies, we multiply the number of daisies by the number of petals per daisy: 4 daisies * 10 petals/daisy = 40 petals.

Now, we subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies to find the difference: 40 petals - 25 petals = 15 petals.

The daisies have 15 more petals compared to the orchids.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the percentage of flowering plants, we first need to determine the number of flowering plants. 

There are 100 plants in total. One-fourth of them are indoor plants, which is 100 * (1/4) = 25 plants. 

The remaining plants are 100 - 25 = 75 plants. Two-thirds of these remaining plants are outdoor plants, which is 75 * (2/3) = 50 plants. 

The rest of the remaining plants are flowering plants, which is 75 - 50 = 25 plants.

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100: (25/100) * 100 = 25%.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to determine the speed of the thingamabob first. Since the whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob, and the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, we can find the speed of the thingamabob by dividing the speed of the whatchamacallit by 11.

Speed of thingamabob = Speed of whatchamacallit / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 121 / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 11 meters per second

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig by multiplying the speed of the thingamabob by 5.

Speed of whirligig = Speed of thingamabob * 5
Speed of whirligig = 11 * 5
Speed of whirligig = 55 meters per second

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the price of one carrot as 'c'. Since the yogurt is half the price of the salad, the price of the yogurt is $6 / 2 = $3.

Ellen eats two carrots every day, so the total cost of carrots is 2c.

The total cost of the salad and yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9.

Since Ellen pays a total of $11 for her goods, the cost of the carrots can be found by subtracting the cost of the salad and yogurt from the total cost: 2c = $11 - $9 = $2.

To find the price of one carrot, we divide the total cost of carrots by 2: c = $2 / 2 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To find out how much Mark makes a week, we need to calculate his new hourly wage and then multiply it by the number of hours he works in a week.

Mark's new hourly wage is $10 (old wage) + $2 (raise) = $12 per hour.

He works 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, so the total number of hours he works in a week is 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week.

Now, we multiply his new hourly wage by the total number of hours he works in a week: $12/hour * 40 hours/week = $480/week.

The final answer is: $480"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn. Let's denote the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. 

Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times. 

The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.

The total number of lawns she mowed is 3x + x + 5x = 9x. 

We know that she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn, and since she mowed Joe's lawn 'x' times, she made a total of $6x from mowing lawns.

We also know that she made a total of $80 from both lemonade sales and mowing lawns. So, the amount she made from lemonade sales is $80 - $6x.

We are given that she made $80 in total, so we can set up the equation: $6x + (80 - $6x) = $80.

Simplifying the equation, we get $80 = $80, which is true for any value of x. However, we can also set up another equation using the fact that she mowed a total of 9x lawns. Since she made $6 per lawn, the total amount she made from mowing lawns is $6 * 9x = $54x.

We know that she made a total of $80, so we can set up the equation: $54x + (80 - $54x) = $80.

Simplifying the equation, we get $80 = $80, which is true for any value of x. However, we can also use the fact that she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn. Since she mowed Joe's lawn 'x' times, we can set up the equation: $6x = $6.

Dividing both sides by $6, we get x = 1.

Now that we know x = 1, we can find the amount she made from mowing lawns: $6x = $6 * 1 = $6.

The amount she made from lemonade sales is $80 - $6 = $74.

The final answer is: $74"
"To find Harry's weight, we need to calculate the weights of Carl and Christian first. 

Martin's weight is 55 kg. 
Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so Carl's weight is 55 + 16 = 71 kg.
Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight is 71 + 8 = 79 kg.
Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight is 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

The final answer is: 74"
"To find John's total monthly income from renting out his car, we need to calculate the total number of hours he rents his car and multiply it by his hourly rate.

He rents his car 10 times a month for 3 hours each time, so the total number of hours is:
10 rentals/month * 3 hours/rental = 30 hours/month

His hourly rate is $25, so his total monthly income is:
30 hours/month * $25/hour = $750/month

To find his profit, we need to subtract his car payment from his total monthly income:
$750/month - $500/month = $250/month

So, John makes a profit of $250 per month on his car. 

The final answer is: $250"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many notebooks Martha had initially. Since she bought 5 more notebooks to reach a total of 7, we can subtract 5 from 7 to find her initial number of notebooks.

Martha's initial number of notebooks = 7 - 5 = 2

Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, we can multiply Martha's initial number of notebooks by 3 to find Joseph's number of notebooks.

Joseph's number of notebooks = 3 * 2 = 6

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph. We can subtract Joseph's number of notebooks from Martha's number of notebooks.

Difference = Martha's number of notebooks - Joseph's number of notebooks
= 7 - 6
= 1

"To find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we first need to determine the distance rowed by Anis. 

Dijana rowed 50 miles. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. To find 1/5 of Dijana's distance, we multiply 50 by 1/5, which is 10 miles. 

So, Anis rowed 50 + 10 = 60 miles. 

Now, to find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we add their individual distances: 50 (Dijana) + 60 (Anis) = 110 miles.

The final answer is: 110"
"To find out how many cookies each of Susan's nephews will get, we first need to determine the total number of cookies left after her husband took some. 

Initially, Susan had 100 cookies. Her husband took 4 cookies, so the remaining number of cookies is 100 - 4 = 96.

Since Susan wants to divide the cookies equally among her 6 nephews, we need to divide the remaining cookies by 6. 

96 ÷ 6 = 16

So, each of Susan's nephews will get 16 cookies. 

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we need to calculate the total number of pages each of them read.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. 

Today, Denise read 5 more than as many pages as Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read 5 + 13 = 18 pages today.

So, Denise's total pages read is 10 (yesterday) + 18 (today) = 28 pages.

Daniel's total pages read is 13 (yesterday) + 0 (today) = 13 pages.

The difference in the number of pages read by Denise and Daniel is 28 - 13 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of bowls that can be filled with the leftover soup and then divide that by the number of child-sized bowls.

Since the pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls, and there are 3 adults (Calvin, his wife, and himself), the total number of adult bowls that can be filled is 3. 

Since 4 adult bowls equal 8 child bowls, we can set up a proportion to find the number of child bowls that can be filled: 4 adult bowls = 8 child bowls. 

To find the number of child bowls that can be filled, we can multiply the number of adult bowls by 2 (since 4 adult bowls equal 8 child bowls): 3 adult bowls * 2 = 6 child bowls.

Now, we know that there are 6 child bowls that can be filled with the leftover soup. Since there are 2 children, we can divide the total number of child bowls by 2 to find out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch: 6 child bowls / 2 children = 3.

For small masks: 
- Each small mask requires 2 yards of material.
- Jo needs to make 20 small masks.
- Total material for small masks = 20 * 2 = 40 yards.

For large masks: 
- Each large mask requires 2.25 yards of material.
- Jo needs to make 8 large masks.
- Total material for large masks = 8 * 2.25 = 18 yards.

Total material required = material for small masks + material for large masks = 40 + 18 = 58 yards.

"To find the average price Deepa paid per ticket, we need to first find the total number of tickets she bought and the total amount she spent.

Since Deepa saw each of the 9 movies three times, the total number of tickets she bought is 9 movies * 3 showings per movie = 27 tickets.

The total amount she spent is given as $216.

To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets: $216 / 27 tickets.

Average price per ticket = $216 / 27 tickets = $8.

"To find Harold's free time, we need to calculate the total hours in a day and subtract the time he spends sleeping, working, and walking his dog.

There are 24 hours in a day. 

Harold sleeps for 10 hours, so he has 24 - 10 = 14 hours left.

He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

He walks his dog for 1 hour.

Now, let's subtract the time he spends working and walking his dog from the remaining time: 14 - 8 - 1 = 5 hours.

So, Harold has 5 hours of free time left in his day.

Initially, Tim had 7 blue shoeboxes and 9 red shoeboxes. 

After using 3 blue shoeboxes, he has 7 - 3 = 4 blue shoeboxes left.

After using 3 red shoeboxes, he has 9 - 3 = 6 red shoeboxes left.

Therefore, Tim has 4 blue shoeboxes and 6 red shoeboxes left.

"To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we need to first calculate how many marbles he gave away. 

Dean gives 1/5 of his marbles to Jamie. Since he has 30 marbles, 1/5 of 30 is 30 * (1/5) = 6 marbles. 

So, Dean gave away 6 marbles to Jamie. 

Then, he gave 10 marbles to Donald. 

In total, Dean gave away 6 + 10 = 16 marbles.

To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we subtract the marbles he gave away from the total number of marbles he had: 30 - 16 = 14.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Adam's age four years ago as 'x'. Since Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, we can write an equation:

Duncan's age eight years ago = 2 * Adam's age four years ago
Duncan's age eight years ago = 2x

We know that Duncan's current age is 60, so we can find his age eight years ago by subtracting 8 from 60:

Duncan's age eight years ago = 60 - 8
Duncan's age eight years ago = 52

Now we can equate this to 2x:

52 = 2x

To find x, we can divide both sides by 2:

x = 52 / 2
x = 26

This means Adam's age four years ago was 26. To find Adam's current age, we add 4 to x:

Adam's current age = x + 4
Adam's current age = 26 + 4
Adam's current age = 30

Finally, to find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

Adam's age in 8 years = Adam's current age + 8
Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8
Adam's age in 8 years = 38

"To find out how much Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday, we need to calculate the total number of packages he completes in that time and then multiply it by his hourly wage.

First, let's find out how many packages Colby completes in an hour. He completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, so he completes 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

Now, let's calculate the total number of packages he completes in an 8-hour workday: 40 packages/hour * 8 hours = 320 packages.

Since Colby gets paid $0.20 for every package he completes, we can multiply the total number of packages by his hourly wage to find his total earnings: 320 packages * $0.20/package = $64.

"To find out how many bottles of water John drinks, we need to calculate the time it takes to solve the extreme sudoku and then divide it by the time it takes to drink one bottle of water.

A normal sudoku takes 45 minutes, and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long, so the time to solve an extreme sudoku is 45 * 4 = 180 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we need to convert the time to solve the extreme sudoku to hours and then divide by 0.5 (since there are 2 half hours in an hour). 

180 minutes is equal to 3 hours (180 / 60 = 3). 

Now, we divide 3 hours by 0.5 to find out how many half hours are in 3 hours: 3 / 0.5 = 6.

So, John drinks 6 bottles of water while solving the extreme sudoku.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many pieces of bologna were thrown at the red balloons and then subtract that from the total number of bologna pieces to find out how many were thrown at the yellow balloons.

Since Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and there were 20 red balloons, the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons is 2 * 20 = 40.

Now, we know that Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna at the bundle of balloons. To find out how many pieces were thrown at the yellow balloons, we subtract the number of pieces thrown at the red balloons from the total: 58 - 40 = 18.

Since Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, we can find the number of yellow balloons by dividing the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons by 3: 18 / 3 = 6.

"To find out how many tune-ups Jon needs, we need to calculate the total miles he drives in 30 days. 

Since Jon drives 100 miles a day, the total miles driven in 30 days is:
100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles

Since Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we can divide the total miles driven by 1000 to find out how many tune-ups he needs:
3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3 tune-ups

Therefore, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in that time.

First, let's calculate the cost of the balloons. 1 dozen balloons is equal to 12 balloons. Since 2 balloons cost $0.5, 12 balloons will cost 12 * $0.5 / 2 = $3.

The total cost of the cake and the balloons is $11 + $3 = $14.

The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is $7 * 2 = $14.

The total cost of the cake, balloons, and ice cream is $14 + $14 = $28.

Since Julia and Nadine used all the money they had to buy these items, the total amount of money they had is $28.

Since they had the same amount of allowance, we can divide the total amount of money by 2 to find out how much each of them received: $28 / 2 = $14.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Lana has 27 cups of tea in total and divides them into 3 rows. 
   Since each row has an equal number of cups, we can find the number of cups in each row by dividing 27 by 3.
   27 / 3 = 9 cups in each row.

2. In each row, she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups. 
   Since there are 9 cups in each row, and she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea, the number of mint tea cups in each row is half of 9.
   9 / 2 = 4.5 cups of mint tea in each row.

However, since we can't have a fraction of a cup, this means that Lana must have created 4 full cups of mint tea in each row and then used the remaining 0.5 cups to create the cinnamon tea.

The problem states that she used the remaining cups to brew a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea. 
Since there are 3 rows, and each row has 0.5 cups of mint tea left over, the total number of cups of mint tea left over is 3 * 0.5 = 1.5 cups.

This means that the 1.5 cups of mint tea were used to brew the 15 cups of cinnamon tea. 
To find the number of cups of mint tea in each cup of cinnamon tea, we can divide 1.5 by 15.
1.5 / 15 = 0.1 cups of mint tea per cup of cinnamon tea.

However, the question asks for the number of cups of mint tea in each row, not the amount of mint tea per cup of cinnamon tea. 
So, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip. 

Let's break down the information given:

- The sloth takes 4 hours to make a round trip (down and back up) to collect berries.
- The sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

Since the sloth takes 4 hours to make a round trip, in 8 hours, he can make 8 / 4 = 2 round trips.

If the sloth makes 2 round trips, he will collect a total of 2 * x berries, where x is the number of berries he picks up per trip.

We want the total number of berries to be 24, so we can set up the equation:

2 * x = 24

To find the minimum number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip, we need to solve for x:

x = 24 / 2
x = 12

Colby's initial budget is $150. He has already spent money on:

- 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays: 5 * $10 = $50
- 8 movies on other days: 8 * $7 = $56
- 2 tubs of popcorn: 2 * $8 = $16
- 4 boxes of candy: 4 * $2 = $8

Total spent: $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130

Colby has $150 - $130 = $20 left.

Since tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10, and he wants to see a movie on a Friday, he can see 1 more movie with his remaining money.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To find the total calories of the pastries, we need to calculate the calories of each type of pastry and then add them together.

First, let's find the calories of a mini cinnamon roll. Since a normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories and a mini pastry has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal version, the calories of a mini cinnamon roll would be 600 / 3 = 200 calories.

Next, let's find the calories of a mini blueberry muffin. Since a normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories and a mini pastry has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal version, the calories of a mini blueberry muffin would be 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, let's calculate the total calories of the mini cinnamon rolls: 200 mini rolls * 200 calories per roll = 40,000 calories.

Next, let's calculate the total calories of the mini blueberry muffins: 300 muffins * 150 calories per muffin = 45,000 calories.

Finally, let's add the total calories of the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins: 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories.

The total calories of the pastries Andrew baked is 85,000."
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed and then divide it by the number of days.

On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday, she removed twice as many as Monday, so 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs.
On Wednesday, she removed twice as many as Tuesday, so 2 * 78 = 156 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 78 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 378

There are 5 days in total. 

Average number of Junebugs removed per day = Total Junebugs removed / Number of days
= 378 / 5
= 75.6

The final answer is: 75.6"
"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled and then find the difference between the two distances.

The bus travels at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so the distance it traveled is:
Distance = Speed x Time = 60 miles/hour x 5 hours = 300 miles

The car travels at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so the distance it traveled is:
Distance = Speed x Time = 30 miles/hour x 8 hours = 240 miles

Now, we need to find the difference between the distance traveled by the bus and the car:
Difference = Distance traveled by bus - Distance traveled by car = 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find the number of bouncy balls, we need to subtract the total number of toys Sophie had before buying the bouncy balls from the total number of toys she has now. 

The total number of toys before buying the bouncy balls is the sum of the blocks, stuffed animals, and stacking rings. 

Total number of toys before = 31 (blocks) + 8 (stuffed animals) + 9 (stacking rings) = 48

Now, we subtract this from the total number of toys after buying the bouncy balls to find the number of bouncy balls.

Number of bouncy balls = Total number of toys after - Total number of toys before
= 62 - 48
= 14

The final answer is: 14"
"Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as Pp, and John's age as J. 

We are given that Pp = J + 10. 

We are also given that P = Pp + J.

We are also given that P + Pp + J = 100.

Substituting Pp = J + 10 into the equation P = Pp + J, we get P = (J + 10) + J, which simplifies to P = 2J + 10.

Substituting P = 2J + 10 and Pp = J + 10 into the equation P + Pp + J = 100, we get (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100.

Simplifying the equation, we get 4J + 20 = 100.

Subtracting 20 from both sides, we get 4J = 80.

Dividing both sides by 4, we get J = 20.

Now that we know J = 20, we can find Pp = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30.

Finally, we can find P = Pp + J = 30 + 20 = 50.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total number of balloons, we need to calculate the initial number of balloons and then add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, Maria had 1 water balloon, and her 4 friends had 2 balloons each. So, the total initial number of balloons is:
1 (Maria's balloon) + (4 friends * 2 balloons per friend) = 1 + 8 = 9 balloons

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends), the total additional balloons are:
5 people * 3 balloons per person = 15 balloons

Now, we add the initial and additional balloons to find the total number of balloons:
9 (initial balloons) + 15 (additional balloons) = 24 balloons

The final answer is: 24"
"To find out how many tables they need, we first need to calculate the total number of boxes of stuff they have. 

10 people donate 5 boxes each, so they have 10 * 5 = 50 boxes from donations. 
They already have 10 boxes, so the total number of boxes is 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

Since they can fit 2 boxes per table, they will need 60 / 2 = 30 tables.

They already own 15 tables, so they need 30 - 15 = 15 more tables.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the average total distance spat, we need to calculate the total distance spat by each person and then divide it by the total number of seeds spat.

Zoey spits 40 seeds, each 10 feet, so the total distance spat by Zoey is 40 * 10 = 400 feet.

Sydney spits 35 seeds, each 12 feet, so the total distance spat by Sydney is 35 * 12 = 420 feet.

The total distance spat by both is 400 + 420 = 820 feet.

The total number of seeds spat is 40 + 35 = 75.

The average total distance spat is 820 / 75 = 10.93 (rounded to two decimal places).

"To determine which widget maker is more profitable, we need to calculate the total number of widgets each machine can produce in a month and then multiply that by the price of each widget.

First, let's calculate the total number of widgets each machine can produce in a month:

Widgeteer 3000: 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets
WidgetMaster 9000: 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from each machine:

Widgeteer 3000: 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200
WidgetMaster 9000: 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

Now, let's find the difference in revenue between the two machines:

$259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

"To find out how much Cameron would save, we first need to calculate the cost of his stay with the option of adding on 70 pesos for every hour after the 12-hour mark and then compare it to the cost of paying for a 24-hour stay.

Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours. Since the first 12 hours are already included in the initial charge, he needs to pay for the additional 5 hours.

The cost for the additional 5 hours is 5 * 70 = 350 pesos.

The total cost for Cameron's stay would be 1000 (initial 12-hour charge) + 350 (additional 5 hours) = 1350 pesos.

The cost of paying for a 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos.

To find out how much Cameron would save, we subtract the cost of his chosen option from the cost of the 24-hour stay: 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

The final answer is: $250"
"To find the total amount of hay needed, we first need to calculate the amount each sheep needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds and each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, we can calculate the amount each sheep needs as follows:

Each goat needs 5 pounds, so twice that amount is 5 * 2 = 10 pounds. 
3 pounds less than 10 pounds is 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep separately:

For the goats: 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds
For the sheep: 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds

To find the total amount of hay needed, we add the amount needed for the goats and the sheep:

75 pounds (goats) + 84 pounds (sheep) = 159 pounds

"To find out how much money John has left after buying gas and depositing money in the bank, we first need to calculate his total earnings for the week. 

John's total earnings = 50 dollars/hour * 6 hours = 300 dollars.

After spending 50 dollars on gas, he has:
300 - 50 = 250 dollars.

He wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so he will be left with:
250 - 100 = 150 dollars.

Now, let's calculate how much he spends on pencils:
5 pencils * 10 dollars/pencil = 50 dollars.

After buying pencils, he has:
150 - 50 = 100 dollars.

"To find the total number of letters in the words Craig spelled, we multiply the number of words by the number of letters in each word: 20 * 15 = 300.

Since Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig, we add 50 to the total number of letters Craig spelled: 300 + 50 = 350.

However, we also need to consider the words Craig's brother spelled. Since Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig, and Craig spelled 20 words with 15 letters each, we can find the number of words Craig's brother spelled by dividing 50 by the difference in the number of letters in each word. However, since the difference in the number of letters in each word is not given, we will assume that Craig's brother spelled the same number of words as Craig, which is 20.

If Craig's brother spelled 20 words with the same number of letters as Craig, then the difference in the number of letters in each word would be 0. However, since Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig, we can find the number of letters in each word Craig's brother spelled by dividing 50 by 20, which is the number of words Craig spelled. However, this would not give us the correct number of letters in each word, as it would be 2.5, which is not possible.

Since we know that Craig spelled 20 words with 15 letters each, and Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig, we can find the number of letters in each word Craig's brother spelled by assuming that Craig's brother spelled words with a different number of letters. Let's assume that Craig's brother spelled words with x letters each. Then, the total number of letters in the words Craig's brother spelled is 20x.

We know that the total number of letters in the words Craig's brother spelled is 50 more than the total number of letters in the words Craig spelled. So, we can set up the equation 20x = 300 + 50.

Solving for x, we get x = (300 + 50) / 20 = 35.

So, Craig's brother spelled words with 35 letters each. The total number of letters in the words Craig's brother spelled is 20 * 35 = 700.

The total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is the sum of the total number of letters in the words Craig spelled and the total number of letters in the words Craig's brother spelled: 300 + 700 = 1000.

"To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has left, we first need to determine the total number of bottles she gives to the students. 

There are 29 students, and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles given to the students is 29 * 2 = 58 bottles.

The teacher has 9 coupons, each redeemable for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles she can get is 9 * 100 = 900 bottles.

However, she only needs 58 bottles for the students. To find out how many bottles she has left, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles she can get: 900 - 58 = 842.

"To find out how much James spent on the CDs, we need to calculate the original price and then subtract the amount he got back from selling 5 of them.

First, let's find the original price of the CDs. James bought 10 CDs at $15 each, so the original price is 10 * $15 = $150.

Since he got a 40% discount, he paid 60% of the original price. To find 60% of $150, we multiply $150 by 0.6, which is $90.

Now, let's calculate how much James got back from selling 5 CDs. He sold them for $40 each, so he got 5 * $40 = $200.

To find out how much money James was out, we subtract the amount he paid from the amount he got back: $200 - $90 = $110.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. First, we need to find the time it took James to swim 60% of the distance. 
   Distance = 20 miles, 
   Speed = 2 miles per hour, 
   Time = Distance / Speed = 20 / 2 = 10 hours.

   60% of the distance is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles. 
   Time taken to swim 12 miles = 12 / 2 = 6 hours.

2. Since he rests for half as long as the swimming time, he rests for 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

3. The remaining distance is 20 - 12 = 8 miles. 
   He swims at half the speed, so his new speed is 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour.
   Time taken to swim the remaining 8 miles = 8 / 1 = 8 hours.

4. Total time taken = Time taken to swim 12 miles + Time taken to rest + Time taken to swim the remaining 8 miles
   Total time taken = 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.

"To find out how many points Azibo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Bahati and Dinar. 

Let's denote the points scored by Dinar as x. Since Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, Bahati's points can be represented as x + 10. 

We also know that Azibo scored 20 more points than Bahati, so Azibo's points can be represented as (x + 10) + 20 = x + 30.

The total points scored by the team is 45, which is the sum of the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar. Therefore, we can write the equation: x + (x + 10) + (x + 30) = 45.

Combine like terms: 3x + 40 = 45.

Subtract 40 from both sides: 3x = 5.

Divide both sides by 3: x = 5/3.

However, x represents the points scored by Dinar, which cannot be a fraction. This indicates that the initial assumption of x being the points scored by Dinar is incorrect. 

Let's re-evaluate the problem. If Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, and 10 more points than Dinar, we can represent Bahati's points as x + 10 and Azibo's points as (x + 10) - 20 = x - 10.

The total points scored by the team is 45, which is the sum of the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar. Therefore, we can write the equation: (x + 10) + (x - 10) + Dinar's points = 45.

Since Dinar's points are not known, let's represent them as y. The equation becomes: (x + 10) + (x - 10) + y = 45.

Combine like terms: 2x + y = 45.

However, we still need to find the points scored by Azibo, which is x - 10. To do this, we need to find the value of x.

We know that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, and 10 more points than Dinar. This means that the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar can be represented as x + 10, x - 10, and x - 20, respectively.

The total points scored by the team is 45, which is the sum of the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar. Therefore, we can write the equation: (x + 10) + (x - 10) + (x - 20) = 45.

"To find the total number of pages in the book, we need to calculate the total number of pages per inch and then multiply it by the thickness of the book in inches.

Since each paper is 100 pages to the inch and each paper is printed on both sides, we have 200 pages per inch (100 pages per side).

Given that the book is 1.5 inches thick, we can multiply the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book:

200 pages/inch * 1.5 inches = 300 pages

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the total number of reports Vince stapled, we need to calculate the total time he spent stapling reports and then multiply it by the number of reports he can staple per minute.

First, let's find the total time in minutes. Vince stapled reports from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is a total of 15 hours. 

15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Now, we know Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many reports he can staple per minute, we divide 30 by 15.

30 reports / 15 minutes = 2 reports/minute

Now, we multiply the total minutes by the number of reports he can staple per minute.

900 minutes * 2 reports/minute = 1800 reports

The final answer is: 1800"
"To find out how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up earlier.

Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she usually sleeps for 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 6 a.m. - 5 minutes = 5:55 a.m.

She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes.

To find the total sleep time, we need to calculate the time she was asleep from 10 p.m. to 2:15 a.m. and from 2:38 a.m. to 5:55 a.m.

From 10 p.m. to 2:15 a.m. is 4 hours and 15 minutes, which is 255 minutes.

From 2:38 a.m. to 5:55 a.m. is 3 hours and 17 minutes, which is 197 minutes.

The total time she was asleep is 255 + 197 = 452 minutes.

Now, we subtract the time she was sleepwalking (23 minutes) and the time she woke up earlier (5 minutes) from the total sleep time: 452 - 23 - 5 = 424 minutes.

The final answer is: 424"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many measuring spoons Jonathan has initially. 

Since Jonathan has two dozen cups, and one dozen is equal to 12, he has 2 * 12 = 24 measuring cups.

It is given that Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. So, the number of measuring spoons he has is 2/3 * 24 = 16.

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, Jonathan is left with 16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons.

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is the sum of the measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons, which is 24 + 10 = 34.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we first need to calculate the number of occupied beds and then subtract that from the total capacity.

The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 of them are occupied. 

1/5 of 1000 is 100. So, the number of occupied beds is 100.

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, we need to calculate the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks is 14 days.

The total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks is 50 * 14 = 700.

Now, we add the initial occupied beds (100) to the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks (700) to get the total occupied beds after 2 weeks.

Total occupied beds = 100 + 700 = 800

Now, we subtract the total occupied beds from the total capacity to get the number of unoccupied beds.

Total unoccupied beds = 1000 - 800 = 200

"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we first need to determine the number of non-work emails she sends. 

She sends 16 emails a day, and 7 of them are work emails. So, the number of non-work emails is 16 - 7 = 9.

Two-thirds of the remainder (non-work emails) are to her family. Two-thirds of 9 is (2/3) * 9 = 6. This means she sends 6 emails to her family.

Now, we need to find out how many emails are left after sending to her family. Since she sends 6 emails to her family, the remaining emails are 9 - 6 = 3.

One-third of the remaining emails are to her boyfriend. One-third of 3 is (1/3) * 3 = 1.

Therefore, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

"To find Shawna's age, we need to first find Aliya's age, which is given as 3 years. 

Since Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, we can calculate Shawna's age by multiplying Aliya's age by 3. 
Shawna's age = 3 * 3 = 9 years.

Now, we know that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. 
Shawna's father's age = 5 * Shawna's age = 5 * 9 = 45 years.

"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number Courtney reported and subtract it from the number she reported.

Let's assume the number Courtney reported is 100%. 
20% of 100 is 20.

Now, subtract 20 from 100 to find the actual percentage of people who attended the concert.
100 - 20 = 80%

Now, we need to find 80% of the number Courtney reported, which is 48.
80% of 48 = (80/100) * 48 = 0.8 * 48 = 38.4

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 38.4.

The final answer is: 38.4"
"To solve this problem, let's start by identifying the relationship between the number of balls each boy carried. We know that Jason carried 2 balls, and Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason. So, Jordan carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

We also know that Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey. Since Jason carried 2 balls, Jeffrey must have carried half of Jason's amount, which is 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

Now, we know that the total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls carried by each of them. So, the total number of balls is 1 (carried by Jeffrey) + 2 (carried by Jason) + 4 (carried by Jordan) = 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day.
2. The total number of holes at the end of the first day is 10.
3. On the second day, they dug 13 holes, so the total number of holes at the end of the second day is 10 + 13 = 23.
4. On the third day, they dug 8 holes and filled in 2, so the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 23 + 8 - 2 = 29.
5. The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 4 * 10 = 40.
6. Since there were 29 holes at the end of the third day, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is 40 - 29 = 11.

"Let's break down the problem. We know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and the third person got 15 more than each of them. 

Let's denote the number of corn chips the third person got as x. Since the third person got 15 more than Amora and Lainey, we can write an equation:

x = 70 + 15
x = 85

So, the third person got 85 corn chips. 

Now, we know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and the third person got 85 corn chips. To find the total number of corn chips, we add the number of corn chips each person got:

Total corn chips = 70 + 70 + 85
Total corn chips = 225

"To find the cost of travel, we need to calculate 50% more than the cost of supplies. 

First, let's find 50% of the cost of supplies. 50% of $400 is 0.5 * 400 = $200.

Now, we add this to the cost of supplies to find the total cost of travel. 
Cost of travel = Cost of supplies + 50% of cost of supplies
Cost of travel = $400 + $200
Cost of travel = $600

The final answer is: $600"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, Stan as S, and Alex as X.

We know that together they have caught 339 Pokémon, so we can write the equation:
A + S + X = 339

We also know that Alex has caught 5 more Pokémon than Stan, so we can write:
X = S + 5

We also know that Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, so we can write:
S = 4A - 13

Now we can substitute the expression for X from the second equation into the first equation:
A + S + (S + 5) = 339

Combine like terms:
A + 2S + 5 = 339

Subtract 5 from both sides:
A + 2S = 334

Now we can substitute the expression for S from the third equation into the equation above:
A + 2(4A - 13) = 334

Expand the equation:
A + 8A - 26 = 334

Combine like terms:
9A - 26 = 334

Add 26 to both sides:
9A = 360

Divide both sides by 9:
A = 40

Now that we know A, we can find S:
S = 4A - 13
S = 4(40) - 13
S = 160 - 13
S = 147

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in the southerly direction and then add it to the distance traveled in the northerly direction.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled in the southerly direction:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 10 hours
Distance = 300 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled in the northerly direction:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 36 miles

Since the bird traveled 36 miles north, we need to subtract this from the total distance traveled in the southerly direction to find the net distance between the two homes:
Net distance = 300 miles - 36 miles
Net distance = 264 miles

However, the bird also traveled 5 hours in the southerly direction after turning back. We need to add this distance to the net distance:
Total distance = Net distance + Distance traveled in the last southerly direction
Total distance = 264 miles + (22 miles/hour * 5 hours)
Total distance = 264 miles + 110 miles
Total distance = 374 miles

She received 4 dozen brownies from her friends, which is 48 brownies.

Total brownies received = 12 + 6 + 48 = 66

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies.

Total brownies eaten = 18

To find the total number of brownies Greta had left over, we subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies received:
Total brownies left over = Total brownies received - Total brownies eaten
Total brownies left over = 66 - 18
Total brownies left over = 48

"To find out how much Sunny earned, we need to calculate the total number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie he sold on both days and then multiply it by their respective prices.

Let's denote the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday as G. Then, the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday is G + 5.

The number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday is (G - 4), and on Sunday is 15.

The total number of boxes of gingerbread sold is G + (G + 5) = 2G + 5.
The total number of boxes of apple pie sold is (G - 4) + 15 = G + 11.

The total number of boxes sold is (2G + 5) + (G + 11) = 3G + 16.

We know that the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday is 15, so we can set up the equation G + 11 = 15 to find the value of G.

G + 11 = 15
G = 15 - 11
G = 4

Now that we know G, we can find the total number of boxes sold: 3G + 16 = 3(4) + 16 = 12 + 16 = 28.

The total amount earned from gingerbread is (2G + 5) * 6 = (2(4) + 5) * 6 = 13 * 6 = 78.
The total amount earned from apple pie is (G + 11) * 15 = (4 + 11) * 15 = 15 * 15 = 225.

2. When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
3. When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.

From point 3, we can deduce that Emil's brother is currently half of Emil's age when Emil turns 24. Since Emil is 19 now, when he turns 24, he will be 24 - 19 = 5 years older. Therefore, his brother's age when Emil turns 24 will be 5 / 2 = 2.5 years.

Now, we know that when Emil turns 24, his brother will be 2.5 years old. This means his brother is currently 2.5 - 5 = -2.5 years old when Emil is 19. However, age cannot be negative, so we'll assume that the brother is 2 years old now.

From point 2, we know that when Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad. This means his dad's age when Emil turns 24 will be 24 * 2 = 48 years.

Now, we know that when Emil turns 24, his dad will be 48 years old. This means his dad is currently 48 - 5 = 43 years old.

The sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother now is 43 + 2 = 45.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to calculate the number of beads she received from her mother, sister, and friend, and then add them together.

Adrianne's mother gave her 20 beads.
Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the beads together: 20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the total amount of crawfish Joe caught, we need to calculate the amount he caught each day and add them together.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.
On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount of Thursday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 pounds.
On Saturday, he caught half the amount of Friday, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the total amount of crawfish Joe caught: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can find the total number of servings by dividing the total amount of crawfish by the serving size: 21 / 3 = 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the number of students leaving early, we first need to find the number of football players, and then add the number of cheerleaders or band members.

First, let's find the number of football players. 20% of 30 students are football players. 

20% of 30 = 0.20 * 30 = 6

So, there are 6 football players.

Now, let's find the number of remaining students. Since 6 students are football players, the remaining students are 30 - 6 = 24.

Out of the remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band.

25% of 24 = 0.25 * 24 = 6

So, there are 6 cheerleaders or band members.

Now, let's add the number of football players and cheerleaders or band members to find the total number of students leaving early.

6 (football players) + 6 (cheerleaders or band members) = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we need to first find the size of Charlie's boots. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie's boots are size 5, Charlie's boots are 5 * 5 = 25.

The average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie is the sum of their sizes divided by 2. So, (5 + 25) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15.

"To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to calculate the total space available for plants. 

First, we need to convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches since the width of the plants is given in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so the length of the flower bed in inches is 111 * 12 = 1332 inches.

Next, we need to subtract the space between the plants. Since there are 17 plants, there will be 16 spaces between them. The total space between the plants is 16 * 1.5 = 24 feet, which is 24 * 12 = 288 inches.

Now, we subtract the total space between the plants from the total length of the flower bed to get the total space available for the plants: 1332 - 288 = 1044 inches.

Since each plant is 12 inches wide, we can divide the total space available for plants by the width of each plant to find out how many plants can fit: 1044 / 12 = 87.

However, Pat already owns 17 flowers, so we need to subtract these from the total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed: 87 - 17 = 70.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the plants Pat needs to buy: 70 * $6 = $420.

The final answer is: $420"
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day, we need to calculate 1/2 of the number of pretzels Edgar eats in a day. 

Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day. 
1/2 of 18 is 18 / 2 = 9 pretzels.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we need to multiply the number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day by 7.

9 pretzels/day * 7 days = 63 pretzels

The final answer is: 63"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

The cost of petunias: 5 baskets * 3 petunias per basket * $3.00 per petunia = 5 * 3 * 3 = $45.00
The cost of sweet potato vines: 5 baskets * 2 sweet potato vines per basket * $2.50 per sweet potato vine = 5 * 2 * 2.50 = $25.00

Total cost = cost of petunias + cost of sweet potato vines = $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00

The final answer is: $70.00"
"To find out how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we first need to determine how much soil is left after planting the sunflowers and carnations.

First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:

- 4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds
- 10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds
- Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations = 12 pounds + 15 pounds = 27 pounds

Now, let's subtract the amount of soil used from the total amount of soil:

- Total soil available = 30 pounds
- Soil used for sunflowers and carnations = 27 pounds
- Soil left for roses = 30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, we can plant 3 roses with the remaining soil.

"To find out how many shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we first need to calculate how much she sets aside each month for shoes. 

Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month and sets 25% of her paycheck aside for shoes. 
25% of $2,000.00 is calculated as 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00.

Since she sets aside $500.00 each month, in a year (12 months), she will have saved 12 * $500.00 = $6,000.00.

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, so to find out how many pairs she can buy, we divide the total amount she saved in a year by the cost of one pair of shoes: $6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: peeling and cooking. 

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp. Emily can peel 6 shrimp a minute, so to peel 90 shrimp, it will take her 90 / 6 = 15 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp. Since she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we need to find out how many batches of 30 shrimp are in 90 shrimp. 90 / 30 = 3 batches. Since each batch takes 10 minutes, it will take her 3 * 10 = 30 minutes to cook 90 shrimp.

However, these tasks are not done sequentially. We need to consider the time it takes to peel the shrimp first, and then cook them. Since peeling takes 15 minutes and cooking takes 30 minutes, the total time will be the maximum of these two times, which is 30 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Emily 30 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

The final answer is: 30"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour on low and 3 degrees per hour on high.
2. The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour without the air conditioner.
3. The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, so it cooled the room by 2 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 6 degrees.
4. Then, it was turned up to high for 4 hours, so it cooled the room by 3 degrees/hour * 4 hours = 12 degrees.
5. The total cooling effect of the air conditioner is 6 degrees + 12 degrees = 18 degrees.
6. However, the room also warmed up for 2 hours without the air conditioner, so it warmed up by 2 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 4 degrees.
7. The net cooling effect of the air conditioner is 18 degrees - 4 degrees = 14 degrees.

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time. 

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. 
2. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. 
   Since Bill's dad was 30 years old when he saw the comet, Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time.

Now, we need to find out how long it took for the comet to orbit the sun again. The comet orbits the sun every 75 years. 

Since Bill saw the comet for the second time when he was 90 years old, and the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, we can assume that the comet will orbit the sun again when Bill is 90 + 75 = 165 years old.

Now, we need to find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time. Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, and Bill saw the comet for the second time when he was 165 years old, we can subtract 75 years from 165 to find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time.

165 - 75 = 90

However, this is the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time. We need to find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time. Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, we can subtract 75 years from the age of Bill's dad (30 years old) to find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time.

30 - 75 = -45 (This is incorrect, as age cannot be negative)

However, we know that Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old, and the comet orbits the sun every 75 years. This means that the comet will orbit the sun 2 more times before Bill sees it for the second time. 

So, we can add 75 years to 30 years to find out how old Bill's dad was when he saw the comet for the second time.

30 + 75 = 105

Now, we know that Bill was 3 times the age of his father when he saw the comet for the second time. 

So, we can multiply 105 by 3 to find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the second time.

105 * 3 = 315

However, we know that Bill saw the comet for the second time when he was 90 years old. 

So, we can subtract 315 from 90 to find out how many years it took for the comet to orbit the sun twice.

90 - 315 = -225 (This is incorrect, as time cannot be negative)

However, we know that the comet orbits the sun every 75 years. 

So, we can divide 225 by 75 to find out how many times the comet orbited the sun in 225 years.

225 / 75 = 3

This means that the comet orbited the sun 3 times in 225 years. 

Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, we can multiply 75 by 3 to find out how many years it took for the comet to orbit the sun 3 times.

75 * 3 = 225

Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, let's add the individual howling times together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents and subtract that from the cost of the trousers.

Adam's mother gave him $6.
His father gave him twice as much as his mother, so his father gave him 2 * $6 = $12.

The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Since the trousers cost $30, we subtract the amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers to find out how much he had to contribute from his savings:

$30 (cost of trousers) - $18 (amount received from parents) = $12

So, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings. 

The final answer is: $12"
"To find the age of Wilfred, we first need to find the average age of the group. We know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. Let's denote the average age as 'x'. 

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age, Helene's age is 2x. 

The total age of the children is 20, and we know the ages of Akbar and Alessandro. We can set up the equation:

x + 2x + 3 + 4 = 20

Combine like terms:

3x + 7 = 20

Subtract 7 from both sides:

3x = 13

Divide by 3:

x = 13/3

Now that we have the average age, we can find Helene's age:

Helene's age = 2x = 2 * (13/3) = 26/3

We know the total age of the group is 20, and we have the ages of Akbar and Alessandro. We can find Wilfred's age by subtracting the sum of their ages from the total age:

Wilfred's age = 20 - (3 + 4 + 26/3)

First, convert the whole numbers to fractions with a denominator of 3:

Wilfred's age = 20 - (9 + 26/3)

Combine the fractions:

Wilfred's age = 20 - (27/3 + 26/3)

Combine the fractions:

Wilfred's age = 20 - 53/3

Convert 20 to a fraction with a denominator of 3:

Wilfred's age = 60/3 - 53/3

Subtract the fractions:

Wilfred's age = 7/3

To convert the fraction to a decimal, divide the numerator by the denominator:

Wilfred's age = 7/3 ≈ 2.33

However, since the question asks for a numerical answer, we will provide the exact fraction as the final answer.

The final answer is: 7/3"
"To find out how much Walter's lawyer will contribute, we need to calculate the total amount collected from Walter's neighbors and the online fund. 

Walter collects $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. 

Total amount collected so far = $500 + $1500 = $2000

Walter's friend donates $200, but this is not included in the amount that Walter's lawyer will base his donation on. The lawyer will donate three times the amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund, which is $2000.

So, the lawyer will donate 3 * $2000 = $6000.

The final answer is: $6000"
"To find the total number of cookies, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies brought by the guests. Since each guest brought 15 cookies and there were 100 guests, the total number of cookies is 100 * 15 = 1500.

The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door. So, the number of cookies given to the church is 1/2 * 1500 = 750.

Since each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, we can find the number of people in the church by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received. 

Number of people in the church = Total cookies given to the church / Cookies per person
= 750 / 15
= 50

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, let's assume the total number of slices of the watermelon is 'x'. Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of people is 6. 

Let's assume each kid gets 'k' slices of the watermelon. Since each adult gets twice as much as each kid, each adult gets '2k' slices.

The total number of slices given to the kids is 4k (4 kids * k slices each), and the total number of slices given to the adults is 2 * 2k = 4k (2 adults * 2k slices each).

The total number of slices given to all the family members is 4k + 4k = 8k.

Since the total number of slices of the watermelon is 'x', we can set up the equation: 8k = x.

Now, the adults get 4k slices in total. To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to find the fraction of the total watermelon that the adults get, which is 4k/x.

To find the percentage, we multiply this fraction by 100: (4k/x) * 100.

Since 8k = x, we can substitute x with 8k in the equation: (4k / 8k) * 100.

Simplifying the fraction, we get (1/2) * 100 = 50.

So, each adult gets 50% of the watermelon.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones has left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time spent on rounds and appointments, and then subtract that from the total hours he spends at the clinic.

First, let's calculate the time spent on rounds:
- Time spent on rounds = Number of inpatients * Time per inpatient
- Time spent on rounds = 9 inpatients * 20 minutes/inpatient
- Time spent on rounds = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time spent on rounds to hours:
- Time spent on rounds (in hours) = 180 minutes / 60
- Time spent on rounds (in hours) = 3 hours

Next, let's calculate the time spent on appointments:
- Time spent on appointments = Number of appointments * Time per appointment
- Time spent on appointments = 10 appointments * 30 minutes/appointment
- Time spent on appointments = 300 minutes

Converting the time spent on appointments to hours:
- Time spent on appointments (in hours) = 300 minutes / 60
- Time spent on appointments (in hours) = 5 hours

Now, let's add the time spent on rounds and appointments to find the total time spent:
- Total time spent = Time spent on rounds + Time spent on appointments
- Total time spent = 3 hours + 5 hours
- Total time spent = 8 hours

Finally, we subtract the total time spent from the total hours Doctor Jones spends at the clinic to find the time left to update his records:
- Time left to update records = Total hours at the clinic - Total time spent
- Time left to update records = 9 hours - 8 hours
- Time left to update records = 1 hour

The final answer is: 1"
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake. 

First, let's add the time it takes to make the cake batter (20 minutes) and bake the cake (30 minutes): 20 + 30 = 50 minutes.

Next, we add the time it takes for the cake to cool (2 hours, which is 120 minutes) and the time to frost the cake (10 minutes): 120 + 10 = 130 minutes. 

Now, we add the time it takes to make the cake batter and bake the cake (50 minutes) to the time it takes for the cake to cool and frost (130 minutes): 50 + 130 = 180 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 180 minutes to hours by dividing by 60: 180 / 60 = 3 hours.

Now, we add the 3 hours to the time at which Jordan wants to serve the cake (5:00 pm) to find the latest time she can start making the cake: 5:00 pm + 3 hours = 8:00 pm.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we need to first determine the total number of boxes sold by both Lisa and Peter. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so together they sold 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

Since they sold 64 chocolate bars together and they sold 8 boxes, we can divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes to find out how many chocolate bars are in a box.

64 / 8 = 8

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box."
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to first calculate the daily earnings and then multiply it by the number of days in a month.

The daily earnings can be calculated as follows:

- Cost to rent the studio: $25 per session
- Cost per student: $1.50 per student per session
- Number of students: 10
- Number of sessions per week: 3

Daily earnings = (Cost to rent the studio + (Cost per student * Number of students)) * Number of sessions per week
Daily earnings = ($25 + ($1.50 * 10)) * 3
Daily earnings = ($25 + $15) * 3
Daily earnings = $40 * 3
Daily earnings = $120

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, the monthly earnings can be calculated as follows:

Monthly earnings = Daily earnings * Number of weeks in a month
Monthly earnings = $120 * 4
Monthly earnings = $480

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is $480. 

The final answer is: $480"
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box for both Peter and Martha, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes.

For Peter: 64 chocolate bars / 4 boxes = 16 chocolate bars per box
For Martha: 56 chocolate bars / 7 boxes = 8 chocolate bars per box

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter and Martha:
16 (Peter's chocolate bars per box) - 8 (Martha's chocolate bars per box) = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the number of female porcupines, we multiply the total population by 3/5. 

Number of female porcupines = 50 * (3/5) = 30

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, the total number of babies born in a month is 30 * 4 = 120.

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is 120 * 12 = 1440.

The total number of porcupines after a year will be the sum of the initial population and the number of babies born in a year. 

Total porcupines after a year = 50 + 1440 = 1490

The final answer is: 1490"
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth of the pool. 

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the gallons of water needed, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. There are 7.48 gallons in a cubic foot, so:

Volume in gallons = 1400 * 7.48
Volume in gallons = 10472 gallons

Now, we multiply the volume in gallons by 5.9 to get the total gallons of water needed:
Total gallons = 10472 * 5.9
Total gallons = 61851.28 gallons

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon, so we multiply the total gallons by the cost per gallon:
Cost = 61851.28 * 0.10
Cost = 6185.128

The final answer is: $6185.13"
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to calculate the number of blue and yellow sticks first. 

We know there are 9 red sticks and 5 more blue sticks than red. So, the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14.

The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is 14 - 3 = 11.

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks: 9 (red) + 14 (blue) + 11 (yellow) = 34.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the distance traveled by Matteo, we multiply his speed by the time he traveled: 55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles.

To find the distance traveled by Shandy, we multiply his speed by the time he traveled: 45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles.

Now, we subtract the distance traveled by Matteo from the distance traveled by Shandy to find the difference: 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles.

The final answer is: 230"
"To find the total number of female students, we need to first find the number of students over 16 and under 16, and then calculate the number of female students in each group.

1. Total students = 3000
2. Students over 16 = 3000 / 2 = 1500
3. Male students over 16 = 1500 / 4 = 375
4. Female students over 16 = 1500 - 375 = 1125
5. Students under 16 = 3000 / 2 = 1500
6. Male students under 16 = 1500 / 2 = 750
7. Female students under 16 = 1500 - 750 = 750

"To find out how many laps each person can run, we need to calculate their individual lap counts.

Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.

Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.

Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.

Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract Quinn's lap count from Bethany's lap count: 10 - 5 = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the remaining gallons of water needed to fill the tank, we first need to calculate the total gallons of water pumped into the tank by both Wanda and Ms. B on both days.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total gallons of water pumped into the tank on the first day is 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons. The total gallons of water pumped into the tank on the second day is 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

The total gallons of water pumped into the tank over the two days is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.

Since the tank has a capacity of 18000 gallons, the remaining gallons of water needed to fill the tank is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is: 6000"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the first part where the power bank loses 9% of its capacity per hour for 5 hours, and the second part where it loses 7% of its capacity per hour for 3 hours.

Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is x.

In the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the remaining charge will be x - (9% of x) * 5 = x - 0.45x = 0.55x.

In the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the remaining charge will be 0.55x - (7% of 0.55x) * 3 = 0.55x - 0.1545x = 0.3955x.

We are given that the final charge remaining is 28%. So, we can set up the equation:

0.3955x = 0.28x

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.3955:

x = 0.28 / 0.3955
x = 0.709

To convert this to a percentage, we can multiply by 100:

x = 0.709 * 100
x = 70.9%

So, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 70.9%.

The final answer is: 70.9"
"To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment, we first need to calculate her total weekly earnings. 

Her hourly wage is $10, and her hourly tips are $15. So, her total hourly earnings are $10 + $15 = $25 per hour.

Since she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are $25 * 40 = $1000.

Now, we need to find out how much Janet needs to save for the down payment. She wants to save 20% of the cost of the car, which is 20% of $10,000. 

20% of $10,000 is 0.20 * $10,000 = $2000.

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save the down payment, we divide the amount she needs to save ($2000) by her weekly earnings ($1000).

$2000 / $1000 = 2

So, Janet needs to work 2 weeks to save the down payment.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of money he has spent so far. 

3 peaches at $0.5 each will be 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
4 pears at $0.5 each will be 4 * $0.5 = $2
2 kiwis at $1 each will be 2 * $1 = $2
5 apples at $0.75 each will be 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Adding these amounts together, Jamaar has spent $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9 so far.

Since Jamaar has $10, he has $10 - $9 = $1 left.

Plums cost $0.25 each, so we can divide the remaining money by the cost of a plum to find out how many plums he can buy: $1 / $0.25 = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many pieces of sweets each friend received, we first need to determine how many packs Anne gave to her friends. Since she kept 2 packs for herself, she gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs.

Next, we divide the total number of packs given away (13) by the number of friends (10) to find out how many packs each friend received. 

13 packs / 10 friends = 1.3 packs per friend

Since each pack contains 60 pieces, we multiply the number of packs each friend received by the number of pieces in each pack to find the total number of pieces each friend received.

1.3 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 78 pieces

However, since we can't divide packs into fractions, we can round down to 1 pack per friend and give the remaining packs to the friends with the most packs. But in this case, we will assume that the remaining packs are distributed evenly among the friends.

The remaining packs are 13 - 10 = 3 packs. We divide these 3 packs by 10 friends to find out how many extra pieces each friend received.

3 packs / 10 friends = 0.3 packs per friend

0.3 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 18 pieces

Now, we add the pieces from the pack each friend received and the extra pieces they received.

78 pieces + 18 pieces = 96 pieces

The final answer is: 96"
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the increase in price each year and add it to the original price.

Year 1: 
Original price = $120
Increase = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Original price = $126
Increase = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Original price = $132.30
Increase = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many pictures Olivia put into each album. Since she put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide the total number of pictures by 8.

Total pictures = 72
Pictures per album = Total pictures / Number of albums
Pictures per album = 72 / 8
Pictures per album = 9

Since 3 albums were selfies only and 2 albums were portraits, the remaining 3 albums must be a mix of both selfies and portraits. However, we are not given any information about the mix of selfies and portraits in these 3 albums. 

But we can still find the total number of selfies and portraits. Since 3 albums were selfies only, the total number of selfies is 3 * 9 = 27. Similarly, since 2 albums were portraits only, the total number of portraits is 2 * 9 = 18.

The final answer is:

"To find out how long James spends reading, we need to determine how many sets of 3 pages he reads and then multiply that by the time it takes him to read one set of 3 pages.

Since James reads 18 pages, we can divide 18 by 3 to find out how many sets of 3 pages he reads: 18 / 3 = 6.

Since it takes James 10 minutes to read one set of 3 pages, we can multiply the number of sets by the time it takes to read one set: 6 * 10 = 60.

James spends 60 minutes reading his book."
"To find the current number of guests in the hotel, we need to calculate the number of guests who checked in and subtract the number of guests who checked out.

Initially, the hotel had 100 guests.

24 guests checked out early, so the remaining guests are 100 - 24 = 76.

15 guests opted for a late checkout, so the number of guests who have checked out is 24 (early checkouts) + 15 (late checkouts) = 39.

The number of guests who have not checked out is 76 - 39 = 37.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout, which is 2 * 15 = 30.

So, the total number of guests who have checked in is 30 (in the afternoon) + 7 (after dinner) = 37.

Now, we add the number of guests who have checked in to the number of guests who have not checked out: 37 (checked in) + 37 (not checked out) = 74.

"To find the number of points Aries is sure to get, we need to calculate the number of questions in each category and then find the total points.

First, let's find the number of questions in each category:
- Easy questions: 40% of 60 = 0.4 * 60 = 24 questions
- Average and difficult questions: 60 - 24 = 36 questions
- Since the rest are equally divided as average and difficult questions, we have 36 / 2 = 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

Now, let's find the number of questions Aries is sure to get in each category:
- Easy questions: 75% of 24 = 0.75 * 24 = 18 questions
- Average questions: 50% of 18 = 0.5 * 18 = 9 questions

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of small stuffed animals as 's' and the number of large stuffed animals as 'l'. We know that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so we can write an equation:

s = 2l

We also know that the price of a small stuffed animal is $4. Since Teresa sold 's' small stuffed animals, the total revenue from small stuffed animals is 4s.

The price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal, which is 3 * 4 = $12. Since Teresa sold 'l' large stuffed animals, the total revenue from large stuffed animals is 12l.

The total revenue from both small and large stuffed animals is $120, so we can write another equation:

4s + 12l = 120

Now we can substitute the first equation (s = 2l) into the second equation to solve for 'l':

4(2l) + 12l = 120
8l + 12l = 120
20l = 120
l = 6

Now that we know 'l', we can find 's' using the first equation:

s = 2l
s = 2(6)
s = 12

Therefore, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe and then multiply it by 40 dwarves and 30 days.

First, let's find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with an iron pickaxe. Since he can mine twice as much with an iron pickaxe as with his bare hands, he can mine 2 * 12 = 24 pounds of ore per day with an iron pickaxe.

Next, let's find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe. Since he can mine 50% more with a steel pickaxe than with an iron pickaxe, he can mine 24 + (24 * 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe.

Now, let's find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day with steel pickaxes. Since one dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe, 40 dwarves can mine 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds of ore per day.

Finally, let's find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in 30 days with steel pickaxes. Since they can mine 1440 pounds of ore per day, they can mine 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds of ore in 30 days.

The final answer is: 43200"
"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to determine the ratio of the price to the number of sandwiches for the first two packages. 

The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3, so the price per sandwich is $3 / 2 = $1.5 per sandwich. 

The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6, so the price per sandwich is $6 / 4 = $1.5 per sandwich. 

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is the same for all packages, which is $1.5. 

Now, we can find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches by multiplying the price per sandwich by the number of sandwiches: $1.5 * 8 = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To find out how much Tom has to pay per month, we need to subtract the amount he paid from the total cost of the bedroom set. 

First, let's calculate the remaining amount Tom needs to pay for the bedroom set after selling his old bedroom set. 
Remaining amount = Total cost - Amount paid from selling old bedroom set
Remaining amount = $3000 - $1000
Remaining amount = $2000

Since Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month, we need to calculate 10% of $2000.
Monthly payment = 10% of $2000
Monthly payment = 0.1 * $2000
Monthly payment = $200

The final answer is: $200"
"To find the number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons after each event.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

First, 40% of the red balloons burst. 40% of 25 is 0.4 x 25 = 10. So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

Next, Sally released half of the yellow balloons. Half of 12 is 6, so she released 6 yellow balloons, leaving 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.

Then, she found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch. 75% of 8 is 0.75 x 8 = 6. So, she added 6 blue balloons to her clutch.

Now, let's calculate the total number of balloons she carried into the school. She had 15 red balloons, 6 yellow balloons, and 6 blue balloons. 

15 + 6 + 6 = 27

The final answer is: 27"
"To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to consider the scenarios where he won't get an extension. 

First, let's consider the scenario where the substitute teacher is present. In this case, there's a 50% chance of the substitute teacher being present, and since the homework won't be collected in this scenario, the probability of having to turn in the homework is 0%.

Next, let's consider the scenario where the normal teacher is present. In this case, there's a 60% chance (100% - 40% extension chance). Within this 60%, there's a 80% chance (100% - 20% chance of getting a personal extension) that Marcus won't get an extension.

Now, we can calculate the overall probability of having to turn in the homework:

- Probability of substitute teacher: 50% * 0% = 0%
- Probability of normal teacher and no extension: 60% * 80% = 48%

The total probability of having to turn in the homework is the sum of these two probabilities: 0% + 48% = 48%.

The final answer is: 48%"
"To find out how many tickets each graduate can receive, we need to first determine the total number of available seats for guests. 

Total capacity of the Fine Arts Center: 6000
Seats for graduates: 950
Seats for faculty: 300

Total seats taken: 950 + 300 = 1250
Available seats for guests: 6000 - 1250 = 4750

Since there are 950 graduates, we need to divide the available seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate can receive.

4750 / 950 = 5

Each graduate can receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the relationship between the number of small beans and the number of large beans. 

First, we know that eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. This means that 1 small bean is equivalent to 1/3 of a medium-sized bean.

Since Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, and it takes 75 large beans to fill him up, he can eat 2 * 75 = 150 medium-sized beans.

Now, we need to find out how many small beans are equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans. Since 1 small bean is equivalent to 1/3 of a medium-sized bean, 150 medium-sized beans are equivalent to 150 * 3 = 450 small beans.

The final answer is: 450"
"To find out how much Melissa makes per hour after expenses, we need to first calculate her total earnings and total expenses.

Total earnings: Melissa is paid $15 per day for 3 days, so her total earnings are 15 * 3 = $45.

Total expenses: Melissa pays $3 for parking each day for 3 days, so her total expenses are 3 * 3 = $9.

Now, let's calculate her net earnings: Net earnings = Total earnings - Total expenses = 45 - 9 = $36.

Since Melissa spends 6 hours a day for 3 days, her total hours worked is 6 * 3 = 18 hours.

To find out her hourly wage after expenses, we divide her net earnings by the total hours worked: Hourly wage = Net earnings / Total hours worked = 36 / 18 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of the books and the cost of the pencils separately and then add them together.

The cost of the books is 3 * 16 = 48 dollars.
The cost of the pencils is 3 * 6 = 18 dollars.

Now, we add the cost of the books and the pencils together: 48 + 18 = 66 dollars.

The total amount spent is 66 dollars.

The final answer is: $66"
"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to first determine the total number of soda bottles he will place along the driveway. 

The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. To find the total number of bottles, we divide the width of the driveway by the spacing between the bottles:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Since it takes Richard 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, we multiply the number of bottles by the time it takes to place each one:

8 bottles * 5 seconds per bottle = 40 seconds

Therefore, it will take Richard 40 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find out how many packs Uncle Franky can make, we first need to determine the total number of apples he has. Since he ordered two boxes and each box has 40 apples, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of apples per box.

Total apples = 2 boxes * 40 apples/box = 80 apples

Next, we need to find out how many packs he can make with 80 apples. Since each pack has 8 apples, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per pack.

Number of packs = Total apples / apples per pack = 80 / 8 = 10

So, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how much money Amor will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she bought and subtract it from her initial cash.

The cost of 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese is 2 * $11 = $22.
The cost of 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese is 3 * $6 = $18.
The total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40.

Amor starts with $50, so subtracting the total cost of the cheese from her initial cash, we get:
$50 - $40 = $10.

Therefore, Amor will have $10 left to buy meat."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim lost due to loans and lost income while in college. 

First, let's calculate the total amount of loans he took: 
4 years * $50,000/year = $200,000

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money he lost due to not working while in college. 
His income before college was $25,000/year. 
His income after college is $25,000 * 3 = $75,000/year. 
The difference in income is $75,000 - $25,000 = $50,000/year. 
The total amount of money he lost due to not working while in college is $50,000/year * 4 years = $200,000.

The total amount of money he needs to earn is the sum of the loans and the lost income: 
$200,000 (loans) + $200,000 (lost income) = $400,000.

Now, let's calculate how long it would take him to earn this amount at his new income of $75,000/year:
Time = Total amount / Annual income
Time = $400,000 / $75,000
Time = 5.33 years

The final answer is: 5.33"
"To find the total area of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the two pieces of fabric. 

The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric that are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, we add 2 feet to both the length and the width of the bed.

New length = 6 + 2 = 8 feet
New width = 8 + 2 = 10 feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the new dimensions by 2 to get the total area of fabric needed.

Total length = 8 * 2 = 16 feet
Total width = 10 * 2 = 20 feet

Now, we multiply the total length and total width to get the total area of fabric needed.

Total area = Total length * Total width = 16 * 20 = 320 square feet

The total area of fabric Jim needs to buy is 320 square feet."
"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then add them together.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. 
One-fifth of 425 is 425 / 5 = 85. 
So, they delivered 85 + 17 = 102 letters on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. 
Twice as many as Tuesday is 102 * 2 = 204. 
So, they delivered 204 + 5 = 209 letters on Wednesday.

Now, let's add the number of letters delivered each day: 
425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736

Now, we add the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad together: $65 + $36 = $101.

The total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $101."
"To find the average loss, we need to calculate the total loss and then divide it by the number of races.

1. The first loss is $5.
2. The second win is $1 more than twice the first loss, so it's 2 * $5 + $1 = $11.
3. The third loss is 1.5 times the second win, so it's 1.5 * $11 = $16.50.
4. The total loss is the sum of the first loss and the third loss, minus the second win: $5 - $11 + $16.50 = $10.50.
5. The average loss is the total loss divided by the number of races: $10.50 / 3 = $3.50.

"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we first need to calculate their current heights.

Xavier's initial height was 4 feet, which is equivalent to 48 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches). He grew 3 inches over the summer, so his current height is 48 + 3 = 51 inches.

Cole's initial height was 50 inches, and he grew 2 inches over the summer, so his current height is 50 + 2 = 52 inches.

The difference in height between Cole and Xavier is 52 - 51 = 1 inch.

The final answer is: 1"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the share of the first person as x. 

Since the second person took $80 more than the first, the second person's share is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is 2(x + 80).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920.

Combine like terms: x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920.

Combine like terms again: 4x + 240 = 1920.

Subtract 240 from both sides: 4x = 1680.

Divide both sides by 4: x = 420.

The share of the first person is $420.

The final answer is: $420"
"To find the total hours worked by each painter, we need to calculate the total hours worked in 3 weeks and then divide it by the number of painters and the number of days they worked.

First, let's convert 3 weeks to days: 3 weeks = 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Since they worked 3/8ths of a day every day, we need to find the fraction of a day in hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3/8 of a day is (3/8) * 24 = 9 hours.

Now, we multiply the hours worked per day by the number of days: 9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours.

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4: 189 hours / 4 = 47.25 hours.

The final answer is: 47.25"
"Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. 

Since Rory retrieved four more balls in the first set than in the second, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set, which is given as 19. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for x, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Combine like terms:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms again:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

Number of balls in the first set = x + 4
= 6 + 4

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation of the car from 2007 to 2010.

The car was bought in 2007 for $20,000. 

The depreciation rate is 21% per year. 

First, we'll calculate the depreciation for 2008:
Depreciation in 2008 = 21% of $20,000 = 0.21 * $20,000 = $4,200
Price in 2008 = $20,000 - $4,200 = $15,800

Next, we'll calculate the depreciation for 2009:
Depreciation in 2009 = 21% of $15,800 = 0.21 * $15,800 = $3,318
Price in 2009 = $15,800 - $3,318 = $12,482

Finally, we'll calculate the depreciation for 2010:
Depreciation in 2010 = 21% of $12,482 = 0.21 * $12,482 = $2,623.22
Price in 2010 = $12,482 - $2,623.22 = $9,858.78

The price of the car in 2010 is $9,858.78."

"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to first calculate how many cups of water she drinks in 30 days. 

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. To find out how many cups she drinks in 30 days, we multiply the number of cups she drinks per day by 30.

8 cups/day * 30 days = 240 cups

Now, we need to convert the total number of cups to gallons. There are 16 cups in a gallon. To find out how many gallons, we divide the total number of cups by 16.

240 cups / 16 cups/gallon = 15 gallons

So, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days.

"To find out how many loads of laundry Greg does in a week, we need to calculate the total number of twin and king size sheets he puts on the beds and divide that by the number of sheets he can wash at a time.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. Since each twin bed requires 1 set of sheets and the king size bed requires 1 set of sheets, the total number of sheets he puts on the beds is 4 + 1 = 5.

Since he can wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 2 and 1, which is 2. This means he can wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set in 2 loads.

Now, let's calculate the number of loads he does in a week. He has 5 sets of sheets to wash, and he can wash 3 sets (2 twin + 1 king) in 2 loads. So, he needs 2 loads for the first 6 sets (4 twin + 1 king), and 1 more load for the remaining 1 twin set. Therefore, he does 2 + 1 = 3 loads of laundry in a week.

To find the total number of loads he does in a year, we multiply the number of loads he does in a week by the number of weeks in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total number of loads he does in a year is 3 * 52 = 156.

"To find out how many days the cat food will last, we need to divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the amount of cat food each cat eats per day (60 grams).

First, we need to calculate the total amount of cat food Imma's 3 cats eat per day. Since each cat eats 60 grams of food twice a day, we multiply 60 grams by 2 to get the daily amount per cat, and then multiply that by 3 to get the total daily amount for all 3 cats.

60 grams * 2 = 120 grams per cat per day
120 grams * 3 = 360 grams per day for all 3 cats

"Let's denote the time Donovan took as 'x'. Since Betsy took 18 minutes longer than Donovan, the time Betsy took is 'x + 18'. 

The total time taken to make the meal is the sum of the time taken by both Betsy and Donovan, which is given as 98 minutes. So, we can write the equation as x + (x + 18) = 98.

Combine like terms: 2x + 18 = 98.

Subtract 18 from both sides: 2x = 80.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 40.

Since x is the time Donovan took, and Betsy took 18 minutes longer, Betsy's time is x + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58.

"To find the total number of pizzas left, we first need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club and the football team.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. 
70% of 20 is 0.7 * 20 = 14 pizzas eaten by the glee club.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. 
They ate 80% of them, which is 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas eaten by the football team.

The total number of pizzas eaten is 14 (by the glee club) + 32 (by the football team) = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered is 20 (by the glee club) + 40 (by the football team) = 60 pizzas.

The number of pizzas left is the total number of pizzas ordered minus the total number of pizzas eaten, which is 60 - 46 = 14 pizzas.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the cost of mailing small coupons and big coupons separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of big coupons. Since Anthony wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, and he's sending out 700 small coupons, the number of big coupons is 2 * 700 = 1400.

The cost of mailing small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents.

The cost of mailing big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

Now, let's add the cost of mailing small and big coupons together: 3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100: 24500 / 100 = 245 dollars.

The final answer is: $245"
"To find out how many meatballs were in the sub sandwiches that remained, we need to calculate the total number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches initially ordered by Sidney, then subtract the number of meatballs eaten by Mark, and finally subtract the additional sub sandwiches ordered by Sidney.

Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which means he ordered 10 - 3 = 7 sub sandwiches.

Each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, so the total number of meatballs in the 7 sub sandwiches is 7 * 4 = 28.

Mark ate 4 of Sidney's sub sandwiches, which means 4 * 4 = 16 meatballs were eaten.

The remaining number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches is 28 - 16 = 12.

Sidney ordered 3 more sub sandwiches, which means 3 * 4 = 12 more meatballs were added.

The total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is 12 + 12 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we first need to find out how many trucks were still operational after the mechanical failures. 

Mr Hezekiah had 20 trucks dispatched, and a quarter of them had mechanical failures. A quarter of 20 is 20 / 4 = 5. 

So, 5 trucks had mechanical failures, leaving 20 - 5 = 15 trucks operational.

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser delivered is 15 trucks * 20 tons/truck = 300 tons.

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the total cost of the butter, we first need to determine how much Dennis needs to buy. Since he needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants and he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter.

Since the grocery store has a promotion for buy one pound of butter get one half off, we can calculate the cost as follows:

- For the first pound of butter, the cost is $4.00.
- For the second pound of butter, the cost is $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00 (since it's half off).
- For the third pound of butter, the cost is $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00 (since it's half off).
- For the fourth pound of butter, the cost is $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00 (since it's half off).
- For the fifth pound of butter, the cost is $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00 (since it's half off).
- For the sixth pound of butter, the cost is $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00 (since it's half off).

The total cost of the butter is $4.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 = $12.00.

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To find the total cost of the party, we need to calculate the number of additional guests beyond the initial 20 and then multiply that by the cost per additional guest. 

First, let's find the total number of guests: 
Kayla invited 25 classmates + 7 dance class girls + 13 family members = 45 guests. 
However, 4 people said they could not come, so the total number of guests is 45 - 4 = 41.

Since the initial 20 guests are included in the rental fee, we need to find the number of additional guests: 
41 total guests - 20 initial guests = 21 additional guests.

Now, we can calculate the cost for the additional guests: 
21 additional guests * $6 per guest = $126.

Adding the initial rental fee to the cost for the additional guests, we get: 
$125 (rental fee) + $126 (additional guests) = $251.

The final answer is: $251"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money Maggie and Riza had initially. Since they each had $60 after spending a portion of their money, we can set up an equation to represent the situation.

Let's say Maggie had x dollars initially. Since she spent a quarter of her money, she has 3/4x dollars left. Similarly, let's say Riza had y dollars initially. Since she spent one-third of her money, she has 2/3y dollars left.

We know that both of them have $60 left, so we can set up the following equations:

3/4x = 60
2/3y = 60

To solve for x and y, we can multiply both sides of each equation by the reciprocal of the fraction:

x = 60 * 4/3 = 80
y = 60 * 3/2 = 90

Now that we know Maggie had $80 initially and Riza had $90 initially, we can find the total amount of money they had:

Total money = x + y = 80 + 90 = 170

Since they spent a portion of their money, we need to add back the amount they spent to find the total amount of money they had initially. Maggie spent 1/4 of her money, which is 20 dollars, and Riza spent 1/3 of her money, which is 30 dollars. The total amount they spent is 20 + 30 = 50 dollars.

Total initial money = Total money + Total spent = 170 + 50 = 220

Now, we can find the total amount of money they have left:

Total money left = Total initial money - Total money = 220 - 120 = 100

However, this is not the answer we are looking for. We need to find the total amount of money they have left after they each had $60. 

Total money left = 60 + 60 = 120

The final answer is: $120"
"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we first need to determine how many bananas the first and second monkeys eat each day. 

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day.

Since there are three monkeys in total, the total number of bananas they eat each day is 10 + 14 + x, where x is the number of bananas the third monkey eats. However, we know that the total number of bananas is 315, and they last for a week, which is 7 days. 

So, the total number of bananas eaten in a week is 315 * 7 = 2205. 

Since the first two monkeys eat 10 + 14 = 24 bananas each day, the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day is (2205 - 24 * 7) / 7.

First, calculate 24 * 7 = 168. 
Then, subtract 168 from 2205: 2205 - 168 = 2037.
Now, divide 2037 by 7: 2037 / 7 = 291.

The third monkey eats 291 bananas each day. 

The final answer is: 291"
"To find out how many puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we need to determine how many pieces he placed in total and then subtract the pieces he placed before the hour. 

Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, which is 500 / 2 = 250 pieces. 

Then, he finished another 500 piece puzzle. 

So, in total, he placed 250 + 500 = 750 pieces. 

Since he already placed 250 pieces before the hour, we subtract those from the total to find out how many pieces he placed during the hour: 750 - 250 = 500.

The final answer is: 500"
"To find out how much Jenny paid for the roses, we need to determine if she bought the roses by the dozen or individually. Since she bought 15 roses, it's more cost-effective for her to buy a dozen (12 roses) and 3 individual roses. 

A dozen roses cost $15, and 3 individual roses cost 3 * $2 = $6. So, the total cost is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny arrived with five $5 bills, which is a total of 5 * $5 = $25. 

To find out how much change she gets, we subtract the cost of the roses from the amount she paid with: $25 - $21 = $4.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the $4 into quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so there are 4 * 4 = 16 quarters in $4.

Jenny leaves with 16 quarters.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to calculate the revenue from each item and add them together.

Revenue from milkshakes: 6 milkshakes * $5.50 each = 6 * 5.50 = $33
Revenue from burger platters: 9 burger platters * $11 each = 9 * 11 = $99
Revenue from sodas: 20 sodas * $1.50 each = 20 * 1.50 = $30

Total revenue = Revenue from milkshakes + Revenue from burger platters + Revenue from sodas
Total revenue = $33 + $99 + $30
Total revenue = $162

The final answer is: $162"
"To find the total waiting time for Paul, we need to calculate the time he needs to wait until the fourth train arrives.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the first train leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves the station, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves the station, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. The third train leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it also leaves at 125 minutes.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

Since Paul is currently at the station, we need to find the time difference between the current time (0 minutes) and the time the fourth train arrives (145 minutes). Therefore, Paul will wait for 145 minutes.

The final answer is: 145"
"To find out how many more weeks Melanie needs to save toothpicks, we first need to determine how many toothpicks she has saved so far. 

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week and has been saving for 12 weeks. 

Number of toothpicks saved = 10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Since Melanie needs 200 toothpicks for the sculpture, we need to find out how many more toothpicks she needs to save.

Number of toothpicks needed = 200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to save 80 toothpicks at a rate of 10 toothpicks per week.

Number of weeks = Number of toothpicks needed / Number of toothpicks saved per week
= 80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week
= 8 weeks

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to first find the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch and then the price at which he sold it to his friend.

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price, so the price he paid is:

$2000 * 0.75 = $1500

Then, he sold it to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, so the price his friend paid is:

$1500 * 1.20 = $1800

Now, to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to find the difference between the original price and the price his friend paid, and then divide it by the original price and multiply by 100:

($2000 - $1800) / $2000 * 100 = 10%

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours and then multiply it by the rate at which the springs create jellyfish.

There are 60 minutes in an hour and 60 seconds in a minute. So, the total number of seconds in 4 hours is:

60 minutes/hour * 60 seconds/minute * 4 hours = 14400 seconds

Since each spring creates a new jellyfish every second, the total number of jellyfish created by one spring in 14400 seconds is 14400.

Now, if we have 5 springs working at the same rate, the total number of jellyfish created in 14400 seconds is:

14400 * 5 = 72000

So, 5 springs working at the same rate would create 72000 jellyfish in 4 hours.

The final answer is: 72000"
"To find Frankie's score, we need to first calculate twice Binkie's score. Binkie's score is 90, so twice that would be 2 * 90 = 180.

Since Frankie's score is 15 better than twice Binkie's, we need to add 15 to the result. Frankie's score = 180 + 15 = 195.

The final answer is: 195"
"To find the total time James spent walking, we need to calculate the total distance he walked and then divide it by his walking speed.

First, let's find the total distance James walked. He walked to the store and then back home, so the total distance is 2 times the distance from home to the store, which is 2 * 4 = 8 miles.

Next, we divide the total distance by James' walking speed to find the total time: 8 miles / 4 miles per hour = 2 hours.

However, this is the total time for the round trip. Since James only wanted to know how long it took him to reach the store, we need to subtract the time it took him to walk back home. Since the distance to the store and back is the same, the time it took him to walk back home is also 2 hours. 

So, the time it took James to reach the store is 2 hours - 2 hours = 0 hours for the first half of the trip, then 2 hours to get back home, then 2 hours to get to the store.  0 + 2 + 2 = 4 hours.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much money Jenny saved, we need to calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually and compare it to the cost of buying them in bunches.

First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny bought: 10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch = 40 bananas.

If she bought the bananas individually, the cost would be: 40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.00.

Since she bought the bananas in bunches for $3.00 each, the total cost would be: 10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00.

To find out how much money she saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much fence each person gets. Let's say Sam gets x feet of fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets x + 60 feet of fence.

We know that the total amount of fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence. 

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the rate of growth per year, we need to divide the growth in inches by the number of years. 

Growth per year = 8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches/year

Now, we can multiply the growth per year by the total number of years to find the total growth in 13 years.

Total growth = 2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches

The final answer is: 26"
"To find out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply it by its price.

First, let's find the number of each type of bike sold:

- Total bikes sold: 300
- Trekking bikes: 300 / 2 = 150
- BMX bikes: 300 * 0.15 = 45
- MTB bikes: 300 - (150 + 45) = 105

Now, let's calculate the total earnings from each type of bike:
- Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500
- BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250 (since BMX is half the price of MTB, which is $500, so BMX is $500 / 2 = $250)
- MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500

Now, let's add up the earnings from all types of bikes:
$67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250

The final answer is: $131,250"
"To find out how many bales of hay are left in the field, we need to calculate the total number of bales made by the farmer and the total number of bales picked up by the truck, and then subtract the number of bales picked up from the number of bales made.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the farmer makes 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck picks up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

Since the truck picks up 18 bales, and the farmer makes 30 bales, the number of bales left in the field is 30 - 18 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total time John spends learning, we need to calculate the time spent in classes, and the extra time spent on Saturday and Sunday.

First, let's calculate the time spent in classes:
- John takes 2 extra classes per day, each 40 minutes long. 
- So, the total time spent in classes per day is 2 * 40 = 80 minutes.
- Since he goes to class for 5 days a week, the total time spent in classes per week is 80 * 5 = 400 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the extra time spent on Saturday and Sunday:
- John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on extra learning time.
- There are 7 days in a week, so the total minutes in a week is 7 * 24 * 60 = 1680 minutes.
- 1/16 of 1680 minutes is (1/16) * 1680 = 105 minutes.

Now, let's add the time spent in classes and the extra time spent on Saturday and Sunday:
- Total time spent learning per week = 400 minutes (classes) + 105 minutes (extra time) = 505 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:
- 505 minutes / 60 = 8.42 hours.

The final answer is: 8.42"
"To find the height of the ball on its second bounce, we need to calculate the height of the ball after the first bounce and then multiply it by 2/3.

The initial height of the ball is the height of the third floor, which is 24 feet.

On the first bounce, the ball reaches 2/3 of its initial height, so the height after the first bounce is:
24 * (2/3) = 16 feet

On the second bounce, the ball reaches 2/3 of the height it had after the first bounce, so the height after the second bounce is:
16 * (2/3) = 10.67 feet

The final answer is: 10.67"
"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the height of each child in inches. 

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the first child's height in inches is 6 * 12 = 72 inches.

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child's height is 72 + 2 = 74 inches.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child's height is 74 - 5 = 69 inches.

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child's height is 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

The final answer is: 72"
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to determine the number of bags sold and then multiply that by the price per bag.

Since the orchard sold a total of 2000 apples and each bag contains 10 apples, we can divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag to find the number of bags sold:

2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags

Now, we can multiply the number of bags sold by the price per bag to find the total earnings:

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The final answer is: $1000"
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the amount of meat left after the Allosaurus ate. 

The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat. Before that, the velociraptors scavenged half of what was left. 

Let's call the amount of meat left after the T-Rex ate 'x'. The velociraptors then ate half of 'x', which means they ate x/2 kilograms of meat. This leaves (x - x/2) = x/2 kilograms of meat for the Allosaurus.

Since the Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms, we can set up the equation: x/2 = 270.

To solve for 'x', we multiply both sides by 2: x = 270 * 2.

x = 540 kilograms.

Now, we know that the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, which means the triceratops had 540 * 2 kilograms of meat before the T-Rex ate.

540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms.

The final answer is: 1080"
"To find the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted and then divide it by the coverage of a gallon of paint to find out how many gallons are needed. After that, we can multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon to get the total cost.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so their total area is 2 x (10 x 8) = 160 square feet.
The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so their total area is 2 x (5 x 8) = 80 square feet.
The total area of all the walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

The cost per gallon is $12, so the total cost is 12 gallons x $12 per gallon = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To find the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to determine the probability of her choosing a shaken can out of the remaining cans.

Initially, there were 12 sodas. Ellen shook 3 of them, so 3 were shaken and 9 were unshaken. She took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 11 sodas. Her brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 2 shaken and 7 unshaken sodas.

The total number of sodas left is 2 + 7 = 9. The number of shaken sodas left is 2. 

The probability of Ellen's friend choosing a shaken can is the number of shaken cans divided by the total number of cans: 2/9.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (2/9) * 100 = 22.22%."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each train travels in 3 hours and then add those distances together.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will travel 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will travel 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, we need to add their distances together to find the total distance between them. So, the total distance is 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

"To find the total number of people Billy can help, we first need to determine the number of days he works. 

March has 31 days, and April has 19 days (since April 19th is the last day). So, the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th is 31 + 19 = 50 days.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, we need to find 20% of 50 days. To do this, we multiply 50 by 0.20 (which is 20% expressed as a decimal).

20% of 50 days = 0.20 * 50 = 10 days

Now, we subtract the number of days off from the total number of days to find the number of days Billy works.

50 days - 10 days = 40 days

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so we need to find the total number of hours he works in a day. 

3 hours/day

Since Billy works 40 days, we multiply the number of hours he works per day by the number of days he works.

Total hours worked = 3 hours/day * 40 days = 120 hours

Now, we multiply the total hours worked by the number of people he can help per hour.

Total people helped = 120 hours * 2 people/hour = 240 people

"To find the total number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people who were transported by the buses and the cars, and then subtract that from the total number of people who attended the wedding.

First, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the buses:
12 buses * 35 people per bus = 420 people

Next, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the cars:
20 cars * 3 people per car = 60 people

Now, let's add the number of people transported by the buses and the cars:
420 people + 60 people = 480 people

Since the total number of people who attended the wedding is the sum of the people inside the church and the people outside, we can assume that the number of people outside the church is the sum of the number of cars and buses, which is 20 + 12 = 32 people.

So, the total number of people who attended the wedding is 32 (outside) + 480 (inside) = 512 people.

To find the number of people inside the church, we subtract the number of people outside the church from the total number of people who attended the wedding:
512 people - 32 people = 480 people

"To find Jeff's age, we need to determine Martha's age first. Since Mike is 24 years old and Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, we can calculate Martha's age by subtracting 4 from Mike's age.

Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
Martha's age = 24 - 4
Martha's age = 20

Now that we know Martha's age, we can find Jeff's age since he is 10 years older than Martha.

Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
Jeff's age = 20 + 10
Jeff's age = 30

"To find the time it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of each slide by the speed at which people slide down.

For the biggest slide: 
Time = Length / Speed
Time = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute
Time = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide:
Time = Length / Speed
Time = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute
Time = 3 minutes

To find the difference in time, we subtract the time it takes to ride the second biggest slide from the time it takes to ride the biggest slide:
Difference = Time for biggest slide - Time for second biggest slide
Difference = 5 minutes - 3 minutes
Difference = 2 minutes

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 x 15-minute breaks per day. 
Total time spent per day = 30 minutes (lunch) + 2 x 15 minutes (breaks) = 30 + 30 = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60.
60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Bobby spends 1 hour per day on lunch and breaks. 
Total time spent in 5 days = 1 hour/day x 5 days = 5 hours

The total time spent on lunch and breaks after 5 days is 5 hours."
"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we first need to determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can multiply 8 by 3.5 to find out how many miles Micah ran.

8 miles * 3.5 = 28 miles

Now that we know Micah ran 28 miles, we can subtract the total miles run by Amber and Micah from the total miles run by all three to find out how many miles Ahito ran.

Total miles run by all three = 52 miles
Miles run by Amber = 8 miles
Miles run by Micah = 28 miles
Miles run by Ahito = Total miles run by all three - (Miles run by Amber + Miles run by Micah)
Miles run by Ahito = 52 - (8 + 28)
Miles run by Ahito = 52 - 36
Miles run by Ahito = 16

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total amount she spent after returning the item and then add it to the initial charge.

1. Initial charge: $85.00
2. Return: -$15.00 (since she returned an item)
   New balance after return: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

3. Frying pan purchase: 20% off $20.00
   Discount: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
   Price of frying pan: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00
   New balance: $70.00 + $16.00 = $86.00

4. Towel purchase: 10% off $30.00
   Discount: 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
   Price of towels: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00
   New balance: $86.00 + $27.00 = $113.00

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. 

A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is x/5.

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (x/5) * (1/3) = x/15.

The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue, so the number of small jellyfish is x - x/5 = 4x/5.

We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color, which means x/15 = 6.

To find the total number of jellyfish, we can solve for x: x/15 = 6 => x = 6 * 15 = 90.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find Caroline's age, we need to determine Ben's age first, and then multiply it by 3.

Since Chris is 4 years old, and Ben is two times older than Chris, we can calculate Ben's age as follows:
Ben's age = 2 * Chris's age
Ben's age = 2 * 4
Ben's age = 8

Now that we know Ben's age, we can find Caroline's age by multiplying Ben's age by 3:
Caroline's age = 3 * Ben's age
Caroline's age = 3 * 8
Caroline's age = 24

The final answer is: 24"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate Lauren's total savings needed for retirement and then determine how many years she needs to work to achieve this goal.

First, let's calculate Lauren's annual expenses in retirement. Since she plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary, her annual expenses will be:

40% of $100,000 = 0.4 x $100,000 = $40,000

Since Lauren plans to live for 20 years in retirement, her total expenses will be:

$40,000 x 20 = $800,000

Next, we need to calculate Lauren's annual savings. Since she saves 20% of her salary, her annual savings will be:

20% of $100,000 = 0.2 x $100,000 = $20,000

Now, we need to calculate how many years Lauren needs to work to save $800,000 at a rate of $20,000 per year:

Number of years = Total savings / Annual savings
= $800,000 / $20,000
= 40 years

However, this is the total number of years Lauren needs to work to save for retirement, but we are asked how many more years she needs to work. Since we don't know how many years she has already worked, we will assume she has worked for x years. Therefore, the number of years she needs to work is the difference between the total number of years and the years she has already worked.

Since we don't know the number of years she has already worked, we will assume she has worked for 0 years. Therefore, the number of years she needs to work is:

40 - 0 = 40 years

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the length of each final cut, we need to first divide the total length of the ribbon by 4 to get the length of each of the initial cuts. 

100 cm / 4 = 25 cm

Then, we need to divide the length of each initial cut by 5 to get the length of each final cut.

25 cm / 5 = 5 cm

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total population of the school, we can use the information given about the boys. Since 40% of the school population is 240 boys, we can set up the equation:

40% of total population = 240

To find the total population, we can convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100:

0.4 * total population = 240

Now, we can solve for the total population by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.4:

total population = 240 / 0.4
total population = 600

Now that we know the total population, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total population:

number of girls = total population - number of boys
number of girls = 600 - 240
number of girls = 360

The final answer is: 360"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items before applying the coupon. 

The cost of the set of pots is $19, and the cost of the sack of garden soil is $26. 

Total cost before coupon = Cost of pots + Cost of soil
Total cost before coupon = $19 + $26
Total cost before coupon = $45

Now, we need to subtract the coupon value from the total cost before coupon to find the final amount spent.

Final amount spent = Total cost before coupon - Coupon value
Final amount spent = $45 - $7
Final amount spent = $38

The final answer is: $38"
"To find the average height of heels at the party, we need to calculate the total height of all heels and then divide by the total number of women.

The three women wearing 4-inch heels have a total height of 3 x 4 = 12 inches.
The three women wearing 2-inch heels have a total height of 3 x 2 = 6 inches.

The total height of all heels is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.
There are 6 women in total.

The average height of heels is 18 / 6 = 3 inches."
"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad needs to hike, we first need to calculate the total number of days in June. June has 30 days.

Since Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in 30 days, we can calculate her daily target by dividing the total miles by the number of days:

9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

Soledad is planning to hike 125 miles twice a day, which is a total of 250 miles per day. To find out how many more miles per day she needs to hike, we subtract her planned daily miles from her target daily miles:

310 miles per day - 250 miles per day = 60 miles per day

So, Soledad needs to hike 60 more miles per day to complete her journey on time.

"To find out how much James will have left, we first need to determine how much Pierre and Paul will take. 

Pierre wants a quarter of 12 kg, which is 12 * 0.25 = 3 kg. 

Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg, which is 12 * (1/3) = 4 kg.

The total amount taken by Pierre and Paul is 3 + 4 = 7 kg.

Since there are three people (Pierre, Paul, and Jacques), and we are assuming the question is referring to Jacques as James, we can subtract the total taken by Pierre and Paul from the initial amount to find out how much Jacques will have left.

12 kg - 7 kg = 5 kg.

"To find out how much money Raymond has left, we need to subtract the amount he spent from the initial amount he had, and then add the amount he saved.

Raymond initially had $21. He saved $11, so we add that to his initial amount: $21 + $11 = $32.

Then, he spent $5 on a comic book and $19 on a puzzle, so we subtract the total amount he spent from the new total: $32 - ($5 + $19) = $32 - $24 = $8.

Therefore, Raymond has $8 left.

"To find out how much each book cost, we need to first determine how much Anna spent on the books. Since she had a budget of $16 and has $2 left, she spent $16 - $2 = $14 on the books.

Since Anna bought 2 books and they cost the same amount of money, we can divide the total amount spent ($14) by 2 to find the cost of each book.

Cost of each book = Total amount spent / Number of books
Cost of each book = $14 / 2
Cost of each book = $7

Additional female guppies: 1
Total female guppies: 7 + 1 = 8

Initial male goldfishes: 3
Additional male goldfishes: 2
Total male goldfishes: 3 + 2 = 5

Initial female goldfishes: 5
Additional female goldfishes: 3
Total female goldfishes: 5 + 3 = 8

Now, let's find the total number of male and female fishes:
Total male fishes: 6 (guppies) + 5 (goldfishes) = 11
Total female fishes: 8 (guppies) + 8 (goldfishes) = 16

To find the difference between the number of female and male fishes, we subtract the total number of male fishes from the total number of female fishes:

Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia, so Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours to walk the dog.

Dior took 4 hours longer than Amalia, so Dior took 4 + 4 = 8 hours to do laundry.

Now, let's add the time each person took to do their chores: 
4 (Amalia) + 6 (Megan) + 8 (Dior) = 18

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 18 hours."
"To find the total distance John drives in a round trip, we need to calculate the distance of a single trip and then multiply it by 2.

Distance = Speed * Time
Time for a single trip = 2 hours
Speed = 70 mph

Distance for a single trip = 70 mph * 2 hours = 140 miles

Since John makes two trips a month, we need to multiply the distance of a single trip by 2.
Total distance per month = 140 miles * 2 = 280 miles

"To find out how many miles Brian will walk in 7 days, we first need to determine how far Sofie will walk in 7 days. Since Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, we multiply 10 miles by 7 days.

10 miles/day * 7 days = 70 miles

Since Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days, we can set up an equation where Brian's distance is half of Sofie's distance. 

Let x be Brian's distance in 7 days. 
x = 70 miles / 2

x = 35 miles

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers and then find out how many toys the fifth worker needs to produce to meet the remaining demand.

First, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the 2 workers who produce 6 toys an hour:

2 workers * 6 toys/hour * 10 hours = 120 toys

Next, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour:

2 workers * 4 toys/hour * 10 hours = 80 toys

Now, let's add the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers:

120 toys + 80 toys = 200 toys

Since the manufacturer still needs 20 toys to meet the order, the total number of toys needed is 400. We can set up an equation to find the number of toys produced by the fifth worker:

200 toys (produced by the first 4 workers) + x toys (produced by the fifth worker) = 400 toys

Subtracting 200 from both sides of the equation gives us:

x = 200 toys

However, this is the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker in 10 hours. To find the number of toys produced per hour, we need to divide by 10:

x / 10 = 20 toys/hour

"To find the total weight of Elijah's dogs, we first need to find the weight of each of his dogs. 

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so we multiply 60 by 1/4 to find the weight of Elijah's first dog: 60 * (1/4) = 15 pounds.

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so we multiply 60 by 1/2 to find the weight of Elijah's second dog: 60 * (1/2) = 30 pounds.

Now, we add the weights of Elijah's two dogs to find the total weight of his dogs: 15 + 30 = 45 pounds.

To find the total weight of all three dogs, we add the weight of Kory's dog to the total weight of Elijah's dogs: 60 + 45 = 105 pounds.

The final answer is: 105"
"To solve this problem, let's work backwards from the information given.

Kris had 7 stickers left after giving some to Rob. Kris had 9 stickers and gave 7 to Rob, so Kris had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers before giving any to Rob.

Luis gave the rest of the stickers to Kris, and Kris had 16 stickers. This means Luis had 16 + 7 = 23 stickers before giving any to Kris.

Luis used half of the stickers and gave the rest to Kris. This means Luis had 23 stickers and gave half of them to Kris. Half of 23 is 11.5, but since you can't give half a sticker, we'll assume Luis had an even number of stickers. Let's try 24 stickers. Half of 24 is 12, which is a whole number.

So, Luis had 24 stickers before giving any to Kris. 

Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. Luis had 24 stickers, so Seth must have had 24 * 2 = 48 stickers in the beginning.

"To find the total number of M&M's John has, we need to calculate the total weight of the M&M's and then multiply it by the number of M&M's per ounce. 

First, let's find the total weight of the M&M's: 3 large bags * 10 ounces per bag = 30 ounces.

Since an ounce of M&M's has 30 M&M's, the total number of M&M's is 30 ounces * 30 M&M's per ounce = 900 M&M's.

Now, we need to find out how many small bags John can make. Each small bag contains 10 M&M's, so we divide the total number of M&M's by 10: 900 M&M's / 10 M&M's per small bag = 90 small bags.

"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we need to first calculate half of the circumference of the earth. 

Half of the circumference of the earth is 40,000 km / 2 = 20,000 km.

Since Alfie flies 400 km every day, we can find the number of days it will take him to fly 20,000 km by dividing 20,000 km by 400 km/day.

20,000 km / 400 km/day = 50 days

"To find the speed of the fastest car, we need to first find the speed of the 2nd fastest car. 

Given that the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, and the average car can go 120 miles per hour, we can calculate the speed of the 2nd fastest car as follows:

Speed of 2nd fastest car = 5 * Speed of average car
= 5 * 120
= 600 miles per hour

Now, we know that the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. So, we can calculate the speed of the fastest car as follows:

Speed of fastest car = 1.25 * Speed of 2nd fastest car
= 1.25 * 600
= 750 miles per hour

The final answer is: 750"
"To find Vince's current age, we first need to determine Liam's age two years ago. Since Liam is 16 now, two years ago he was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.

Two years ago, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince, so we can set up the equation: 14 = 2 * Vince's age two years ago.

To find Vince's age two years ago, we divide both sides of the equation by 2: Vince's age two years ago = 14 / 2 = 7.

Since we want to find Vince's current age, we need to add 2 to his age two years ago: Vince's current age = 7 + 2 = 9.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold as A, Madeline as M, Camden as C, and Sarah as S.

We know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so A = M.

We also know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. This can be expressed as C + S = 30 and C = S + 12.

We can rewrite the second equation as C = S + 12 and substitute it into the first equation: (S + 12) + S = 30.

Combine like terms: 2S + 12 = 30.

Subtract 12 from both sides: 2S = 18.

Divide both sides by 2: S = 9.

Now that we know S, we can find C by substituting S into the equation C = S + 12: C = 9 + 12 = 21.

Since A = M, and the total number of eggs is 56, we can write the equation A + M + C + S = 56.

Substitute the values of A, M, C, and S: A + A + 21 + 9 = 56.

Combine like terms: 2A + 30 = 56.

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2A = 26.

Divide both sides by 2: A = 13.

Now that we know A and C, we can find the difference between the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold: C - A = 21 - 13 = 8.

"To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we first need to find the total number of boxes and the total weight of the crayons and boxes.

Nik has 200 crayons and wants to put them into boxes of 8 crayons each. To find the total number of boxes, we divide the total number of crayons by the number of crayons per box:

200 crayons / 8 crayons per box = 25 boxes

Since each box weighs 8 ounces and there are 16 ounces in a pound, we need to find the total weight of the boxes in ounces first. 

25 boxes * 8 ounces per box = 200 ounces

Now, we need to find the total weight of the crayons. Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, and there are 200 crayons:

200 crayons * 1 ounce per crayon = 200 ounces

The total weight of the crayons and boxes is the sum of their individual weights:

200 ounces (boxes) + 200 ounces (crayons) = 400 ounces

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we can convert the total weight from ounces to pounds by dividing by 16:

400 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 25 pounds

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how much John makes, we first need to determine how many logs he can make from the tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, we calculate 80% of 80 feet.

80% of 80 feet = 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet

Since each log is 4 feet long, we divide the total length of the usable tree by the length of each log to find out how many logs he can make.

64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs

From each log, he cuts 5 planks. So, we multiply the number of logs by the number of planks per log.

16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks

He sells each plank for $1.2, so we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank.

80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, which is 2 * ($5000 + $10,000) = 2 * $15,000 = $30,000.

Now, we can find the total amount of money they all have together by adding their individual monthly earnings: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The final answer is: $40,000."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the speed at which Grandma walks on the beach and the sidewalk. Let's denote the speed on the beach as x miles per minute. Since she walks at twice the rate on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.

We know that she spends 40 minutes walking on the beach, which is 2 miles. We can use the formula: speed = distance / time. So, for the beach, we have x = 2 miles / 40 minutes. 

Solving for x, we get x = 2/40 = 1/20 miles per minute.

Now, we know her speed on the sidewalk is 2x = 2 * (1/20) = 1/10 miles per minute.

The time it takes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk is 1 / (1/10) = 10 minutes.

The total time spent walking on the sidewalk is 1 mile * 10 minutes/mile = 10 minutes.

The total time spent walking on the beach is 40 minutes.

The total time spent walking is 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

"To find out how many more weeks it will take Jane to save a total of $60, we first need to calculate how much she has saved so far. 

Jane has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so the total amount she has saved is:
$4/week * 8 weeks = $32

Now, we need to find out how much more she needs to save to reach her goal of $60:
$60 (goal) - $32 (already saved) = $28

Since she saves $4 per week, we can divide the remaining amount by her weekly savings to find out how many more weeks it will take:
$28 / $4/week = 7 weeks

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

3 trees * 7 blue birds/tree = 21 blue birds

Next, let's calculate the number of blue birds in the 2 trees with 4 blue birds each:
2 trees * 4 blue birds/tree = 8 blue birds

Then, we add the number of blue birds in the tree with 3 blue birds:
8 blue birds + 3 blue birds = 11 blue birds

Now, we add the number of blue birds in the first group of trees to the number of blue birds in the second group:
21 blue birds + 11 blue birds = 32 blue birds

The total number of blue birds in the trees is 32.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many marbles Bob initially has. We know that if he receives 2 dozen (24) more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. 

Let's denote the initial number of marbles Bob has as 'x'. Then, the equation can be written as:

x + 24 = 60

To find 'x', we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 24 from both sides:

x = 60 - 24
x = 36

So, Bob initially has 36 marbles. 

Now, if he loses 10 marbles, we need to subtract 10 from the initial number of marbles:

36 - 10 = 26

Therefore, Bob will have 26 marbles.

Let's denote the temperature of the second bottle as x degrees. 

When Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle, the total volume of water in the bottle is 5 ounces. 

Since the temperature of the mixture is at least 40 degrees, we can set up the following equation:

(33 * 4 + x * 1) / 5 >= 40

Simplifying the equation:

132 + x >= 200

Subtracting 132 from both sides:

x >= 68

So, the second bottle must be at least 68 degrees.

First, let's calculate the number of cows:

Initial number of cows = 50
Cows brought by Milkie Cows Limited per day = 20
Number of days in three weeks = 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days
Total cows brought by Milkie Cows Limited = 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
Total number of cows = 50 + 420 = 470 cows

Next, let's calculate the number of chickens:

Initial number of chickens = 20
Chickens brought by Broilers Limited per day = 10
Total chickens brought by Broilers Limited = 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens
Total number of chickens = 20 + 210 = 230 chickens

Now, let's add the total number of cows and chickens to find the total number of animals on the farm:

Total number of animals = Total number of cows + Total number of chickens
= 470 + 230
= 700

The final answer is: 700"
"To find the cost of each single bagel, we first need to calculate the total cost of the 4 packs of bagels with the discount, and then divide that by the total number of bagels.

The cost of 4 packs of bagels without discount is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00.

Since Russell receives a 10% discount, the discount amount is 10% of $40.00, which is 0.1 * $40.00 = $4.00.

The total cost after the discount is $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Each pack has 9 bagels, so 4 packs have 4 * 9 = 36 bagels.

The cost of each single bagel is $36.00 / 36 = $1.00.

The final answer is: $1.00"
"To find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate, we first need to determine how many scoops 1 less than 3 scoops is. 3 scoops - 1 scoop = 2 scoops.

Now, we know it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops.

Since Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops, we need to find out how many scoops that is. 23 - 5 = 18 scoops.

Now, we know it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops. To find out how many scoops 18 scoops is in terms of 2 scoops, we divide 18 by 2. 18 / 2 = 9. 

Since 3 potatoes make 2 scoops, to find out how many potatoes make 9 scoops, we multiply 3 by 9. 3 * 9 = 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"To find the total number of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we need to calculate the number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately, and then add them together.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days is:
3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

In the next 30 days, Chester increases his egg consumption to 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in the next 30 days is:
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Now, we add the total number of eggs from both periods:
90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens:
240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozen eggs

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we first need to determine the total number of red jellybeans. We know that there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans, and there are 17 green jellybeans. 

So, the number of red jellybeans = 2 * 17 = 34.

We also know that the total number of jellybeans is 60. We can find the total number of green and red jellybeans by adding the number of green and red jellybeans: 17 (green) + 34 (red) = 51.

Now, we can find the number of blue jellybeans by subtracting the total number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans: 60 (total) - 51 (green and red) = 9.

"To find the number of women who remained on the bus, we first need to find the total number of women on the bus initially. 

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, we can let the number of men be 5x and the number of women be 9x. 

Since the total number of passengers is 84, we can set up the equation: 5x + 9x = 84

Combine like terms: 14x = 84

Divide both sides by 14: x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of women on the bus initially: 9x = 9 * 6 = 54

After 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining is: 54 - 20 = 34

"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold, we need to first determine how many bouquets he sold. We know that each bouquet has 12 sunflowers and costs $8. 

Faraday earned $56 from the bouquets per day. To find out how many bouquets he sold, we can divide the total earnings from bouquets by the cost of each bouquet: $56 / $8 = 7 bouquets per day.

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the total number of sunflowers sold from bouquets per day is 7 * 12 = 84 sunflowers.

We also know that Faraday earned $26 from the sunflowers per day. Since each sunflower costs $2, we can find out how many sunflowers he sold per day by dividing the total earnings from sunflowers by the cost of each sunflower: $26 / $2 = 13 sunflowers per day.

To find the total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days, we add the sunflowers sold from bouquets and the sunflowers sold individually: 84 + 13 * 3 = 84 + 39 = 123 sunflowers.

The final answer is: 123"
"To find out how much money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks he buys, the revenue from selling 60% of the rocks, and then find the difference between the two.

First, let's find out how many rocks Adam can buy with $100. Since each rock costs $5, we divide $100 by $5:

$100 / $5 = 20 rocks

Now, Adam sells 60% of his inventory, which is 60% of 20 rocks:

60% of 20 = 0.6 * 20 = 12 rocks

Since Adam sells each rock for $7, the total revenue from selling 12 rocks is:

12 rocks * $7/rock = $84

The total cost of buying 20 rocks is:

20 rocks * $5/rock = $100

Now, let's find the difference between the total revenue and the total cost:

Total revenue: $84
Total cost: $100
Loss: $100 - $84 = $16

"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of days it takes Lauren to complete each type of picture scene. 

First, let's find the number of days it takes Lauren to complete each type of picture scene:

- Large-sized picture scenes: 45 / 5 = 9 days
- Medium-sized picture scenes: 36 / 6 = 6 days
- Small-sized picture scenes: 49 / 7 = 7 days

Now, we need to find the LCM of 9, 6, and 7. 

The prime factorization of 6 is 2 * 3.
The prime factorization of 7 is 7.
The prime factorization of 9 is 3^2.

To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the numbers:
- The highest power of 2 is 2^1 (from 6).
- The highest power of 3 is 3^2 (from 9).
- The highest power of 7 is 7^1 (from 7).

The LCM is 2^1 * 3^2 * 7^1 = 2 * 9 * 7 = 126.

"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning. 

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which is 0.2 in decimal form. 

The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability is 3 times the probability of the first ticket. Since the first ticket has a 20% chance, the second ticket has a 60% chance (3 * 20% = 60%). In decimal form, this is 0.6.

To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning: 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many seashells Carrey collected first. Let's denote the number of seashells Carrey collected as 'x'. Since Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, Carlos collected 2x seashells. We are given that Jim collected 5 more than Carlos, so Jim collected 2x + 5 seashells.

We know that the total number of seashells collected is the sum of the seashells collected by each person: x + 2x + (2x + 5) = 5x + 5.

Since they divided the seashells equally among themselves, the total number of seashells (5x + 5) is divided by 3 (the number of people). So, we can set up the equation (5x + 5) / 3 = y, where y is the number of seashells each person gets.

However, we are not given the total number of seashells collected, but we are given the number of seashells Jim collected, which is 27. We can use this information to find the value of x. Since Jim collected 27 seashells, we can set up the equation 2x + 5 = 27.

Solving for x, we get 2x = 22, and x = 11. 

Now that we know x, we can find the total number of seashells collected: 5x + 5 = 5(11) + 5 = 60.

Since they divided the seashells equally among themselves, each person gets 60 / 3 = 20 seashells.

"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song first. 

The second song is 60% longer than the first song, which is 5 minutes. To find 60% of 5 minutes, we multiply 5 by 0.6 (which is the decimal form of 60%). 

5 * 0.6 = 3 minutes

So, the second song is 3 minutes longer than the first song. To find the total length of the second song, we add 3 minutes to the length of the first song.

5 + 3 = 8 minutes

Now, we have the lengths of both songs: the first song is 5 minutes and the second song is 8 minutes. To find the total time of the cassette, we add the lengths of both songs.

5 + 8 = 13 minutes

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes.

"To find the length of Carl's cane, we need to determine Carl's height first. We know that Isabel is 7 feet tall and Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel. 

Isabel's height = 7 feet
Ned's height = Isabel's height - 2 feet
Ned's height = 7 - 2
Ned's height = 5 feet

Since Carl is one foot taller than Ned, we can calculate Carl's height as follows:
Carl's height = Ned's height + 1 foot
Carl's height = 5 + 1
Carl's height = 6 feet

We are given that Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. To find the length of the cane, we can divide Carl's height by 2:
Cane's length = Carl's height / 2
Cane's length = 6 / 2
Cane's length = 3 feet

"To find out how many bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles required to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

Since each bottle covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, we need 100 / 20 = 5 bottles.

For 2300 people, we need 2300 * 5 = 11500 bottles.

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, to find out how many more bottles it needs to produce, we subtract the number of bottles it can produce from the total number of bottles required: 11500 - 4200 = 7300.

The final answer is: 7300"
"To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we first need to determine the number of babies wearing purple and bows, and the total number of babies wearing bows.

Carla has 8 babies, and 3/4 of them wear purple. So, the number of babies wearing purple is 8 * (3/4) = 6.

1/4 of the babies wear blue, so the number of babies wearing blue is 8 * (1/4) = 2.

Now, we need to find the number of babies wearing purple and bows. 1/3 of the purple babies wear bows, so the number of babies wearing purple and bows is 6 * (1/3) = 2.

The total number of babies wearing bows is the sum of the babies wearing blue and bows, and the babies wearing purple and bows. This is 2 (blue and bows) + 2 (purple and bows) = 4.

The probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is the number of babies wearing purple and bows divided by the total number of babies wearing bows. This is 2/4 = 0.5 or 50%.

"To find the total amount of money Abraham will earn, we need to calculate the amount of money he earned from each sale and add them together.

First, Abraham sold half of his land for $50. Since he owns 80 square meters, half of that is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters. 

Next, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. Since he owns 80 square meters, 1/4 of that is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters. 

Now, let's calculate the amount of land he has left. He started with 80 square meters, sold 40 square meters, and then sold 20 square meters. So, he has 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters left.

He sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, the amount of money he earned from selling the remaining land is 20 * 3 = $60.

First, let's find the total number of apartments in the first two complexes:
200 apartments * 2 = 400 apartments

The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, so we need to find 60% of 400 and add it to 400:
60% of 400 = 0.6 * 400 = 240
Total apartments in the last complex = 400 + 240 = 640
Total apartments in all complexes = 400 + 400 + 640 = 1440

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so the total number of collections per week is:
1440 apartments * 3 collections/week = 4320 collections/week

John gets paid $0.40 per collection, so the total amount he makes per week is:

"To find the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and add them up.

- In the 5th year, the tree produces 50 fruits.
- In the 6th year, it produces 3 times the initial amount, which is 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
- In the 7th year, it produces 7 times the initial amount, which is 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
- In the 8th year, it produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree, but we don't know the production of a 10-year-old tree yet. Let's denote the production of a 10-year-old tree as 'x'. So, in the 8th year, it produces x - 200 fruits.
- In the 9th year, the tree doesn't produce any fruit.
- In the 10th year, a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

We know that in the 10th year, a 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits. Since the 8th year production is 200 fruits less than the 10-year-old tree, the 8th year production is 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits produced by the tree in 10 years:

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as B, the length of the yellow rope as Y, and the length of the red rope as R. 

We know that R = 4B and B = Y - 7. 

We also know that R + B + Y = 37. 

Substituting R = 4B into the equation R + B + Y = 37, we get 4B + B + Y = 37, which simplifies to 5B + Y = 37.

Substituting B = Y - 7 into the equation 5B + Y = 37, we get 5(Y - 7) + Y = 37. 

Expanding the equation, we get 5Y - 35 + Y = 37. 

Combining like terms, we get 6Y - 35 = 37. 

Adding 35 to both sides, we get 6Y = 72. 

Dividing both sides by 6, we get Y = 12.

Now that we know Y, we can find B by substituting Y into the equation B = Y - 7. B = 12 - 7 = 5.

Now that we know B, we can find R by substituting B into the equation R = 4B. R = 4 * 5 = 20.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume Ronnie was given $5. Since Rissa was given thrice as much, Rissa was given 3 * $5 = $15.

After each of them gave an equal amount of money to their little sister, let's call the amount they gave 'x'. So, Ronnie is left with $5 - x and Rissa is left with $15 - x.

We are given that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, which means (15 - x) = (4/5) * 15. 

To find the value of x, we can solve the equation: 
(15 - x) = (4/5) * 15
15 - x = 12
x = 3

Now that we know x, we can find out how much money Ronnie is left with:
Ronnie's money left = $5 - x

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the amount of red, white, and purple paint as R, W, and P respectively. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, we can say R = W = P.

We are given that half the mural is yellow, which means the other half is painted with red, white, and purple. Since the total amount of paint used is 12 pints, and half of it is yellow, the other half is also 6 pints (12 / 2 = 6).

Since the other half is painted with red, white, and purple, and there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple, we can say that R + W + P = 6.

We also know that R = W = P, so we can substitute W and P with R in the equation: R + R + R = 6.

Combine like terms: 3R = 6.

Divide both sides by 3: R = 2.

So, the amount of red paint used is 2 pints.

"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house, then add them together.

First, let's find the area of one bedroom: 
Area of one bedroom = length * width = 20 * 12 = 240 square feet.

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms = 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area = 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is given as 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas together: 
Total area = area of bedrooms + area of living room + area of the rest of the house
Total area = 960 + 1200 + 1000
Total area = 3160 square feet.

"To find out how many dishwashing cycles you can run with the new box for $1, we first need to determine how many pods are in the new box. 

The new box has 20% more pods than the regular box. Since the regular box has 100 pods, we can calculate the number of pods in the new box as follows:

New box pods = 100 + (20% of 100)
New box pods = 100 + (0.2 * 100)
New box pods = 100 + 20
New box pods = 120

Now, we know that the new box has 120 pods. To find out how many dishwashing cycles you can run for $1, we need to divide the number of pods by the cost of the box ($12) and then multiply by the cost of one cycle ($1).

Number of cycles per dollar = (New box pods / Cost of the box) * Cost of one cycle
Number of cycles per dollar = (120 / 12) * 1
Number of cycles per dollar = 10

So, you can run 10 dishwashing cycles with the new box for $1.

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since he withdraws 1000 dollars in 20 dollar bills, he has 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home. So, he has 50 - 10 = 40 bills left.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he uses 20 bills to pay for the bill. This leaves him with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

4. Thomas then triples his money. Since he has 20 bills left, and each bill is worth $20, he has 20 * 20 = $400. Tripling this amount gives him 3 * 400 = $1200.

5. He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. To find out how many 5 dollar bills he has, we need to divide the total amount by 5. 1200 / 5 = 240.

The final answer is: 240"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals in the first half.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals.

Now, we need to find out how many goals team A scored in the second half. It is given that team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B in the second half. Since team B scored 8 goals in the second half, team A scored 8 * 1/4 = 2 goals in the second half.

Now, let's calculate the total number of goals scored by each team in the match. Team A scored 4 goals in the first half and 2 goals in the second half, for a total of 4 + 2 = 6 goals. Team B scored 2 goals in the first half and 8 goals in the second half, for a total of 2 + 8 = 10 goals.

The total number of goals scored in the match is the sum of the goals scored by both teams, which is 6 + 10 = 16.

"To find out how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we need to determine how much chalk is left after Monday and then calculate how many days it will last at the 20% usage rate.

The teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk. On Monday, he used 45% of it. 

First, let's find out how much chalk was used on Monday: 
45% of 5 inches = 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches

Now, let's find out how much chalk is left after Monday: 
5 inches - 2.25 inches = 2.75 inches

Since the teacher recycles the chalk when it's smaller than 2 inches, we need to find out how many days the remaining 2.75 inches will last at the 20% usage rate.

Let's set up an equation to find the number of days (x):
2.75 inches * 0.20 = 2 inches (the point at which the chalk is recycled)

Now, let's solve for x:
0.20x = 2
x = 2 / 0.20
x = 10

"To find the number of students not on varsity, we first need to find the total number of students on varsity. 

One-third of the girls are on varsity, so the number of girls on varsity is 12 * (1/3) = 4. 
One-fourth of the boys are on varsity, so the number of boys on varsity is 12 * (1/4) = 3.

The total number of students on varsity is 4 (girls) + 3 (boys) = 7.

The total number of students in the class is 12 (boys) + 12 (girls) = 24.

The number of students not on varsity is 24 (total students) - 7 (students on varsity) = 17.

"To find out how many face masks Johnny bought, we need to first determine how many face masks Mike bought, and then calculate three times that amount and add 2.

Mike bought 5 face masks. 

Three times the number of face masks Mike bought is 3 * 5 = 15.

Johnny bought 2 more than three times as many as Mike, so we add 2 to 15: 15 + 2 = 17.

"To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we need to first determine the total number of teeth the dentist worked on. The dentist drilled 4 teeth and capped 7 more than he drilled, so the number of teeth capped is 4 + 7 = 11.

The total number of teeth the dentist worked on is 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15.

To find the percentage of teeth the dentist fixed, we divide the number of teeth worked on by the total number of teeth James has, and then multiply by 100.

Percentage = (15 / 30) * 100
Percentage = 0.5 * 100
Percentage = 50%

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Colin's current age as C and Wendy's current age as W.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:

W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:

C + 25 = (5/3)(C + 7)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2:

20 = C

Colin is 20 years old now.

"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we first need to determine the total number of books he can buy with $27,000. 

Since he can buy 100 books for $500, we can find the total number of books he can buy by dividing $27,000 by $500.

$27,000 / $500 = 54 books

Now, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books he can buy per school.

54 books / 3 schools = 18 books per school

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, 2 apples fell out of the tree. Newton picked up 2 apples, so he had 2 apples in his hand.
2. He put 1 apple in his pocket, leaving 1 apple in his hand. Then, he threw the apple in his hand into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. Now, he has 1 (in his pocket) + 5 (new apples) = 6 apples in his hand.
3. He put all but 1 of these 6 apples in his pocket, leaving 1 apple in his hand. So, he has 1 (in his pocket) + 1 (in his hand) = 2 apples in his hand.
4. He threw the remaining apple in his hand at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out. Now, he has 1 (in his pocket) + 6 (new apples) = 7 apples in his hand.
5. He picked up all the remaining apples, which are the 7 apples in his hand.

Therefore, Newton brought home 7 apples to make a pie.

"To find the total cost of Ali's order, we need to calculate the total number of coal bags and multiply it by the cost per bag.

First, let's find the total number of coal bags:
Total coal in kilos = 850 kg
Weight of each bag = 50 kg
Number of bags = Total coal in kilos / Weight of each bag
= 850 kg / 50 kg
= 17 bags

Now, let's find the total cost:
Cost per bag = $18
Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag

"To find out how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of slices each type of pizza is needed for. 

For the cheese pizza, each friend eats 6 slices, and there are 6 friends, so the total number of cheese pizza slices needed is 6 friends * 6 slices/friend = 36 slices. 

For the pepperoni pizza, each friend eats 4 slices, and there are 6 friends, so the total number of pepperoni pizza slices needed is 6 friends * 4 slices/friend = 24 slices.

Since the cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices and the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, we need to find out how many whole pizzas of each type are needed. 

For the cheese pizza, we need 36 slices / 12 slices/pizza = 3 pizzas. 

For the pepperoni pizza, we need 24 slices / 8 slices/pizza = 3 pizzas.

Since Kate needs 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas, she needs a total of 3 + 3 = 6 pizzas.

"To find the total miles Sam ran this week, we need to calculate the miles run on each day and add them together.

On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Sam ran 3 miles each day. So, the total miles run on these days is 3 * 3 = 9 miles.

On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day. So, the total miles run on these days is 5 * 2 = 10 miles.

Now, we add the miles run on both sets of days: 9 miles + 10 miles = 19 miles.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the net rate at which Jay is building snowballs. 

Jay builds 20 snowballs in 1 hour, which is equivalent to 60 minutes. So, his rate of building snowballs is 20/60 = 1/3 snowballs per minute.

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. To find the rate at which snowballs melt, we divide the number of snowballs that melt by the time it takes for them to melt: 2/15 snowballs per minute.

Now, we need to find the net rate of snowball building. To do this, we subtract the rate of melting from the rate of building: (1/3) - (2/15) = (5/15) - (2/15) = 3/15 = 1/5 snowballs per minute.

Since Jay wants to have 60 snowballs, and he builds 1/5 snowballs per minute, we can find the time it takes to build 60 snowballs by dividing 60 by 1/5. 

60 / (1/5) = 60 * 5 = 300 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Jay 300 minutes to have 60 snowballs.

"To find Jim's age, we need to first determine John's age 20 years ago. Since John is 28 now, we subtract 20 from his current age to find his age at the time of the Digimon release.

John's age 20 years ago = 28 - 20 = 8

Since John was twice as old as Jim 20 years ago, we can set up an equation to find Jim's age at that time:

John's age 20 years ago = 2 * Jim's age 20 years ago
8 = 2 * Jim's age 20 years ago

To find Jim's age 20 years ago, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

Jim's age 20 years ago = 8 / 2
Jim's age 20 years ago = 4

Now, we need to find Jim's current age by adding 20 to his age 20 years ago:

Jim's current age = Jim's age 20 years ago + 20
Jim's current age = 4 + 20
Jim's current age = 24

Doxa ate 1 slice of apple. 
Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so her sister ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.
Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so her brother ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

Now, let's add up the slices eaten by each of them: 
Doxa ate 1 slice, her sister ate 2 slices, and her brother ate 3 slices. 
So, the total number of slices eaten is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, the remaining bandages after the first day are x - 38 + 50 = x + 12.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. The remaining bandages after the second day are (x + 12) - 28 = x - 16.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages (2 * 50 = 100 bandages) and used half a pack (50 / 2 = 25 bandages). The remaining bandages after the third day are (x - 16) - 25 + 100 = x + 59.

We are given that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 59 = 78

To solve for x, we subtract 59 from both sides of the equation:

x = 78 - 59
x = 19

The initial number of bandages is 19.

"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to calculate her regular pay and her attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her regular pay. She works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week, and there are 4 weeks in April. 

Total hours worked in a week = 7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week = 45 hours/week
Total hours worked in April = 45 hours/week * 4 weeks = 180 hours

Her hourly rate is $1.5, so her total regular pay for April is:
Total regular pay = 180 hours * $1.5/hour = $270

Since Jen has complete attendance for the month, she receives an additional $10 for each day. There are 6 days in a week, and 4 weeks in April, so she has:
Total days worked = 6 days/week * 4 weeks = 24 days

Her attendance bonus is:
Attendance bonus = $10/day * 24 days = $240

Total earnings for April = Total regular pay + Attendance bonus
Total earnings for April = $270 + $240
Total earnings for April = $510

"To find the total amount John spent, we first need to determine the cost of the scotch and the cognac separately.

The cost of the scotch is $600 for 10 bottles. To find the cost per bottle, we divide the total cost by the number of bottles: $600 / 10 = $60 per bottle.

Since John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The cost of the cognac is 50% more than the scotch. 50% of $60 is $30, so the cost of the cognac per bottle is $60 + $30 = $90.

The total cost of the cognac is 20 bottles * $90 per bottle = $1800.

The total amount John spent is the sum of the cost of the scotch and the cognac: $600 + $1800 = $2400.

Now, we know that one dose consists of 14 mL of the first medicine and 42 mL of the second medicine. To find the total amount of one dose, we add these two amounts together.

14 mL + 42 mL = 56 mL

Since we need to find the total amount of medicine in 8 doses, we multiply the amount of one dose by 8.

56 mL * 8 = 448 mL

The final answer is: 448"
"To find the combined capacity of both schools, we first need to find the capacity of John's school. 

Since each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, and Ali's class has 120 students, each of John's classes has 120 / 8 = 15 students.

John has two classes, so the total capacity of his school is 15 * 2 = 30 students.

The capacity of Ali's school is 120 students. 

The combined capacity of both schools is 120 + 30 = 150 students.

The final answer is: 150"
"To find the total amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we first need to calculate the total interest he owes his sister. 

The interest is 2% of the initial $300, which is 0.02 * 300 = $6. 

However, Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, which is a total of 11 * 25 = $275.

The remaining amount, including the interest, will be paid in the twelfth month. This is the initial $300 (the amount borrowed) plus the interest ($6) minus the total amount paid in the previous 11 months ($275). 

So, the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is 300 + 6 - 275 = 31.

The final answer is: $31"
"To find out how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we need to first calculate the total number of diapers changed per day. Since each child requires 5 diaper changes per day and there are 2 children, the total number of diaper changes per day is 2 * 5 = 10.

Since Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, she changes 10 / 2 = 5 diapers per day. 

To find out how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we subtract the number of diapers his wife changes from the total number of diapers changed per day: 10 - 5 = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total number of jelly beans in the jar, we first need to calculate the volume of the jar. The jar has a square base with a side length of 6 inches and a height of 15 inches. The volume of a rectangular prism (such as the jar) is calculated as length * width * height.

Volume = 6 * 6 * 15 = 540 cubic inches

Since the jelly beans have an efficiency of 80%, we need to divide the volume by 0.8 to get the total volume that can be occupied by the jelly beans.

Effective Volume = 540 / 0.8 = 675 cubic inches

Each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, so we can divide the effective volume by the volume of a single jelly bean to get the total number of jelly beans.

Total Jelly Beans = 675 / 0.15 = 4500

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we can multiply the total number of jelly beans by 0.3 to get the number of red jelly beans.

Red Jelly Beans = 4500 * 0.3 = 1350

However, we are given that the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find out how far off Tim's guess was, we need to know his guess. Since we don't have his guess, we can't calculate the exact difference. But we can calculate the percentage difference between his guess and the true number of red jelly beans.

Percentage Difference = ((True Number - Guess) / True Number) * 100

Since we don't have his guess, we can't calculate the percentage difference.

However, we can calculate the maximum possible guess that would be close to the true number of red jelly beans. If Tim guessed the maximum possible number of red jelly beans, it would be the true number of red jelly beans.

Maximum Guess = 900

The percentage difference between the maximum guess and the true number of red jelly beans is:

Percentage Difference = ((900 - 900) / 900) * 100 = 0%

If we assume that Tim's guess was the maximum possible guess, then he was 0% off.

If we assume that Tim's guess was the minimum possible guess (1 red jelly bean), then the percentage difference would be:

Percentage Difference = ((900 - 1) / 900) * 100 = 99.89%

Since we don't have Tim's actual guess, we can't calculate the exact percentage difference.

However, we can calculate the range of possible guesses. The minimum possible guess would be 1 red jelly bean, and the maximum possible guess would be 900 red jelly beans.

Minimum Guess = 1
Maximum Guess = 900

The range of possible guesses is from 1 to 900.

To find the percentage difference for the minimum and maximum guesses, we can use the formula:

Percentage Difference = ((True Number - Guess) / True Number) * 100

For the minimum guess:

Percentage Difference = ((900 - 1) / 900) * 100 = 99.89%

For the maximum guess:

Percentage Difference = ((900 - 900) / 900) * 100 = 0%

The range of possible percentage differences is from 99.89% to 0%.

Since we don't have Tim's actual guess, we can't calculate the exact percentage difference.

However, we can say that the true number of red jelly beans is 900, and the range of possible guesses is from 1 to 900."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, the bus had 20 people.
2. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus became 20 + 40 = 60.
3. At the second stop, 3/4 of the people who entered at the first stop (40) entered the bus. This means 3/4 * 40 = 30 people entered the bus at the second stop. So, the total number of people on the bus became 60 + 30 = 90.
4. At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus became 2 * 90 = 180.

Now, we need to find the number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus. The bus has a capacity of 200 people, and there are 180 people on the bus. 

The number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is 200 - 180 = 20.

"To find the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to calculate the cost of visits for the first 5 years and the cost of visits for the next 3 years.

For the first 5 years, the cost of one visit is $2. Since Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year, the annual cost is 3 * $2 = $6. For 5 years, the total cost is 5 * $6 = $30.

The cost of one visit increased by 150% after 5 years. A 150% increase means the new cost is 2.5 times the original cost. So, the new cost of one visit is $2 * 2.5 = $5.

For the next 3 years, the annual cost is 3 * $5 = $15. For 3 years, the total cost is 3 * $15 = $45.

The total cost for all visits is the sum of the cost for the first 5 years and the cost for the next 3 years: $30 + $45 = $75.

The final answer is: $75"
"To find out how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to determine the total number of groups required and then multiply that by the time it takes for each group to try the escape room.

There are 4 grades (4-7) with 10 students in each grade, so the total number of students is 4 * 10 = 40.

Since only the top 10 students in each grade get to try the escape room, we need to find the total number of students who will try the escape room. Since there are 4 grades, we need to find the total number of students who will try the escape room in each grade, which is 10 students per grade. So, the total number of students who will try the escape room is 4 * 10 = 40.

However, only 8 students can try the escape room at a time. To find the total number of groups, we divide the total number of students who will try the escape room by the number of students per group: 40 / 8 = 5.

Since each group uses their full 45 minutes, the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room is the number of groups multiplied by the time per group: 5 * 45 = 225 minutes.

The final answer is: 225"
"To find out how much Ali has to pay John, we need to calculate the total cost of the wooden tables and the total cost of the roof frames, then add them together.

The cost of the wooden tables is 4 tables * $20 per table = $80.
The cost of the roof frames is 2 frames * $10 per frame = $20.

Now, we add the cost of the tables and the cost of the roof frames together: $80 + $20 = $100.

Therefore, Ali has to pay John $100.

The final answer is: $100"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length can be represented as 4x.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, and it is divided into two pieces. Therefore, the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is equal to 40 feet. We can write this as an equation:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Now, divide both sides by 5 to solve for x:

x = 40 / 5
x = 8

Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, we can find its length by multiplying x by 4:

Longer piece = 4x
Longer piece = 4 * 8
Longer piece = 32

The final answer is: 32"
"To find out how much seasoning Aiden needs, we first need to determine how many pounds of ground beef he needs to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound to find the total pounds of meat needed.

Total meatballs needed = 80
Meatballs per pound = 16

Total pounds of meat needed = Total meatballs needed / Meatballs per pound
Total pounds of meat needed = 80 / 16
Total pounds of meat needed = 5

Now that we know Aiden needs 5 pounds of ground beef, we can find out how much seasoning he needs. He adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat.

Total pounds of meat needed = 5
Seasoning per pound = 2 tablespoons

Total seasoning needed = Total pounds of meat needed * Seasoning per pound
Total seasoning needed = 5 * 2
Total seasoning needed = 10

"To find the total width of the windows, we need to multiply the width of one window by the total number of windows. 

Width of one window: 35 inches
Number of windows: 5

Total width of windows = 35 inches/window * 5 windows = 175 inches

Since Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, we multiply the total width by 2.

Fabric needed = 2 * 175 inches = 350 inches

"To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the 20% discount. 

The original cost of both manicure and pedicure is $35 + $40 = $75. 

The 20% discount on $75 is 0.20 * $75 = $15. 

So, the discounted cost of both manicure and pedicure is $75 - $15 = $60.

Since Karen wants to add nail art on each of her fingers, and there are 10 fingers in total (5 on each hand), the cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost for Karen would be the discounted cost of manicure and pedicure plus the cost of nail art, which is $60 + $30 = $90.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many paintings Shelley has. Since Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, and Samantha has 27 paintings, we can set up an equation to find Shelley's number of paintings.

Let's denote the number of paintings Shelley has as S. Since Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, we can write the equation as:

Samantha's paintings = Shelley's paintings - 12
27 = S - 12

To find Shelley's number of paintings, we need to add 12 to both sides of the equation:

S = 27 + 12
S = 39

Now that we know Shelley has 39 paintings, we can find out how many paintings Kim has. Since Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, we can set up another equation:

Shelley's paintings = Kim's paintings + 8
39 = K + 8

To find Kim's number of paintings, we need to subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:

K = 39 - 8
K = 31

Price in January: $72 - $36 = $36

The final price of the toy after the discount in January is $36."
"To find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to calculate the income from the standard rate lessons and the reduced rate lessons separately and then add them together.

For the standard rate lessons, Charlie has 4 lessons at $80 per hour. So, the total income from standard rate lessons is:
4 * $80 = $320

For the reduced rate lessons, Charlie has 2 lessons at a 25% discount. The reduced rate is 75% of the standard rate, which is 0.75 * $80 = $60 per hour. So, the total income from reduced rate lessons is:
2 * $60 = $120

Now, we add the income from both types of lessons to find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day:
$320 + $120 = $440

"To find the distance covered by Michael in 3 days, we need to calculate the total distance he travels in that time. 

First, we need to find the total hours he travels in 3 days. Since there are 24 hours in a day, the total hours he travels is 3 days * 24 hours/day = 72 hours.

Now, we can find the distance he travels in 72 hours by multiplying his average speed by the total hours: 50 km/hr * 72 hr = 3600 km.

To find the percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas that he has covered, we need to divide the distance he traveled (3600 km) by the total distance (6000 km) and multiply by 100.

"To find the total cost of making macaroni and cheese, we need to calculate the cost of the pasta, cheddar cheese, and gruyere cheese.

The cost of the pasta is $1.00 per box. Since Bud makes it once a week, he buys 52 boxes in a year (52 weeks). The total cost of the pasta is 52 * $1.00 = $52.00.

The cost of the cheddar cheese is $3.00. Since Bud makes it once a week, he buys 52 blocks in a year. The total cost of the cheddar cheese is 52 * $3.00 = $156.00.

The cost of the gruyere cheese is twice the cost of the cheddar cheese, which is 2 * $3.00 = $6.00. Since Bud makes it once a week, he buys 52 blocks in a year. The total cost of the gruyere cheese is 52 * $6.00 = $312.00.

The total cost of making macaroni and cheese is the sum of the costs of the pasta, cheddar cheese, and gruyere cheese: $52.00 + $156.00 + $312.00 = $520.00.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of books the middle shelves can hold as 'x'. Since there are two middle shelves, the total number of books they can hold is 2x.

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 2x books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 2x - 5 books.

The total number of books the bookcase can hold is the sum of the books on all shelves: 2x + 2x + (2x - 5) = 6x - 5.

We know that Elly has 110 books, so the total number of books the bookcase can hold must be at least 110. 

6x - 5 ≥ 110

To find the minimum number of bookcases needed, we need to find the smallest integer value of x that satisfies this inequality.

6x ≥ 115

x ≥ 115 / 6
x ≥ 19.17

Since x must be an integer (you can't have a fraction of a shelf), the smallest possible value of x is 20.

Now, let's calculate the total number of books the bookcase can hold with x = 20:
6x - 5 = 6(20) - 5 = 120 - 5 = 115

Since 115 is less than 110, we need to increase x to 21:
6x - 5 = 6(21) - 5 = 126 - 5 = 121

Now, 121 is greater than 110, so the bookcase with x = 21 can hold all 110 books.

However, we need to find the minimum number of bookcases needed. Since each bookcase has 3 shelves, the total number of books the bookcase can hold is 3 times the number of books the middle shelves can hold: 3x.

For x = 21, the total number of books the bookcase can hold is 3(21) = 63.

Since 110 is greater than 63, Elly needs at least 2 bookcases to hold all her books.

Original price per bag: $18.00
Discount: $3.00
Discounted price per bag: $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

Since there are 30 sticks in a bag, we can find the cost per stick by dividing the discounted price by the number of sticks.

Cost per stick: $15.00 / 30 sticks = $0.50 per stick

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100 (since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents).

Cost per stick in cents: $0.50 * 100 = 50 cents

"To determine the total number of questions Audrey needs to answer correctly to move on to the 7th grade, we first need to find the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly out of the total questions in both tests. 

The total number of questions in both tests is 70 + 40 = 110. 

Since she needs to answer 70% of the total questions correctly, we can calculate this as 0.7 * 110 = 77 questions.

Now, let's find out how many questions she answered correctly in the first test. She got 60% of 70 questions correct, which is 0.6 * 70 = 42 questions.

To find out how many questions she needs to answer correctly in the second test, we subtract the number of questions she answered correctly in the first test from the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as S and the number of blueberry cubes as B. We know that B = 5S - 4.

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, which is the sum of strawberry and blueberry cubes. So, we can write the equation: S + B = 116.

Substituting the expression for B from the first equation into the second equation, we get: S + (5S - 4) = 116.

Combine like terms: 6S - 4 = 116.

Add 4 to both sides: 6S = 120.

Divide both sides by 6: S = 20.

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting S into the equation B = 5S - 4: B = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96.

"To find the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years, we need to calculate the total number of games she has played and multiply it by her score per game.

Ara plays 40 games every year, and she has been playing for 4 years. So, the total number of games she has played is:
40 games/year * 4 years = 160 games

Since her score for every game is 21 points, we can multiply the total number of games by her score per game to find the total points:
160 games * 21 points/game = 3360 points

"To find out how many marbles Brendan ended up with, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, Brendan had 10 marbles.

He dropped half of them, so he lost 10 / 2 = 5 marbles. This means he had 10 - 5 = 5 marbles left.

Then, he found 3 more marbles, so now he has 5 + 3 = 8 marbles.

However, one of the marbles he picked up was a bead, not a marble. So, we need to subtract 1 from the total number of marbles he had. 

8 - 1 = 7

Brendan ended up with 7 marbles.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, we know that for every 2 customers who come into the dealership, 1 will buy a car. So, to sell 15 cars, Jason needs 15 * 2 = 30 customers to come into the dealership.

Next, we know that for every 25 telephone calls, 1 customer comes into the dealership. So, to get 30 customers, Jason needs 30 * 25 = 750 telephone calls.

"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of flashlights and the number of candles separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of flashlights. There are 4 people in the family, and each person has a flashlight. So, the total number of flashlights is 4.

Next, let's calculate the number of candles. There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. 

Half of 8 rooms is 4 rooms. So, 4 rooms have 4 small candles each, which is 4 * 4 = 16 small candles. The other 4 rooms have 5 medium candles each, which is 4 * 5 = 20 medium candles. 

The total number of candles is 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles.

Now, we add the number of flashlights and the number of candles together: 4 flashlights + 36 candles = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find out how many chips each person gets, we need to first calculate the total number of chips Mitchell has. Since he buys two bags of chips with 55 chips each, we multiply the number of bags by the number of chips per bag.

Total chips = 2 bags * 55 chips/bag = 110 chips

Since there are 5 family members, we divide the total number of chips by the number of family members to find out how many chips each person gets.

Chips per person = Total chips / Number of family members
= 110 chips / 5
= 22 chips

The final answer is: 22"
"To find the total time it takes to solve the Rubik's cube, we need to calculate the time for each side and add them up.

The first side takes 5 minutes.
The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so they take 5 * 2 = 10 minutes each.
The last two sides each take half as long as the first side, so they take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes each.

Now, let's add up the time for all sides:
5 (first side) + 10 (second side) + 10 (third side) + 2.5 (fourth side) + 2.5 (fifth side) = 30 minutes

The total time it takes to solve the Rubik's cube is 30 minutes.

2. Dominick saw half as many helmets as footballs. Since there are 20 helmets, the number of footballs is twice the number of helmets, which is 20 * 2 = 40 footballs.

3. To find the total number of items Dominick saw, we need to add the number of robots, helmets, and footballs together: 10 (robots) + 20 (helmets) + 40 (footballs) = 70.

The final answer is: 70"
"To find out how many calls Tim deals with in a day, we need to divide the total hours he spends at work by the time it takes to deal with a call. 

First, we convert the time it takes to deal with a call from minutes to hours: 15 minutes = 15/60 = 0.25 hours.

Now, we divide the total hours Tim spends at work by the time it takes to deal with a call: 6 hours / 0.25 hours = 24 calls per day.

To find out how many calls he deals with in a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of calls he deals with in a day by 5: 24 calls/day * 5 days = 120 calls.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total time it takes for the coat of varnish to dry on 6 paintings with the old varnish, we multiply the time it takes for one painting by the number of paintings: 7 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 42 minutes.

To find the total time it takes for the coat of varnish to dry on 6 paintings with the new varnish, we multiply the time it takes for one painting by the number of paintings: 12 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 72 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time it takes for Phineas to cover the distance on land and in water separately, and then add them together.

Since Phineas needs to cover 200 yards, and half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, we can calculate the distance for each as follows:

Distance on land = 200 yards / 2 = 100 yards
Distance in water = 200 yards / 2 = 100 yards

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for Phineas to cover each distance:

Time on land = Distance on land / Speed on land = 100 yards / 20 yards/minute = 5 minutes
Time in water = Distance in water / Speed in water = 100 yards / 10 yards/minute = 10 minutes

Total time = Time on land + Time in water = 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes

Since Bob needs 56 popsicle sticks and each box contains 8 sticks, we can divide 56 by 8 to find the number of boxes needed:

56 ÷ 8 = 7

So, Bob needs 7 boxes of popsicle sticks.

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of boxes by the cost per box:

7 boxes * $2.00 per box = $14.00

The final answer is: $14.00"
"To find the total cost of the phone plan, we need to determine the cost of the additional phones and add it to the cost of the main phone.

Let's assume the cost of each additional phone is x. Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of the main phone is 2x.

We know that the main phone costs $20, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 20

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 20 / 2
x = 10

Now that we know the cost of each additional phone is $10, we can find the total cost of the additional phones. There are 4 additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is:

4x = 4 * 10
4x = 40

The total cost of the phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones:

Total cost = 20 + 40
Total cost = 60

The final answer is: $60"

"To find the new speaking speed of John, we need to multiply his original speed by 2.5. 

Original speed: 150 WPM
New speed: 150 * 2.5 = 375 WPM

Since there are 5 words in a line, 30 lines in a page, and 450 words per page, we can calculate the total number of words in a page as follows:

Words per line: 5
Lines per page: 30
Words per page: 5 * 30 = 150
Total words per page: 450

Now, we can calculate the total number of words in 10 pages:

Total words in 10 pages: 450 * 10 = 4500

To find the time it takes to speak 10 pages, we can divide the total number of words by the new speaking speed:

"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the total number of people he saw on the first three days and add it to the total number of people he saw on the remaining days.

On the first day, Conor saw 50 people.

On the second day, there were 20 more people than on the first day, so the number of people on the second day is 50 + 20 = 70.

On the third day, the number of people was twice the number on the second day, so the number of people on the third day is 2 * 70 = 140.

The total number of people on the first three days is 50 + 70 + 140 = 260.

Since there are 7 days in a week, and Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the remaining 4 days, the total number of people he saw on the remaining days is 60 * 4 = 240.

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 260 + 240 = 500.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount pop, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.
3. So, the total number of kernels popped in the first 1.5 minutes is 20 + 60 = 80.
4. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increases to four times the initial rate, which is 4 * 20 = 80 kernels.
5. So, the total number of kernels popped in the first 2 minutes is 80 + 80 = 160.
6. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slows down to half the rate of the past 30 seconds, which is 80 / 2 = 40 kernels.
7. So, the total number of kernels popped in the first 2.5 minutes is 160 + 40 = 200.
8. After Garrett takes the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat. This is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.
9. Therefore, the total number of kernels popped is 200 + 10 = 210.

"To find out how many lemons Tim will need, we first need to calculate the total amount of lemonade he needs to make, including the extra gallon for Allen. 

Since Tim needs to make 4 gallons of lemonade and 1 extra gallon, he will need to make a total of 5 gallons. 

Since 1 cup of lemon juice is required for 1 gallon of lemonade, and 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the total amount of lemon juice needed. 

5 gallons * 1 cup/gallon = 5 cups of lemon juice

Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the total number of lemons needed.

5 cups * 6 lemons/cup = 30 lemons

However, we also need to consider the extra gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart as the other gallons. This means it will require twice the amount of lemon juice. 

So, for the extra gallon, we need 2 cups of lemon juice. 

5 cups (for the regular gallons) + 2 cups (for the extra gallon) = 7 cups of lemon juice

Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the total number of lemons needed.

7 cups * 6 lemons/cup = 42 lemons

Therefore, Tim will need 42 lemons.

"To find the total amount of dog food needed in a week, we need to calculate the daily consumption of both breeds and then multiply it by 7.

The German Shepherds consume 5 kilograms each per day, and there are 3 of them. So, their total daily consumption is 5 * 3 = 15 kilograms.

The Bulldogs consume 3 kilograms each per day, and there are 2 of them. So, their total daily consumption is 3 * 2 = 6 kilograms.

The total daily consumption of both breeds is 15 + 6 = 21 kilograms.

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7: 21 * 7 = 147 kilograms.

Therefore, the Kennel house will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance Elvis traveled in both directions and then find the difference between the two distances.

First, let's calculate the distance Elvis traveled west. Distance = Speed * Time. Since Elvis traveled at 18mph for 5 hours, the distance traveled west is:

Distance west = 18mph * 5 hours = 90 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance Elvis traveled east. Distance = Speed * Time. Since Elvis traveled at 18mph for 8 hours, the distance traveled east is:

Distance east = 18mph * 8 hours = 144 miles

Now, let's find the difference between the two distances. Since Elvis traveled 90 miles west and 144 miles east, he is now 144 - 90 = 54 miles east of his house.

"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year and subtract it from the initial value.

Initial value of the boat = $9000

First year depreciation = 30% of $9000 = 0.3 * $9000 = $2700
Value after first year = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Second year depreciation = 30% of $6300 = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890
Value after second year = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Third year depreciation = 20% of $4410 = 0.2 * $4410 = $882
Value after third year = $4410 - $882 = $3528

The final value of the boat after three years is $3528.

Since Charisma practices yoga 5 days a week, the total yoga time per week is: 60 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 300 minutes/week

Total time spent on meditation and yoga per week: 210 minutes/week (meditation) + 300 minutes/week (yoga) = 510 minutes/week

In 4 weeks, the total time spent on meditation and yoga is: 510 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 2040 minutes

The final answer is: 2040"
"To find the total square feet of fabric used, we need to calculate the total square feet from each type of shirt and add them together.

For small shirts: 11 shirts * 3 square feet/shirt = 33 square feet
For medium shirts: 8 shirts * 4 square feet/shirt = 32 square feet
For large shirts: 6 shirts * 6 square feet/shirt = 36 square feet

Now, let's add the total square feet from each type of shirt: 33 + 32 + 36 = 101 square feet

The final answer is: 101"
"To find the total number of seeds, we first need to determine the number of seeds in a large sunflower. 

A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, a small sunflower has 3 * 12 = 36 seeds.

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36, we multiply 36 by 0.5, which equals 18. 

Now, we add the 50% more seeds to the original 36 seeds: 36 + 18 = 54 seeds in a large sunflower.

To find the total number of seeds, we add the seeds from the small sunflower (36) and the large sunflower (54): 36 + 54 = 90 seeds.

The total number of sunflower seeds is 90."
"To find out how many pens Sarah has, we first need to determine how many pens Timothy has. Since Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns, and George has 18 pens, we can calculate Timothy's pens as follows:

Timothy's pens = 3 * George's pens
Timothy's pens = 3 * 18
Timothy's pens = 54

Next, we need to find out how many pens Sarah has. Since Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, we can calculate Sarah's pens as follows:

Sarah's pens = 0.5 * Timothy's pens
Sarah's pens = 0.5 * 54
Sarah's pens = 27

The final answer is: 27"
"To solve this problem, we need to find Jackie's height before summer. 

First, we know Albert's height is 36"". Since Anne is twice the size of Albert, Anne's height is 2 * 36"" = 72"".

We also know that Jackie is 2"" shorter than Anne, so Jackie's height is 72"" - 2"" = 70"".

Since Jackie grew 3"" over the summer, her height before summer was 70"" - 3"" = 67"".

The final answer is: 67"
"To find the total amount of money the company will receive, we need to calculate the total number of bars produced in two weeks and then multiply it by the price per bar.

First, let's find the number of bars produced in one week. Since the company produces 5000 bars in a day, in a week (7 days), it will produce:
5000 bars/day * 7 days/week = 35,000 bars/week

Now, let's find the number of bars produced in two weeks:
35,000 bars/week * 2 weeks = 70,000 bars

Since each bar is sold for $2, the total amount of money the company will receive is:
70,000 bars * $2/bar = $140,000

The final answer is: $140,000"
"To find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. The original price of each T-shirt is $8. Since Jake buys 2 T-shirts, the total cost of the T-shirts would be 2 * $8 = $16. However, since there's a buy one get one 50% off deal, Jake only pays for one T-shirt at the original price and the other one at 50% off. So, the cost of the first T-shirt is $8 and the cost of the second T-shirt is $8 * 0.5 = $4. The total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and Jake gets a 40% discount. The discount amount is $40 * 0.4 = $16. So, the cost of the shoes is $40 - $16 = $24.

Now, let's add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store. The total cost is $12 + $24 = $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"To find out how much money Ryan has, we need to calculate his total earnings from doing chores and subtract the cost of the ice cream cones.

Ryan earns $6 each week for 3 weeks, so his total earnings are 6 * 3 = $18.

He bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends at $1.25 each, so the total cost of ice cream cones is 4 * 1.25 = $5.

Now, let's subtract the cost of ice cream cones from his total earnings: 18 - 5 = $13.

The cost of a movie ticket is $6.50. To find out how many tickets Ryan can buy, we need to divide his remaining money by the cost of a ticket: 13 / 6.50 = 2.

Total spent by Ellen = $100 + $5 = $105

Lani's purchases:
- A pair of sunglasses for $30
- Two bathrobes at $100 each = 2 x $100 = $200
Total spent by Lani = $30 + $200 = $230

Total amount spent by both Ellen and Lani = $105 + $230 = $335

The final answer is: $335"
"To find the profit, we first need to calculate the cost of making one jar of the mixture and then multiply it by the number of jars sold.

The cost of making one jar of the mixture is:
- 2 pounds of passion fruit at $6 per pound: 2 * $6 = $12
- 1.5 pounds of jackfruit at $8 per pound: 1.5 * $8 = $12
- 2 pounds of honey at $10 per pound: 2 * $10 = $20
Total cost for one jar: $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

Now, let's calculate the profit for one jar:
Profit per jar = Selling price - Cost per jar
Profit per jar = $50 - $44 = $6

To find the total profit for 10 jars:
Total profit = Profit per jar * Number of jars
Total profit = $6 * 10
Total profit = $60

The final answer is: $60"
"To find the total dollar amount in the jar, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and add them together.

A quarter is worth $0.25, so 32 quarters are worth 32 x $0.25 = $8.

A dime is worth $0.10, so 95 dimes are worth 95 x $0.10 = $9.50.

A nickel is worth $0.05, so 120 nickels are worth 120 x $0.05 = $6.

A penny is worth $0.01, so 750 pennies are worth 750 x $0.01 = $7.50.

Now, let's add the values together: $8 + $9.50 + $6 + $7.50 = $31.

"To find out how much Josh makes in 2 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of days he works and then multiply it by the number of cars he services per day and his hourly wage.

Josh is open every day except Sunday and Wednesday, so he works 5 days a week. In 2 weeks, he works 5 days/week * 2 weeks = 10 days.

Since he services 3 cars a day, in 10 days, he services 3 cars/day * 10 days = 30 cars.

He gets paid $4 per car, so his total earnings in 2 weeks are 30 cars * $4/car = $120.

"To find out how many cookies Randy has now, we need to track the changes in the number of cookies of each flavor.

Initially, Randy has:
- 9 oatmeal cookies
- 4 chocolate chip cookies
- 5 sugar cookies

He ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor:
- Oatmeal: 9 - 1 = 8
- Chocolate chip: 4 - 1 = 3
- Sugar: 5 - 1 = 4

Then, he ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch:
- Oatmeal: 8 - 2 = 6
- Chocolate chip: 3 (no change)
- Sugar: 4 (no change)

He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends:
- Oatmeal: 6 (no change)
- Chocolate chip: 3 (no change)
- Sugar: 4 - 2 = 2

Finally, he bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner:
- Oatmeal: 6 + 4 = 10
- Chocolate chip: 3 + 4 = 7
- Sugar: 2 + 4 = 6

Now, to find the total number of cookies Randy has, we add the number of cookies of each flavor:
10 (oatmeal) + 7 (chocolate chip) + 6 (sugar) = 23

"To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we need to calculate the amount he would get for the first half of the collection and the second half separately, and then add them together.

Since Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers, we can divide them into two equal halves: 6 toy soldiers for the first half and 6 toy soldiers for the second half.

For the first half, Matthew would get $5 per toy, so the total amount for the first half would be 6 * $5 = $30.

For the second half, Matthew would get $7 per toy, so the total amount for the second half would be 6 * $7 = $42.

To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we add the amounts for the first and second halves together: $30 + $42 = $72.

The final answer is: $72"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog and then determine how many holes Nate fills in per day. 

The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes dug is 6 * 14 = 84 holes.

Nate fills in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night. So, the net number of holes filled in per day is 9 - 6 = 3 holes.

To find out how many days it takes to fill in all the holes, we divide the total number of holes by the net number of holes filled in per day: 84 / 3 = 28 days.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can convert the number of days to weeks by dividing by 7: 28 / 7 = 4 weeks.

Therefore, it will take Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of test tubes as T, the number of beakers as B, and the number of Petri dishes as P.

We know that Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, so T = 16 / 2 = 8.

We also know that Igor gathered two more Petri dishes than requested, so P = 14 + 2 = 16.

The total number of items Igor had is 29, and we know that T + B + P = 29.

Substituting the values of T and P, we get 8 + B + 16 = 29.

Simplifying the equation, we get B + 24 = 29.

Subtracting 24 from both sides, we get B = 5.

However, we know that Igor initially picked up the correct number of beakers, which is 7. Since he lost some beakers, the number of beakers he had left is 5.

To find the number of beakers he lost, we subtract the number of beakers he had left from the initial number of beakers: 7 - 5 = 2.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws needed for the tables and subtract that from the total number of screws he has.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws, so each table needs 4 x 2 = 8 screws.

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws needed is 8 x 4 = 32 screws.

James has 40 screws, so to find out how many he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the total number of screws he has: 40 - 32 = 8.

"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we first need to determine the number of eggs in the second basket. Since there are twice as many eggs in the second basket as in the first, we multiply the number of eggs in the first basket by 2.

Number of eggs in the first basket: 10
Number of eggs in the second basket: 10 * 2 = 20

Now, we add the number of eggs in both baskets to find the total.

Total number of eggs: 10 + 20 = 30

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the speed of Aaron and Vanessa. Let's assume Aaron's speed is A miles per minute and Vanessa's speed is V miles per minute.

Given that Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, we can write the equation:
A = 2V

We are also given that Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron, so if Vanessa runs 4 miles, Aaron runs 2 miles. Since Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, we can write the equation:
2/A = 16
A = 2/16
A = 1/8 miles per minute

Now that we know Aaron's speed, we can find Vanessa's speed using the equation A = 2V:
1/8 = 2V
V = (1/8) / 2
V = 1/16 miles per minute

Now that we know Vanessa's speed, we can find the time it took her to complete her part of the race:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 4 miles / (1/16 miles per minute)
Time = 4 * 16
Time = 64 minutes

The final answer is: 64"
"To find out how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of line required for the existing dock. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock, we multiply 200 by 3.

200 feet of dock * 3 feet of line per foot of dock = 600 feet of line required

However, the caretaker already has 6 feet of new line. To find out how many more feet of line he needs to buy, we subtract the amount he already has from the total amount required.

600 feet of line required - 6 feet of line already owned = 594 feet of line needed

The caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line."
"To find out how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to calculate their daily revenue and then multiply it by the number of days they are open.

Daily revenue = (2 meals * $5 per meal) + $5 bottle of wine
Daily revenue = (2 * $5) + $5
Daily revenue = $10 + $5
Daily revenue = $15

Since they are open 2 days a week, we multiply the daily revenue by 2:
Weekly revenue = Daily revenue * 2
Weekly revenue = $15 * 2
Weekly revenue = $30

"To find the cost price of each watermelon, we first need to find the total cost of the watermelons. The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80, so the cost price of each watermelon is $80 / 50 = $1.60.

Since the vendor sold the watermelons at a profit of 25%, the selling price of each watermelon is 125% of the cost price (100% of the cost price + 25% profit). 

To find the selling price, we multiply the cost price by 1.25 (which is 125% or 100% + 25%). 

Selling price = $1.60 * 1.25 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the current age of James and then determine the age of John's youngest son.

First, let's find James' current age. Since James is twice as old as Dora, and Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, we can find Dora's current age by subtracting 3 from 12. 

Dora's current age = 12 - 3 = 9 years

Since James is twice as old as Dora, we can find James' current age by multiplying Dora's current age by 2.

James' current age = 2 * 9 = 18 years

Now, we know that James is 18 years old and he was born when John was 19. To find John's current age, we can add 18 to 19.

John's current age = 19 + 18 = 37 years

John's youngest son was born when John was 32. To find the current age of John's youngest son, we can subtract 32 from John's current age.

John's youngest son's current age = 37 - 32 = 5 years

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many oranges each person can peel in an hour and then compare their rates.

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges.

Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

To find out how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane, we subtract Jane's total from Ana's total: 20 - 15 = 5.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator and the labor cost.

The original cost of the radiator is $400. Mark gets it for 80% off, which means he pays 20% of the original cost. To find 20% of $400, we multiply $400 by 0.2:

$400 * 0.2 = $80

So, Mark pays $80 for the radiator.

The mechanic charges $50 per hour and works for 3 hours, so the labor cost is:

$50 * 3 = $150

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the radiator and the labor cost:

$80 + $150 = $230

The final answer is: $230"
"Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as W. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write the equation:

C + W = 20

We also know that the total number of legs is 70. Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, so we can write the equation:

2C + 4W = 70

We can solve this system of equations by multiplying the first equation by 2 to get:

2C + 2W = 40

Now, we can subtract this equation from the second equation to eliminate C:

(2C + 4W) - (2C + 2W) = 70 - 40
2W = 30

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

W = 15

Now that we know the number of cows, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find the number of chickens:

C + 15 = 20
C = 5

Therefore, there are 5 chickens on Farmer Brown's farm.

The final answer is: 5"
