"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to determine the number of eggs she sells. 

First, let's calculate the total number of eggs she lays per day: 16 eggs.

Next, let's calculate the number of eggs she consumes: 3 eggs for breakfast and 4 eggs for baking muffins, which is 3 + 4 = 7 eggs.

Now, let's subtract the number of eggs she consumes from the total number of eggs she lays: 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.

Janet sells these 9 eggs at $2 each, so the total amount she makes is 9 * 2 = $18.

The final answer is: $18"
"To find the total number of bolts needed for the robe, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber and add it to the amount of blue fiber.

The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. 
It takes half that much white fiber, which is 2 / 2 = 1 bolt of white fiber.

So, the total number of bolts needed is 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the profit Josh made, we first need to determine the total value of the house after the repairs. 

The original value of the house was $80,000. Josh put in $50,000 in repairs, which increased the value of the house by 150%. 

To find the new value of the house, we can set up an equation: 

New Value = Original Value + (Original Value * 150%)

New Value = $80,000 + ($80,000 * 1.5)
New Value = $80,000 + $120,000
New Value = $200,000

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the total cost (purchase price + repairs) from the new value of the house.

Total Cost = Purchase Price + Repairs
Total Cost = $80,000 + $50,000
Total Cost = $130,000

Profit = New Value - Total Cost
Profit = $200,000 - $130,000
Profit = $70,000

The final answer is: $70,000"
"To find the total number of meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total meters he runs in one sprint session and then multiply it by the number of sessions he has in a week.

Since James runs 3 sprints in a session, and each sprint is 60 meters, the total meters he runs in one session is:
3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/session

Since James runs 3 sessions a week, the total meters he runs in a week is:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

The final answer is: 540"
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to determine the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon meals. 

In the morning, Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups of feed. In the afternoon, she gives them another 25 cups of feed. So, the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

Since Wendi feeds each chicken 3 cups of feed per day, and she has a flock of 20 chickens, the total amount of feed needed per day is 3 * 20 = 60 cups.

Now, to find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we subtract the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total amount of feed needed per day. 

60 (total feed needed per day) - 40 (feed given in morning and afternoon) = 20 cups.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining glasses. The first glass costs $5. 

The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3. 

The third glass costs 60% of $3, which is 0.6 * $3 = $1.8. 

We can see that the cost of each subsequent glass is 60% of the previous glass's cost. 

The sequence of the cost of the glasses is: $5, $3, $1.8, $1.08, $0.64, $0.384, $0.2304, $0.13824, $0.0829376, $0.04956256, $0.029837696, $0.017902816, $0.0107458496, $0.00644791456, $0.003823947296, $0.0022841781776, $0.001370506105472.

To find the total cost, we need to sum up the cost of all 16 glasses. 

The sum of the cost of the glasses is approximately $5 + $3 + $1.8 + $1.08 + $0.64 + $0.384 + $0.2304 + $0.13824 + $0.0829376 + $0.04956256 + $0.029837696 + $0.017902816 + $0.0107458496 + $0.00644791456 + $0.003823947296 + $0.0022841781776 + $0.001370506105472.

The total cost is approximately $24.999999999999998.

The final answer is: $25"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of sheep in Toulouse and Charleston first. 

Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, and Seattle has 20 sheep, we can calculate the number of sheep in Charleston as follows:
Charleston = 4 * Seattle = 4 * 20 = 80

Now, we know that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. So, we can calculate the number of sheep in Toulouse as follows:
Toulouse = 2 * Charleston = 2 * 80 = 160

Now, we have the number of sheep in Toulouse (160), Charleston (80), and Seattle (20). To find the total number of sheep, we add these numbers together:
Total = Toulouse + Charleston + Seattle = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260

The final answer is: 260"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, let's find out how long it would take Carla to download the file without any interruptions. Since she can download 2 GB/minute, we can divide the total file size by her download rate:

200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes

However, Windows forces a restart 40% of the way through the download. To find out how much of the file Carla has downloaded before the restart, we can multiply the total file size by 0.4:

200 GB * 0.4 = 80 GB

Since Carla has downloaded 80 GB, she still needs to download 120 GB (200 - 80 = 120). 

Now, let's consider the time it takes to download the remaining 120 GB. Since Carla can download 2 GB/minute, we can divide the remaining file size by her download rate:

120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes

However, we also need to add the 20 minutes it takes for Windows to install updates. 

So, the total time it takes to download the file is the time it takes to download the remaining 120 GB (60 minutes) plus the time it takes for Windows to install updates (20 minutes):

60 minutes + 20 minutes = 80 minutes

The total time it takes to download the file is 80 minutes.

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and calculate the distance traveled in each segment.

First, John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph. The distance traveled in this segment is:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 mph * 3 hours
Distance = 180 miles

Since he turns around, he is now 180 miles away from home.

Next, he spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't move at all in this segment.

Then, he drives for 0.5 hours (half an hour) at 30 mph. The distance traveled in this segment is:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 mph * 0.5 hours
Distance = 15 miles

Now, he is 180 - 15 = 165 miles away from home.

Finally, he drives for the remaining 4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours at 80 mph. The distance traveled in this segment is:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 80 mph * 1.5 hours
Distance = 120 miles

Now, he is 165 - 120 = 45 miles away from home.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find Eliza's total earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately, then add them together.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings are:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours, she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours. Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, so her overtime rate is $10 * 1.2 = $12/hour. Her overtime earnings are:
5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Her total earnings for the week are:
$400 + $60 = $460

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and then add them together.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the downloads were reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which is 54. Then, we subtract 54 from 180 to get 126 downloads in the third month.

Now, we add the downloads from each month together: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The final answer is: 366"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the donuts: 3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen is 3 x $68 = $204.

Next, let's find the cost of the mini cupcakes: 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen is 2 x $80 = $160.

Now, let's find the cost of the mini cheesecakes: 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen is 6 x $55 = $330.

Finally, let's add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost is $694."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of planting the tree and the annual expenses, and then find the point at which the total earnings from selling lemons exceed these costs.

The initial cost of planting the tree is $90. The annual expenses for watering and feeding the tree are $3. 

Each year, the tree will grow 7 lemons, which can be sold for $1.5 each, resulting in a total annual revenue of 7 * $1.5 = $10.5.

To find the break-even point, we need to calculate the total cost of the tree and the total annual expenses, and then find the point at which the total earnings from selling lemons exceed these costs.

Let's denote the number of years as 'n'. The total cost of the tree is $90, and the total annual expenses are $3. The total earnings from selling lemons after 'n' years will be $10.5 * n.

The break-even point can be found by setting up the equation:

Total cost + Total annual expenses * n = Total earnings from lemons

90 + 3n = 10.5n

Subtracting 3n from both sides:

90 = 7.5n

Dividing both sides by 7.5:

n = 12

So, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

The final answer is: 12"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume Melanie started with 'x' vacuum cleaners.

At the green house, she sold a third of her vacuum cleaners, which is x/3.

At the red house, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners.

At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, which is (x - x/3 - 2).

We know that after selling at all the houses, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the equation:

x - (x/3) - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

To simplify the equation, let's first simplify the term (x - x/3 - 2)/2:

(x - x/3 - 2)/2 = (2x/3 - 6)/2 = x/3 - 3

Now, let's rewrite the equation:

x - (x/3) - 2 - (x/3 - 3) = 5

Combine like terms:

x - 2x/3 - 2 - x/3 + 3 = 5

Combine like terms:

x - 3x/3 + 1 = 5

Combine like terms:

x - x + 1 = 5

1 = 5

This equation doesn't make sense, so let's go back to the previous step and try to simplify it differently.

x - (x/3) - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

x - (x/3) - 2 - (x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

x - (x/3) - 2 - (x/6 - 1) = 5

x - (x/3) - 2 - x/6 + 1 = 5

Combine like terms:

x - 2x/3 - x/6 + 1 = 5

To combine the fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 6. So, let's rewrite the equation:

(6x - 4x - x)/6 + 1 = 5

Combine like terms:

x - 5x/6 + 1 = 5

Combine like terms:

(6x - 5x)/6 + 1 = 5

x/6 + 1 = 5

Subtract 1 from both sides:

x/6 = 4

Multiply both sides by 6:

x = 24

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to find the number of students who enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance, and then subtract that from the total number of students.

20% of 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance:
20 * 0.2 = 4 students

The remaining students are 20 - 4 = 16 students.

25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:
16 * 0.25 = 4 students

The number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is the remaining students after subtracting the students who enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance:
16 - 4 = 12 students

To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100:
(12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is: 60"
"To determine the maximum profit, we need to calculate the potential increase in value for both options and then compare them.

For the jewelry option, the potential increase in value is 2.5% of $5,000:
2.5% of $5,000 = 0.025 * $5,000 = $125

For the electronic gadgets option, the potential increase in value is 1.2% of $8,000:
1.2% of $8,000 = 0.012 * $8,000 = $96

Since the jewelry option has a higher potential increase in value, the merchant should choose the jewelry option to maximize profit.

The profit would be the potential increase in value of the chosen option, which is $125.

The final answer is: $125"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance covered on the first day and the distance covered on the second day.

On the first day, both trains travel 80 miles westward. Since they are traveling in the same direction, they cover the same distance. 

On the second day, they travel 150 miles northward. Again, since they are traveling in the same direction, they cover the same distance.

So, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 80 miles + 150 miles = 230 miles.

The final answer is: 230"
"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:

She works 35 hours a week as a teacher and gets paid $20 per hour. Since she works 50 weeks a year, her total hours worked as a teacher in a year is:
35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year

Her earnings from teaching in a year is:
1750 hours/year * $20/hour = $35,000/year

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:

She works 15 hours a week as a coach and gets paid $30 per hour. Since she works 50 weeks a year, her total hours worked as a coach in a year is:
15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year

Her earnings from coaching in a year is:
750 hours/year * $30/hour = $22,500/year

Now, let's add her earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary:
$35,000/year + $22,500/year = $57,500/year

The final answer is: $57,500"
"To find out how many eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in a week and then multiply it by 4.

Since Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning, she eats 3 eggs per day. 

There are 7 days in a week, so she eats 3 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 21 eggs/week.

In 4 weeks, she will eat 21 eggs/week * 4 weeks = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens she will eat in 4 weeks.

84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozens.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much time Marissa has left to walk the remaining distance. 

She has walked 4 miles in 1 hour and 2 miles in another hour, so she has walked a total of 6 miles in 2 hours. 

The total distance of the trail is 12 miles, and she has already walked 6 miles, so she has 12 - 6 = 6 miles left to walk.

Since she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, and the total distance is 12 miles, she needs to walk the entire 12 miles in 12 / 4 = 3 hours.

She has already walked for 2 hours, so she has 3 - 2 = 1 hour left to walk the remaining 6 miles.

To find her required speed, we divide the remaining distance by the remaining time: 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total amount of water in the orange drink, we first need to calculate two-thirds of 10 liters. Two-thirds of 10 liters is (2/3) * 10 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters. Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, this means 6.67 liters of the orange drink is water.

Next, we need to find the total amount of water in the pineapple drink. Three-fifths of 15 liters is (3/5) * 15 = 45/5 = 9 liters. Since the pineapple drink is three-fifths water, this means 9 liters of the pineapple drink is water.

Now, we need to subtract the 1 liter of orange drink that was spilled. The total amount of water in the orange drink after the spill is 6.67 - 1 = 5.67 liters.

The total amount of water in the mixture is the sum of the water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink, which is 5.67 + 9 = 14.67 liters.

However, we are asked to find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture. Since we have 1 liter of orange drink spilled, the total amount of the mixture is 10 + 15 - 1 = 24 liters. The amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 14.67 liters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14.67}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how old Raymond was when his son was born and then subtract that from the current age of Samantha to find out how many years ago it was.

First, let's find out how old Raymond is now. Since Samantha is 31 and Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, Raymond is 31 - 6 = 25 years old.

Since Raymond had a son at the age of 23, we need to find out how many years have passed since then. To do this, we subtract 23 from Raymond's current age: 25 - 23 = 2.

However, this is the number of years that have passed since Raymond's son was born, not how many years ago it was. Since we want to know how many years ago it was, we don't need to do anything else.

"To find the total number of DVDs sold by Billy, we need to calculate the number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers.

The first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each, so the total number of DVDs sold to them is 3 * 1 = 3.

The next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so the total number of DVDs sold to them is 2 * 2 = 4.

The last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs, so the total number of DVDs sold to them is 0.

Now, we add the number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers: 3 + 4 = 7.

So, the total number of DVDs sold by Billy on Tuesday is 7.

"To find the original price of the book, we need to determine the amount of the discount and add it to the discounted price. 

First, let's find the amount of the discount: 
Discount = 25% of the original price
Let's denote the original price as 'x'. 
Then, the discount is 0.25x.

The discounted price is the original price minus the discount: 
Discounted price = x - 0.25x = 0.75x

We know the discounted price is $19.50. 
So, we can set up the equation: 
0.75x = 19.50

To find 'x', we need to divide both sides by 0.75: 
x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book was $26.

The final answer is: $26"
"To find the total cost of the items Marie ordered, we need to calculate the cost of the chicken meal, the milk, and the apples, and then subtract that from the total amount she paid.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of the milk is 5 packs * $3 per pack = $15.
The cost of the apples is 4 apples * $1.50 per apple = $6.

The total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the cost of the pizza boxes is $50 - $33 = $17.

To find the number of boxes of pizza, we need to divide the cost of the pizza boxes by the cost per box: $17 / $8.50 = 2.

"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to calculate the total number of cartons she buys and then multiply it by the cost per carton.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she will go through 60 servings in 60 days. Each carton has 15 servings, so we need to divide 60 by 15 to find out how many cartons she buys:

60 servings / 15 servings per carton = 4 cartons

Now, we multiply the number of cartons by the cost per carton:

4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00

So, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream after 60 days.

The final answer is: $16.00"
"To find the distance traveled between Henry's first and second stops, we need to determine the distance between the two stops. 

Henry's first stop was after 20 miles, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total trip was 60 miles, we can find the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip by subtracting 15 miles from 60 miles. 

60 miles - 15 miles = 45 miles

Now, we know that the distance from the first stop to the second stop is the difference between the distance traveled before the first stop (20 miles) and the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip (45 miles). 

However, we need to find the distance between the first and second stop, not the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip. To do this, we can subtract the distance traveled before the first stop (20 miles) from the total distance traveled before the second stop. 

Since the second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, the distance traveled before the second stop is 60 miles - 15 miles = 45 miles. 

Now, we can find the distance between the first and second stop by subtracting the distance traveled before the first stop (20 miles) from the distance traveled before the second stop (45 miles).

45 miles - 20 miles = 25 miles

"To solve this problem, let's denote the cost of the more expensive pair of heels as x. Since the other pair costs twice as much, its cost is 2x. We know that the two pairs of heels together cost $5 less than the boots. 

We can set up the equation: x + 2x = boots - 5. 

Combine like terms: 3x = boots - 5.

We also know that one pair of heels costs $33, which is the more expensive pair. So, we can substitute x with 33 in the equation: 3(33) = boots - 5.

Solve for boots: 99 = boots - 5.

Add 5 to both sides: 104 = boots.

The final answer is: $104"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given ratio and total age. Let's assume Darrell's age is 7x and Allen's age is 11x, where x is a common multiplier.

We know that their total age is 162, so we can write the equation:

7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms:

18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18:

x = 9

Now that we have the value of x, we can find Darrell's and Allen's current ages:

Darrell's age = 7x = 7(9) = 63
Allen's age = 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

"To find the average guess, we need to calculate the total number of guesses and divide by the number of people.

The first person guesses 80 jelly beans.
The second person guesses 20 more than half of 80, which is (80 / 2) + 20 = 60.
The third person guesses 25% more than 80, which is 80 + (0.25 * 80) = 100.

Now, let's add up all the guesses: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

There are 3 people, so we divide the total by 3 to find the average: 240 / 3 = 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the total hours John spends taking care of dogs in a week, we need to first calculate the total hours he spends per day and then multiply it by 7 (the number of days in a week).

Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business. Since John takes care of 10 dogs, the total hours he spends per day is:
10 dogs * 0.5 hours/dog = 5 hours/day

Now, we multiply the daily hours by 7 to get the total hours per week:
5 hours/day * 7 days/week = 35 hours/week

The final answer is: 35"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let's represent the number of silver coins as 'x'. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins can be represented as 'x + 30'.

We know that the total number of coins is 110, which is the sum of the number of gold and silver coins. So, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 30) = 110

Combine like terms:

2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:

2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 40

Since x represents the number of silver coins, and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is x + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70.

The final answer is: 70"
"To find out how many jewels Siobhan has, we need to first determine how many jewels Aaron has. 

Since Raymond has 40 jewels, half of Raymond's jewels would be 40 / 2 = 20. 

Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, so Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.

Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, so Siobhan has 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total points scored by Mike, we need to calculate the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes separately, and then add them together.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% of 4, we multiply 4 by 0.25, which is 1. Then, we add this to the original 4 points to get the total points scored in the second 20 minutes: 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Now, we add the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes to get the total points: 4 + 5 = 9 points.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to first determine how many yogurts he eats in 30 days and then calculate the cost.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. In 30 days, he will eat 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

The sale is 4 yogurts for $5.00. To find the cost of 1 yogurt, we divide $5.00 by 4. So, the cost of 1 yogurt is $5.00 / 4 = $1.25.

Now, we multiply the number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days (60) by the cost of 1 yogurt ($1.25) to find the total cost. 60 * $1.25 = $75.00.

The final answer is: $75.00"
"To find out how many LEGO sets John still has, we need to first calculate how much money he made from selling the LEGO sets and then subtract the cost of the video games and the remaining money.

John sells 13 LEGO sets for $15 each, so the total amount of money he made is:
13 LEGO sets * $15 per set = $195

He then buys 8 video games for $20 each, so the total cost of the video games is:
8 video games * $20 per game = $160

After buying the video games, he has $5 left. To find out how much money he spent on the video games, we subtract the remaining money from the total amount he made:
$195 - $5 = $190

Now, we subtract the cost of the video games from the amount he spent:
$190 - $160 = $30

This means he spent $30 on something else, but we are not given any information about what that is. However, we are asked about the LEGO sets. Since he sold 13 LEGO sets and we don't have any information about him buying more or selling any, we can conclude that he still has 0 LEGO sets.

The final answer is: 0"
"To find John's running speed, we first need to calculate the total hours he runs per week. 

He runs 3 hours on the first day. The other two days, he runs half as much as the first day, which is 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours per day. 

So, the total hours he runs per week is 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours.

Now, we know John runs 60 miles a week and 6 hours a week. To find his speed, we divide the total miles by the total hours: 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Dana's walking speed. Since she can skip at half the speed of running and skip at 3 miles per hour, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Given that she can run four times faster than she can walk, her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, we need to find the time she spends running and walking. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. So, the time spent running is 6 hours * (1/3) = 2 hours, and the time spent walking is 6 hours * (2/3) = 4 hours.

The distance traveled while running is 6 miles per hour * 2 hours = 12 miles. The distance traveled while walking is 1.5 miles per hour * 4 hours = 6 miles.

The total distance traveled is 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles.

The final answer is: 18"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the age of Brandon's iPhone. 

First, we know that Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old. 
Since Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, we can calculate Ben's iPhone age as 2 * 1 = 2 years.

Now, we know that Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. 
So, we can calculate Brandon's iPhone age as 4 * 2 = 8 years.

The final answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the distance Polly can throw the javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone and then subtract the dragon's reach from that distance.

When Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone. Since she can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone, she can throw it 3 * 400 = 1200 feet with the gemstone.

The dragon's flames reach 1000 feet. To find the distance outside of the dragon's reach, we subtract the dragon's reach from the distance Polly can throw with the gemstone: 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet.

The final answer is: 200"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests. We know that Grandma Jones baked 5 pies and cut each pie into 8 pieces, so the total number of pieces is 5 * 8 = 40. 

At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken, we need to subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces. 

40 (total pieces) - 14 (remaining pieces) = 26

So, 26 pieces of pie were taken by the guests.

The final answer is: 26"
"To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we first need to determine how many calories you have left to consume. 

Your daily calorie target is 2000, and you have already consumed 1800 calories. 

2000 (daily target) - 1800 (already consumed) = 200 calories left

Since each serving of chips has 250 calories, we need to find out how many servings you can have within your remaining calorie limit.

200 calories / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings

Since a 300g bag has 5 servings, we need to find out how many grams are in one serving.

300g / 5 servings = 60g per serving

Now, we can multiply the number of servings you can have by the grams per serving to find out how many grams you can eat.

0.8 servings * 60g per serving = 48g

The final answer is: 48"
"To find Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost.

First, let's calculate the total cost. Since one pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10.00, and Charlie makes 10 candles per pound, the cost per candle is $1.00 ($10.00 / 10 candles). 

To make 20 candles, the total cost would be 20 candles * $1.00 per candle = $20.00.

Next, let's calculate the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, and he makes 20 candles. The total revenue would be 20 candles * $2.00 per candle = $40.00.

Now, let's calculate the net profit. The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.

The final answer is: $20.00"
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply it by the average time it takes to write an article (4 hours).

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. To find 2/5 of 5, we multiply 5 by 2/5:
5 * (2/5) = 2
So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 7 * 2 = 14 articles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles she wrote in the three days:
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles

Since each article takes 4 hours to write, the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours

The final answer is: 104"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many Post-it notes Candice had after placing one on each of the 220 cups of coffee. We know she had 80 initially and had 23 remaining after placing the notes on the cups. 

First, let's find out how many Post-it notes Candice used at the coffee shop. This can be calculated by subtracting the remaining Post-it notes from the initial amount: 80 - 23 = 57. 

Since she placed one note on each of the 220 cups, the total number of Post-it notes used at the coffee shop is 220. However, we know that 57 were used in total, so the remaining Post-it notes must have come from the package she purchased. 

Now, let's find out how many Post-it notes were in the package. This can be calculated by subtracting the Post-it notes used at the coffee shop from the total used: 220 - 57 = 163. 

However, this is the number of Post-it notes used from the package, not the total number of Post-it notes in the package. Since Candice purchased a package, we can assume that the package was not empty. Therefore, the total number of Post-it notes in the package must be more than 163. 

To find the total number of Post-it notes in the package, we need to add the remaining Post-it notes to the number of Post-it notes used from the package: 163 + 23 = 186.

The final answer is: 186"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many blue ties John bought. Since he spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is:

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
= 2 * 5
= 10

Now, we need to find the cost of each red tie. Since the red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, the cost of each red tie is:

Cost of each red tie = Cost of each blue tie + (50% of the cost of each blue tie)
= $40 + (0.5 * $40)
= $40 + $20
= $60

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent on red ties:

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of each red tie
= 10 * $60
= $600

The total amount spent on ties is the sum of the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties:

Total amount spent on ties = $200 + $600
= $800

The final answer is: $800"
"To find the number of pieces Tracy obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches, since the pieces are 6 inches long. There are 12 inches in 1 foot, so the total length of the wire in inches is 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches.

Now, we can divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece to find the number of pieces: 48 inches / 6 inches/piece = 8 pieces.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total number of units in the building, we need to multiply the number of floors by the number of units per floor. 

Number of floors: 15
Number of units per floor: 8

Total units = Number of floors * Number of units per floor
Total units = 15 * 8
Total units = 120

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we need to find 1/4 of the total units to determine the number of unoccupied units.

1/4 of the total units = (1/4) * Total units
1/4 of the total units = (1/4) * 120
1/4 of the total units = 30

The total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"To find out how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we first need to calculate how many eggs he produces in a week and then multiply that by the price per dozen.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the number of eggs produced per day by 7:

252 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 1764 eggs/week

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens:

1764 eggs/week / 12 eggs/dozen = 147 dozen/week

Now, we multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen to find the total weekly revenue:

147 dozen/week * $2/dozen = $294/week

The final answer is: $294"
"To find the total time Tom spends traveling, we first need to calculate the time he spends traveling from 1 to 4 PM. Since he travels at 10 miles per hour, we can assume he travels for 3 hours (from 1 to 4 PM is 3 hours).

Now, let's calculate the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM. Distance = Speed * Time = 10 miles/hour * 3 hours = 30 miles.

Since he travels back at a rate of 6 mph, we can use the formula Time = Distance / Speed to find the time it takes him to get back. Time = 30 miles / 6 mph = 5 hours.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he removes 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is:

30 * 1/4 = 30 * 0.25 = 7.5 pounds

Since Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds, and the comic books weigh 7.5 pounds, the remaining weight that needs to be removed from toys is:

15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, the number of toys Uriah needs to remove is:

7.5 / 0.5 = 15

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total revenue for each day, we need to calculate the revenue from truck tires and car tires separately and then add them together.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires at $60 each and 4 car tires at $40 each. The total revenue from truck tires on Thursday is 6 * $60 = $360. The total revenue from car tires on Thursday is 4 * $40 = $160. The total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires at $40 each and no truck tires. The total revenue from car tires on Friday is 12 * $40 = $480. Since there were no truck tires repaired, the total revenue on Friday is $480.

To find the day with higher revenue, we compare the revenues: $520 (Thursday) and $480 (Friday). Thursday has higher revenue.

Now, to find how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we subtract the lower revenue from the higher revenue: $520 - $480 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find the total number of kittens, we first need to determine the number of kittens each cat has had. 

Patchy, the first cat, has had thrice the number of adopted kittens. Since the Doubtfire sisters adopted 7 kittens, Patchy has had 3 * 7 = 21 kittens.

Trixie, the other cat, has had 12 kittens.

Now, we add the number of adopted kittens (7) to the number of kittens each cat has had: 7 (adopted) + 21 (Patchy's kittens) + 12 (Trixie's kittens) = 40.

The Doubtfire family now has 40 kittens.

"To find out how many bags Jean can fill, we first need to determine the number of lollipops remaining after eating 2. 

Jean starts with 30 lollipops and eats 2, so the remaining lollipops are 30 - 2 = 28.

Since Jean wants to package 2 lollipops in one bag, we need to divide the remaining lollipops by 2 to find out how many bags can be filled.

28 lollipops / 2 lollipops per bag = 14 bags

"To find out how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to calculate how many times he can afford the total cost of a movie outing, which includes both the ticket and the popcorn.

The total cost of a movie outing is $7 (ticket) + $7 (popcorn) = $14.

We know Peter has $42 for the week. To find out how many times he can go to the movies, we'll divide the total amount of money he has by the cost of a single movie outing.

$42 ÷ $14 = 3

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times this week.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck, we need to first determine the remaining weight capacity of the bridge after the truck and driver are on it. 

The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. The weight limit of the bridge is 5000 pounds. 

Remaining weight capacity = Weight limit - Combined weight of driver and empty truck
Remaining weight capacity = 5000 - 3755
Remaining weight capacity = 1245 pounds

Since each box weighs 15 pounds, we can find the maximum number of boxes by dividing the remaining weight capacity by the weight of each box.

Maximum number of boxes = Remaining weight capacity / Weight of each box
Maximum number of boxes = 1245 / 15
Maximum number of boxes = 83

The final answer is: 83"
"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to follow the order of operations. 

First, let's calculate the 25% fee on the final total of $40.00. 
25% of $40.00 is 0.25 * $40.00 = $10.00.

Now, let's add the delivery fee of $3.00 to the 25% fee of $10.00. 
$10.00 + $3.00 = $13.00.

The total extra fees are $13.00. Now, let's add the tip of $4.00 to the total extra fees.
$13.00 + $4.00 = $17.00.

Now, let's add the total extra fees of $17.00 to the original bill of $40.00.

"To find the number of good oranges, we first need to find the total number of oranges that are not bad or sour. 

There are 1 bad oranges and 2 sour oranges, so the total number of oranges that are not good is 1 + 2 = 3.

Since there are 25 oranges in total, the number of oranges that are not bad or sour is 25 - 3 = 22.

However, 20% of the oranges are unripe, which means 20% of 25 oranges are unripe. To find the number of unripe oranges, we multiply 25 by 0.2.

0.2 * 25 = 5

So, the number of unripe oranges is 5. 

Now, we know that the number of oranges that are not bad or sour is 22, and 5 of them are unripe. Therefore, the number of good oranges is 22 - 5 = 17.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the value of the pension after 30 years and then find 5% of that value.

Marcy works for 30 years, but she only gets the 5% increase after 20 years. So, for the first 20 years, she gets the standard $50,000 annual pension. 

For the next 10 years (from year 21 to 30), she gets 5% of the value of the pension. 

First, let's calculate the value of the pension after 20 years. Since she gets the standard pension for 20 years, the total value of the pension after 20 years is $50,000 * 20 = $1,000,000.

Now, we need to find 5% of the value of the pension after 20 years. 5% of $1,000,000 is 0.05 * $1,000,000 = $50,000.

So, for the next 10 years, she gets $50,000 as an additional pension.

The total annual pension after 30 years will be the sum of the standard pension and the additional pension: $50,000 + $50,000 = $100,000.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the first half of the year and the second half of the year separately, and then add them together.

The streaming service charges $140 per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the first half of the year consists of 6 months. 

The total amount paid for the first half of the year is 6 * $140 = $840.

For the second half of the year, the streaming company charges 10% less than the initial amount. To find the amount charged for the second half, we need to calculate 10% of $140 and subtract it from $140.

10% of $140 = 0.1 * $140 = $14
Amount charged for the second half of the year = $140 - $14 = $126

The total amount paid for the second half of the year is 6 * $126 = $756.

Now, we add the total amount paid for the first half and the second half of the year to get the total amount paid by the end of the year.

Total amount paid = $840 + $756 = $1596

"To determine how far Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to find out how many miles she can drive per gallon. We know that she has traveled 100 miles since her last fill-up and that it took 4 gallons to fill up her tank again. 

First, let's find out how many miles she can drive per gallon. We can do this by dividing the total distance she has traveled (100 miles) by the amount of gas she used (4 gallons). 

100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon

Now that we know she can drive 25 miles per gallon, we can find out how many miles she can drive on a full tank by multiplying the miles per gallon by the total capacity of her tank (12 gallons).

- Petunias: $1.87 → $2
- Begonias: $2.12 → $2

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from each type of flower:
- Marigolds: 12 pots * $3/pot = $36
- Petunias: 9 pots * $2/pot = $18
- Begonias: 17 pots * $2/pot = $34

Now, let's add the total revenue from each type of flower:
$36 + $18 + $34 = $88

The final answer is: $88"
"To find the average square footage of a level, we need to first find the total square footage of the sandcastle and then divide it by the number of levels.

Since each level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can start with the top level and work our way down. 

The top level has a square footage of 16. 
The second level will have half of 16, which is 8. 
The third level will have half of 8, which is 4. 
The fourth level will have half of 4, which is 2.

Now, we add up the square footage of all levels: 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30.

There are 4 levels in total. To find the average square footage, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels: 30 / 4 = 7.5.

The final answer is: 7.5"
"To find the total number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total number of cups of dog food the puppy will eat in the first year and then divide it by the number of cups in a bag.

The puppy eats 1 cup of dog food per day for the first 180 days. So, the total number of cups of dog food eaten in the first 180 days is 180 * 1 = 180 cups.

The puppy eats 2 cups of dog food per day for the rest of its life, which is 365 - 180 = 185 days. So, the total number of cups of dog food eaten in the rest of the year is 185 * 2 = 370 cups.

The total number of cups of dog food eaten in the first year is 180 + 370 = 550 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the total number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year is 550 / 110 = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much laundry Raymond and David do.

Since Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, and she does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can find out how much laundry David does by dividing 400 by 4.

David's laundry = 400 / 4 = 100 pounds

Since Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, we can find out how much laundry Raymond does by dividing 400 by 2.

Raymond's laundry = 400 / 2 = 200 pounds

Now, we need to find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do.

Difference = Raymond's laundry - David's laundry
= 200 - 100
= 100 pounds

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the better price, we need to calculate the cost per flower for each package option.

For the package of 3 flowers for $2.50, the cost per flower is $2.50 / 3 = $0.8333 per flower.

For the package of 2 flowers for $1, the cost per flower is $1 / 2 = $0.5 per flower.

Since $0.5 per flower is less than $0.8333 per flower, the package of 2 flowers for $1 is the better option.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price. 18 flowers / 2 flowers per package = 9 packages. The total cost is 9 packages * $1 per package = $9.

To find the cost of buying 18 flowers at the more expensive option, we calculate 18 flowers / 3 flowers per package = 6 packages. The total cost is 6 packages * $2.50 per package = $15.

The amount of money saved is $15 - $9 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To find the cost of the grooming after the discount, we need to calculate 30% of the original price and subtract it from the original price.

The original price is $100. 
30% of $100 is 0.3 x $100 = $30.

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price: $100 - $30 = $70.

The final cost of the grooming is $70.

The final answer is: $70"
"To find out how much water the girls got, we need to calculate 1/6 of 24 liters for each girl. 

1/6 of 24 liters is 24 / 6 = 4 liters. Since there are two girls, they got a total of 4 * 2 = 8 liters.

Now, we subtract the total amount of water the girls got from the initial 24 liters. 

24 - 8 = 16 liters.

Then, the boy got 6 liters of water. 

16 - 6 = 10 liters.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many stickers Charlie has left, we need to calculate the total number of stickers he had initially and then subtract the number of stickers he gave away or used.

Initially, Charlie had 10 stickers.

He bought 21 stickers from a store, so now he has 10 + 21 = 31 stickers.

He got 23 stickers for his birthday, so now he has 31 + 23 = 54 stickers.

Then, he gave 9 stickers to his sister, so now he has 54 - 9 = 45 stickers.

Finally, he used 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card, so now he has 45 - 28 = 17 stickers.

Therefore, Charlie has 17 stickers left.

"To find the total number of thorns, we need to multiply the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush, and then multiply that result by the number of thorns per rose.

First, we multiply the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush: 3 * 25 = 75

Then, we multiply the result by the number of thorns per rose: 75 * 8 = 600

So, there are 600 thorns in total.

The final answer is: 600"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let's represent the number of games the team lost as 'x'. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games they won can be represented as 'x + 8'.

We know that the total number of games played is 22, which is the sum of the games won and lost. So, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:

2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 7

Since x represents the number of games lost, the number of games won is x + 8. 

x + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15

"To find the total number of quilt blocks, we need to calculate the total number of years Gene has been vacationing and multiply it by the number of vacations he goes on per year.

Gene has been vacationing since he was 23 years old and is now 34, so he has been vacationing for 34 - 23 = 11 years.

Since he goes on four vacations a year, the total number of quilt blocks is 11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 quilt blocks.

The final answer is: 44"
"To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the number of times it rang each time it went off and add them together.

The first time the alarm went off, it rang 4 times.

The second time, it rang for three times as long as the first time, so it rang 3 * 4 = 12 times.

The third time, it rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we add the number of times it rang each time: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To find Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we first need to calculate her salary after five years of service, and then calculate the increase for the next three years.

Initially, Sylvie's salary is $600. 

After one year, her salary will be 600 + (600 * 0.10) = 600 + 60 = $660.

After two years, her salary will be 660 + (660 * 0.10) = 660 + 66 = $726.

After three years, her salary will be 726 + (726 * 0.10) = 726 + 72.6 = $798.60.

After four years, her salary will be 798.60 + (798.60 * 0.10) = 798.60 + 79.86 = $878.46.

After five years, her salary will be 878.46 + (878.46 * 0.10) = 878.46 + 87.846 = $966.306.

Since Sylvie has already reached the five-year mark, she will receive a 10% increase every year for the next three years. 

After six years, her salary will be 966.306 + (966.306 * 0.10) = 966.306 + 96.6306 = $1062.9366.

After seven years, her salary will be 1062.9366 + (1062.9366 * 0.10) = 1062.9366 + 106.29366 = $1169.23026.

After eight years, her salary will be 1169.23026 + (1169.23026 * 0.10) = 1169.23026 + 116.923026 = $1286.153286.

The final answer is: $1286.15"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as 'H' and the number of copies Marilyn sold as 'M'. We know that M = 10H, since Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's.

We also know that the total number of copies sold is 88,000, so M + H = 88,000.

Substituting M = 10H into the second equation, we get 10H + H = 88,000.

Combining like terms, we get 11H = 88,000.

To solve for H, we divide both sides by 11: H = 88,000 / 11.

H = 8000.

The final answer is: 8000"
"To find out how many gift bags Christina needs, we first need to calculate the number of guests she expects to attend. Since 1/4 of the invited guests don't show up, we can find the number of expected attendees by subtracting 1/4 from the total number of invited guests.

Number of invited guests: 16
Number of guests not showing up: 16 * (1/4) = 4
Number of expected attendees: 16 - 4 = 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we multiply the number of expected attendees by 0.75 to find the total number of gift bags needed.

Number of gift bags needed: 12 * 0.75 = 9

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of gift bags needed by the cost per gift bag.

Cost per gift bag: $2
Total cost: 9 * $2 = $18

The final answer is: $18"
"To determine the total amount of potato salad needed, we need to calculate the amount an adult and a child will eat and then multiply it by the number of adults and children, respectively.

An adult will eat 10 lbs of potato salad, and a child will eat half as much as an adult, which is 10 / 2 = 5 lbs.

There are 20 adults, so the total amount of potato salad needed for adults is 20 * 10 = 200 lbs.

There are 5 children, so the total amount of potato salad needed for children is 5 * 5 = 25 lbs.

To find the total amount of potato salad needed, we add the amount for adults and children: 200 + 25 = 225 lbs.

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.

225"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem.

We know that Cindy has 4 pets. Since Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.

We also know that Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia. Since Marcia has 6 pets, Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets.

To find the total number of pets the three have, we need to add the number of pets each of them has: 4 (Cindy) + 6 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan) = 28.

The final answer is: 28"
"To find Jackson's age, we need to determine Corey's age first. Since James is 10 and 1 year younger than Corey, Corey must be 10 + 1 = 11 years old.

We also know that Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

Given that Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, we can find Jackson's age by subtracting 5 from Amy's age: 9 - 5 = 4.

So, Jackson is 4 years old.

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it takes Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles before his diet change. Since Lee runs 2 seconds faster than Gerald, we can set up an equation:

Time it takes Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles = Time it takes Lee to run the 400-meter hurdles + 2 seconds

We know that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds. So, we can substitute this value into the equation:

Time it takes Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles = 38 + 2
Time it takes Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles = 40 seconds

Now, we know that Gerald's diet improved his speed by 10%. To find out how much time he will save, we need to calculate 10% of 40 seconds:

10% of 40 seconds = 0.1 * 40 = 4 seconds

Since Gerald's speed improved by 10%, he will save 4 seconds from his original time. To find out his new time, we subtract 4 seconds from his original time:

New time it takes Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles = Original time - Time saved
New time it takes Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles = 40 - 4
New time it takes Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles = 36 seconds

The final answer is: 36"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of cats, then the number of rabbits, and finally add them up with the number of dogs to get the total number of pets.

Given that there are two cats for every dog, and the number of dogs is 60, we can find the number of cats by multiplying the number of dogs by 2.

Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
= 2 * 60
= 120

Now, we know that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. We can find the combined number of dogs and cats by adding the number of dogs and cats.

Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
= 60 + 120
= 180

Now, we can find the number of rabbits by subtracting 12 from the combined number of dogs and cats.

Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
= 180 - 12
= 168

Finally, we can find the total number of pets in the neighborhood by adding the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits.

Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
= 60 + 120 + 168
= 348

"To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we first need to find the total number of girls and then subtract the number of girls in the girl scout.

First, let's find the number of boys and girls. We know that 2/5 of the students are boys. 

Number of boys = (2/5) * 200 = 80

Since there are 200 students in total, the number of girls can be found by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students.

Number of girls = 200 - 80 = 120

Now, we know that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. 

Number of girls in the girl scout = (2/3) * 120 = 80

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls.

Number of girls not in the girl scout = 120 - 80 = 40

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many ounces of tomatoes Freda used to make 32 ounces of sauce. Since the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked, the sauce is half the volume of the tomatoes. 

Let's denote the total volume of tomatoes as T. Since the sauce is half the volume of the tomatoes, the volume of the sauce (32 ounces) is half of T. So, T = 32 * 2 = 64 ounces.

We know that each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains three tomatoes. To find out how many cans of tomatoes Freda used, we divide the total volume of tomatoes (64 ounces) by the volume of each can (16 ounces). 64 / 16 = 4 cans.

Since each can contains three tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes used is 4 cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes.

"To find out how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we need to first determine the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam. 

We know that 20 cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. Since 5 cars took an exit, we need to subtract those from the total number of cars that were originally on the motorway. 

So, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 30 - 5 = 25 cars.

Now, we know that 20 cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. To find out how many cars drove through in the first 15 minutes, we need to subtract 20 from the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam.

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 25 - 20 = 5 cars.

"To find out how many potted plants Mary will have left, we first need to determine the total number of potted plants she has initially. She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, so the total number of potted plants she has is 2 * 40 = 80.

Yesterday, she received 18 new potted plants, so the total number of potted plants she has now is 80 + 18 = 98.

Tomorrow, she will give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to her friends and family, so she will give away 40 potted plants.

To find out how many potted plants she will have left, we subtract the number of potted plants she gave away from the total number of potted plants she has now: 98 - 40 = 58.

"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell and add them up.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. Since 1/4 of 20 is 5, the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. We are given that the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times, so the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

Now, we add up the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell: 20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 155.

The total number of doorbell rings is 155.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 2 episodes of a 1-hour show, which is a total of 2 * 1 = 2 hours.

On Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. Let's call the number of episodes 'x'. Since each episode is 30 minutes, the total time he watched on Wednesday is 30x minutes.

On Thursday, he watched 1 hour and 30 minutes of TV. Converting 1 hour to minutes, we get 60 minutes. So, the total time he watched on Thursday is 60 + 30 = 90 minutes.

On Friday, he watched 2 episodes of a 1-hour show, which is a total of 2 * 1 = 2 hours.

The total time Frankie watched TV is 7 hours, which is equal to 7 * 60 = 420 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time he watched on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday: 2 + 2 + 90 + 2 * 60 = 2 + 2 + 90 + 120 = 214 minutes.

The time he watched on Wednesday is the difference between the total time and the time he watched on other days: 420 - 214 = 206 minutes.

Since each episode is 30 minutes, we can find the number of episodes by dividing the total time by 30: 206 / 30 = 6.8666. Since we can't have a fraction of an episode, we round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can have a fraction of an episode, so we will keep the decimal value.

However, the question asks for the number of 30-minute episodes, and since we can't have a fraction of an episode, we will round down to the nearest whole number. But in this case, we will keep the decimal value as it is, and then we will round down to the nearest whole number in the final answer.

The number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday is 6.8666."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as 'x'. Since Henry wants to make twice as many cookies this year, he plans to bake 2x cookies.

However, he actually baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the total number of cookies he baked is 2x + 15.

After dropping 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies left. This can be represented as:

2x + 15 - 5 = 110

Combine like terms:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2x = 100

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 50

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To find the total cost of gas after the cashback rewards, we need to first calculate the total cost of gas without the rewards, and then subtract the cashback amount.

The cost of gas per gallon is $3.00, and the person is buying 10 gallons. 

Total cost of gas = cost per gallon * number of gallons
Total cost of gas = $3.00 * 10
Total cost of gas = $30.00

The cashback reward is $0.20 per gallon, and the person is buying 10 gallons.

Total cashback = cashback per gallon * number of gallons
Total cashback = $0.20 * 10
Total cashback = $2.00

Now, we subtract the total cashback from the total cost of gas to find the final cost.

Final cost = Total cost of gas - Total cashback
Final cost = $30.00 - $2.00
Final cost = $28.00

"To find the total number of fruit roll-ups eaten by each person, we need to calculate the area of their respective roll-ups. 

Beatrice's roll-up is 2 roll-ups wide and 24 rolls up long, so its area is 2 * 24 = 48 square roll-ups. 

Marcell's roll-up is 3 roll-ups wide and 14 rolls up long, so its area is 3 * 14 = 42 square roll-ups.

To find the total number of roll-ups eaten by each person, we need to know the total number of roll-ups in each roll-up. Since we don't have this information, we'll assume that each roll-up is the same size, and the width and length given are the number of roll-ups. 

So, Beatrice ate 48 roll-ups, and Marcell ate 42 roll-ups.

To find the average number of roll-ups eaten, we need to add the total number of roll-ups eaten by both people and divide by 2.

Total roll-ups eaten = 48 + 42 = 90

Average roll-ups eaten = 90 / 2 = 45

First, let's find out how many sets of 10 feet Julia rows in 16 seconds. Since it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can find the time it takes her to row 10 feet by dividing 16 by 2, which is 8 seconds. 

Now, we can find out how many sets of 10 feet she rows in 64 seconds by dividing 64 by 8, which is 8 sets.

Since it takes 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, and Julia rows 8 sets of 10 feet, she takes on 8 * 2 = 16 liters of water.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we need to calculate the total number of lessons and then multiply it by the number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per lesson.

Each teacher has 2 lessons per day, and there are 4 teachers. So, the total number of lessons per day is 2 * 4 = 8.

The whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson. Therefore, the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day is 8 * 3 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the total number of flowers Ryan has, we need to calculate the total number of flowers he planted and subtract the ones that did not grow.

Ryan plants 2 flowers a day. After 15 days, he would have planted 2 * 15 = 30 flowers.

However, 5 of these flowers did not grow. So, we need to subtract 5 from the total number of flowers planted.

Total flowers = 30 - 5 = 25

The final answer is: 25"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs. Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, we can find the number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold by dividing 1800 by 6.

Brittany's phone can hold 1800 / 6 = 300 photographs.

Next, we are told that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Let's call the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph ""x"". Then, we can write the equation:

300 = 50x

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 50:

x = 300 / 50
x = 6

So, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.

The final answer is: 6"
"To calculate Sasha's profit, we need to first find the total cost of the lumber and the total selling price. 

The total cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $10 = $100. 
The total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $16 = $80. 
The total cost of all the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since prices have gone up by 50%, the new price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each. 
The new price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 each.

The total selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $15 = $150. 
The total selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $24 = $120. 
The total selling price of all the lumber is $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit is the total selling price minus the total cost, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To solve this problem, we need to use the given ratio of sugar to water, which is 7:13. This means that for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, there are 13 cups of water. 

First, we need to find the total number of parts in the ratio, which is 7 + 13 = 20. 

Since the total amount of sugar and water used is 120, we can set up a proportion to find the number of teaspoons of sugar used. Let's say the number of teaspoons of sugar used is 7x. Then, the number of cups of water used is 13x.

We know that 7x + 13x = 120, since the total amount of sugar and water used is 120. Combining like terms, we get 20x = 120.

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 20: x = 120 / 20 = 6.

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the number of teaspoons of sugar used by multiplying 7 and x: 7 * 6 = 42.

The final answer is: 42"
"To find the total amount John paid, we need to calculate the cost of the shoes for all 3 children. 

First, we find the cost of shoes for one child: 2 pairs * $60 per pair = $120.

So, John paid a total of $360.

The final answer is: $360"
"To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we first need to determine the total number of vehicles that were already at the port. We know that there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles initially is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of vehicles at the port after the second day is 30. To find the number of vehicles brought in on the second day, we subtract the initial number of vehicles from the total number of vehicles: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can find the number of containers brought in on the second day by dividing the number of vehicles brought in by the number of vehicles per container: 20 / 5 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Lylah's salary four years ago. 

Let's assume Lylah's salary four years ago was 'x'. Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can express Adrien's salary as 1.3x. We are given that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000, so we can set up the equation:

1.3x = 40000

To find 'x', we can divide both sides by 1.3:

x = 40000 / 1.3
x = 30769.23

So, Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30769.23.

Now, we need to find Adrien's salary four years later. We are given that his salary increased by 40% of his original salary. We can express this as:

New salary = Original salary + (40% of Original salary)
= 40000 + (0.4 * 40000)
= 40000 + 16000
= 56000

Now, we need to find Lylah's salary four years later. Since their salaries increased simultaneously, we can assume the percentage increase for Lylah is the same as Adrien's, which is 40%. We can express Lylah's new salary as:

New salary = Original salary + (40% of Original salary)
= 30769.23 + (0.4 * 30769.23)
= 30769.23 + 12307.69
= 43076.92

Now, we can find the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later by adding their new salaries:

Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary
= 56000 + 43076.92
= 99076.92

The final answer is: $99077"
"To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we need to first calculate how many sheets he uses in a week and then multiply that by the number of weeks in a month.

Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad has 30 sheets. So, the total number of sheets he uses in a week is 2 pads * 30 sheets/pad = 60 sheets.

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we can multiply the number of sheets Miguel uses in a week by 4 to find the total number of sheets he uses in a month: 60 sheets/week * 4 weeks/month = 240 sheets/month.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the total number of fruits, we need to calculate the number of fruits each person brought and then add them together.

Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges. 

Kael brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette, which is 2 * 5 = 10 apples. 
Kael brought half the number of oranges as Morisette, which is 8 / 2 = 4 oranges.

So, Morisette brought 5 + 8 = 13 fruits, and Kael brought 10 + 4 = 14 fruits.

The total number of fruits they have is 13 + 14 = 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"To find the total hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we need to calculate the hours she slept on each day and add them up.

On Monday, Sadie slept 8 hours.

For the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday), she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours each day.

The rest of the week (Thursday to Sunday) she slept 1 hour more than those two days, so she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours each day.

Now, let's calculate the total hours she slept for each period:

- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday and Wednesday: 2 days * 6 hours = 12 hours
- Thursday to Sunday: 5 days * 7 hours = 35 hours

Adding up the hours, we get: 8 + 12 + 35 = 55 hours

"To find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour and the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour.

First, let's calculate the distance Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours. 

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, let's calculate the remaining time after 3 hours. 
Total time = 7 hours
Time already run = 3 hours
Remaining time = Total time - Time already run
Remaining time = 7 hours - 3 hours
Remaining time = 4 hours

Next, let's calculate the distance Rosie runs at 5 miles per hour for the remaining 4 hours.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour * 4 hours
Distance = 20 miles

Now, let's add the distances from both parts to find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours.

Total distance = Distance at 10 mph + Distance at 5 mph
Total distance = 30 miles + 20 miles
Total distance = 50 miles

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many letters Jennie stamped and then subtract that from the total number of letters that were already stamped when she began.

We know that Jennie put stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps. Since there are 60 letters needing stamps, one-third of that is 60 / 3 = 20 letters.

We also know that after Jennie stamped 20 letters, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. This means that the 20 letters Jennie stamped were added to the pile of already-stamped letters.

So, to find out how many letters were in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began, we need to subtract the 20 letters Jennie added from the current total of 30 letters.

30 (current total) - 20 (letters Jennie added) = 10

Therefore, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Julia initially bought a package of spoons, but we don't know the quantity yet. Let's call this quantity 'x'.
2. Her husband bought a package of 5 new spoons and gave them to Julia.
3. Julia used 3 spoons while making the stew.
4. After using the spoons, Julia had a total of 12 spoons.

Now, let's set up an equation to represent the situation:

Initial spoons (x) + spoons from her husband (5) - spoons used (3) = Total spoons (12)

x + 5 - 3 = 12

Simplifying the equation:

x + 2 = 12

Subtract 2 from both sides:

x = 10

So, Julia bought a package of 10 spoons.

"To find the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we need to add the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages. 

First, let's find the number of fish sausages. Since Dylan bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, and he bought 38 chicken sausages, the number of fish sausages is 38 + 6 = 44.

Now, we can find the total number of sausages by adding the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages: 38 (chicken sausages) + 44 (fish sausages) = 82.

The final answer is: 82"
"To find the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together, we first need to determine the number of friends Amy has. Since Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, and Lily has 50 friends, we can calculate Amy's friends by adding 20 to Lily's total.

Amy's friends = Lily's friends + 20
Amy's friends = 50 + 20
Amy's friends = 70

Now, to find the total number of friends they have together, we add the number of friends Lily and Amy have.

Total friends = Lily's friends + Amy's friends
Total friends = 50 + 70
Total friends = 120

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to determine the cost of each item and then multiply it by the quantity.

First, let's find the cost of a watermelon. Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, and each pepper costs $15, the cost of a watermelon is 3 * $15 = $45.

Next, we find the cost of an orange. An orange costs 5 dollars less than a watermelon, so the cost of an orange is $45 - $5 = $40.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of each item:

- 4 watermelons: 4 * $45 = $180
- 20 peppers: 20 * $15 = $300
- 10 oranges: 10 * $40 = $400

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is the sum of the costs of all items: $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

"To calculate the hospital's profit, we need to first determine the total time spent by doctors and the total amount charged to patients.

The hospital sees 500 people a day, and each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes. 

First, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 24 minutes is 24/60 = 0.4 hours.

The total time spent by doctors is 500 patients * 0.4 hours per patient = 200 hours.

The doctors charge $150 an hour, so the total amount charged by doctors is 200 hours * $150 per hour = $30,000.

The hospital charges the patients $200 an hour, so the total amount charged to patients is 500 patients * 0.4 hours per patient * $200 per hour = $80,000.

The hospital's profit is the difference between the total amount charged to patients and the total amount charged by doctors, which is $80,000 - $30,000 = $50,000.

The final numerical answer is: $50,000"
"To find the number of elves left, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, Nissa hires 60 seasonal workers.

A third of the elves quit after children vomit on them. To find a third of 60, we divide 60 by 3:

So, 20 elves quit, leaving 60 - 20 = 40 elves.

Then, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. To find the number of elves left, we subtract 10 from 40:
40 - 10 = 30

Therefore, 30 elves are left.

For the first test, Mark had 8 hours to complete 75 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour. 

First, let's find out how many questions Mark could have completed in 8 hours: 
8 hours * 5 questions per hour = 40 questions

Since Mark had 75 questions in the first test, he left 75 - 40 = 35 questions incomplete.

For the second test, Mark had 6 hours to complete 100 questions at the same rate of 5 questions per hour.

Now, let's find out how many questions Mark could have completed in 6 hours: 
6 hours * 5 questions per hour = 30 questions

Since Mark had 100 questions in the second test, he left 100 - 30 = 70 questions incomplete.

"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine the total number of semi-automatic cars. We know that there are 20 cars in total, with 12 being automatic and 4 being manual. 

Total number of cars = 20
Number of automatic cars = 12
Number of manual cars = 4

To find the number of semi-automatic cars, we subtract the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars:
Number of semi-automatic cars = Total number of cars - (Number of automatic cars + Number of manual cars)
= 20 - (12 + 4)
= 20 - 16
= 4

Now, we can find the percentage of semi-automatic cars by dividing the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiplying by 100:
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100
= (4 / 20) * 100

"To solve this problem, we can start by representing the number of baby bees as 'x'. Since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, the number of worker bees is 2x. 

We also know that there are twice as many babies as queens, so the number of queens is x/2. 

The total number of bees in the hive is 700, which is the sum of worker bees, baby bees, and queens. We can write this as an equation:

x + 2x + x/2 = 700

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + 4x + x = 1400

Combine like terms:

7x = 1400

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 200

Now that we know the number of baby bees, we can find the number of worker bees, which is 2x:

Worker bees = 2 * 200 = 400

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of food items and non-food items separately and then add them together.

The food items are milk and eggs, which cost 2 dollars and 3 dollars respectively. So, the total cost of food items is 2 + 3 = 5 dollars.

The non-food items are light bulbs, cups, and roach traps, which cost 3 dollars, 3 dollars, and 4 dollars respectively. However, there is a 10% tax on these items. To find the total cost of non-food items, we need to calculate the tax first.

The total cost of non-food items before tax is 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars. The tax is 10% of 10 dollars, which is 0.1 * 10 = 1 dollar. So, the total cost of non-food items after tax is 10 + 1 = 11 dollars.

"To find out how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we first need to calculate the total number of pineapples in his field. 

Since John has 10 hectares of a pineapple field and there are 100 pineapples per hectare, we can multiply the number of hectares by the number of pineapples per hectare to get the total number of pineapples.

Total pineapples = 10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, we need to find out how many 3-month periods are in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so we can divide 12 by 3 to get the number of 3-month periods.

12 months/year / 3 months/period = 4 periods/year

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of the bees that left in the first 6 hours return. So, 1/2 * 30 = 15 bees return.
3. The number of bees that have left the hive so far is 30 (initially left) + 15 (returned) = 45 bees. However, 15 bees returned, so the number of bees that have left and not returned is 30 (initially left) - 15 (returned) = 15 bees.
4. In the next 6 hours, two times as many bees as the initial 30 leave the hive. So, 2 * 30 = 60 bees leave the hive.
5. The total number of bees that have left the hive so far is 30 (initially left) + 60 (left in the next 6 hours) = 90 bees. However, 15 bees returned in the previous step, and 15 bees returned in the second step, so the number of bees that have left and not returned is 30 (initially left) + 60 (left in the next 6 hours) - 30 (returned in the second step) = 60 bees.
6. In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive. So, 30 bees return.

The number of bees that return to the hive in the last 6 hours is 30."

Since Brittany's mom received $8 in change, the amount she gave the cashier is the total cost plus the change.

Amount given to the cashier = Total cost + Change
Amount given to the cashier = $22 + $8
Amount given to the cashier = $30

The final answer is: $30"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. We know that Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends. We can represent the number of friends Dorothy has as 'x'. Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, we can write an equation:

Charlie's friends = 3 * Dorothy's friends
12 = 3x

To find the number of friends Dorothy has, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 12 / 3
x = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find the number of friends James has. James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, so we can write another equation:

James' friends = 4 * Dorothy's friends
James' friends = 4 * 4
James' friends = 16

The final answer is: 16"
"To determine the time it takes for each person to get home, we need to calculate the time it takes for Steve and Tim to cover their respective distances.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet since the speeds are given in feet per minute. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15,840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10,560 feet

Now, let's calculate the time it takes for each person to get home:

Steve's time: distance / speed = 15,840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: distance / speed = 10,560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 36 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve will be the winner. To find out how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to subtract the winner's time from the loser's time.

Waiting time = Tim's time - Steve's time = 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

"To find out how much Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total cost of inflating all the tires. 

First, let's calculate the cost of inflating the bicycle tires. Each bicycle has 2 tires, and there were 5 bicycles. So, the total number of bicycle tires is 5 * 2 = 10. The cost of inflating these tires is 10 * 25 cents = $2.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of inflating the tricycle tires. Each tricycle has 3 tires, and there were 3 tricycles. So, the total number of tricycle tires is 3 * 3 = 9. The cost of inflating these tires is 9 * 25 cents = $2.25.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of inflating the unicycle tire. A unicycle has 1 tire, and there was 1 unicycle. So, the total number of unicycle tires is 1 * 1 = 1. The cost of inflating this tire is 1 * 25 cents = $0.25.

Now, let's add up the total cost of inflating all the tires: $2.50 + $2.25 + $0.25 = $5.00.

The final answer is: $5.00"
"To find out how much change Carl receives, we first need to calculate the total cost of the cookies. 

There are 10 packs of cookies, and each pack has 6 cookies. So, the total number of cookies is 10 * 6 = 60 cookies.

Each cookie costs $0.10, so the total cost of the cookies is 60 * $0.10 = $6.

Carl pays with a $10 bill, so the change he receives is $10 - $6 = $4.

The final numerical answer is: $4"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Dave ate 14 french fries initially.
2. The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 french fries.
   Now, the total amount eaten by Dave and the seagull is 14 + 7 = 21 french fries.
3. Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate a total of 3 * 3 = 9 french fries.
   Now, the total amount eaten is 21 + 9 = 30 french fries.
4. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries. Let's denote the initial amount of fries as 'x'. 
   After the seagull and pigeons ate, the remaining amount is x - 30.
   The raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries, which is (2/3) * (x - 30).
   The remaining amount after the raccoon is (x - 30) - (2/3) * (x - 30).
   Simplifying this, we get (1/3) * (x - 30).
5. After the raccoon, ants carried off a final french fry, leaving 5 behind. 
   So, the remaining amount after the raccoon is (1/3) * (x - 30) - 1 = 5.
   Now, we can solve for 'x'.
   (1/3) * (x - 30) = 6
   x - 30 = 18
   x = 48

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in a semester, we need to calculate the total hours he spends in a week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a semester.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes per day, each lasting 1 hour. So, the total hours he spends on these days per week is 3 * 3 * 1 = 9 hours.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes per day, each lasting 2 hours. So, the total hours he spends on these days per week is 2 * 2 * 2 = 8 hours.

The total hours Kimo spends in a week is 9 + 8 = 17 hours.

Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, the total hours Kimo spends attending classes in a semester is 17 * 16 = 272 hours.

The final answer is: 272"
"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the length of each type of baked good in feet and then add them together.

First, let's convert the length of each type of baked good from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

- Each roll is 4 inches long, which is 4/12 = 1/3 feet long.
- Each croissant is 6 inches long, which is 6/12 = 0.5 feet long.
- Each baguette is 2 feet long.

Now, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good:

- Rolls: 300 rolls * 1/3 feet per roll = 100 feet
- Croissants: 120 croissants * 0.5 feet per croissant = 60 feet
- Baguettes: 60 baguettes * 2 feet per baguette = 120 feet

Now, let's add the lengths together to find the total length of the baked goods:

100 feet (rolls) + 60 feet (croissants) + 120 feet (baguettes) = 280 feet

"To determine the total number of bananas needed for 2 months, we need to calculate the monthly consumption of all the apes and then multiply it by 2.

The monkeys need 200 bananas per month, the gorillas need 400 bananas per month, and the baboons need 100 bananas per month. 

Total monthly consumption = 200 (monkeys) + 400 (gorillas) + 100 (baboons) = 700 bananas per month.

Since the zookeeper needs to order bananas for 2 months, we multiply the total monthly consumption by 2.

Total bananas needed for 2 months = 700 bananas/month * 2 months = 1400 bananas.

The final answer is: 1400"
"To find out who the winner is, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Since he's running back and forth, the total distance he covers is 2 times the length of the field for each run. So, the total distance Blake ran is 15 * 2 * 100 = 3000 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 2 * 100 = 200 yards. Then, she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 2 * 40 = 80 yards. She does this 34 times, so the total distance she covers is 34 * 80 = 2720 yards. 

To find the total distance Kelly ran, we add the initial 200 yards to the distance she ran to the 40-yard line and back: 2720 + 200 = 2920 yards.

Now, we compare the distances: Blake ran 3000 yards, and Kelly ran 2920 yards. Blake is the winner.

To find out how much farther the winner ran than the loser, we subtract the loser's distance from the winner's distance: 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

"To find the total number of fish caught by Anakin, we need to add the number of starfish, sea horses, and clownfish he caught. 

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. 

Total fish caught by Anakin = 10 + 6 + 3 = 19

Now, let's find the number of fish caught by Locsin. 

Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so he caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.

Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so he caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.

Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so he caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Total fish caught by Locsin = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

Now, let's find the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin.

Total fish caught = Total fish caught by Anakin + Total fish caught by Locsin
= 19 + 13

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the price increase every two months and add it to the original price. 

The original price of the bag of marbles is $20. 

After 2 months, the price increases by 20% of $20, which is 0.20 * $20 = $4. 
So, the price after 2 months is $20 + $4 = $24.

After 4 months, the price increases by 20% of $24, which is 0.20 * $24 = $4.80. 
So, the price after 4 months is $24 + $4.80 = $28.80.

After 6 months, the price increases by 20% of $28.80, which is 0.20 * $28.80 = $5.76. 
So, the price after 6 months is $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56.

After 8 months, the price increases by 20% of $34.56, which is 0.20 * $34.56 = $6.912. 
So, the price after 8 months is $34.56 + $6.912 = $41.472.

After 10 months, the price increases by 20% of $41.472, which is 0.20 * $41.472 = $8.2944. 
So, the price after 10 months is $41.472 + $8.2944 = $49.7664.

After 12 months, the price increases by 20% of $49.7664, which is 0.20 * $49.7664 = $9.95328. 
So, the price after 12 months is $49.7664 + $9.95328 = $59.71968.

After 14 months, the price increases by 20% of $59.71968, which is 0.20 * $59.71968 = $11.943736. 
So, the price after 14 months is $59.71968 + $11.943736 = $71.663416.

After 16 months, the price increases by 20% of $71.663416, which is 0.20 * $71.663416 = $14.3326832. 
So, the price after 16 months is $71.663416 + $14.3326832 = $85.9960992.

After 18 months, the price increases by 20% of $85.9960992, which is 0.20 * $85.9960992 = $17.19921984. 
So, the price after 18 months is $85.9960992 + $17.19921984 = $103.19531904.

So, the price after 20 months is $103.19531904 + $20.639063608 = $123.834382648.

After 22 months, the price increases by 20% of $123.834382648, which is 0.20 * $123.834382648 = $24.7668765296. 
So, the price after 22 months is $123.834382648 + $24.7668765296 = $148.601259178.

After 24 months, the price increases by 20% of $148.601259178, which is 0.20 * $148.601259178 = $29.7202518356. 
So, the price after 24 months is $148.601259178 + $29.7202518356 = $178.321510994.

After 26 months, the price increases by 20% of $178.321510994, which is 0.20 * $178.321510994 = $35.6643121988. 
So, the price after 26 months is $178.321510994 + $35.6643121988 = $213.985823193.

So, the price after 30 months is $256.783987832 + $51.3567975664 = $308.140785398.

After 32 months, the price increases by 20% of $308.140785398, which is 0.20 * $308.140785398 = $61.6281570796. 
So, the price after 32 months is $308.140785398 + $61.6281570796 = $369.768942478.

After 34 months, the price increases by 20% of $369.768942478, which is 0.20 * $369.768942478 = $73.953788496. 
So, the price after 34 months is $369.768942478 + $73.953788496 = $443.722730974.

The doll costs as much as 3 action figures. Since an action figure costs $5, the doll costs 3 * $5 = $15.

One red car costs $4. Since there are 5 red cars, the total cost of the red cars is 5 * $4 = $20.

The total cost of the action figures is 3 * $5 = $15.

Now, we add the cost of the doll, the red cars, and the action figures together: $15 (doll) + $20 (red cars) + $15 (action figures) = $50.

The total worth of all the toys is $50.

"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the difference in income between hiring the accountant and doing the taxes herself.

If Jackie does the taxes herself, she'll lose $35/hour in missed income for 3 hours of freelance work. So, the total income lost is $35/hour * 3 hours = $105.

The cost of hiring the accountant is $90.

Now, let's calculate the difference in income: 
Income with accountant = $0 (since she won't lose any income)
Income without accountant = $105 (lost income)
Difference = Income with accountant - Income without accountant
Difference = $0 - $105
Difference = -$105

However, since we want to know how much more money she'll have if she hires the accountant, we need to consider the cost of hiring the accountant. So, the actual difference is:
Difference = -$105 - $90
Difference = -$195

Since we want to know how much more money she'll have, we'll make the answer positive:
Difference = $195

"To determine how many times Sandra has to babysit, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she needs for the Spanish flans and divide that by the number of eggs she receives per babysitting job.

First, let's calculate the total number of eggs needed for 15 Spanish flans. Since each flan requires 3 eggs, we multiply 15 by 3:

15 flans * 3 eggs/flan = 45 eggs

Now, we need to divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs Sandra receives per babysitting job, which is 9:

45 eggs / 9 eggs/babysitting job = 5

So, Sandra has to babysit 5 times to get enough eggs for 15 Spanish flans.

"Let's denote Brooke's current age as B and Seth's current age as S. We are given that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write an equation:

S = 2B

We are also given that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. This means that in 2 years, Seth's age will be S + 2 and Brooke's age will be B + 2. The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write another equation:

S + 2 + B + 2 = 28

Combine like terms:

S + B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

S + B = 24

Now we can substitute S = 2B into this equation:

2B + B = 24

Combine like terms:

3B = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B = 8 into the equation S = 2B:

S = 2(8)
S = 16

The final answer is: 16"

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, and Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old. So, Sally Four is also 8 years old.
2. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.
3. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we have the ages of three birds: Sally Four (8), Granny Red (16), and Sally Two (19). The only bird left is the one at the Caboose, which is Sally Two's counterpart, Sally One. However, the problem doesn't mention Sally One's age, but since Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, and Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, we can assume that the ages of the birds are sequential. Therefore, Sally One would be 2 years old.

The total age of the four birds is 2 + 8 + 16 + 19 = 45.

"To find out how much Jessica pays in a year, we first need to calculate her monthly payments for each debt. 

The minimum payment for her student loans is $300, so 50% more than the minimum would be $300 + ($300 * 0.5) = $300 + $150 = $450.

The minimum payment for her credit card is $200, so 50% more than the minimum would be $200 + ($200 * 0.5) = $200 + $100 = $300.

The minimum payment for her mortgage is $500, so 50% more than the minimum would be $500 + ($500 * 0.5) = $500 + $250 = $750.

Now, we add up the monthly payments for each debt: $450 (student loans) + $300 (credit card) + $750 (mortgage) = $1500.

To find the total amount paid in a year, we multiply the monthly payment by 12: $1500 * 12 = $18,000.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much they made in total from selling lemonade and then subtract the cost of sugar to find the cost of lemons.

Let's denote the number of gallons as 'g'. Since they get 20 glasses per gallon and sell each glass for $0.50, the total revenue from selling lemonade is 20 * 0.5 * g = 10g dollars.

The total cost of making lemonade is 3g (for lemons) + 2g (for sugar) = 5g dollars.

Since they made a profit of $25, we can set up the equation: 10g - 5g = 25.

Simplifying the equation, we get 5g = 25.

Dividing both sides by 5, we get g = 5.

Now that we know they made 5 gallons, we can find the cost of lemons: 3g = 3 * 5 = 15 dollars.

2. Zaid spends 1/3 on car fuel:
   1/3 of 4500 = 4500 * 1/3 = 1500

   Remaining amount after car fuel = 4500 - 1500 = 3000

3. Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity:
   Half of 3000 = 3000 * 1/2 = 1500

   Remaining amount after donation = 3000 - 1500 = 1500

4. Zaid gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$:
   Total given to family = 200 + 700 = 900

   Remaining amount after giving to family = 1500 - 900 = 600

Therefore, Zaid will have 600 dollars left after all these expenses and donations.

The final answer is: $600"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Bo has 40 crabs.
- Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.
- Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

To find the total number of crabs the three have together, we add the number of crabs each one has: 40 (Bo) + 36 (Monic) + 46 (Rani) = 122.

The final answer is: 122"
"To find out how much Lloyd earned in the first two weeks, we need to calculate his earnings for each week and then add them together.

For the first week, Lloyd tutored 5 hours at $10 per hour, so his earnings for the first week are:
5 hours * $10/hour = $50

For the second week, Lloyd tutored 8 hours at $10 per hour, so his earnings for the second week are:
8 hours * $10/hour = $80

Now, we add his earnings for both weeks to find the total:
$50 (first week) + $80 (second week) = $130

The final answer is: $130"
"To find the number of votes the loser got, we first need to find the total number of votes the winner got. Since the winner got 3/4 of the votes, we can calculate this by multiplying 3/4 by the total number of students who voted, which is 80.

3/4 * 80 = (3 * 80) / 4
= 240 / 4
= 60

So, the winner got 60 votes. To find the number of votes the loser got, we subtract the number of votes the winner got from the total number of votes.

Total votes = 80
Votes the winner got = 60
Votes the loser got = Total votes - Votes the winner got
= 80 - 60
= 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of white carnations and then calculate the number of red roses.

Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. According to the problem, Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations. This can be represented as:

200 = 5x

To find the value of 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 5:

x = 200 / 5
x = 40

So, Sandra ordered 40 white carnations.

Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, we can calculate the number of red roses as:

Number of red roses = 4 * x
= 4 * 40
= 160

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

The final answer is: 160"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem.

Let's denote Mark's current age as M and Jean's current age as J. We know that J = M + 2.

Two years ago, Mark was M - 2 years old, and Jan was 30 - 2 = 28 years old. We are also given that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. This can be written as:

M - 2 = (1/2) * 28 + 5

Simplifying the equation:

M - 2 = 14 + 5
M - 2 = 19
M = 21

Now that we know Mark's age, we can find Jean's age by adding 2 to Mark's age:

J = M + 2
J = 21 + 2
J = 23

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total time for each team, we need to calculate the time for each runner and add them up.

The well-rounded team has each member running 400 meters in 55 seconds. Since there are 4 members, the total time for the well-rounded team is 4 * 55 = 220 seconds.

The less well-rounded team's first runner runs 400 meters in 60 seconds. The second runner is 3 seconds faster, so they run 400 meters in 60 - 3 = 57 seconds. The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so they run 400 meters in 57 - 3 = 54 seconds. The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so they run 400 meters in 54 - 3 = 51 seconds. The total time for the less well-rounded team is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 162 seconds.

To find the difference in time between the two teams, we subtract the time of the less well-rounded team from the time of the well-rounded team: 220 - 162 = 58 seconds.

The faster team will win by 58 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, and then find the difference between these two probabilities.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die is the probability of rolling a 4, 5, or 6. There are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, 6) out of 6 possible outcomes, so the probability is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5 or 50%.

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5, since there are 3 even numbers (2, 4, 6) out of 6 possible outcomes. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 = 0.25 or 25%.

Now, we need to find the difference between the two probabilities. The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 50% and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 25%. The difference is 50% - 25% = 25%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To find out how many apples Jenna picked, we need to determine half of the number of apples her mom picked. Since her mom picked 20 apples, we can calculate Jenna's share by dividing 20 by 2.

20 / 2 = 10

Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, and her mom picked 20, Jenna picked 10 apples. To find the total number of apples they both picked, we need to add Jenna's share to her mom's share.

20 (mom's apples) + 10 (Jenna's apples) = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of small rodents (rats and hamsters) and the total number of straw pieces distributed among them. 

Let's start by finding the total number of straw pieces distributed among the small rodents. We know that 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, and 20 pieces are distributed among the rabbits. So, the total number of straw pieces distributed among the small rodents and rabbits is 160 + 20 = 180.

Since the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, let's assume the number of rats in each cage is 'r'. The total number of rats is 3r. Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, so the total number of straw pieces distributed among the rats is 6 * 3r = 18r.

The hamsters are kept in 10 cages, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. So, the total number of straw pieces distributed among the hamsters is 5 * 10 = 50.

We know that the total number of straw pieces distributed among the small rodents and rabbits is 180. We also know that the total number of straw pieces distributed among the rats and hamsters is 18r + 50. Since the total number of straw pieces distributed among the small rodents is 160, we can set up the equation:

18r + 50 = 160

Subtracting 50 from both sides of the equation gives us:

18r = 110

Dividing both sides of the equation by 18 gives us:

r = 110 / 18
r = 6.11 (round down to the nearest whole number is not possible here as we are looking for the number of rats in each cage, so we will round to the nearest whole number that makes sense in the context of the problem)

However, since the number of rats in each cage must be a whole number, we need to re-evaluate the equation. We can try to find the factors of 110 that are divisible by 18. 

110 = 2 * 55
110 = 5 * 22
110 = 10 * 11
110 = 1 * 110

Among these factors, 110 is divisible by 10 and 11, but 10 is not a factor of 18. However, 11 is not a factor of 18. But 2 * 55 is not a factor of 18, 5 * 22 is not a factor of 18, and 1 * 110 is not a factor of 18.

"To calculate the total amount Mandy should pay, we need to calculate the interest for 3 months and add it to the initial amount.

The monthly interest rate is 2%, which as a decimal is 0.02. 

The interest for the first month is $100 * 0.02 = $2.
The interest for the second month is $102 * 0.02 = $2.04.
The interest for the third month is $104.04 * 0.02 = $2.0808.

The total interest is $2 + $2.04 + $2.0808 = $6.1208.

The total amount Mandy should pay is the initial amount plus the total interest: $100 + $6.1208 = $106.1208.

Rounding to two decimal places, the total amount Mandy should pay is $106.12.

The final answer is: $106.12"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total cost incurred by the trader, which includes the cost of buying the bags and the cost of transportation. 

Let's denote the number of bags as 'x'. The cost of buying 'x' bags at $20 per bag is 20x. The cost of transporting 'x' bags at $2 per bag is 2x. 

The total cost is the sum of these two costs: total_cost = 20x + 2x = 22x.

The trader sold the bags at $30 each, so the total revenue is 30x.

The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost: profit = total_revenue - total_cost = 30x - 22x = 8x.

We are given that the profit is $400, so we can set up the equation: 8x = 400.

To find the number of bags, we need to solve for x: x = 400 / 8 = 50.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how much each friend paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets, food, and rides, and then divide it by 3.

First, let's find the cost of the food. They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. Since they spent $20.25 on tickets, the cost of food is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.

The cost of the rides is 2 rides * $33 per ride = $66.

Now, let's add up the total cost: $20.25 (tickets) + $15.75 (food) + $66 (rides) = $102.

Since they agreed to split the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3: $102 / 3 = $34.

The final answer is: $34"
"To find the total number of peaches John collects, we need to calculate the total minutes he collects peaches and then multiply it by the number of peaches he collects per minute.

Since John collects peaches for 3 hours, we need to convert the hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Now, we know John collects 2 peaches per minute. To find the total number of peaches, we multiply the total minutes by the peaches collected per minute:

180 minutes * 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches

"To find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ducks needs per day, we first need to calculate the total pounds of insects they need per week. Since there are ten ducks and each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week, we multiply the number of ducks by the pounds of insects each duck needs per week.

10 ducks * 3.5 pounds/duck/week = 35 pounds/week

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of insects they need per day. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total pounds of insects they need per week by 7.

35 pounds/week / 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day

So, the flock of ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day to survive.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net change in the number of trees Tom has each year. 

Tom plants 10 trees a year and chops down 2 trees a year, so the net change is 10 - 2 = 8 trees per year.

Since Tom starts with 50 trees, we need to calculate the total number of trees after 10 years. 

In 10 years, the net change is 8 * 10 = 80 trees. So, the total number of trees after 10 years is 50 + 80 = 130 trees.

However, after 10 years, 30% of the trees die. To find the number of trees that die, we multiply 130 by 0.3: 130 * 0.3 = 39 trees.

Now, we subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees: 130 - 39 = 91 trees.

The final answer is: 91"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos on Sue's front yard.

On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. They painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back out on Sue's front yard. So, now there are 6 white flamingos and 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos.

On Sunday morning, the neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection. Now, there are 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos.

The total number of white flamingos remains the same, which is 6.

To find out how many more pink plastic flamingos were out than white plastic flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find out how much change Violetta will get, we need to first determine how many crayons she can buy with $20. Since one crayon costs $2, we can divide the total amount she has by the cost of one crayon.

$20 ÷ $2 = 10 crayons

Since Violetta needs 5 different colors, we can assume she will buy 2 crayons of each color (although the problem doesn't specify this, it's a reasonable assumption). 

The total number of crayons she will buy is 5 colors * 2 crayons per color = 10 crayons

Since she can buy 10 crayons with $20 and she will buy 10 crayons, she will spend the entire $20.

The change she will get is $0."
"To find the cost of a pen, we need to add the cost of a pencil and an eraser, since a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined. 

Cost of a pencil = $1.20
Cost of an eraser = $0.30
Cost of a pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser
Cost of a pen = $1.20 + $0.30
Cost of a pen = $1.50

Now, we need to find the cost of 8 pens. 

Cost of 8 pens = Cost of a pen * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $1.50 * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $12.00

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we first need to calculate the total pounds of carrots that will be used by the restaurants. 

Each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants. 

Total pounds of carrots used = Number of restaurants * Pounds per restaurant
Total pounds of carrots used = 40 * 2
Total pounds of carrots used = 80 pounds

Now, we subtract the total pounds of carrots used from the total pounds of carrots available to find out how many pounds will not be used.

Pounds of carrots not used = Total pounds of carrots - Total pounds of carrots used
Pounds of carrots not used = 200 - 80
Pounds of carrots not used = 120

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the number of children in Soda, we need to subtract the total number of men and women from the total population.

Total population = 23786
Number of men = 8417
Number of women = 9092

First, let's add the number of men and women:
8417 + 9092 = 17509

Now, subtract the sum from the total population to find the number of children:
23786 - 17509 = 6277

The number of children in Soda is 6277."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Initially, Elaine had 20 Pokémon cards.

In the first month, she collected three times the number of cards she initially had: 3 * 20 = 60 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month: 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months: (60 + 40) * 2 = 200 cards.

Now, let's add up the total number of cards Elaine has: 20 (initial cards) + 60 (first month) + 40 (second month) + 200 (third month) = 320 cards.

The final answer is: 320"
"Let's break down the information given. Mark edits 1000 sentences each week, and Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence. Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, he also edits 1000 sentences for Publisher B.

We know that Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays 2 * 5 cents = 10 cents per sentence.

Mark's total earnings from Publisher A are 1000 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 5000 cents.

Mark's total earnings from Publisher B are 1000 sentences * 10 cents/sentence = 10000 cents.

To find Mark's total weekly earnings, we add his earnings from both publishers: 5000 cents + 10000 cents = 15000 cents.

The final answer is: 15000"
"To find the total amount of water Baldur gets every day, we need to calculate the total number of pails he gets in a day and then multiply it by the amount of water in each pail.

Baldur gets 5 pails of water every morning and 6 pails of water every afternoon. So, the total number of pails he gets in a day is 5 + 6 = 11 pails.

Since each pail contains 5 liters of water, the total amount of water he gets every day is 11 pails * 5 liters/pail = 55 liters.

The final answer is: 55"
"To calculate John's total earnings for the year, we need to consider both the one-time monetary reward and the 5% raise in salary.

First, let's calculate the total amount John earns from his weekly salary for the year. Since he makes $2000 per week and works every week of the year (52 weeks), his total earnings from his salary would be:

2000 * 52 = 104,000

Now, let's calculate the 5% raise in salary. A 5% raise on $2000 would be:

2000 * 0.05 = 100

So, his new weekly salary would be:

2000 + 100 = 2100

Now, let's calculate his total earnings from his new salary for the year:

2100 * 52 = 109,200

Adding the one-time monetary reward of $5000 to his total earnings from his salary, we get:

109,200 + 5000 = 114,200

Therefore, John's total earnings for the year would be $114,200.

The final answer is: $114,200"
"To find the total number of barrels of wine produced per year, we need to calculate the total number of tons of grapes produced per year and then multiply it by the number of barrels of wine each ton can make.

First, let's find the total number of tons of grapes produced per year. Since each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year and there are 10 acres, we multiply 5 tons/acre by 10 acres:

5 tons/acre * 10 acres = 50 tons/year

Next, we know that each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine. To find the total number of barrels of wine produced per year, we multiply the total number of tons of grapes by the number of barrels each ton can make:

50 tons/year * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels/year

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the slices used for the sandwiches, omelets, and the macaroni and cheese dish separately and then add them together.

For the sandwiches, Carl ate 7 days' worth of sandwiches (since he ate one every day for a week) with 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. So, the total slices used for sandwiches = 7 * 2 = 14.

For the omelets, Carl ate 3 days' worth of omelets with one more slice per omelet than per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 3 slices per omelet. So, the total slices used for omelets = 3 * 3 = 9.

For the macaroni and cheese dish, Carl used 8 slices of cheese.

Now, let's add the slices used for sandwiches, omelets, and the macaroni and cheese dish together: 14 (sandwiches) + 9 (omelets) + 8 (macaroni and cheese) = 31.

The final answer is: 31"
"To find the total number of pens Janet has now, we need to calculate the number of pens she initially had and the number of pens she bought.

Janet initially had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, so the total number of pens she had initially is 22 + 10 = 32.

She bought 6 bags of blue pens, with 9 pens in each bag, so the total number of blue pens she bought is 6 * 9 = 54.

She also bought 2 bags of red pens, with 6 pens in each bag, so the total number of red pens she bought is 2 * 6 = 12.

Now, let's add the number of pens she bought to the number of pens she initially had: 32 (initial pens) + 54 (blue pens) + 12 (red pens) = 98.

However, we don't know how many green pens she bought, but we do know she bought 6 bags of blue pens and 2 bags of red pens. Since the question only asks for the total number of pens, we can ignore the color of the pens she bought and just add the total number of pens she bought to the number of pens she initially had.

The total number of pens Janet has now is 32 (initial pens) + 66 (total pens bought) = 98.

The final answer is: 98"
"To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we first need to find the total score she needs for the semester. Since there are six tests and she wants an average of 93, we multiply the desired average by the number of tests:

6 tests * 93 average = 558 total score

Since Brinley can remove the lowest score, we need to find the lowest of the five scores she already has. The scores are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. The lowest score is 71.

Now, we subtract the lowest score from the total score to find the total of the remaining four scores:

558 total score - 71 lowest score = 487 remaining total

We add the remaining four scores Brinley has to this total:

89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367

Now, we subtract this total from the remaining total to find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test:

487 remaining total - 367 total of known scores = 120 score needed

"To find the total number of kilometers Michael rode his bike, we need to calculate the total kilometers for the two different periods.

First, let's calculate the total kilometers for the first four weeks when he rode 25 kilometers each time, 5 times a week. 

Total kilometers in the first four weeks = 25 km * 5 times/week * 4 weeks = 25 * 5 * 4 = 500 km

Next, let's calculate the total kilometers for the next three weeks when he rode 60 kilometers each time, 2 times a week.

Total kilometers in the next three weeks = 60 km * 2 times/week * 3 weeks = 60 * 2 * 3 = 360 km

Now, we add the total kilometers from both periods to find the overall total.

Total kilometers = 500 km + 360 km = 860 km

"To find the total weight of the bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the weight of the chocolate bars. Since there are 25 chocolate bars and each weighs 40g, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
25 * 40g = 1000g

Next, let's find the weight of the candied apples. We know that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, so the weight of each candied apple is:
40g / 2 = 20g

Now, we can find the total weight of the candied apples:
80 * 20g = 1600g

Finally, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag of candy:
1000g + 1600g = 2600g

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since each plate costs $6000, half a dozen plates will cost 6 * $6000 = $36,000.

We are also given that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, the total cost of twenty dozen cups is $36,000 - $1200 = $34,800.

Since twenty dozen cups is equivalent to 240 cups, we can find the cost of each cup by dividing the total cost by the number of cups: $34,800 / 240 = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy and the total amount of money she has earned so far.

The total cost of the items is the cost of the jacket plus the cost of 2 pairs of shoes: 
$30 (jacket) + 2 * $20 (shoes) = $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved before she started babysitting. She earns $5 each time she babysits the neighbor's kids, so the total amount she has earned from babysitting is:
$5 * number of times she babysits.

Let's denote the number of times she babysits as 'x'. Then, the total amount she has earned from babysitting is $5x.

She also earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. Let's denote the number of times she mows the lawn as 'y'. Then, the total amount she has earned from mowing the lawn is $4y.

The total amount of money she has is the sum of the money she already had, the money she earned from babysitting, and the money she earned from mowing the lawn:
$10 (initial savings) + $5x (babysitting) + $4y (mowing the lawn).

Since she wants to buy the jacket and shoes, the total amount of money she has must be greater than or equal to the total cost of the items:
$10 + $5x + $4y ≥ $70.

We want to find the minimum number of times she must mow the lawn, so we want to find the smallest value of 'y' that satisfies the inequality. To do this, we can first subtract $10 from both sides of the inequality:
$5x + $4y ≥ $60.

Since we want to find the minimum value of 'y', we can try to find the smallest value of 'x' that satisfies the inequality. We know that $5x must be less than or equal to $60 - $4y, so we can write:
$5x ≤ $60 - $4y.

Now, we can try to find the smallest value of 'y' that satisfies the inequality. We can do this by trying different values of 'y' and finding the corresponding values of 'x'.

If y = 0, then $5x ≤ $60, which means x ≤ 12. However, this is not the smallest value of 'y' that satisfies the inequality.

If y = 1, then $5x ≤ $56, which means x ≤ 11.2. This is not an integer, so we cannot use this value of 'y'.

If y = 2, then $5x ≤ $52, which means x ≤ 10.4. This is not an integer, so we cannot use this value of 'y'.

If y = 3, then $5x ≤ $48, which means x ≤ 9.6. This is not an integer, so we cannot use this value of 'y'.

If y = 4, then $5x ≤ $44, which means x ≤ 8.8. This is not an integer, so we cannot use this value of 'y'.

If y = 5, then $5x ≤ $40, which means x ≤ 8. This is an integer, so we can use this value of 'y'.

If y = 5, then the total amount of money she has is:
$10 + $5x + $4y = $10 + $5(8) + $4(5) = $10 + $40 + $20 = $70.

This is equal to the total cost of the items, so she can afford the jacket and shoes if she mows the lawn 5 times.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"Let's denote the number of red chickens as R and the number of white chickens as W. We know that W = R + 2.

We also know that the total number of eggs collected is 42. Since red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and white chickens produce 5 eggs a day, we can set up the following equation:

3R + 5W = 42

Substituting W = R + 2 into the equation, we get:

3R + 5(R + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3R + 5R + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8R + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8R = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

R = 4

"To find the time Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park since he walks around the edge. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the dimensions of the park, l = 6 miles and w = 1.5 miles, we can substitute these values into the formula:

P = 2(6 + 1.5)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles/hour, we can find the time he spends walking by dividing the perimeter by his speed:

Time = Perimeter / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of customers Sloane counted on the first day. Let's denote the number of customers on the first day as x.

On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so the number of customers on the second day is x + 50.

The total number of customers by the third day was 500, which is the sum of the customers from the first two days and the customers on the third day. Since the number of customers on the third day is the same as the number on the second day (because the problem doesn't mention any change in the number of customers on the third day), we can write the equation:

x + (x + 50) + (x + 50) = 500

Combine like terms:

2x + 100 = 500

Subtract 100 from both sides:

2x = 400

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 200

So, Sloane counted 200 customers on the first day. 

Now, we need to find the number of customers she counted on the third day. Since the number of customers on the third day is the same as the number on the second day, we can use the expression x + 50:

x + 50 = 200 + 50
= 250

The final answer is: 250"
"Let's denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as 'x' gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the initial amount of water in the big pool is 2x gallons.

Since both pools leak at 4 gallons/minute, the rate of water loss for both pools is 8 gallons/minute. 

In 4 minutes, the total water lost from both pools is 8 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 32 gallons.

The big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as 'y'. Then, the current amount of water in the big pool is 4y.

We can set up the equation based on the initial and current water amounts in both pools:

Initial water in big pool - Initial water in small pool = Current water in big pool - Current water in small pool - Total water lost
2x - x = 4y - y - 32
x = 3y - 32

Since the initial amount of water in the big pool is twice as much as the small pool, we can also set up another equation:
2x = 4y - 32

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for x and y.

From the first equation, we can express x in terms of y:
x = 3y - 32

Substitute x in the second equation:
2(3y - 32) = 4y - 32
6y - 64 = 4y - 32
2y = 32
y = 16

Now that we have the value of y, we can find the initial amount of water in the small pool (x):
x = 3y - 32
x = 3(16) - 32
x = 48 - 32
x = 16

Since the small pool lost 4 minutes worth of water, the amount of water lost from the small pool is 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons.

The current amount of water in the small pool is the initial amount minus the water lost:
Current water in small pool = Initial water in small pool - Water lost
= 16 - 16
= 0

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Janeth will pay in 12 months and then subtract that from the initial amount borrowed plus the additional 10% interest.

First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth will pay in 12 months:

$165/month * 12 months = $1980

Now, let's calculate the total amount Janeth borrowed with the additional 10% interest:

$2000 + (10% of $2000) = $2000 + $200 = $2200

Now, let's subtract the total amount Janeth will pay from the total amount she borrowed with interest:

"To find the average age of the three in three years, we first need to find their current ages and then add 3 to each age. 

Given that Harriet is 21 years old, and she is half the age of Zack, we can find Zack's age by multiplying Harriet's age by 2. 

Zack's age = 2 * Harriet's age = 2 * 21 = 42

Since Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, we can find Adrian's age by multiplying Harriet's age by 3.

Adrian's age = 3 * Harriet's age = 3 * 21 = 63

Now, we have the current ages of the three: Harriet (21), Zack (42), and Adrian (63). To find their ages in three years, we add 3 to each age.

Harriet's age in 3 years = 21 + 3 = 24
Zack's age in 3 years = 42 + 3 = 45
Adrian's age in 3 years = 63 + 3 = 66

To find the average age, we add their ages and divide by 3.

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Yuri and Brianna. 

Naomi scored 68 points. 
Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. 
Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. 
Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. 
Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

The total points scored by the four students is 251. 
We know that Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna scored 68, 44, and 85 points respectively. 
So, the total points scored by them is 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points.

To find out how many points Jojo scored, we subtract the total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points scored by all four students. 
Jojo scored 251 - 197 = 54 points.

The total number of cards James has is 30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96 cards.

The probability of picking a water type card is the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards, which is 32/96.

To find the percentage, we multiply by 100: (32/96) * 100 = 33.333...

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type is 33."
"To find out how much Chad still owes, we need to calculate the total cost of his meal and then subtract the gift card amount.

The base burrito costs $6.50. 
He adds extra meat for $2.00, extra cheese for $1.00, avocado for $1.00, and 2 sauces for $0.25 each, which is 2 * $0.25 = $0.50. 
The total cost of the add-ons is $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $4.50.
The total cost of the meal before the upgrade is $6.50 + $4.50 = $11.00.
He upgrades his meal for an extra $3.00, so the new total is $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00.
He has a gift card for $5.00, so we subtract this from the total: $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the combined rate at which Kalinda and her mom can add pieces to the puzzle, and then divide the total number of pieces by this rate.

Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute. Her mom can add half as many pieces per minute, which is 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute.

The combined rate is 4 (Kalinda's rate) + 2 (her mom's rate) = 6 pieces per minute.

To find the time it will take to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces (360) by the combined rate (6 pieces per minute).

360 pieces / 6 pieces per minute = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in 1 hour, we can convert the time from minutes to hours by dividing by 60.

60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Therefore, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

The final answer is: 1"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, there were 120 baby watermelons.

After two months, 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest. To find 30% of 120, we multiply 120 by 0.3.

120 * 0.3 = 36

So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest after two months. This means 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons were not ready.

After two weeks, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest. To find 3/4 of 84, we multiply 84 by 3/4.

84 * (3/4) = 63

So, 63 watermelons were ready for harvest after two weeks. This means 84 - 63 = 21 watermelons were not ready.

The final answer is: 21"
"To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the total cost of the cars, the tax on the cars, and the registration fees.

The total cost of the cars is the price of one car multiplied by the number of cars: 12 * $20,000 = $240,000.

The tax on the cars is 10% of the total cost of the cars: 0.10 * $240,000 = $24,000.

The registration fees are $1000 per car, so for 12 cars, it's 12 * $1000 = $12,000.

Now, we add the total cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees to find the total cost: $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

The final answer is: $276,000"
"To find out how many shells Kylie collects on Tuesday, we first need to determine how many shells she collected on Monday. We know that Robert collected 20 shells on Monday, and Kylie collected 5 more than Robert. 

So, Kylie collected 20 + 5 = 25 shells on Monday.

On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. To find out how many shells she collected on Tuesday, we multiply the number of shells she collected on Monday by 2.

25 * 2 = 50

Kylie collects 50 shells on Tuesday."
"To find the total number of insects in the garden, we first need to determine the number of bugs. Since Dax found half as many bugs as ants, and there were 50 ants, we can calculate the number of bugs as follows:

Number of bugs = Number of ants / 2
Number of bugs = 50 / 2
Number of bugs = 25

Now, to find the total number of insects in the garden, we add the number of ants and bugs:

Total number of insects = Number of ants + Number of bugs
Total number of insects = 50 + 25
Total number of insects = 75

The final answer is: 75"
"To find the number of penguins left sunbathing, we need to determine how many penguins are not in the ocean or the cave. 

First, let's find out how many penguins jump in the ocean. One-third of 36 is 36 / 3 = 12 penguins. 

Next, let's find out how many penguins go inside the cave. Another one-third of 36 is 36 / 3 = 12 penguins.

Now, we need to find the total number of penguins that are either in the ocean or the cave. This is 12 (ocean) + 12 (cave) = 24 penguins.

To find the number of penguins left sunbathing, we subtract the number of penguins in the ocean and the cave from the total number of penguins. This is 36 (total) - 24 (ocean and cave) = 12 penguins.

The final answer is: 12"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many tomatoes Steve eats in a week and then divide that number by the number of tomatoes a vine can produce per week.

Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, he eats 6 * 7 = 42 tomatoes per week.

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats half as much as Steve, which is 42 / 2 = 21 tomatoes per week.

The total number of tomatoes they eat per week is 42 (Steve) + 21 (girlfriend) = 63 tomatoes per week.

Each vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week. To find out how many vines Steve needs, we divide the total number of tomatoes they eat per week by the number of tomatoes a vine can produce per week: 63 / 3 = 21 vines.

The final answer is: 21"
"To determine the number of pizzas John needs to order, we need to calculate the total number of slices required and then divide that by the number of slices per pizza.

First, let's find the total number of slices required. Since there are 20 friends and each friend needs 4 slices, the total number of slices required is:
20 friends * 4 slices per friend = 80 slices

Since pizzas are sold in 8 slices per pizza, we need to divide the total number of slices required by the number of slices per pizza:
80 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 10 pizzas

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas to ensure each of his 20 friends gets 4 slices.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Ram starts with 25 pens. He uses 5 pens to make 1 new pen, so he has 24 pens left. Then, he uses 5 of the remaining 24 pens to make 1 new pen, leaving him with 19 pens. He continues this process until he has used up all the pens.

To find the total number of pens he gets, we can use a geometric series formula. The number of pens he gets from each set of 5 pens is 1, 1, 1, and so on. The number of sets of 5 pens is 25/5 = 5. 

The total number of pens he gets is the sum of the geometric series: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.

However, this is not the total number of pens he gets. He also gets the original 25 pens. So, the total number of pens he gets is 5 (from the series) + 25 (original pens) = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the final amount of money Johnny had after a year, we need to follow the steps of the problem.

1. Johnny started with an allowance of $20 and added an extra $10 to it. So, the initial amount of money he had is $20 + $10 = $30.

2. He then invested this sum of money, which tripled in a year. This means the amount of money he had after a year is 3 times the initial amount. 

3. To find the final amount, we multiply the initial amount by 3: $30 * 3 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the sum of the ages of the three girls, we need to determine the ages of Mary and Joan first.

Since Jessa is 20 years old, and Joan is five years older than Jessa, we can calculate Joan's age by adding 5 to Jessa's age: 20 + 5 = 25.

Now, we know that Mary is two years younger than Joan, so we can calculate Mary's age by subtracting 2 from Joan's age: 25 - 2 = 23.

Now that we have the ages of all three girls, we can find the sum of their ages by adding their individual ages together: 20 (Jessa) + 23 (Mary) + 25 (Joan) = 68.

The final answer is: 68"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of students who went out through exit A, then the number of students remaining, and finally, the number of students who went out through exit C.

First, let's find the number of students who went out through exit A. 30% of 1000 students went out through exit A. 

30% of 1000 = 0.3 * 1000 = 300 students.

Now, let's find the number of students remaining after 300 students went out through exit A. 

Remaining students = Total students - Students who went out through exit A
= 1000 - 300
= 700 students.

Next, 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B. 

3/5 of 700 = (3/5) * 700 = 420 students.

Now, let's find the number of students who went out through exit C. 

Students who went out through exit C = Remaining students - Students who went out through exit B
= 700 - 420
= 280 students.

The final answer is: 280"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. We know that John has 54 candies and that he has twice as many candies as Robert. 

To find out how many candies Robert has, we can divide the number of candies John has by 2. 

Robert's candies = John's candies / 2
Robert's candies = 54 / 2
Robert's candies = 27

We also know that James has 6 more candies than Robert. 

James' candies = Robert's candies + 6
James' candies = 27 + 6
James' candies = 33

Now, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James. 

Difference = John's candies - James' candies
Difference = 54 - 33
Difference = 21

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Dolly has 2 books and Pandora has 1 book. 

Dolly will read her own 2 books and Pandora's 1 book, so Dolly will read a total of 3 books.

Pandora will read her own 1 book and Dolly's 2 books, so Pandora will read a total of 3 books.

In total, they will read 3 (Dolly's total) + 3 (Pandora's total) = 6 books.

However, we need to consider that they also read each other's books. So, Dolly will read Pandora's book and Pandora will read Dolly's book. This means they will read 2 more books.

Therefore, the total number of books they will read is 6 (initial books) + 2 (additional books) = 8.

"To find out how many hours Mike spends writing a week, we need to calculate the total number of letters he writes and then multiply it by the time it takes him to write one page.

First, let's find out how many letters Mike writes in a week. He has 3 pen pals left, and each of them sends 2 letters a week. So, the total number of letters he receives is 3 * 2 = 6 letters.

Since he responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters a week. 

Now, let's calculate the total number of pages he writes in a week. Each letter is 5 pages long, so the total number of pages is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

Since Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time he spends writing a week is 30 pages * 6 minutes/page = 180 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60. So, 180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many minutes Jason has left, we need to calculate the total minutes used and subtract that from his total plan minutes.

First, let's calculate the total minutes used for the daily calls with his boss. Since Jason has a 15-minute call with his boss every day and there are 30 days in the month, the total minutes used for these calls is:

15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes

Next, we add the extra 300 minutes used for calls with other people:

450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from Jason's total plan minutes:

1000 minutes - 750 minutes = 250 minutes

So, Jason has 250 minutes left.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Griffin had 24 french fries.

Kyle took 5 fries from Griffin. So, Griffin was left with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.

Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, which means Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Now, Griffin has 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

Ginger gave Griffin a certain number of fries, let's call it 'x'. After this, Griffin had 9 + x fries.

Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. So, after Colby took 2 fries, Griffin had 9 + x - 2 = 7 + x fries.

We are given that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. Therefore, we can set up the equation 7 + x = 27.

To find the value of 'x', we subtract 7 from both sides of the equation: x = 27 - 7.

x = 20

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries. 

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28.

According to the problem, this difference is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums, so we can set up the equation:

28 = 2(2x)

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 2:

14 = 2x

Now, divide both sides by 2 again:

7 = x

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the total hours worked. The makeup artist works 6 hours a day, 4 times a week, for 5 weeks. 

Total hours worked per week = 6 hours/day * 4 days/week = 24 hours/week
Total hours worked in 5 weeks = 24 hours/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours

The makeup artist charges $250 per hour. 

Total cost before discount = 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000

After the movie is done, the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount. 

Discount amount = 10% of $30,000 = 0.1 * $30,000 = $3,000

Total amount Jean paid = Total cost before discount - Discount amount
= $30,000 - $3,000
= $27,000

"To find out how much each person paid, we need to first calculate the total cost of the party supplies. 

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the cake, presents, decorations, invitations, and goodie bags. 

Total cost = $12 (cake) + $43 (presents) + $15 (decorations) + $4 (invitations) + $22 (goodie bags)
Total cost = $96

Since Isabelle split the cost evenly with her two parents, there are a total of 3 people sharing the cost. 

To find out how much each person paid, we need to divide the total cost by 3.

Each person's share = Total cost / 3
Each person's share = $96 / 3
Each person's share = $32

200 pounds * $1.50/pound = $300

The chef spent $300."
"To find out how many calories Sue consumed, we first need to determine how many cookies she ate. 

On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 5 cookies, so Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday.

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 13 cookies, so Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.

In total, Sue ate 20 + 26 = 46 cookies. 

Her sister ate 5 + 13 = 18 cookies.

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, Sue consumed 46 * 200 = 9200 calories, and her sister consumed 18 * 200 = 3600 calories.

The difference in calories consumed is 9200 - 3600 = 5600."
"To find the number of boys in the third class, we first need to determine the total number of girls in the school. Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, and there are 3 classes with 20 students each, the total number of students in the school is 3 * 20 = 60.

Given that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls, the total number of girls in the school is 15 + 12 = 27. 

Since the school is 50% girls, the total number of boys in the school is also 60 - 27 = 33.

Now, we need to find the number of girls in the third class. Since the school is 50% girls, the third class should also have 50% girls. The total number of students in the third class is 20, so the number of girls in the third class is 20 * 0.5 = 10.

To find the number of boys in the third class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in the third class: 20 - 10 = 10.

First, let's find out how many cougars Rick killed today. We know he killed 15 cougars last night and three fewer cougars today. So, the number of cougars he killed today is 15 - 3 = 12.

Now, we know that Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars today. Since he killed 12 cougars today, he killed 3 * 12 = 36 wolves today.

We already know that Rick killed 10 wolves last night. So, the total number of wolves he killed is 10 + 36 = 46.

We also know that Rick killed 15 cougars last night and 12 cougars today. So, the total number of cougars he killed is 15 + 12 = 27.

To find out how many cows he added to each stall, we divide the total number of new cows (40) by the number of stalls (10). 

40 / 10 = 4

So, Mr. Sylas added 4 cows to each stall. 

Now, we need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. We know that each stall has 20 original cows and 4 new cows. 

20 (original cows) + 4 (new cows) = 24 cows per stall

"To determine the total amount of flour needed, we need to calculate the amount of flour required for each day and then add them together.

For today, Carla is making 36 cookies. Since two cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many cups are needed for 36 cookies. 

First, let's find out how many dozens are in 36 cookies: 36 / 12 = 3. This means Carla needs 3 dozen cookies' worth of flour for today. Since 2 cups are needed for a dozen, Carla will need 3 * 2 = 6 cups of flour for today.

For tomorrow, Carla is making 30 cookies. Again, we need to find out how many dozens are in 30 cookies: 30 / 12 = 2.5. Since 2 cups are needed for a dozen, Carla will need 2.5 * 2 = 5 cups of flour for tomorrow.

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price, which is 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000.

The total price of the house is the sum of the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee: $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

To find out how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we subtract her budget from the total price: $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500.

The final answer is: $9,500"
"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to calculate the total amount he paid in fees and subtract that from the selling price, then subtract the remaining loan amount.

First, let's calculate the transfer fees: 3% of $400,000 is 0.03 x $400,000 = $12,000.

Next, let's calculate the brokerage fee: 5% of $400,000 is 0.05 x $400,000 = $20,000.

The total amount paid in fees is $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000.

Now, let's subtract the total fees from the selling price: $400,000 - $32,000 = $368,000.

Finally, let's subtract the remaining loan amount: $368,000 - $250,000 = $118,000.

The final answer is: $118,000"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know it takes 20 minutes for the oil to heat up to 300 degrees. Then, it takes 40% longer to heat up to 400 degrees. 

40% of 20 minutes is 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes. So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat up to 400 degrees.

After warming the oil, it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil. It took 28 minutes to warm up the oil, so it takes 28 - 5 = 23 minutes to cook.

The total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is the sum of the time it took to warm up the oil and the time it took to cook. So, the total time is 28 + 23 = 51 minutes.

The final numerical answer is: 51"
"To find the total amount spent on newspaper ads, we multiply the cost per ad by the number of ads: $5 * 50 = $250.

To find the total amount spent on television ads, we multiply the cost per ad by the number of ads: $75 * 15 = $1125.

Now, we add the total amount spent on newspaper ads and television ads to find the overall amount spent: $250 + $1125 = $1375.

The final answer is: $1375"
"To find the number of blue golf balls, we first need to determine the total number of golf balls. Since half of the balls are golf balls, and the juggler can juggle 16 balls, the number of golf balls is 16 / 2 = 8.

"To find the total number of M&Ms Mary got, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and then add them together.

The first bag has 300 M&Ms.

The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.

The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, let's add the number of M&Ms in each bag together: 300 + 312 + 150 = 762.

The final answer is: 762"
"To find the total number of windows, we need to calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows in each house.

Each house has 3 bedrooms, and each bedroom has 2 windows. So, the total number of windows in the bedrooms of one house is 3 * 2 = 6.

There are 4 additional windows in each house not connected to bedrooms.

So, the total number of windows in one house is 6 (from bedrooms) + 4 (additional) = 10.

Since John has 2 houses, the total number of windows is 10 * 2 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost of the items, we need to add the cost of the cocoa, laundry, and pasta. 

Total cost = $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35
Total cost = $14.00

Change = Amount paid - Total cost
Change = $20 - $14.00
Change = $6.00

The final answer is: $6.00"
"To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we first need to determine the total number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette. 

The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches, which is 900 * 0.1 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so it takes 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

The total number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette is 90 + 180 = 270 stitches.

Since the whole sweater is a 1800-stitch project, the total number of stitches used for the body and the sleeves is 1800 - 270 = 1530 stitches.

The body takes 900 stitches, so the number of stitches used for the sleeves is 1530 - 900 = 630 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the total number of stitches for the sleeves by 2 to find the number of stitches for each sleeve: 630 / 2 = 315 stitches.

The final answer is: 315"
"To find the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan spent on seeds, we need to calculate the cost of the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately and then add them together.

"To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the lines for each scene and the song, and then add them together.

The solo song has 54 lines.

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. However, only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has (4/5) * 60 = 48 lines from the second scene.

To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

The final answer is: 138"
"To find the number of cards with the letter D, we need to calculate the number of cards that had the letters A, B, and C, and then subtract that from the total number of cards.

First, we find the number of cards with the letter A: 2/5 of 80 is (2/5) * 80 = 32 cards.

Next, we find the number of cards with the letter B. The remaining cards after A are 80 - 32 = 48. 1/2 of 48 is (1/2) * 48 = 24 cards.

Now, we find the number of cards with the letter C. The remaining cards after B are 48 - 24 = 24. 5/8 of 24 is (5/8) * 24 = 15 cards.

The total number of cards with the letters A, B, and C is 32 + 24 + 15 = 71.

To find the number of cards with the letter D, we subtract the total number of cards with A, B, and C from the total number of cards: 80 - 71 = 9.

"To find the total time it takes Matthew to dig the holes, we need to calculate the time for small holes and large holes separately and then add them together.

Time for small holes: 3 minutes per hole * 30 holes = 90 minutes
Time for large holes: 10 minutes per hole * 15 holes = 150 minutes

Total time in minutes: 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 
240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours

"To find the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we first need to determine their current ages. Since the sum of their ages is 20, we can represent their ages as x and 20 - x.

In 10 years, Mico's age will be x + 10 and Marco's age will be (20 - x) + 10, which simplifies to 30 - x.

The sum of their ages in 10 years will be (x + 10) + (30 - x), which simplifies to 40.

"Let's denote Ruby's current age as R and Sam's current age as S. We are given two pieces of information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam: R = 6S
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam: (R + 9) = 3(S + 9)

We can substitute the first equation into the second one to solve for S:

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the equation:

6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtract 3S from both sides:

3S + 9 = 27

Subtract 9 from both sides:

3S = 18

Divide both sides by 3:

S = 6

So, Sam is 6 years old now.

"To find the total number of spots on the cobras, we need to multiply the number of cobras by the number of spots each cobra has. 

Number of cobras: 40
Number of spots per cobra: 70
Total spots on cobras: 40 * 70 = 2800

Since the mambas have half the number of spots as the cobras, we can find the number of spots per mamba by dividing the number of spots per cobra by 2.

Number of spots per mamba: 70 / 2 = 35

Now, we can find the total number of spots on the mambas by multiplying the number of mambas by the number of spots per mamba.

Number of mambas: 60
Number of spots per mamba: 35
Total spots on mambas: 60 * 35 = 2100

To find the total number of spots on all the snakes, we add the total spots on the cobras and the mambas.

Total spots on all snakes: 2800 + 2100 = 4900

Finally, to find half the number of spots they all have combined, we divide the total number of spots by 2.

Half the total spots: 4900 / 2 = 2450"
"To find the total number of people Maddy needs to buy pizza for, we need to calculate the total number of team members, coaches, and their guests. 

There are 12 team members, and each brings 2 guests, so the total number of guests is 12 * 2 = 24. Adding the 12 team members and 3 coaches, we get a total of 12 + 24 + 3 = 39 people.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, we need to divide the total number of people by 3 to find the number of pizzas needed. 39 / 3 = 13 pizzas.

Each pizza costs $15, so the total cost will be the number of pizzas multiplied by the cost per pizza. 13 * 15 = 195.

The final answer is: $195"
"To find the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace, we first need to calculate the total space occupied by the topaz gemstones and then subtract that from the total length of the necklace. 

Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and there are 8 of them, so the total space occupied by the gemstones is 8 inches. 

The remaining space for the sterling silver beads is 25 inches (total length of the necklace) - 8 inches (space occupied by gemstones) = 17 inches.

Each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long, so the number of beads that can fit in 17 inches is 17 / 0.25 = 68.

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

The final answer is: 68"

"To find the number of rows of 5-star stars, we first need to determine the total number of stars in the flag. We know that there are three rows of 8 stars and two rows of 6 stars. 

The total number of stars in the 8-star rows is 3 * 8 = 24 stars.
The total number of stars in the 6-star rows is 2 * 6 = 12 stars.

Now, we can find the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows: 24 + 12 = 36 stars.

Since the flag has 76 stars in total, the number of stars in the 5-star rows is 76 - 36 = 40 stars.

Since each row has 5 stars, we can find the number of rows of 5-star stars by dividing the total number of 5-star stars by 5: 40 / 5 = 8.

"To determine the number of trucks needed, we need to calculate the total weight of the flagstones and divide it by the weight capacity of each truck.

First, let's find the total weight of the flagstones: 
80 flagstones * 75 pounds per flagstone = 6000 pounds

Now, let's divide the total weight by the weight capacity of each truck:
6000 pounds / 2000 pounds per truck = 3

So, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

The final answer is: 3"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the speed of the car in the slow lane. Since it's traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, we can calculate it as follows:

Speed of the car in the fast lane = 60 miles/hour
Speed of the car in the slow lane = 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour

Now, we know the distance covered by both cars is the same, which is 480 miles. We can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

For the car in the fast lane:
Time = 480 miles / 60 miles/hour = 8 hours

Since the car in the slow lane travels at half the speed, it will take twice the time to cover the same distance. Therefore, the time taken by the car in the slow lane is:

Time = 2 * 8 hours = 16 hours

The final answer is: 16"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem.

Ali has 22 medals. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.

Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

It's given that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have. Let's represent the total number of medals given out as 'x'. Then, we can write the equation:

39 = x / 10

To solve for 'x', we multiply both sides by 10:

x = 39 * 10
x = 390

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is 390.

The final answer is: 390"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of chocolate bars available. Since each packet contains 5 chocolate bars and there are 8 packets, the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

We know that each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, and there are 4 adults. So, the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 * 6 = 24.

Now, we need to find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children. This can be calculated by subtracting the number of chocolate bars given to adults from the total number of chocolate bars: 40 - 24 = 16.

Since there are 8 children, and the remaining chocolate bars are to be shared equally among them, we divide the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children: 16 / 8 = 2.

Therefore, each child will get 2 chocolate bars.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much Susan earns, we need to calculate the total time she works and then multiply it by her hourly wage.

First, let's find the total time she works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total time.

3 hours (working time) - 0.5 hours (pause time) = 2.5 hours

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to convert the total working time to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Now, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes:

150 minutes / 10 minutes/interval = 15 intervals

Since she earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by her earnings per interval:

15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

So, Susan earns $75 for the online task.

The final answer is: $75"
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the points each player has after the third round and then add the extra points they receive in the fourth round.

After the third round, Mike has 21 points. 
Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

Now, let's calculate the extra points each player receives in the fourth round. 
Mike has 21 points, which is less than 20, so he doesn't receive any extra points.
Jim has 18 points, which is less than 20, so he doesn't receive any extra points.
Tony has 42 points, which is more than 20, so he receives 1 extra point.

Now, let's add the extra points to each player's score:
Mike: 21 + 0 = 21
Jim: 18 + 0 = 18
Tony: 42 + 1 = 43

Now, let's add up the total points of all three players:
21 + 18 + 43 = 82

Total exercises on the first day = 100 + 50 + 20 = 170

On the second day, Darren does:
- 20 more pushups than the first day, so 100 + 20 = 120 pushups
- 10 fewer squats than the first day, so 50 - 10 = 40 squats
- Doubles the number of dumbbell presses, so 20 * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses

Total exercises on the second day = 120 + 40 + 40 = 200

Total exercises in two days = 170 + 200 = 370

The final answer is: 370"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day and then divide the total amount of rice available by this daily consumption.

First, let's calculate the daily consumption of rice. Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day (lunch and dinner). So, the daily consumption per person is 0.2 kg/meal * 2 meals = 0.4 kg/day.

Since there are 5 members in the household who eat rice every lunch and dinner, the total daily consumption is 0.4 kg/day * 5 people = 2 kg/day.

Now, let's calculate how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last. We can do this by dividing the total amount of rice available (42 kg) by the daily consumption (2 kg/day).

42 kg / 2 kg/day = 21 days

Since we want to know how many weeks the rice will last, we need to convert the number of days to weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so we can divide the number of days by 7.

21 days / 7 days/week = 3 weeks

Therefore, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks.

"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we first need to calculate the total number of crates he sold in the week. 

Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he sold bread for 5 days. 

He sold 20 crates over the weekend, which is 2 days. 
He sold 15 crates on Tuesday, 12 crates on Wednesday, and 18 crates on Thursday.

Total crates sold = 20 (weekend) + 15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday) = 65 crates

Since he was closed on Monday and Friday, he had 5 working days. His target for the week is 120 crates. 

To find the target for 5 working days, we need to calculate the daily target: 
Daily target = 120 / 7 = 17.14 (approximately)

Since we can't sell a fraction of a crate, we'll consider the daily target as 17 crates per day for 5 working days. 

Total target for 5 working days = 17 * 5 = 85 crates

Now, let's find the difference between the total target and the total crates sold:
Difference = Total target - Total crates sold = 85 - 65 = 20 crates

Sam was 20 crates off from his target for the week.

"To find the total cost of the desk, we need to determine the last bid made by Carmen. 

Since there are 3 other people who bid once, and Carmen bids after each of them, there are a total of 4 people who bid once. The bids rise by $50 each time, so we need to find the total number of bids made.

Let's denote the number of bids as 'n'. The total number of people who bid is 4, and each person bids once, so n = 4.

The first bid is $200, and each subsequent bid is $50 more than the previous one. We can represent the last bid as 200 + 50(n-1), since there are n-1 bids after the first one.

Now, we can substitute n = 4 into the equation to find the last bid:
Last bid = 200 + 50(4-1)
Last bid = 200 + 50(3)
Last bid = 200 + 150
Last bid = 350

Since Carmen wins the desk with the last bid, the total cost of the desk is $350.

The final answer is: $350"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to find the total miles driven per year, the total cost per year for the miles driven, and the total bonus per year.

First, let's find the total miles driven per year. Since John goes to work 30 miles away and back each day, the total miles driven per day is 30 * 2 = 60 miles. He goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year, so the total miles driven per year is 60 * 5 * 50 = 15,000 miles.

The cost per mile is $2, so the total cost per year for the miles driven is 15,000 * $2 = $30,000.

John also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus per year is $150 * 12 = $1,800.

The total cost per year for driving is the sum of the total cost for the miles driven and the total bonus, which is $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

The final numerical answer is: $31,800"
"To find out how many minutes Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to add the minutes he exercised on both days. 

Monday: 16 minutes
Sunday: 23 minutes
Combined: 16 + 23 = 39 minutes

Since Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to multiply the combined minutes by 2.

Combined minutes: 39
Twice the combined minutes: 39 * 2 = 78 minutes

Therefore, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal.

"To determine the number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider the folding process. 

When a piece of paper is folded vertically, it creates two layers: the front and the back. 

In a standard tabloid, the pages are arranged in a way that the first page is on the left back, the second page is on the left front, the 32nd page is on the right back, and the 31st page is on the right front. 

This means that we need two pieces of paper to create the left and right sides of the tabloid. 

Since we have 32 pages, and each side of the tabloid requires two pieces of paper (one for the back and one for the front), we need a total of 2 sides * 2 pieces of paper per side = 4 pieces of paper for the left and right sides.

However, we also need to consider the middle pages, which are pages 3 to 31. These pages will be printed on the inside of the left and right sides. Since there are 29 middle pages, we need 29 pieces of paper for these pages.

In addition to the middle pages, we also need to consider the first and last pages, which are pages 1 and 32. These pages will be printed on the outside of the left and right sides. We already counted the pieces of paper for these pages when we calculated the left and right sides.

Therefore, the total number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid is 4 (for the left and right sides) + 29 (for the middle pages) = 33.

"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we first need to determine how many books she sold in the first year. 

Let's denote the number of books sold in the current year as 'x'. Since she sold twice as many books in the first year, the number of books sold in the first year is 2x.

We know that the total number of books sold in the first two years is the sum of the books sold in the first year and the current year, which is 2x + x = 3x. 

We also know that there are 50 unsold books, and the total number of books is 250. So, the total number of books sold is 250 - 50 = 200.

Since the total number of books sold is 3x, we can set up the equation 3x = 200. Solving for x, we get x = 200 / 3 = 66.67. However, since the number of books cannot be a fraction, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 66.67 ≈ 67 (rounding up to 66 would make the number of unsold books less than 50).

Now that we know the number of books sold in the current year is 67, we can find the number of books sold in the first year, which is 2x = 2 * 67 = 134.

The total amount of money earned in the first year is 134 * 20 = 2680.

The total amount of money earned in the second year is 45 * 20 = 900.

The final answer is: $900"
"To find out how much Watson made in April, we need to calculate his total earnings from his hourly wage and the weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate his total hours worked in a week: 
10 hours/day * 5 days/week = 50 hours/week

Since Watson earns $10 per hour, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:
50 hours/week * $10/hour = $500/week

Since the company performed well for the whole month, Watson received a $300 bonus each week. 
So, his total weekly earnings are:
$500/week (hourly wage) + $300/week (bonus) = $800/week

Now, let's calculate his total earnings for the month of April, which has 4 weeks:
$800/week * 4 weeks = $3200

Therefore, Watson made $3200 in April. 

The final answer is: $3200"
"To find out how many people John lost to, we need to calculate 20% of 20, since he beat 80% of the people he arm wrestled.

20% of 20 is calculated as 0.20 * 20 = 4.

So, John lost to 4 people. 

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many loaves are sold in the afternoon, we first need to determine how many loaves are left after the morning sales. 

The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. 

Two-thirds of 60 is calculated as (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves. 

So, 40 loaves are sold in the morning. 

Now, we need to find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales. 

The total number of loaves produced is 60, and 40 are sold in the morning. 

60 - 40 = 20 loaves are left after the morning sales.

Half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening. 

Half of 20 is calculated as (1/2) * 20 = 10 loaves.

Since the remaining loaves are divided equally between the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much weight Joey loses per week and then multiply that by the number of weeks it takes Sandy to lose the same amount of weight.

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. To find out how much weight Joey loses per week, we divide the total weight lost by the number of weeks:

Weight lost per week = Total weight lost / Number of weeks
Weight lost per week = 8 pounds / 4 weeks
Weight lost per week = 2 pounds per week

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, we multiply the weight lost per week by the number of weeks it takes Sandy:

Total weight lost = Weight lost per week * Number of weeks
Total weight lost = 2 pounds/week * 4 weeks
Total weight lost = 8 pounds

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose 8 pounds.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total savings, we need to calculate the savings on the tubs of ice cream and the packets of milk separately and then add them together.

The original price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 * $13 = $26. The discounted price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 * $11 = $22. The savings on 2 tubs of ice cream is $26 - $22 = $4.

The original price of 4 packets of milk is 4 * $1 = $4. The discounted price of 4 packets of milk is 4 * ($1 - $0.5) = 4 * $0.5 = $2. The savings on 4 packets of milk is $4 - $2 = $2.

The total savings is $4 + $2 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of new arms and legs grown by the person after 15 days.

The person grows an extra arm every 3 days. To find out how many arms they will grow in 15 days, we divide 15 by 3. 

15 / 3 = 5

So, the person will grow 5 extra arms.

The person grows an extra leg every 5 days. To find out how many legs they will grow in 15 days, we divide 15 by 5.

15 / 5 = 3

So, the person will grow 3 extra legs.

To find the total number of new limbs, we add the number of new arms and legs.

5 (new arms) + 3 (new legs) = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount spent by Theo on the business suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket, and then subtract this amount from the total amount he has, $6000. We also need to subtract the amount he wishes to save, $2000.

First, let's calculate the cost of the business suits:
6 suits * $100 each = $600

Next, let's calculate the cost of the suitcases:
3 suitcases * $50 each = $150

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket. The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. The cost of a business suit is $100, so 5 times this amount is:
5 * $100 = $500
$700 more than this is:
$500 + $700 = $1200

Now, let's add up the total amount spent by Theo on the business suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket:
$600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950

Now, let's subtract the total amount spent and the amount he wishes to save from the total amount he has:
$6000 - $1950 - $2000 = $2050

So, Theo has $2050 to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa.

The final answer is: $2050"
"To find the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we first need to determine how many eggs each group of people eats in a day and then multiply it by 7.

Three people eat 3 eggs each day, so they consume 3 * 3 = 9 eggs per day. 

The rest of the family members are 5 - 3 = 2. They eat 2 eggs each day, so they consume 2 * 2 = 4 eggs per day.

The total number of eggs consumed by the family in a day is 9 + 4 = 13 eggs.

To find the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7: 13 * 7 = 91 eggs.

The final answer is: 91"
"To find Trent's age, we need to first determine Jane's age, and then add 5 to it. 

Since Quinn is 30, and Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, we can calculate Jane's age by subtracting 3 from Quinn's age: 30 - 3 = 27.

Now that we know Jane's age, we can find Trent's age by adding 5 to Jane's age: 27 + 5 = 32.

The final answer is: 32"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find Noah's current age. Since Cera is 46 years old now, six years ago, Cera was 40 years old. We are given that six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. So, Noah's age six years ago was 40 / 2 = 20 years.

Now, we know that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, the population of Chile six years ago was 20 * 3000 = 60,000.

We are also given that the population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now. So, the current population of Chile is 60,000 * 2 = 120,000.

The final answer is: 120,000"
"Let's break down the information given. 

Let's denote the number of players on the defense as D. 

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2D.

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is D/2.

We know that the total number of players on the team is 105. The sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams is equal to 105. 

So, we can write the equation: 2D + D + D/2 = 105.

To solve for D, we need to get rid of the fraction. Multiplying the entire equation by 2 will eliminate the fraction: 4D + 2D + D = 210.

Combining like terms, we get 7D = 210.

Dividing both sides by 7, we get D = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total number of people invited, we first need to calculate the number of people from the 2 families with 6 people and the 3 families with 4 people.

For the 2 families with 6 people, the total number of people is 2 * 6 = 12.
For the 3 families with 4 people, the total number of people is 3 * 4 = 12.
The total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.

However, 8 people couldn't come due to illness. So, we subtract 8 from the total number of people invited: 24 - 8 = 16.

Then, 1/4 of the people who couldn't come due to illness had previous commitments. 1/4 of 8 is 2. So, we subtract 2 from the number of people who couldn't come due to illness: 8 - 2 = 6.

Now, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come due to illness and previous commitments from the total number of people invited: 16 - 6 = 10.

"To find the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store, we need to calculate the total number of marbles first.

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and added them to a store that had 50. So, the total number of marbles in the store after buying from Johanna is 20 + 50 = 70.

His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna, his father gave him 2/5 * 20 = 8 marbles.

Now, the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store is 70 (initial marbles) + 20 (bought from Johanna) + 8 (given by his father) = 98 marbles.

Each marble weighs 2kgs, so the total weight of marbles is 98 * 2 = 196 kgs.

The final answer is: 196"
"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (such as a pool) is length x width x height.

Given dimensions: 
- Length (L) = 6 feet
- Width (W) = 4 feet
- Height (H) = 5 feet

Volume = L x W x H = 6 x 4 x 5 = 120 cubic feet

Now, we need to find the cost to fill the pool. The cost is given as $0.1 per cubic foot. 

Cost = Volume x Cost per cubic foot = 120 x 0.1 = $12

"To find the total number of children in the classroom, we first need to determine the number of girls and nongendered children.

Given that there are 30 boys, and the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, we can calculate the number of girls by multiplying the number of boys by 3.

Number of girls = 3 * 30 = 90

Next, we are told that the classroom has 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys. To find the number of nongendered children, we can multiply the number of boys by 1/10.

Number of nongendered children = 30 * (1/10) = 3

Now, we can find the total number of children by adding the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children.

Total number of children = 30 (boys) + 90 (girls) + 3 (nongendered children) = 123

The final answer is: 123"
"To solve this problem, we need to use the given ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This means that for every 1 electric pole, 3 electric wires are needed.

Let's denote the number of electric poles as 'x'. According to the given ratio, the number of electric wires will be 3x.

We are given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45. So, we can set up the equation:

3x = 45

To find the value of x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 45 / 3
x = 15

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required by the electric company to supply the electricity in the neighborhood is 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of people who left the party. We know that 1/4 of the total number of people left, and 22 men stayed. 

Let's denote the total number of people as 'x'. Since 1/4 of the people left, 3/4 of the people stayed. We can set up the equation:

3/4 * x = 22 + (number of women who stayed)

We know that the total number of people at the beginning was 25 men + 15 women = 40 people. So, x = 40.

Now, we can substitute x = 40 into the equation:

3/4 * 40 = 22 + (number of women who stayed)
30 = 22 + (number of women who stayed)
8 = (number of women who stayed)

Since there were 15 women at the beginning, the number of women who left is 15 - 8 = 7.

The total number of women who left is 7, so the number of women who stayed is 15 - 7 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the cost of the pen, we first need to determine the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book, and the book costs $4, the magazine costs $4 / 2 = $2.

The final numerical answer is: $1"
"To find the total number of pencils Jam has, we know she has 3 boxes and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils. Since we know the number of loose pencils, we can find the number of pencils in the boxes by subtracting the loose pencils from the total: 26 - 2 = 24 pencils in the boxes.

Since each box contains an equal number of pencils, we can divide the total number of pencils in the boxes by the number of boxes to find the number of pencils per box: 24 / 3 = 8 pencils per box.

Now, we know Jam has 24 pencils in the boxes and Meg has 46 pencils. To find the total number of pencils, we add the number of pencils Jam has to the number of pencils Meg has: 24 + 46 = 70 pencils.

To find the number of boxes needed to store all the pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils per box: 70 / 8 = 8.75. Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we round up to the nearest whole number to ensure all pencils fit in the boxes. Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

The final answer is: 9"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total weakening effect of the ice cubes and the added cream.

First, let's calculate the number of ice cubes needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, so the number of ice cubes needed is:

65 / 13 = 5

Since each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, 5 ice cubes will make it 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters weaker.

Next, we need to consider the effect of adding 15 milliliters of cream. Since any added liquid weakens the coffee, the total weakening effect of the cream is 15 milliliters.

Now, we add the weakening effects of the ice cubes and the cream to get the total weakening effect:

60 milliliters (from ice cubes) + 15 milliliters (from cream) = 75 milliliters

The final answer is: 75"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the trade ratio. For every 2 old records, 1 new record is given. Since 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of new records as 7. 

Now, we need to find out how many old records were traded for these 7 new records. Since the trade ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record, we can multiply the number of new records by 2 to find the total number of old records traded.

Total old records = 7 new records * 2 = 14

So, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records.

The final answer is: 14"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of junior programmers and the number of senior programmers. 

The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, which is 100. So, the number of junior programmers is 2/5 * 100 = 40.

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers is 100 - 40 = 60.

The junior programmers are each paid $2000 per month, so the total amount paid to junior programmers is 40 * $2000 = $80,000.

Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so they are paid $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month.

The total amount paid to senior programmers is 60 * $2400 = $144,000.

The total amount paid to all programmers is the sum of the amount paid to junior programmers and senior programmers, which is $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

The final answer is: $224,000"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as 'x'.

Initially, there were x people on the bus.

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the total number of people became x + 5.

At the second bus stop, 7 people got down, so the total number of people became (x + 5) - 7 = x - 2.

Then, 8 more people got in, so the total number of people became (x - 2) + 8 = x + 6.

We are given that the total number of people heading to the third stop is 20, so we can set up the equation:

x + 6 = 20

To solve for x, we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:

x = 20 - 6
x = 14

"To find the time it takes to fully charge the phone, we need to first determine how many percentage points are left to charge. Since the phone is already at 60% charged, it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more to be fully charged.

Since the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time it takes to charge 40% as follows:

40 percentage points / 1 percentage point per 3 minutes = 40 * 3 minutes = 120 minutes

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the rewards earned from the previous shopping trip, apply the rewards and the coupon to the current shopping trip, and then find the final amount paid.

The customer spent $80 on their last shopping trip, so they earned $80 / $20 = 4 rewards. 

On this shopping trip, they spent $43 and used their rewards. Since they had 4 rewards, they used $4 off the price. 

The coupon took twice the amount of rewards off the price, which is 2 * $4 = $8. 

So, the total discount applied is $4 (from rewards) + $8 (from the coupon) = $12.

The final amount paid is $43 (initial price) - $12 (total discount) = $31.

"To determine which job pays more, we need to calculate the net pay for each job.

For Job A, the total income is $15/hour * 2000 hours/year = $30,000/year. The state tax rate is 20%, so the tax amount is $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000. The net pay for Job A is $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

For Job B, the total income is $42,000/year. The property tax is $6,000, so the net income before taxes is $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000. The state tax rate is 10%, so the tax amount is $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600. The net pay for Job B is $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

To find the difference in net pay between the two jobs, we subtract the net pay of Job A from the net pay of Job B: $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

The final answer is: $8,400"

"To find the final value of Maria's shares, we need to calculate the stock price after the first year and then after the second year.

Initially, Maria buys 8 shares for $8 each, so the total cost is 8 * 8 = $64.

The stock price increases by 50% in the first year. To find the new price, we multiply the original price by 1.5 (100% + 50% = 150%, or 1.5 as a decimal). 

New price after the first year = 8 * 1.5 = $12.

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. To find the new price, we multiply the price after the first year by 0.75 (100% - 25% = 75%, or 0.75 as a decimal).

New price after the second year = 12 * 0.75 = $9.

Now, we multiply the new price after the second year by the number of shares to find the final value of Maria's shares.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of students in the two equal groups as 'x'. Since the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the smallest group is 'x - 10'.

We know that the total number of students in the class is 200, and the sum of the students in all three groups is equal to 200. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 70

Since the smallest group has 'x - 10' students, we can find the number of students in the smallest group by subtracting 10 from x:

x - 10 = 70 - 10

Since the pink frog weighs 50 pounds and it weighs the same as the blue beetle and the green toad, we can conclude that the blue beetle and the green toad also weigh 50 pounds.

The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.

The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we can find the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal by adding the weights of the animals and the container: 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 210 pounds.

The final answer is: 210"
"To find the total number of baby outfits Laurel has, we need to add up the outfits she received from her friend, the new outfits she got at the baby shower, and the outfits her mom gifted her.

Laurel's friend gave her 24 baby outfits.
At the baby shower, she received twice the amount of new baby outfits, which is 2 * 24 = 48 outfits.
Her mom gifted her 15 baby outfits.

Now, let's add up the total number of outfits: 24 + 48 + 15 = 87.

The final answer is: 87"
"To find the total distance Tyson covered in June, we first need to calculate the new daily distance he needs to run based on his coach's advice. 

The coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters in a day. To find 1/5 of 5000 meters, we multiply 5000 by 1/5.

5000 * (1/5) = 1000 meters

Now, we add this to the original 5000 meters to find the new daily distance.

5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters

Since Tyson runs 6000 meters every day, and there are 30 days in June, we multiply the daily distance by the number of days in June to find the total distance covered in June.

6000 * 30 = 180,000 meters

The final answer is: 180,000"
"To find the price difference between Juice Box C and Juice Box B, we first need to determine the price of each juice box.

Juice Box A costs 4 dollars. 
Juice Box B is 5 dollars more than Juice Box A, so it costs 4 + 5 = 9 dollars.
Juice Box C is 7 dollars more than Juice Box A, so it costs 4 + 7 = 11 dollars.

Now, we need to find the difference between the price of Juice Box C and Juice Box B. 
The difference is 11 - 9 = 2 dollars.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the total number of legs from both types of tables and add them together.

First, let's find the total number of legs from the tables with 4 legs: 
40 tables * 4 legs/table = 160 legs

Next, let's find the total number of legs from the tables with 3 legs: 
50 tables * 3 legs/table = 150 legs

Now, let's add the total number of legs from both types of tables: 
160 legs + 150 legs = 310 legs

The total number of legs the restaurant's tables have is 310."
"To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we need to first determine how many cookies are used by her son and her husband. 

Her son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, so the total number of cookies her son eats is 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so the total number of cookies her husband eats is 1 * 7 = 7 cookies.

The total number of cookies used by her son and her husband is 20 + 7 = 27 cookies.

Since each bag has 36 cookies, and 27 cookies are used by her son and her husband, the number of cookies left for Jenny is 36 - 27 = 9 cookies.

Therefore, Jenny eats 9 cookies.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the total cost of the shirts, we first need to calculate the discount amount. The original price of each shirt is $30, and the discount is 40%. 

Discount amount = 40% of $30 = 0.4 * $30 = $12

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the discounted price of one shirt. 

Discounted price of one shirt = $30 - $12 = $18

Since Davos bought 2 shirts, we multiply the discounted price of one shirt by 2 to get the total cost.

Total cost = $18 * 2 = $36

The final answer is: $36"
"To find the percentage increase in the amount of money the factory is making per day, we need to first find the difference in the amount of money they are making per day now and the amount they used to make per day.

The factory used to make $100 per tractor and sold 10 tractors a day, so they made $100 * 10 = $1000 per day.

Now, they make $220 per silo and sell 5 silos a day, so they make $220 * 5 = $1100 per day.

The difference in the amount of money they are making per day now and the amount they used to make per day is $1100 - $1000 = $100.

To find the percentage increase, we divide the difference by the original amount and multiply by 100:

($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%

So, the factory is making 10% more per day now.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how much Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to calculate the total monthly expenses and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's find the monthly expenses. 

Food costs $25 per week, and there are 4 weeks in a month, so the monthly food cost is:
$25/week * 4 weeks/month = $100/month

Treats cost $20 per month.

Medicine costs $100 per month.

The total monthly expenses are:
$100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine) = $220/month

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total yearly expenses are:
$220/month * 12 months/year = $2640/year

The final numerical answer is: $2640"
"To find the total time spent on after-work activities, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and add them up.

- Monday's yoga class is 1 hour.
- Tuesday's cooking class is 3 times as long as Monday's yoga, so it's 1 * 3 = 3 hours.
- Wednesday's cheese-tasting event is 0.5 hours (half an hour).
- Thursday's museum tour is half as long as the cooking class, so it's 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours.
- Friday's errands are 2 hours.

Now, let's add up the time spent on each activity:
1 (Monday) + 3 (Tuesday) + 0.5 (Wednesday) + 1.5 (Thursday) + 2 (Friday) = 7.5 hours.

The final answer is: 7.5"
"To find out how many plant pots April has left over, we first need to determine the total number of plant pots she needs. 

The school asked for 30 plant pots for the daisies. Since they asked for twice as many for the roses, we multiply 30 by 2 to get the number of plant pots needed for the roses. 

30 * 2 = 60

Now, we add the number of plant pots needed for the daisies and the roses to get the total number of plant pots needed. 

30 + 60 = 90

Since April had already bought 100 plant pots, we subtract the total number of plant pots needed from the number she bought to find out how many she has left over.

100 - 90 = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how much Andrea saved, we need to subtract the amount she spent from the initial amount she had. 

First, let's calculate the total amount she spent. She spent $11 on a sweater and gave her brother $4, so the total amount spent is $11 + $4 = $15.

Now, let's subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount she had: $36 - $15 = $21.

Andrea saved $21."
"To find the total time John spent, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and then add them up.

John spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours swimming. 

He also watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so the total time spent watching shows is 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

The total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows is 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours.

We are given that watching shows was 30% of the total time, so we can set up the equation: 30% of total time = 15 hours. 

To find the total time, we can convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100: 30 / 100 = 0.3. 

Now we can set up the equation: 0.3 * total time = 15. 

To find the total time, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.3: total time = 15 / 0.3 = 50 hours.

We are also given that John spent 40% of his time sightseeing. To find the time spent sightseeing, we can convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100: 40 / 100 = 0.4.

Now we can multiply the total time by the decimal to find the time spent sightseeing: 0.4 * 50 = 20 hours.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how much money Annabelle still needs to save, we need to calculate her total earnings from both jobs and subtract the amount she already has in her savings.

First, let's calculate her earnings from the first job:
20 hours * $10 per hour = $200

Next, let's calculate her earnings from the second job:
15 hours * $5 per hour = $75

Now, let's add her earnings from both jobs:
$200 + $75 = $275

Since she already has $80 in her savings, we need to subtract this from her total earnings to find out how much she still needs to save:
$275 - $80 = $195

So, Annabelle still needs to save $195.

The final answer is: $195"
"To find the height of the tallest tree, we first need to find the combined height of the two shorter trees. The shortest tree is 6 feet tall, and the second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, so it's 6 + 5 = 11 feet tall. 

The combined height of the two shorter trees is 6 + 11 = 17 feet. 

Since the height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined, we multiply the combined height by 2: 17 * 2 = 34 feet.

The height of the tallest tree is 34 feet.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find out how much money Dean has left, we need to calculate the total amount of money he spent and then add the extra $10 his mother gave him.

First, let's calculate the total amount Dean spent on toy cars: 
6 toy cars * $2 per toy car = $12

Next, let's calculate the total amount Dean spent on teddy bears: 
5 teddy bears * $1 per teddy bear = $5

Now, let's add the cost of the toy cars and teddy bears to find the total amount Dean spent: 
$12 (toy cars) + $5 (teddy bears) = $17

Dean initially had $28. After spending $17, he had: 
$28 - $17 = $11

His mother then gave him an extra $10, so we add that to the $11 he had: 
$11 + $10 = $21

Therefore, Dean has $21 left.

The final answer is: $21"
"To find out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to first calculate the total cost of the activities. 

The cost of mini-golf for Morgan and her friends is $5 per person. Since we don't know the number of friends yet, let's call it 'x'. The total cost for mini-golf will be 1 (Morgan) + x (friends) * $5.

The cost of arcade tokens is $5.

The cost of go-karts is $10 per ride, and Morgan and her friends will ride it twice. So, the total cost for go-karts will be 2 * ($10 + $10) = $40.

Now, let's add up the costs: 
Total cost = (1 + x) * $5 (mini-golf) + $5 (arcade tokens) + $40 (go-karts) = $5x + $50.

We know that Morgan's dad has a budget of $90. So, we can set up the equation: 
$5x + $50 = $90.

Now, let's solve for x:
$5x = $90 - $50
$5x = $40
x = $40 / $5
x = 8

So, Morgan can invite 8 friends. 

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how much money Marisa saves in her piggy bank, we need to first calculate how much money she spends on lollipops each day and then subtract that from her daily pocket money.

Marisa buys 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each, so the total amount she spends on lollipops each day is:
4 lollipops * 25 cents/lollipop = 100 cents or $1

Since Marisa gets $5 as pocket money each day, the amount she saves each day is:
$5 - $1 = $4

Now, we need to find out how much she saves in 5 days:
$4/day * 5 days = $20

The final answer is: $20"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how much change Billy has after buying the candy. 

Billy starts with $10. The candy costs $1.5 per pound. Let's call the number of pounds of candy he buys 'x'. The total cost of the candy is 1.5x. 

The change Billy has after buying the candy is 10 - 1.5x.

Next, Billy spends half of his change on gumballs. Since he bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, the total cost of the gumballs is 40 * 0.05 = $2. 

Since he spent half of his change on gumballs, the amount he spent on gumballs is half of his change, which is (10 - 1.5x) / 2. We know this amount is equal to $2. 

Now we can set up an equation to solve for x:

(10 - 1.5x) / 2 = 2

Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

10 - 1.5x = 4

Subtract 10 from both sides:

-1.5x = -6

Divide both sides by -1.5:

x = 4

So, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy. 

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the age of Carver's son, we need to first determine Carver's age and then calculate the son's age based on the given information.

Let's denote Carver's age as C and his son's age as S. We know that Carver is 45 years old, so C = 45.

We are also given that Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son. This can be expressed as an equation:

C = 2S - 5

Substituting the value of C, we get:

45 = 2S - 5

To solve for S, we need to isolate S on one side of the equation. We can do this by adding 5 to both sides:

45 + 5 = 2S
50 = 2S

Next, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for S:

S = 50 / 2
S = 25

Therefore, Carver's son is 25 years old.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the total distance the train travels in one trip, we need to add the distances between the three cities. 

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles. 
The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles. 
The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than the sum of the first two distances, which is 75 + 100 = 175 miles. 
So, the distance from the third city to the first city is 175 - 50 = 125 miles.

Now, we add the three distances together: 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train travels this distance 3 times a day, the total distance it travels in a day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles.

To find out how many days the train goes between services, we need to divide the total distance it can travel before needing service (18,000 miles) by the distance it travels in a day (900 miles).

18,000 / 900 = 20 days.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the amount of stuffing needed for the collie beds, we first need to calculate the average amount of stuffing between the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds. 

The average amount of stuffing is (8 + 2) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for the chihuahua beds: 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.

Next, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for the collie beds: 3 * 5 = 15 pounds.

Finally, we add the total amount of stuffing needed for the chihuahua beds and the collie beds: 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total time taken for the trip, we need to calculate the time taken for each part of the trip and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time taken for the trip to his friend's house. The distance is 200 miles and the speed is 70 mph. 

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 200 miles / 70 mph
Time = 2.857 hours (approximately)

However, he had to take a detour that added 10 miles to his trip. So, the actual distance traveled to his friend's house is 200 + 10 = 210 miles. 

Time taken for the detour = 10 miles / 70 mph
Time taken for the detour = 0.143 hours (approximately)

Total time taken to reach his friend's house = 2.857 hours + 0.143 hours
Total time taken to reach his friend's house = 3 hours

Now, let's calculate the time taken for the trip back home. The distance is 240 miles and the speed is 80 mph.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 240 miles / 80 mph
Time = 3 hours

Total time taken for the trip = Time taken to reach his friend's house + Time taken for the trip back home
Total time taken for the trip = 3 hours + 3 hours
Total time taken for the trip = 6 hours

"To find the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we first need to find the total number of students present on Friday. 

Total number of fourth-graders = 96
Number of girls = 43
Number of boys = Total number of fourth-graders - Number of girls
Number of boys = 96 - 43 = 53

Now, we know that 4 fourth-grade boys were absent on Friday. To find the number of boys present, we subtract the number of absent boys from the total number of boys.

Number of boys present = Total number of boys - Number of absent boys
Number of boys present = 53 - 4
Number of boys present = 49

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as M, the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting as S, and the number of customers kicked out for physical violence as V.

We are given that M = 3.

We are also given that the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting (S) equals four times the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks minus 5. So, S = 4M - 5 = 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7.

We are also given that the number of customers kicked out for physical violence (V) is three times the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting. So, V = 3S = 3(7) = 21.

We are given that a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart. The total number of people kicked out is the sum of the people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence. So, M + S + V = 50.

Substituting the values we found earlier, we get 3 + 7 + 21 = 31. This is the sum of the people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence.

To find the number of people kicked out for other reasons, we subtract the sum from the total number of people kicked out. So, 50 - 31 = 19.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many points Erin has after scoring 14 points. We know that Erin now has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8 points. 

Let's denote the number of points Erin had before scoring 14 points as 'x'. After scoring 14 points, Erin will have x + 14 points. Since Erin now has three times more points than Sara, we can set up the equation:

x + 14 = 3 * 8

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 14 = 24

Subtracting 14 from both sides of the equation, we get:

x = 10

So, Erin had 10 points before scoring 14 points.

"To calculate the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to break down the costs into different categories.

First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames. Each picture frame costs $20, and the logo etching costs an additional 20% of the frame's cost. 

20% of $20 is 0.20 * $20 = $4. 
So, the total cost of each picture frame with the logo etching is $20 + $4 = $24.

Since there are 44 seniors, the total cost of the picture frames is 44 * $24 = $1056.

Next, 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each. The total cost of the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the cords for the officers. 1/4 of the seniors are officers, which is 44 / 4 = 11 officers. The cost of the cords for the officers is 11 * $12 = $132.

The total cost of the senior gifts is the sum of the costs of the picture frames, pins, and cords: $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

The final numerical answer is: $1198"

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes they sold on Friday, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the amount they did on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six people returned their pairs on Sunday, so we need to subtract those from the total number of shoes sold on Sunday. 14 - 6 = 8 pairs.

Now, let's add up the total number of shoes sold over the three days: 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 pairs.

Since each pair has 2 shoes, we multiply the total number of pairs by 2 to get the total number of shoes sold: 50 * 2 = 100.

"To find the total amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we first need to find the value of the faulty equipment. 

The total value of the equipment is $400,000. 40% of this is faulty. 

40% of $400,000 = 0.4 * $400,000 = $160,000

This means the faulty equipment is worth $160,000. 

To find the value of the functioning equipment, we subtract the value of the faulty equipment from the total value.

Value of functioning equipment = Total value - Value of faulty equipment
= $400,000 - $160,000

"To find the number of pupils who like the color yellow, we first need to determine the number of pupils who like blue, then the number who like green, and finally subtract those from the total number of pupils.

First, half of the class likes blue. Since there are 40 pupils in the class, half of them would be 40 / 2 = 20 pupils who like blue.

Now, one-fourth of the remaining pupils like green. The remaining pupils after excluding those who like blue are 40 - 20 = 20. One-fourth of 20 is 20 / 4 = 5 pupils who like green.

The total number of pupils who like blue or green is 20 (blue) + 5 (green) = 25. 

To find the number of pupils who like yellow, we subtract the total number of pupils who like blue or green from the total number of pupils in the class: 40 - 25 = 15.

"To find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we need to calculate the number of apples picked each day and then add them together.

On Monday, Lucy sold all the apples picked, but we don't know the number of apples picked. However, we do know that she made $56 from selling them at $4 per piece. To find the number of apples picked on Monday, we can divide the total amount earned by the price per apple:

$56 ÷ $4 = 14 apples

So, Lucy picked 14 apples on Monday.

On Tuesday, she picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she did the previous day, which is 2 * 12 = 24 apples.

Now, let's add the number of apples picked each day to find the total:

"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the monthly interest and then add it to the principal amount. 

First, let's find the total interest she has to pay over five months. The formula for simple interest is:

Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

Here, Principal = $3,650, Rate = 10% or 0.10, and Time = 5 months.

Interest = $3,650 * 0.10 * 5
Interest = $1,825

Now, we need to find the total amount she has to pay, which is the principal plus the interest.

Total Amount = Principal + Interest
Total Amount = $3,650 + $1,825
Total Amount = $5,475

Since she has to pay an equal amount every month for 5 months, we divide the total amount by 5.

Monthly Payment = Total Amount / 5
Monthly Payment = $5,475 / 5
Monthly Payment = $1,095

The final answer is: $1,095"
"To find out how many kilometers Cho hiked, we need to multiply the speed by the time. Cho hiked at 14 kilometers per hour for 8 hours, so Cho hiked 14 * 8 = 112 kilometers.

To find out how many kilometers Chloe hiked, we need to multiply Chloe's speed by the time she hiked. Chloe hiked at 9 kilometers per hour for 5 hours, so Chloe hiked 9 * 5 = 45 kilometers.

To find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked than Chloe, we need to subtract the distance Chloe hiked from the distance Cho hiked. Cho hiked 112 kilometers and Chloe hiked 45 kilometers, so Cho hiked 112 - 45 = 67 kilometers farther.

The final answer is: 67"
"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we first need to determine how many silver and gold pesos each of them has.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos.

Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos.

Anna also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

Now, we add up the total number of silver and gold pesos each of them has:

Axel's total: 50 (silver) + 80 (gold) = 130 pesos
Anna's total: 100 (silver) + 120 (gold) = 220 pesos

The total number of pesos they have together is: 130 + 220 = 350

The final answer is: 350"
"To find the total profit per hour, we first need to determine the total revenue and the total cost.

Millie buys supplies for $18 to make 3 pitchers of lemonade. Each pitcher holds 12 cups of lemonade, so she can make 3 * 12 = 36 cups of lemonade.

She sells each cup of lemonade for $1, so her total revenue will be 36 * $1 = $36.

Her total cost is $18.

To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the revenue: $36 - $18 = $18.

Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, we need to find out how many hours it takes her to sell all the lemonade. Since she has 36 cups, and she sells 4 cups per hour, it will take her 36 / 4 = 9 hours to sell all the lemonade.

To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours: $18 / 9 = $2.

The final numerical answer is: $2"
"To find the initial amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we can use the information that he sold 3/5 of his land and had 12.8 hectares left. 

Let's denote the initial amount of land as x hectares. Since he sold 3/5 of his land, he was left with 2/5 of his land, which is equal to 12.8 hectares. 

We can set up the equation: (2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2 to isolate x:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land initially.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the number of female members in the choir, we first need to calculate 50% of the total members. Since 50% of the choir members are girls, we can find this by multiplying the total number of members by 0.5.

Total members = 52
Number of girls = Total members * 0.5
Number of girls = 52 * 0.5
Number of girls = 26

Now, we know that half the people performing can't make it to the show. This means that half of the female members are unable to perform. To find the number of girls who can perform, we need to divide the total number of girls by 2.

Number of girls performing = Number of girls / 2
Number of girls performing = 26 / 2
Number of girls performing = 13

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them. To find the total number of people who sang in the performance, we need to add the number of girls performing and the number of teachers.

Total people performing = Number of girls performing + Number of teachers
Total people performing = 13 + 3
Total people performing = 16

The final answer is: 16"
"To find Wilson's current math grade, we need to calculate the average of his 5 test scores. 

First, we add up all the scores: 
65 + 94 = 159
159 + 81 = 240
240 + 86 = 326
326 + 74 = 400

Next, we divide the sum by the number of tests to find the average:
400 / 5 = 80

So, Wilson's current math grade is 80. 

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the erasers and the cost of the pencils separately and then add them together.

The cost of 6 erasers is 6 * $2 = $12.

The cost of 8 pencils is 8 * $3 = $24.

Now, we add the cost of the erasers and the pencils together: $12 + $24 = $36.

The final numerical answer is: $36"
"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to calculate the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu and add it to the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson.

First, let's find the number of messages James delivers to Mr. Yu. Since he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can multiply the number of messages to Ms. Thompson by 1/3.

Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * Messages to Ms. Thompson
Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * 66
Messages to Mr. Yu = 22

Now, we can add the number of messages to Mr. Yu and Ms. Thompson to find the total number of messages James delivers.

Total messages = Messages to Ms. Thompson + Messages to Mr. Yu
Total messages = 66 + 22
Total messages = 88

The final answer is: 88"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of the rides for Dasha and compare it to the cost of the ride bracelet for David.

First, let's calculate the cost of the rides for Dasha. Since each ride costs 2 tickets at $2 per ticket, the cost of one ride is 2 * $2 = $4. Since they ride all 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha is 9 * $4 = $36.

Now, let's calculate the cost for David. He buys a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides. Since he rides all 9 rides, he doesn't need to buy any additional tickets.

To find out how much money David saves, we need to compare the cost of the ride bracelet to the cost of the tickets for Dasha. Since Dasha's cost is $36 and David's cost is $30, David saves $36 - $30 = $6.

The final numerical answer is: $6"
"To find out how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we need to first determine the total number of gifts she needs to wrap and then divide the total amount of ribbon by that number.

Monica has 6 gifts for her family, 4 gifts for her friends, and 2 gifts for her teachers, making a total of 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 gifts.

Since she wants to make a bow for each gift, she will need to make 12 bows in total.

To find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each bow, we need to divide the total amount of ribbon (144 inches) by the total number of bows (12).

144 inches / 12 bows = 12 inches per bow.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the number of popsicles each person has, we can use the given ratio and the total number of popsicles. 

Let's assume the common ratio is x. Then, Betty has 5x popsicles and Sam has 6x popsicles. The total number of popsicles is 5x + 6x = 11x. We are given that the total number of popsicles is 165, so we can set up the equation 11x = 165.

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 11: x = 165 / 11 = 15.

Now that we know x, we can find the number of popsicles each person has. Betty has 5x = 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles, and Sam has 6x = 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has: 90 - 75 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total cost of the streaming services, we need to calculate the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus. 

The normal cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 each, so together they cost $20. However, Tim saves 20% by bundling them. 

20% of $20 is 0.2 * $20 = $4. 

So, the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $20 - $4 = $16. 

The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $16 (bundled Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26. 

Since Tim was paying $60 for the cable package, he saves $60 - $26 = $34 by cancelling his cable subscription.

The final answer is: $34"
"To find the total time spent on the song, we need to add up the time spent writing, recording, and editing. 

Time spent writing: 4 hours
Time spent recording: 4 hours / 2 = 2 hours
Time spent editing: 90 minutes = 1.5 hours

Total time spent = 4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5 hours

Now, let's find the percentage of time spent editing. 
Percentage = (Time spent editing / Total time) * 100
= (1.5 / 7.5) * 100
= 0.2 * 100
= 20%

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total number of books Wendy needs to carry, we first need to determine the number of books in the shelving system and then add 20 more than double that amount.

The shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns, so the total number of books it can hold is 6 * 6 = 36.

Now, we need to find double the number of books in the shelving system, which is 2 * 36 = 72.

Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books, so we add 20 to 72: 72 + 20 = 92.

Therefore, Wendy will need to carry 92 books to complete her task.

The final answer is: 92"
"To find out how many Valentine's Day cards Erica has now, we need to calculate the total number of cards she initially had, added to the cards her dad brought, and then subtract the cards she passed out and add the cards she received.

Initially, Erica made 20 Valentine's cards.

Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards that had 15 cards each, so she received 2 * 15 = 30 cards.

She passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 to her family, so in total, she gave away 24 + 5 = 29 cards.

She received 17 cards from family and friends.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards Erica has now:

Initial cards + cards from dad - cards given away + cards received
= 20 + 30 - 29 + 17
= 38

So, Erica now has 38 Valentine's Day cards."
"To find out how many slices are left, we first need to determine how many slices Jenny gave away. 

Jenny gave 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices, we can calculate the number of slices Bill received as follows:

1/3 of 12 = (1/3) * 12 = 4 slices

Jenny gave 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. We can calculate the number of slices Mark received as follows:

1/4 of 12 = (1/4) * 12 = 3 slices

In total, Jenny gave away 4 + 3 = 7 slices.

Jenny ate 2 slices, so the total number of slices she gave away or ate is 7 + 2 = 9 slices.

To find out how many slices are left, we subtract the total number of slices given away or eaten from the total number of slices:

12 - 9 = 3 slices

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many days Mark needs to save his money, we need to divide the cost of the bike by his daily earnings.

Cost of the bike: $300
Daily earnings: $10

Number of days = Cost of the bike / Daily earnings

= 30

So, Mark needs to save his money for 30 days to buy the bike.

30"
"To find the total number of bugs, we need to calculate the number of millipedes and stink bugs first.

Nancy saw 90 spiders. The number of millipedes is 1/3rd of the number of spiders, so the number of millipedes is 90 / 3 = 30.

The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12, so the number of stink bugs is (2 * 30) - 12 = 48.

Now, we add up the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs to find the total number of bugs: 90 + 30 + 48 = 168.

The final answer is: 168"
"To find the difference between Alice and Erica's ages, we first need to determine Alice's age. Since Beth is 5 years older than Erica, and Erica is 30 years old, we can calculate Beth's age as follows:

Beth's age = Erica's age + 5
Beth's age = 30 + 5
Beth's age = 35

Since Alice is 7 years older than Beth, we can calculate Alice's age as follows:

Alice's age = Beth's age + 7
Alice's age = 35 + 7
Alice's age = 42

Now, we can find the difference between Alice and Erica's ages:

Difference = Alice's age - Erica's age
Difference = 42 - 30
Difference = 12

"To find the total calories consumed by John, we need to calculate the total ounces of milk he drank and then multiply it by the calories per ounce.

First, we know that John drank 2 glasses of milk, and each glass is 8 ounces. So, the total ounces of milk he drank is 2 * 8 = 16 ounces.

Since milk has 3 calories per ounce, we multiply the total ounces by the calories per ounce: 16 * 3 = 48 calories.

Therefore, John consumed 48 calories.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the total amount the builder earns in a year, we need to calculate his daily earnings and then multiply it by the total number of days he works in a year.

First, let's find out how much he earns in a day: $50 per day.

Since he works 6 days a week and 4 weeks a month, we can find the total number of days he works in a month: 6 days/week * 4 weeks/month = 24 days/month.

There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of days he works in a year is: 24 days/month * 12 months/year = 288 days/year.

Now, we can find his total earnings in a year: $50/day * 288 days/year = $14,400/year.

The final answer is: $14,400"
"To find out how many bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of flour and milk required for the quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. Since Mark is making a quadruple batch, we multiply the ingredients by 4:

- Flour: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups
- Milk: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark will need to buy:
12 cups / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags of flour

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so Mark will need to buy:
4 cups / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles of milk

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour:
6 bags of flour - 2 bottles of milk = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the energy saved, we first need to calculate the original energy consumption and the new energy consumption.

Original energy consumption per day: 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours (Wh) or 7.2 kilowatt-hours (kWh)

New energy consumption per day: 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 Wh or 2.7 kWh

Energy saved per day: 7.2 kWh - 2.7 kWh = 4.5 kWh

To find the total energy saved in 30 days, we multiply the daily energy saved by 30: 4.5 kWh * 30 = 135 kWh

There are two zebras with 17 stripes each, so that's 2 * 17 = 34 stripes.
There's a zebra with 36 stripes.
There's another zebra with half the number of stripes as the third zebra, which is 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.

The total number of stripes is 34 + 36 + 18 = 88.
The total number of zebras is 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.

To find the average, we divide the total number of stripes by the total number of zebras: 88 / 4 = 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To determine the total cost of the meat and cheese, we first need to calculate the total number of sandwiches required to serve 20 people. Since each sandwich serves 4 people, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each sandwich serves:

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, we need a total of 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

The cost of the meat is $7.00 per pound, so the total cost of the meat is:
5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00

The cost of the cheese is $3.00 per pound, so the total cost of the cheese is:
5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

The total cost of the meat and cheese is the sum of the cost of the meat and the cost of the cheese:
$35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the initial number of corns and the new number of cannolis and corns after Allan's purchase.

Initially, Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis. Since he has 40 cannolis, the initial number of corns is 2 * 40 = 80.

Allan bought 60 more cannolis and 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. So, he bought 60 cannolis and 60 - 40 = 20 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. Since he bought 60 cannolis, he bought 60 - 20 = 40 corns.

Now, we add the initial number of corns and cannolis to the number of corns and cannolis Allan bought. The total number of corns is 80 (initial) + 40 (bought) = 120. The total number of cannolis is 40 (initial) + 60 (bought) = 100.

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 120 + 100 = 220.

"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to first determine how many steps he had completed before the jog. 

Elliott finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. Since he wants to walk 10,000 steps, half of that would be 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps. 

He also took an additional 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So, before the jog, he had completed 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

After the jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal of 10,000 steps. This means that before the jog, he had completed 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 steps.

However, we already know that before the jog, he had completed 6,000 steps. To find out how many steps he took during the jog, we need to subtract the steps he had already completed from the total steps he had completed before the jog. 

So, the steps taken during the jog would be 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000 steps.

The final answer is: 2000"
"To find out how many minutes Toby will be early, we first need to determine how long it will take him to read the book. 

The book is 45 pages long and averages 200 words per page, so the total number of words in the book is 45 * 200 = 9000 words.

Toby can read at a rate of 300 words per minute. To find out how long it will take him to read the book, we divide the total number of words by his reading rate: 9000 / 300 = 30 minutes.

It takes 10 minutes to get to the airport, so we need to add this to the time it takes to read the book: 30 + 10 = 40 minutes.

Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes, so we subtract the time it will take him to get to the airport from the time he has to be there: 60 - 40 = 20 minutes.

Therefore, Toby will be 20 minutes early. 

20"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to first determine the number of employees and their total hours worked in each month.

In May, the company hired 40 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours per week for 4 weeks, so the total hours worked by each employee in May is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in May is 160 * $15 = $2400.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 1/4 * 40 = 10 employees left. So, the remaining number of employees is 40 - 10 = 30. Each of these employees worked 160 hours in June, and the total amount paid to each employee in June is 160 * $15 = $2400.

The total amount paid to the employees in May is 40 * $2400 = $96,000. The total amount paid to the employees in June is 30 * $2400 = $72,000.

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000.

"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The sale is ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means that the second pound is half off, so the cost of the second pound is $3 * 0.5 = $1.5. The total cost of 2 pounds of taffy is $3 + $1.5 = $4.5.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the magnets. Sally bought 4 magnets at $0.25 each, so the total cost of the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items: $4.5 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1 (magnets) = $7.

Sally started with $10, so she has $10 - $7 = $3 left.

"To determine how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we need to calculate how many cookies she will eat in 30 days and then divide that number by the number of cookies her recipe makes.

Shannon eats 2 cookies per night. Since there are 30 days in the period she wants to cover, we multiply the number of cookies she eats per night by the number of days:

2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies

Since Shannon's recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies she needs by 12 to find out how many dozens she needs to make:

60 cookies / 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozen

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozen madeleine cookies to have enough for 30 days. 

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. 

First, let's find the number of candles that smell like wet dog. Since 5% of the candles have this defect, we can calculate it as follows:

Number of candles that smell like wet dog = Total number of candles * Percentage of candles with the defect
= 50000 * 0.05
= 2500

Now, we need to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. Since the candles that explode are guaranteed to be 99% safe, it means 1% of the candles can explode. However, we are not given the total number of candles that can explode, but we are given the percentage of candles that are guaranteed not to explode. 

Let's find the number of candles that are guaranteed not to explode:
Number of candles that are guaranteed not to explode = Total number of candles * Percentage of candles that are guaranteed not to explode
= 50000 * 0.99
= 49500

Now, we can find the number of candles that can explode by subtracting the number of candles that are guaranteed not to explode from the total number of candles:
Number of candles that can explode = Total number of candles - Number of candles that are guaranteed not to explode
= 50000 - 49500
= 500

However, we are not given the percentage of candles that can explode and smell like wet dog. We are only given the percentage of candles that can explode and the percentage of candles that smell like wet dog. Since these are independent events, we can assume that the percentage of candles that can explode and smell like wet dog is the product of the two percentages.

Percentage of candles that can explode and smell like wet dog = Percentage of candles that can explode * Percentage of candles that smell like wet dog
= 0.01 * 0.05
= 0.0005

Now, we can find the number of candles that can explode and smell like wet dog:
Number of candles that can explode and smell like wet dog = Total number of candles * Percentage of candles that can explode and smell like wet dog
= 50000 * 0.0005
= 25

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathered from the tallest trees as T, from the average trees as A, and from the shortest trees as S. 

Since Joanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees, we have T = 30.

From the shortest trees, she gathered half of 30, which is 15. So, S = 15.

The total number of apples Joanne gathered is the sum of the apples from the three types of trees: T + A + S = 30 + A + 15.

Now, let's consider Joanne's sister. She gathered twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, so her total from the tallest trees is 2T = 2 * 30 = 60.

She gathered three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so her total from the shortest trees is 3S = 3 * 15 = 45.

Since she didn't gather any apples from the average trees, her total is 60 + 45 = 105.

The combined total of the apples gathered by both sisters is 500. So, the total number of apples Joanne gathered is 500 - 105 = 395.

We already know that Joanne gathered 30 + 15 = 45 apples from the tallest and shortest trees. Therefore, the number of apples she gathered from the average trees is 395 - 45 = 350.

The final answer is: 350"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D.

We know that the total number of heads is 180, and since each animal has one head, we can write the equation:

C + D = 180

We also know that the total number of bumps is 304, and since camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump, we can write the equation:

2C + D = 304

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve for C and D by subtracting the first equation from the second equation:

(2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know C, we can substitute this value into the first equation to solve for D:

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

Therefore, there are 56 dromedaries in the herd.

The final answer is: 56"
"To find the total distance traveled by Tom, we need to break down the information given.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day. So, the total distance covered in the first 4 days is 4 * 200 = 800 kilometers.

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. 30% of 800 kilometers is 0.3 * 800 = 240 kilometers. So, the total distance covered in the next two days is 240 kilometers.

On the next day, he wasn't traveling at all, so the distance covered is 0 kilometers.

During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total distance covered in the second week is 7 * 300 = 2100 kilometers.

Now, let's add up the distances covered in each segment: 
- First 4 days: 800 kilometers
- Next two days: 240 kilometers
- Next day: 0 kilometers
- Second week: 2100 kilometers

Total distance = 800 + 240 + 0 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.

The final answer is: 3140"
"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to work backwards from Peter's locker size. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, Zack's locker must be 4 times as big as Peter's locker.

Let's calculate Zack's locker size:
Zack's locker size = 4 * Peter's locker size
Zack's locker size = 4 * 5 cubic inches
Zack's locker size = 20 cubic inches

Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, Timothy's locker must be twice as big as Zack's locker.

Let's calculate Timothy's locker size:
Timothy's locker size = 2 * Zack's locker size
Timothy's locker size = 2 * 20 cubic inches
Timothy's locker size = 40 cubic inches

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the elevation where Stanley's comb fell, we need to subtract the distance it fell from Stanley's initial elevation. 

Stanley's initial elevation: 10,000 feet
Distance the comb fell: 4,000 feet
Elevation where the comb fell: 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet

Now, we need to find the difference between the elevation where the comb fell and Oliver's elevation to determine how much Oliver needs to climb.

Elevation where the comb fell: 6,000 feet
Oliver's elevation: 3,000 feet
Distance Oliver must climb: 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet

The final answer is: 3000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Mr. Josue initially had $5000 in capital. The first bank gave him $4000, so now he has $5000 + $4000 = $9000.

The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, which is 2 * $4000 = $8000. 

Now, we add the amount he received from the second bank to his current capital: $9000 + $8000 = $17000.

So, Mr. Josue now has $17000 in capital.

The final answer is: $17000"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

1. Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock.
2. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each. So, the total number of cats taken away is 4 * 5 = 20.
3. The remaining cats on the rock are 50 - 20 = 30.
4. Later, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find 3/5 of 30, we multiply 30 by 3/5, which is (30 * 3) / 5 = 90 / 5 = 18.
5. The number of cats that ran after the mouse is 18, so the remaining cats on the rock are 30 - 18 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into the different pricing periods.

1. The first 6 months were $8 a month, so the cost for this period is 6 * $8 = $48.
2. The next 8 months were $12 a month, so the cost for this period is 8 * $12 = $96.
3. The remaining months in 2 years (24 months) minus the first 14 months (6 + 8) is 24 - 14 = 10 months. The cost for this period is 10 * $14 = $140.

Now, we add up the costs for each period: $48 + $96 + $140 = $284.

The final numerical answer is: $284"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let the cost of the jogger jeans be x. Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, the cost of the tattered jeans is x + $6.

The total savings is $6, and Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. This means that 1/3 of the total savings is the savings from the jogger jeans, and 2/3 of the total savings is the savings from the tattered jeans.

We can set up the equation:

(1/3) * (total savings) = savings from jogger jeans
(2/3) * (total savings) = savings from tattered jeans

Since the total savings is $6, we can substitute this value into the equations:

(1/3) * $6 = savings from jogger jeans
(2/3) * $6 = savings from tattered jeans

Simplifying the equations, we get:

$2 = savings from jogger jeans
$4 = savings from tattered jeans

The cost of the jogger jeans is x, and the cost of the tattered jeans is x + $6. The savings from the jogger jeans is $2, so the original cost of the jogger jeans is $2 + $6 = $8.

The original cost of the jogger jeans is $8, and the original cost of the tattered jeans is $28. To find the difference in cost, we subtract the original cost of the tattered jeans from the original cost of the jogger jeans:

$8 - $28 = -$20

However, since we are looking for how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans, we take the absolute value of the difference:

|-20| = $20

The final answer is: $20"
"To find the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and then add them together.

The capacity of the 4 buses is 4 x 60 = 240 employees.
The capacity of the 6 minibusses is 6 x 30 = 180 employees.
The capacity of the 10 minivans is 10 x 15 = 150 employees.

Now, we add the capacities together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

The final answer is: 570"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder. We know that the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones. Since the store-bought feeders attract 20 birds, the homemade feeders attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds.

Lillian has 3 homemade feeders and 3 store-bought feeders. The total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3 * 30 = 90 birds. The total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3 * 20 = 60 birds.

The total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is the sum of the birds attracted to the homemade and store-bought feeders: 90 + 60 = 150 birds.

The final answer is: 150"
"To find the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The bagel costs $4. 
The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. To find 25% of $4, we multiply $4 by 0.25, which is $1. Then, we add this to the cost of the bagel: $4 + $1 = $5. 
The cake costs half the price of the bagel, which is $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, we add the costs of all the items together: $4 (bagel) + $5 (soup) + $2 (cake) = $11.

The final answer is: $11"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cards Kenny sold to get the remaining $50. Since he sold the cards for $1.5 each, we can divide the remaining money by the price per card to find the number of cards sold.

Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as 'x'. Since he kept 1/3 of the cards, he sold 2/3 of the cards. The number of cards sold is (2/3)x.

The money he got from selling the cards is equal to the number of cards sold multiplied by the price per card, which is (2/3)x * $1.5.

We know that he got $50 from selling the cards, so we can set up the equation:

(2/3)x * $1.5 = $50

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3/2 to get:

x * $1.5 = $50 * (3/2)

x * $1.5 = $75

Now, we can divide both sides by $1.5 to get:

x = $75 / $1.5

x = 50

So, Kenny started with 50 cards.

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, the caterer prepared enough hot dogs for half of the guests to have two hot dogs. Since there are 36 guests, half of them would be 36 / 2 = 18. So, the caterer prepared enough hot dogs for 18 guests to have two hot dogs each.

This means the caterer prepared 18 * 2 = 36 hot dogs for the first 18 guests. However, since the caterer prepared enough for 18 guests to have two hot dogs, the total number of hot dogs prepared is 36.

Now, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hot dog. This means that the 18 guests who were initially supposed to have two hot dogs got their second hot dog, and the remaining 22 guests (40 - 18 = 22) also got a second hot dog.

Since the caterer had prepared 36 hot dogs, and 40 guests got a second hot dog, there are not enough hot dogs for the 40th guest. This means that the 40th guest did not get a second hot dog.

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the number of letters in Indras' sister's name, we first need to find half of the letters in Indras' name. 

Indras has 6 letters in her name. Half of 6 is 3. 

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name, so it has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

The total number of letters in both names is 6 (Indras) + 7 (her sister) = 13.

The final numerical answer is: 13"
"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the total cost of the items before the discount and then apply the 20% discount.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- The set of pot and pans costs $120.00
- The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00
- 5 separate utensils at $5.00 each will cost 5 x $5.00 = $25.00

The total cost of the items before the discount is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

Now, let's apply the 20% discount to the total cost:

20% of $165.00 is 0.20 x $165.00 = $33.00

The discount amount is $33.00, so we subtract this from the total cost:

$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

The final cost of Charlotte's order is $132.00.

The final answer is: $132.00"
"To find out how much more money Dora needs, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy and subtract the amount of money she already has.

The total cost of the items is: $6 (skipping rope) + $11 (board game) + $2 (playground ball) = $19.

Dora has a total of $2 (her allowance) + $16 (from her mother) = $18.

To find out how much more money she needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost: $19 (total cost) - $18 (amount she has) = $1.

Therefore, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball.

The final answer is: $1"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many dragons Prince Arthur and Prince Walter slew, and then use that information to find out how many dragons Prince Bruce slew.

Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons. Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, so Prince Arthur slew 3/4 * 100 = 75 dragons.

Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so Prince Walter slew 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.

Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so Prince Bruce slew 1/5 * 150 = 30 dragons.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we first need to determine how much gas was in each container. Since 15 gallons were equally divided into 5 containers, we can divide 15 by 5 to find the amount in each container.

15 gallons / 5 containers = 3 gallons per container

Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we can convert the 3 gallons to pints by multiplying 3 by 8.

3 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 24 pints

Josey needed 1/4 of a container, so we need to find 1/4 of 24 pints.

1/4 * 24 pints = 6 pints

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money George had initially. Since he had 1% of his money left after spending $5, we can set up an equation to find the initial amount.

Let's denote the initial amount of money George had as 'x'. Since he had 1% of his money left after spending $5, we can write the equation as:

x - 5 = 0.01x

To solve for x, we can add 5 to both sides of the equation:

x = 5 / (1 - 0.01)
x = 5 / 0.99
x = 5.05

Now that we know George had $5.05 initially, we can find out how much he spent on chips. He bought 3 bags of chips for 40 cents each, so the total amount spent on chips is:

3 * 0.40 = $1.20

Now, we can subtract the amount spent on chips from the initial amount to find out how much he spent on candy bars:

$5.05 - $1.20 = $3.85

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can divide the amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar to find out how many candy bars he bought:

$3.85 / 0.75 = 5.13

Since we can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can buy 5 candy bars with $3.75 and have $0.10 left, which is not enough to buy another candy bar. Therefore, George bought 5 candy bars.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many lollipops each of Ray's friends received, we need to first determine how many lollipops he shared with his friends. 

Ray had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself, so he shared 25 - 5 = 20 lollipops with his friends.

Since he shared the lollipops equally among his four friends, we need to divide the total number of lollipops shared (20) by the number of friends (4).

20 ÷ 4 = 5

So, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the remaining weight of the cake, we first need to determine how much of the cake was eaten. Since Rory and her mom each had a piece, that's 2 pieces in total. 

The cake was cut into 8 pieces, and 2 were eaten, so 8 - 2 = 6 pieces remain. 

Since the cake weighs 20 ounces and it was cut into 8 equal pieces, we can find the weight of each piece by dividing the total weight by the number of pieces: 20 ounces / 8 = 2.5 ounces per piece.

Now, we multiply the number of remaining pieces by the weight of each piece to find the total weight of the remaining cake: 6 pieces * 2.5 ounces/piece = 15 ounces.

The remaining cake weighs 15 ounces."
"To find out how many oranges each person will get, we first need to determine the total number of oranges Sitti and Juris have. 

Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges. 

Total oranges = 34 + 22 = 56

Since they are sharing the oranges with 6 other friends, including themselves, the total number of people sharing the oranges is 8 (Sitti, Juris, and 6 friends).

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people.

Oranges per person = Total oranges / Total people
= 56 / 8
= 7

So, everyone will get 7 oranges. 

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the cost per serving, we first need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients. 

Antoine wants to double the amount of onions, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The cost of onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, which costs 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

Since the soup serves 6 people, the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes Bernadette to get to the theater and then calculate how much earlier she needs to leave than Wayne.

Since it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, and Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's, Bernadette's drive will take 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, so she needs to leave 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, Bernadette needs to leave 4 + 5 = 9 minutes before Wayne.

"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we first need to find the width of the room. We know the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards. 

First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length in feet is 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet.

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is length * width = area. We can rearrange this formula to solve for the width: width = area / length. 

Plugging in the values we know, we get width = 360 square feet / 9 feet = 40 feet.

Now that we have the width, we can find the perimeter of the room using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is 2 * (length + width). 

Plugging in the values we know, we get perimeter = 2 * (9 feet + 40 feet) = 2 * 49 feet = 98 feet.

The final answer is: 98"
"To find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we need to calculate the total number of beads each sister has.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
1 pack of red beads = 1 x 20 = 20 beads
2 packs of clear beads = 2 x 20 = 40 beads
Total beads Elizabeth has = 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
3 packs of blue beads = 3 x 20 = 60 beads
4 packs of red beads = 4 x 20 = 80 beads
Total beads Margareth has = 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, let's find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth:
Margareth's beads - Elizabeth's beads = 140 - 60 = 80

"To find the final temperature of the house, we need to calculate the temperature increase due to the oven and the temperature decrease due to the open window.

First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to the oven. The oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour, and Marcus bakes for 3 hours. So, the total temperature increase is 5 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 15 degrees.

Now, let's calculate the temperature decrease due to the open window. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Since the window is open for 30 minutes, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are there in 30 minutes. 30 minutes / 10 minutes = 3 intervals. So, the total temperature decrease is 2 degrees/interval * 3 intervals = 6 degrees.

Now, let's subtract the temperature decrease from the temperature increase: 15 degrees (increase) - 6 degrees (decrease) = 9 degrees.

The initial temperature of the house was 40 degrees. So, the final temperature is 40 degrees + 9 degrees = 49 degrees.

The final answer is: 49"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it took James to complete each segment of the triathlon. 

Let's start with the swim. Since James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon, and Jon took 40 minutes, we can calculate James' swim time as follows:

James' swim time = Jon's swim time - (10% of Jon's swim time)
= 40 - (0.1 * 40)
= 40 - 4
= 36 minutes

Next, we know that James took 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. Since Jon took 1 hour and 20 minutes (or 80 minutes) for the bike ride, we can calculate James' bike time as follows:

James' bike time = Jon's bike time + 5 minutes
= 80 + 5
= 85 minutes

Now, we know that Jon won by 10 minutes, which means that the difference between Jon's total time and James' total time is 10 minutes. We can set up an equation to represent this:

Jon's total time - James' total time = 10 minutes

We know Jon's total time is 40 (swim) + 80 (bike) + 50 (run) = 170 minutes. We also know James' swim time (36 minutes) and bike time (85 minutes). Let's represent James' run time as 'x'. Then, we can set up the equation as follows:

170 - (36 + 85 + x) = 10

Combine like terms:

170 - 121 - x = 10

Subtract 170 from both sides:

-121 - x = -160

Add x to both sides:

-121 = -160 + x

Add 121 to both sides:

0 = -39 + x

Add 39 to both sides:

39 = x

So, James' run time is 39 minutes.

The final answer is: 39"
"To find the length of Movie A, we need to first find the length of Movie B and then calculate one-fourth of that length.

Movie C is 1.25 hours, which is equal to 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes.

"To find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay, we need to calculate the total cost of the hay and subtract it from the amount of money he has.

First, let's find out how many miles the horse runs in 30 minutes. Since the horse runs at 32MPH, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. 

30 minutes is 0.5 hours (since 1 hour = 60 minutes).

Now, we can calculate the distance traveled by the horse:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 32MPH * 0.5 hours
Distance = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile, the total hay consumed is:
Total Hay = Distance * (1/2 bail/mile)
Total Hay = 16 miles * (1/2 bail/mile)
Total Hay = 8 bails

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost of the hay is:
Total Cost = Total Hay * Cost per bail
Total Cost = 8 bails * $3/bail
Total Cost = $24

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of:
Total Money = 6 * $5
Total Money = $30

Now, we can find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay:
Change = Total Money - Total Cost
Change = $30 - $24
Change = $6

The final answer is: $6"
"To find out how many trays Rozanne can put out, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs she has. 

Rozanne uses 4 dozen eggs from cases. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 4 dozen eggs would be 4 * 12 = 48 eggs. 

In addition to the eggs from the cases, she also uses 2 loose eggs. So, the total number of eggs is 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Each glass of eggnog needs 5 eggs, so the total number of glasses she can make is 50 / 5 = 10 glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, the total number of trays she can put out is 10 / 5 = 2 trays.

"To find the salesman's profit, we first need to calculate the total revenue from the sale of the sneakers.

The salesman sold 17 sneakers for $20 each on Monday, so the revenue from these sales is:
17 * $20 = $340

The remaining sneakers are 48 - 17 = 31. These were sold for $25 each throughout the rest of the week. The revenue from these sales is:
31 * $25 = $775

The total revenue from the sale of all sneakers is:
$340 + $775 = $1115

The cost of the case of 48 sneakers is $576. To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the total revenue:
$1115 - $576 = $539

The salesman's profit is $539.

The final answer is: $539"

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the regular price of popcorn as P. 

The total cost of buying a movie ticket and popcorn and soda at regular price is 12 + P + 3 = 15 + P.

The total cost of the super ticket is 20, and the extra cost for popcorn and soda is 1. 

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the difference in cost between the two options is 2. 

So, we can set up the equation: 15 + P - 20 + 1 = 2.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 15 + P - 19 = 2.

Combine like terms: -4 + P = 2.

Add 4 to both sides: P = 6.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the cost of filling one balloon before the price increase. 

Let's denote the original cost of filling one balloon as 'x'. Since the total cost of filling 20 balloons was $900, we can set up the equation:

20x = 900

To find the value of 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 20:

x = 900 / 20
x = 45

So, the original cost of filling one balloon was $45.

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost of filling one balloon is:

New cost = Original cost + Increase
New cost = 45 + 20
New cost = 65

Now, we need to find the total cost of filling 170 balloons at the new rate:

Total cost = New cost per balloon * Number of balloons
Total cost = 65 * 170
Total cost = 11050

The final answer is: 11050"
"To find the average speed of the car during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled at 60 mph for 2 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 60 mph x 2 hours
Distance = 120 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled at 30 mph for 1 hour:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 30 mph x 1 hour
Distance = 30 miles

Now, let's find the total distance traveled:
Total Distance = 120 miles + 30 miles
Total Distance = 150 miles

The total time taken is the sum of the time taken at 60 mph and 30 mph:
Total Time = 2 hours + 1 hour
Total Time = 3 hours

Finally, we can calculate the average speed:
Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
Average Speed = 150 miles / 3 hours
Average Speed = 50 mph

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total value of Jenna's jewels, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires and rubies separately and then add them together.

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. Each sapphire is worth $800, so the total value of her sapphires is 8 * $800 = $6400.

Jenna trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. This means she now has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left. The value of the sapphires she traded is 3 * $800 = $2400.

The value of the 2 rubies she received is 2 * $1200 = $2400.

The total value of her jewels is the sum of the value of the sapphires and the rubies: $6400 + $2400 - $2400 = $6400.

The total value of Jenna's jewels is $6400."
"To find the total number of apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of apples they eat per day and then multiply it by 30.

Marin and Nancy each eat 4 apples a day. So, together they eat 4 + 4 = 8 apples per day.

Now, we multiply the total number of apples they eat per day by 30 to find the total number of apples they eat in 30 days: 8 * 30 = 240.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the total volume of soil needed, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed and then multiply it by the number of beds. 

The volume of one raised bed is calculated as length * width * height. 
Volume = 2 feet * 8 feet * 2 feet = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:
Total Volume = 32 cubic feet/bed * 10 beds = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. To find the number of bags needed, we divide the total volume by the volume of one bag:
Number of bags = Total Volume / Volume per bag = 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet/bag = 160 bags.

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:
Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag = 160 bags * $12/bag = $1920.

The final answer is: $1920"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of green cards first. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:

Number of red cards = 15
60% of 15 = 0.6 * 15 = 9
Number of green cards = 15 + 9 = 24

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards:
Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
= 15 + 24
= 39

To find the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards:
Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
= 15 + 24 + 39
= 78

The final answer is: 78"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies.

After 20 minutes, one of her friends saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the fairies that were there. This means her friend saw 50 / 2 = 25 fairies. So, the total number of fairies now is 50 + 25 = 75.

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. To find the remaining number of fairies, we subtract 30 from 75: 75 - 30 = 45.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the total number of puppies with spots, we need to add the number of puppies with spots from Jennifer's and Brandon's dogs. Jennifer has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon has 4 puppies with spots. So, the total number of puppies with spots is 3 + 4 = 7.

Next, we need to find the total number of puppies. Jennifer has 8 puppies, and Brandon has 12 puppies. So, the total number of puppies is 8 + 12 = 20.

To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we need to divide the total number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiply by 100. 

(7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

The final answer is: 35"
"To find the total weight of the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and add them together.

The farmer buys 2 boxes of sugar cubes, each weighing 1 pound, so the total weight of sugar cubes is 2 * 1 = 2 pounds.

The farmer buys 4 bags of carrots, each weighing 12 pounds, so the total weight of carrots is 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.

The farmer buys 42 bales of hay, each weighing 75 pounds, so the total weight of hay is 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.

The farmer buys 20 sacks of oats, each weighing 65 pounds, so the total weight of oats is 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

The total weight of all the feed is 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3400 pounds.

Since the farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, we need to divide the total weight of the feed by the truck's capacity to find the number of trips needed.

3400 / 2250 = 1.511 (round up to the nearest whole number since we can't make a fraction of a trip)

So, the farmer needs 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To find out how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate the total earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the earnings from aluminum cans. Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans a week. Since an aluminum can is worth 2 cents, her weekly earnings from aluminum cans are 3 * 2 = 6 cents. 

For a four-week month, her earnings from aluminum cans would be 6 * 4 = 24 cents.

Next, let's calculate the earnings from plastic bottles. Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles a week. Since a plastic bottle is worth 3 cents, her weekly earnings from plastic bottles are 5 * 3 = 15 cents.

For a four-week month, her earnings from plastic bottles would be 15 * 4 = 60 cents.

Now, let's add the earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles together. 24 cents (aluminum cans) + 60 cents (plastic bottles) = 84 cents.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the number of plants Shondra has, we first need to determine the number of plants Toni has. Since Frederick has 10 plants and Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, we can calculate Toni's plants as follows:

Toni's plants = Frederick's plants + (60% of Frederick's plants)
Toni's plants = 10 + (0.6 * 10)
Toni's plants = 10 + 6
Toni's plants = 16

Now that we know Toni has 16 plants, we can find the number of plants Shondra has. Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni, so we subtract 7 from Toni's total:

Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
Shondra's plants = 16 - 7
Shondra's plants = 9

"To find out how many students Miss Maria has, we first need to calculate the total number of cards she has. 

She has 6 decks of basketball cards with 25 cards in each deck, so the total number of basketball cards is 6 * 25 = 150.

She has 5 boxes of baseball cards with 40 cards in each box, so the total number of baseball cards is 5 * 40 = 200.

The total number of cards is the sum of basketball and baseball cards, which is 150 + 200 = 350.

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so the remaining cards are 350 - 50 = 300.

If her students got 10 cards each, the number of students can be found by dividing the remaining cards by 10. 

300 / 10 = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples for both of them.

Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each and received a $1 discount. The total cost of the apples for Becky is 20 * 0.45 = $9. Since she received a $1 discount, she paid 9 - 1 = $8.

Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each and received a 10 percent discount. The total cost of the apples for Kelly is 20 * 0.50 = $10. The 10 percent discount is 10% of $10, which is 0.1 * 10 = $1. So, Kelly paid 10 - 1 = $9.

To find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we subtract the amount Becky paid from the amount Kelly paid: 9 - 8 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To find the total number of pieces of laundry, we need to calculate the number of each type of item and then add them together.

Each room has 2 sheets. Since there are 80 rooms, the total number of sheets is 2 * 80 = 160.

Each room has 1 comforter, so the total number of comforters is 80.

Each room has twice as many pillow cases as sheets, which means each room has 2 * 2 = 4 pillow cases. The total number of pillow cases is 4 * 80 = 320.

Each room has twice as many towels as pillow cases, which means each room has 2 * 4 = 8 towels. The total number of towels is 8 * 80 = 640.

Now, let's add up the total number of each type of laundry: 160 (sheets) + 80 (comforters) + 320 (pillow cases) + 640 (towels) = 1200.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of shoes Fireman Frank has at the end of the week. 

First, let's calculate the total number of shoes he gets during the week. He gets 5 pairs on Monday, which is 5 * 2 = 10 shoes. Then, he gets 15 pairs on Wednesday, which is 15 * 2 = 30 shoes. Finally, he gets 30 pairs on Friday, which is 30 * 2 = 60 shoes.

Now, let's add up the total number of shoes he gets: 10 + 30 + 60 = 100 shoes.

Next, we need to add the initial 200 shoes he already had to the total number of shoes he got: 200 + 100 = 300 shoes.

Finally, we need to subtract the 180 shoes he gets rid of on Saturday: 300 - 180 = 120 shoes.

So, Fireman Frank will have 120 shoes on Sunday.

The final answer is: 120"
"To determine the number of pans Mary should bake, we first need to find out how many cupcakes she can decorate with the sprinkles she has. Since each jar of sprinkles can decorate 8 cupcakes and she has 6 jars, the total number of cupcakes she can decorate is 6 jars * 8 cupcakes/jar = 48 cupcakes.

Next, we need to find out how many pans she needs to bake to have at least 48 cupcakes. Since each pan holds 12 cupcakes, we can divide the total number of cupcakes she needs to decorate by the number of cupcakes per pan: 48 cupcakes / 12 cupcakes/pan = 4 pans.

Therefore, Mary should bake 4 pans worth of cupcakes to use up all of her sprinkles.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as 'x'. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, which is x/2. He also gets two extra cookies for cleaning his room. So, the total number of cookies he gets is x/2 + 2.

We are given that Matt wants to eat five cookies in total. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x/2 + 2 = 5.

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. First, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: x/2 = 5 - 2, which simplifies to x/2 = 3.

Next, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction: x = 3 * 2, which simplifies to x = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the combined length of the remoras, we need to convert their individual lengths to feet and then add them together. 

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 6 inches to feet by dividing by 12. 

6 inches / 12 = 0.5 feet

Since there are two remoras, we multiply the length of one remora by 2.

0.5 feet * 2 = 1 foot

Now, we add the length of the remoras to the length of the shark.

10 feet (shark) + 1 foot (remoras) = 11 feet

To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy, we divide the combined length of the remoras by the length of the shark and multiply by 100.

(1 foot / 10 feet) * 100 = 10%

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the total number of students as 'x'. We know that three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer, which means one-fourth do not have a desktop computer. Since 20 students do not have a desktop computer, we can set up the following equation:

1/4 * x = 20

To solve for 'x', we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4 to isolate 'x':

x = 20 * 4
x = 80

So, there are 80 students at that grade level.

"To find out how many days Jason has to break in the shoes, we need to multiply the number of days he has (21 days, since there are 7 days in a week and he has 3 weeks) by the number of days he walks per week (4 days). 

21 days * 4 days/week = 84 days

Since it takes 240 minutes to break in the shoes, we need to divide the total number of days by the number of days he walks per week to find out how many days he has to walk to break in the shoes. However, we actually need to find out how many minutes he has to walk each day.

To find the total number of minutes he has to walk, we multiply the number of days he has to walk by the number of minutes it takes to break in the shoes. 

84 days * 240 minutes/day = 20160 minutes

Now, we need to divide the total number of minutes by the number of days he walks per week to find out how many minutes he has to walk each day.

20160 minutes / 4 days/week = 5040 minutes/week

Since there are 7 days in a week, we need to divide the total number of minutes per week by 7 to find out how many minutes he has to walk each day.

5040 minutes/week / 7 days/week = 720 minutes/week

However, we need to find the daily time, so we divide by 7.

720 minutes/week / 7 days/week = 103.43 minutes/day

"To find out how many books each child got, we need to first determine the total number of books Sarah bought. Since each book costs $15 and she spent $300, we can divide the total amount spent by the cost of each book.

Total amount spent = $300
Cost of each book = $15

Total number of books = Total amount spent / Cost of each book
Total number of books = $300 / $15
Total number of books = 20

Since Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, we can divide the total number of books by 4 to find out how many books each child got.

Number of books per child = Total number of books / 4
Number of books per child = 20 / 4
Number of books per child = 5

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we need to first find the total number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts. We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to do this.

Let's denote:
- D as the set of kids allergic to dairy
- P as the set of kids allergic to peanuts

We know:
- |D| = 9 (number of kids allergic to dairy)
- |P| = 6 (number of kids allergic to peanuts)
- |D ∩ P| = 3 (number of kids allergic to both)

Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we can find the total number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts as:
|D ∪ P| = |D| + |P| - |D ∩ P|
|D ∪ P| = 9 + 6 - 3
|D ∪ P| = 12

Now, to find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we subtract the total number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts from the total number of kids in the class:
|D ∪ P| = 12
Total kids in the class = 32
Kids not allergic to anything = Total kids in the class - |D ∪ P|
Kids not allergic to anything = 32 - 12
Kids not allergic to anything = 20

"To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we first need to determine the weight of the 2010 penny. 

Since the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can calculate its weight by multiplying the weight of the 1959 penny by 3/4.

Weight of 1959 penny = 48 grains
Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * 48 grains
Weight of 2010 penny = 36 grains

Now, we can find the combined weight of the two pennies by adding their individual weights.

Combined weight = Weight of 1959 penny + Weight of 2010 penny
Combined weight = 48 grains + 36 grains
Combined weight = 84 grains

"To find out how many hours James runs a week, we need to calculate the total miles he runs in a week and then divide that by his speed.

First, let's find the total miles James runs in a week. He runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week, so:

Total miles per week = 12 miles/day * 5 days/week = 60 miles/week

Now, we know James runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour. To find the total hours he runs in a week, we can divide the total miles by his speed:

Total hours per week = Total miles per week / Speed = 60 miles/week / 10 miles/hour = 6 hours/week

So, James runs 6 hours a week.

"To determine the total amount of oats needed, we need to calculate the daily consumption of oats by the horses and then multiply it by the number of days.

Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and there are two meals per day. So, the daily consumption per horse is 5 pounds/meal * 2 meals = 10 pounds/day.

Since Uncle Ben has four horses, the total daily consumption is 10 pounds/day * 4 horses = 40 pounds/day.

For five days, the total consumption would be 40 pounds/day * 5 days = 200 pounds.

Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats. To find out how many bags are needed, we divide the total consumption by the weight of each bag: 200 pounds / 50 pounds/bag = 4 bags.

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days.

"To find the total amount Sally spent, we need to calculate the cost of the family-size pizza first. Since it costs 3 times as much as the small pizza, we multiply the cost of the small pizza by 3.

Cost of small pizza: $8
Cost of family-size pizza: $8 * 3 = $24

Now, we add the cost of the small pizza and the family-size pizza to find the total amount spent.

Total cost = Cost of small pizza + Cost of family-size pizza
Total cost = $8 + $24
Total cost = $32

The final answer is: $32"
"To find the cost per individual razor after the discount, we need to calculate the total cost of 2 packs of razors with the sale and coupon applied.

First, let's calculate the cost of 2 packs of razors at the sale price. Since it's buy one get one free, Heather will only pay for 1 pack. The cost of 1 pack is $4.00. 

Now, let's apply the $2.00 coupon to the cost of 1 pack. The new cost is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since Heather buys 2 packs, but only pays for 1 pack, the total cost is $2.00.

Now, let's find the total number of razors in 2 packs. 2 packs * 4 razors per pack = 8 razors.

To find the cost per individual razor, we divide the total cost by the total number of razors. $2.00 * 100 cents/dollar = 200 cents. 

200 cents / 8 razors = 25 cents per razor.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the total height of the human pyramid, we need to calculate the height of each level and add them up.

The 4 girls on the bottom are 64"" tall each. 
4 * 64"" = 256""

The 3 girls on top of the 4 are also 64"" tall each. 
3 * 64"" = 192""

The 2 girls on top of the 3 are also 64"" tall each. 
2 * 64"" = 128""

The shortest girl at the top is 60"" tall.

Now, we add up the heights of all the levels:
256"" + 192"" + 128"" + 60"" = 636""

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches):
636"" / 12 = 53 feet

The final answer is: 53"
"To find the total number of minutes Charisma walked, we need to calculate the total number of 5-minute breaks she took in a day and then multiply it by the number of days she worked.

Charisma works 8 hours a day and takes a 5-minute break every hour. So, she takes 8 breaks per day. 

8 breaks per day * 5 minutes per break = 40 minutes per day

Since Charisma worked for 5 days, we multiply the daily breaks by the number of days:

40 minutes per day * 5 days = 200 minutes

The final answer is: 200"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine Brett's age in four years. Since Brett is 14 years old now, in four years, he will be 14 + 4 = 18 years old.

According to the problem, in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. Since Brett is 14 years old now, three times his current age is 3 * 14 = 42 years old.

Since Angela will be 42 years old in four years, we need to subtract 4 from 42 to find her current age. Angela's current age is 42 - 4 = 38 years old.

The final answer is: 38"
"To find the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car, we need to calculate the cost of the morning rides and the cost of the afternoon rides separately, and then add them together.

The cost of the morning rides is the cost per ride multiplied by the number of rides. Since Paul drives twice a day for 14 days, he drives a total of 2 * 14 = 28 rides in the morning. The cost per ride is $6, so the total cost of the morning rides is 28 * $6 = $168.

The cost of the afternoon rides is also the cost per ride multiplied by the number of rides. Since Paul drives twice a day for 14 days, he drives a total of 2 * 14 = 28 rides in the afternoon. The cost per ride is $2, so the total cost of the afternoon rides is 28 * $2 = $56.

To find the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car, we add the cost of the morning rides and the cost of the afternoon rides: $168 + $56 = $224.

The final answer is: $224"
"To find out how many Greek orange pies Brianne and Ashley can make, we need to calculate the total number of oranges they have and then divide that by the number of oranges needed for one pie.

Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so she has 5 * 10 = 50 oranges.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so she has 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

In total, they have 50 + 70 = 120 oranges.

Since one Greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, the number of pies they can make is 120 / 3 = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation for each venue and then equate them to find the break-even point.

Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'.

For the first venue, the total cost is the flat fee of $200 plus the cost of food for each guest, which is $5x. So, the total cost for the first venue is:

Cost1 = 200 + 5x

For the second venue, the total cost is the cost per guest, which is $25, multiplied by the number of guests, x. So, the total cost for the second venue is:

Cost2 = 25x

Since we want to find the break-even point, we set the two costs equal to each other:

200 + 5x = 25x

Now, we can solve for x:

200 = 25x - 5x
200 = 20x
x = 200 / 20
x = 10

So, Mark needs 10 guests for the two venues to be equal in cost.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we can start by assigning variables to the unknowns. Let's say David found 'D' insects, Bodhi found 'B' insects, and Lily found 'L' insects.

We know that Lily found 7 more than David, so we can write an equation: L = D + 7.

We also know that David found half of what Bodhi found, so we can write another equation: D = B/2.

We are also given that together they collected 43 insects, so the total number of insects is the sum of what each of them found: L + D + B = 43.

Now we can substitute the first equation into the total equation: (D + 7) + D + B = 43.

Combine like terms: 2D + B + 7 = 43.

Subtract 7 from both sides: 2D + B = 36.

Now we can substitute the second equation into this one: 2(D) + B = 36, and since D = B/2, we can substitute D with B/2: 2(B/2) + B = 36.

Simplify the equation: B + B = 36.

Combine like terms: 2B = 36.

Divide both sides by 2: B = 18.

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find out how many David found: D = B/2 = 18/2 = 9.

Finally, we can find out how many Lily found: L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total yards of yarn used, we need to calculate the yards used by Mariah and her grandma separately and then add them together.

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, and there are 364 yards in a skein. To find 1/4 of 364, we multiply 364 by 1/4 (which is the same as dividing by 4).

364 yards / 4 = 91 yards

So, Mariah used 91 yards of yarn.

Mariah's grandma used 1/2 of a skein, which is the same as 2/4. To find 2/4 of 364, we multiply 364 by 2 and then divide by 4.

364 * 2 = 728
728 / 4 = 182 yards

So, Mariah's grandma used 182 yards of yarn.

Now, we add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma together.

91 yards (Mariah) + 182 yards (grandma) = 273 yards

The final answer is: 273"
"To find the total number of gifts Cherrie bought, we need to calculate the total number of gifts her friends want and then add the 10 random gifts she bought.

First, let's calculate the total number of gifts her friends want. 2 friends want 5 gifts each, so that's 2 x 5 = 10 gifts. The other 3 friends want 2 gifts each, so that's 3 x 2 = 6 gifts. 

Now, let's add the number of gifts the 2 friends want and the number of gifts the other 3 friends want: 10 + 6 = 16 gifts.

Finally, we add the 10 random gifts Cherrie bought: 16 + 10 = 26.

The final answer is: 26"
"To find the length of the couch, we first need to determine the width of the rug. Since the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, and the chair is 3 feet wide, the rug's width is 3 + 5 = 8 feet.

The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Twice the width of the rug is 2 * 8 = 16 feet. Adding 2 feet to this gives us the length of the couch: 16 + 2 = 18 feet.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the cost of each pack of strawberry gum, we need to first determine the total cost of the grape and green apple gum. 

The cost of the grape gum is $2. The green apple gum cost half as much as the grape gum, so it is $2 / 2 = $1. 

The total cost of the grape and green apple gum is $2 + $1 = $3. 

Since Suzie bought four packs of gum in total and two of them were strawberry, the total cost of the strawberry gum is $7 - $3 = $4. 

Since there are two packs of strawberry gum, the cost of each pack is $4 / 2 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to determine which type of wood gives him the most sticks per dollar spent. 

First, let's calculate the cost per stick for each type of wood:

For a 2 x 4, Frederick can get 200 sticks for $4. 
Cost per stick = $4 / 200 sticks = $0.02 per stick

For a 2 x 8, Frederick can get 400 sticks for $6.
Cost per stick = $6 / 400 sticks = $0.015 per stick

Since the 2 x 8 costs less per stick, we should prioritize buying 2 x 8 lumber. 

Now, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces Frederick can buy with his $24:

Number of 2 x 8 pieces = $24 / $6 = 4

Since each 2 x 8 piece gives 400 sticks, the total number of sticks Frederick can make is:

Total sticks = 4 * 400 = 1600

The final answer is: 1600"
"To find the total cost of snowshoes for Mario's dogs, we first need to determine the total number of snowshoes required. Since each dog has 4 legs and Mario has 6 dogs, the total number of legs is 6 * 4 = 24.

Since each dog needs a pair of snowshoes, and each pair covers 4 legs, we need to divide the total number of legs by 4 to get the total number of pairs of snowshoes required. However, since each dog needs a pair, we simply need to multiply the number of dogs by 2 (one pair per dog).

So, the total number of pairs of snowshoes required is 6 * 2 = 12.

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of pairs of snowshoes by the cost per pair. The cost per pair is $12.00.

Total cost = 12 * $12.00 = $144.00

The final answer is: $144.00"
"To find out how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips for a week and then subtract the cost of the weekly pass.

Janet takes two bus trips per day, five days a week. So, the total number of bus trips per week is 2 * 5 = 10.

Each bus trip costs $2.20, so the total cost of her bus trips for a week is 10 * $2.20 = $22.

The weekly bus pass costs $20. To find out how much Janet would save, we subtract the cost of the pass from the total cost of her bus trips: $22 - $20 = $2.

Therefore, Janet would save $2 by buying a weekly bus pass.

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of cows and sheep at both the farm and the zoo, and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of cows at the zoo. We know the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, and the farm has 30 cows. So, the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.

Next, let's find the number of sheep at the farm. We know the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does. Since the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's find the total number of animals at the farm. The farm has 30 cows and 10 sheep, so the total number of animals at the farm is 30 + 10 = 40.

The total number of animals at the zoo is 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80.

Finally, let's add the total number of animals at the farm and the zoo together: 40 + 80 = 120.

The final answer is: 120"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many items Sophia bought. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of items Sophia bought, we can represent the number of items Sophia bought as 'x'. 

Rose bought 4 times the number of items Sophia bought, so the total number of items Rose bought is 4x. We know that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, so the total number of items Rose bought is 12 + 4 = 16. 

Since Rose bought 4 times the number of items Sophia bought, we can set up the equation 4x = 16. To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 4, which gives us x = 4.

Now that we know Sophia bought 4 items, we can find the total number of items Sophia bought by adding the number of onions and potatoes she bought. However, we don't know the exact number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought. We only know that the total number of items she bought is 4.

To find the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we need to find the ratio of onions to potatoes that Rose bought. Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, so the ratio of onions to potatoes is 12:4 or 3:1. 

Since Sophia bought 4 items, and the ratio of onions to potatoes is 3:1, we can assume that Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato. 

The total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is 3 + 1 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To determine the calorie deficit Andy needs each day, we first need to calculate the total number of days he has to reach his goal. 

Since Andy's birthday is on July 19th and today is December 31st, we can calculate the number of days as follows:

December has 31 days, January has 31 days, February has 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year), March has 31 days, April has 30 days, May has 31 days, June has 30 days, and July has 19 days. 

Total days = 31 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 211 days

Now, we know that Andy wants to lose 30 pounds and that he needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound. 

Total calories to burn = 30 pounds * 3500 calories/pound = 105,000 calories

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories to burn by the number of days:

Daily calorie deficit = Total calories to burn / Total days
= 105,000 calories / 211 days
= approximately 497 calories per day

So, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of approximately 497 calories to reach his goal. 

The final answer is: 497"
"To find out how much Gerald has left, we need to calculate his total earnings for the week and then subtract the amount he spent.

Since Gerald works for a week, which has 7 days, and he earns $30 per day, we can calculate his total earnings as follows:

Total earnings = Daily earnings * Number of days
Total earnings = $30 * 7
Total earnings = $210

Now, we subtract the amount he spent from his total earnings to find out how much he has left:

Amount left = Total earnings - Amount spent
Amount left = $210 - $100
Amount left = $110

The final answer is: $110"
"To find out how many milliliters of water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total distance she will run. Since each lap is 0.25 km and she needs to run 8 laps, we multiply the number of laps by the distance per lap.

Distance = Number of laps * Distance per lap
Distance = 8 * 0.25 km
Distance = 2 km

Since Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs, we multiply the total distance by the amount of water needed per kilometer.

Total water needed = Distance * Water per kilometer
Total water needed = 2 km * 60 ml/km
Total water needed = 120 ml

"To find out how much money Julie had left, we need to calculate the amount she spent on clothes and CDs, and then subtract that from the initial amount.

First, let's calculate the amount she spent on clothes: 20% of $500 is 0.20 x $500 = $100.

Now, let's subtract the amount spent on clothes from the initial amount: $500 - $100 = $400.

Next, let's calculate the amount she spent on CDs: 25% of $400 is 0.25 x $400 = $100.

Now, let's subtract the amount spent on CDs from the remaining amount: $400 - $100 = $300.

The final answer is: $300"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let's denote the cost of the lot as 'x'. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write the equation: x + 3x = 120,000.

Combining like terms, we get 4x = 120,000.

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 4: x = 120,000 / 4 = 30,000.

Since the cost of the house is 3x, we multiply x by 3: 3 * 30,000 = 90,000.

The house cost $90,000.

The final answer is: $90,000"
"To find the profit, we first need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

The total cost is the cost of the canvas bags, which is 8 packs * 5 bags per pack * $4 per bag = 8 * 5 * 4 = $160.

The total revenue is the selling price of the bags, which is 8 bags * $8 per bag = 8 * 8 = $64.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $64 - $160 = -$96.

However, since profit cannot be negative, it seems there's an error in the problem. The selling price of $8 per bag is lower than the cost price of $4 per bag, which is not possible. 

Assuming the selling price is higher than the cost price, let's recalculate the profit. 

The total cost is still $160. 

Let's assume the selling price is x. The total revenue is 8 * x = 8x.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is 8x - 160.

To find the minimum selling price, we set the profit to 0 and solve for x: 8x - 160 = 0, 8x = 160, x = 20.

So, the minimum selling price should be at least $20 per bag to make a profit.

However, since the problem asks for the profit, we need to find the maximum possible profit. 

Let's assume the selling price is $8 per bag, which is not possible as we've already established. 

However, if we assume the selling price is higher than $20, let's say $25 per bag, the total revenue is 8 * 25 = $200.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $200 - $160 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find the total number of punches Joe threw, we need to calculate the total time of the fight and multiply it by the average punches thrown per minute.

The fight lasts for 5 rounds of 3 minutes each, so the total time is 5 * 3 = 15 minutes.

"To find out how many cookies Kelsie made, we need to first determine how many cookies Josh made. Since Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, and Suzanne made 36 cookies, we can calculate Josh's cookies as follows:

Josh's cookies = Suzanne's cookies / 4
Josh's cookies = 36 / 4
Josh's cookies = 9

Now that we know Josh made 9 cookies, we can find out how many Kelsie made. Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh, so we can calculate Kelsie's cookies as follows:

Kelsie's cookies = 2 * Josh's cookies
Kelsie's cookies = 2 * 9
Kelsie's cookies = 18

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total amount of money Ali has. 

Ali has four $10 bills, which is 4 * $10 = $40. 
He also has six $20 bills, which is 6 * $20 = $120. 
The total amount of money Ali has is $40 + $120 = $160.

Ali gives his sister half of the total money, which is $160 / 2 = $80. 
So, he is left with $160 - $80 = $80.

Now, Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount to buy dinner. 
3/5 of $80 is (3/5) * $80 = $48.

To find the amount of money Ali has after buying dinner, we subtract the amount he spent from the remaining amount: 
$80 - $48 = $32.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it takes Rob to shingle a house in minutes. Since Rob takes 2 hours, we need to convert this to minutes. 

1 hour = 60 minutes
2 hours = 2 * 60 = 120 minutes

Now, we know that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time it takes Rob. Let's first find out what double the time it takes Rob is. 

Double the time it takes Rob = 2 * 120 = 240 minutes

Now, we add 40 minutes to this to find out how long it takes Royce.

"To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we first need to determine how many cups of raisins she has available for the oatmeal cookies. 

Since she divides the raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, we can divide the total number of cups of raisins by 3. 

Total cups of raisins = 27
Cups of raisins for oatmeal cookies = Total cups of raisins / 3
Cups of raisins for oatmeal cookies = 27 / 3
Cups of raisins for oatmeal cookies = 9

Now, we need to find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make with 9 cups of raisins. Each batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins. 

Number of batches = Cups of raisins for oatmeal cookies / Cups of raisins per batch
Number of batches = 9 / (3/4)
To divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal.
Number of batches = 9 * (4/3)
Number of batches = 12

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we first need to calculate her daily and weekly electric consumption before and after adding the new device.

Before adding the new device, Ada's daily electric consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. Since there are 24 hours in a day, her daily consumption is 12 * 24 = 288 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per day.

After adding the new device, her daily consumption will be 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour. So, her daily consumption will be 14 * 24 = 336 kWh per day.

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7. 

Before adding the new device, Ada's weekly consumption is 288 * 7 = 2016 kWh.
After adding the new device, her weekly consumption is 336 * 7 = 2352 kWh.

The cost of electricity is $1.50 per kWh. So, the weekly cost before adding the new device is 2016 * $1.50 = $3024.
The weekly cost after adding the new device is 2352 * $1.50 = $3540.

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is $3540 - $3024 = $516.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how long it would take one person to paint a whole house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take them twice as long to paint a whole house, which is 10 days.

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can calculate the total hours it would take one person to paint a whole house by multiplying the number of days by 24:

10 days * 24 hours/day = 240 hours

Now, if 5 people are painting a whole house, we can divide the total hours it would take one person to paint a whole house by the number of people:

240 hours / 5 people = 48 hours

So, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

1. Ophelia has 20 sofas.
2. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so she has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.
4. Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Now, let's calculate the total number of sofas and chairs they have:

Ophelia has 20 sofas and 22 chairs.
Jenna has 64 sofas and 66 chairs.

Total number of sofas = 20 + 64 = 84
Total number of chairs = 22 + 66 = 88

The total number of sofas and chairs is 84 + 88 = 172."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money Tom spent on the headphone set. We know that Tom spent a total of $48 and the CD cost $4. 

Let's subtract the cost of the CD from the total amount spent to find the cost of the headphone set: 
$48 (total spent) - $4 (cost of CD) = $44 (cost of headphone set)

Now, we know that Tom spent $44 on the headphone set. If he had not bought the headphone set, he would have had $44 more to spend on CDs. 

Since each CD costs $4, we can divide the amount he would have had to spend on CDs ($44) by the cost of one CD ($4) to find out how many more CDs he could have bought:
$44 / $4 = 11

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we need to consider the weeks where he spent 4 hours, 5 hours, and 6 hours. 

First, let's find the total hours spent in the weeks where he spent 4 hours each. There are 6 weeks where he spent 4 hours, so the total hours spent in these weeks is 6 * 4 = 24 hours.

Next, let's find the total hours spent in the weeks where he spent 5 hours each. There are 2 weeks where he spent 5 hours, so the total hours spent in these weeks is 2 * 5 = 10 hours.

Finally, let's find the total hours spent in the week where he spent 6 hours. There is 1 week where he spent 6 hours, so the total hours spent in this week is 1 * 6 = 6 hours.

Now, let's add up the total hours spent in all the weeks: 24 + 10 + 6 = 40 hours.

The total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is 40."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off. So, the number of people left on the bus is 48 - 8 = 40.

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (which is 8) get into the bus. So, 5 * 8 = 40 people get in. Now, the total number of people on the bus is 40 (who were already there) + 40 (who got in) = 80.

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off. So, the number of people left on the bus is 80 - 21 = 59.

Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on. Since 21 got off, 3 times fewer would be 21 / 3 = 7. So, 7 people get in. Now, the total number of people on the bus is 59 (who were already there) + 7 (who got in) = 66.

The final number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop is 66."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, so his current age is 27 - 5 = 22 years.
2. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. 
   Jame's age in 8 years will be 22 + 8 = 30 years.
   Twice Jame's age in 8 years will be 2 * 30 = 60 years.
   So, Jame's cousin's age in 8 years will be 60 - 5 = 55 years.
3. Since Jame's cousin will be 55 in 8 years, his current age is 55 - 8 = 47 years.

Now, let's find the difference in their current ages: 47 (cousin's age) - 22 (Jame's age) = 25 years.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the cost of one monitor, we first need to determine the cost of the printer. Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, and the computer cost $1,100, the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700.

The total cost of the computer and the printer is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800. 

Since Errol bought 2 monitors, we need to subtract the cost of the computer and the printer from the total cost to find the cost of the 2 monitors. The total cost was $2,400, so the cost of the 2 monitors is $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.

To find the cost of one monitor, we divide the cost of the 2 monitors by 2: $600 / 2 = $300.

The final answer is: $300"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many shells the boys brought in total. Since there are 10 boys (half of 20 kids) and each brought 60 shells, the total number of shells brought by the boys is 10 * 60 = 600.

Now, we know that the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 600 + 4 * 60 shells.

First, we calculate 4 times the number of shells brought by the boys: 4 * 60 = 240.

Then, we add this to the number of shells brought by the boys: 600 + 240 = 840.

Since there are 10 girls (half of 20 kids), we need to find out how many shells each girl brought. To do this, we divide the total number of shells brought by the girls by the number of girls: 840 / 10 = 84.

The final answer is: 84"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many candies George had before he ate 5. Since he has 3 candies left, we can add the 5 candies he ate to find the total number of candies he had initially.

Initial candies George had = 3 (left) + 5 (eaten) = 8

Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, we can multiply the number of candies George had by 2 to find the number of candies Nick has.

Initial candies Nick had = 2 * 8 = 16

"To find Anne's age, we first need to determine Alyana's age. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, we can calculate Alyana's age by subtracting 4 from Chenny's age.

Alyana's age = Chenny's age - 4
Alyana's age = 10 - 4
Alyana's age = 6

Now that we know Alyana's age, we can find Anne's age by adding 2 to Alyana's age.

Anne's age = Alyana's age + 2
Anne's age = 6 + 2
Anne's age = 8

"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book and then add them together.

The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 * 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add the thickness of all four books together: 
31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188

The final answer is: 188"
"To find out how many vlogs Emma needs to make to complete 72 vlogs per month, we first need to calculate the total number of vlogs she has already made. 

In the first week, Emma made 18 vlogs. 
In the second week, Emma made 21 vlogs. 
In the third week, Emma made 15 vlogs.

Total vlogs made so far = 18 + 21 + 15 = 54

Since Emma aims to make 72 vlogs per month, we subtract the total vlogs made so far from the target to find out how many more vlogs she needs to make.

Vlogs needed to be made = 72 - 54 = 18

Therefore, Emma should make 18 more vlogs to complete her target of 72 vlogs per month."
"To find the total amount you paid, we need to calculate the 20% tip and add it to the original bill.

First, let's find 20% of the $50 dinner bill. To do this, we multiply $50 by 0.20 (which is the decimal equivalent of 20%).

$50 * 0.20 = $10

Now, we add the tip to the original bill:

$50 (bill) + $10 (tip) = $60

So, you ended up paying $60.

The final answer is: $60"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much money the eldest boy initially received. Since $18 is shared among 3 boys, we divide $18 by 3 to find the initial share of the eldest boy.

Initial share of the eldest boy = $18 / 3 = $6

The eldest boy added $5 to his share, so his new total is:

$6 + $5 = $11

The following day, he added another $10, making his total:

$11 + $10 = $21

However, he then spent $8, leaving him with:

$21 - $8 = $13

After saving some more, he tripled the amount he had left after spending the $8. To find the amount he had left after saving, we need to divide the final amount by 3.

Let's denote the amount he saved as 'x'. So, the equation becomes:

$13 + x = 3 * $13

Simplifying the equation:

$13 + x = $39

Subtracting $13 from both sides:

x = $26

Now, we add the amount he saved to the amount he had left after spending $8:

$13 + $26 = $39

So, the eldest boy now has $39."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much Elvis needs to save in the first half of the month. 

Let's assume the number of days in the first half of the month is x. Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half, the number of days in the second half is also x.

The total number of days in the month is 30 (April has 30 days). So, the total number of days in the first half is 15 (half of 30).

Now, let's denote the amount Elvis saves in the first half as y. Then, the amount he saves in the second half is 2y.

The total amount Elvis needs to save in the month is $1125. So, we can set up the equation:

y + 2y = 1125

Combine like terms:

3y = 1125

Divide both sides by 3:

y = 375

Now that we know Elvis saves $375 in the first half, we can find out how much he needs to save in the second half. Since he saves twice as much in the second half, the amount he saves in the second half is 2y = 2 * 375 = 750.

The cost of 5 oranges at $0.80 each is 5 x $0.80 = $4.
The cost of 6 peaches at $0.75 each is 6 x $0.75 = $4.50.

Now, let's add the costs together: $4.50 + $4 + $4.50 = $13.

Since Verna gave $20, the change she received is $20 - $13 = $7.

The final answer is: $7"
"To find out how much more Jairus will get than Jenny, we need to calculate the total amount each of them will receive and then find the difference.

Jairus gets $0.8 for each task, and he finished 20 tasks. So, his total earnings will be 0.8 * 20 = $16.

Jenny gets $0.5 for each task, and she also finished 20 tasks. So, her total earnings will be 0.5 * 20 = $10.

Now, let's find the difference between Jairus' and Jenny's earnings: 16 - 10 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let's represent the amount of money Brad gets as 'x'. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff's amount can be represented as 4x.

We know that the total amount of money they are dividing is $100. So, the sum of the money Jeff and Brad get should equal $100. We can write this as an equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms:

5x = 100

Now, divide both sides by 5 to solve for x:

x = 20

Since x represents the amount Brad gets, and Jeff gets 4 times as much, we can multiply x by 4 to find Jeff's amount:

Jeff's amount = 4x = 4 * 20 = 80

The final answer is: $80"
"To find the total miles Jeff walks in a week, we need to calculate the total miles he walks each day and then multiply it by the number of days he works in a week.

Since Jeff walks to work and back each day, the total miles he walks each day is 2 times the distance to work, which is 2 * 3 miles = 6 miles.

Now, we multiply the daily miles by the number of days he works in a week: 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Elise writes the alphabet in full twice, which means she writes 26 letters each time. So, she writes 26 * 2 = 52 letters.

2. Then, she writes half of the alphabet once. Half of the alphabet is 26 / 2 = 13 letters.

3. So, she writes 13 letters.

4. Now, she re-writes everything she has already written. This means she re-writes 52 + 13 = 65 letters.

5. To find the total number of letters Elise has written, we add the letters from the first two steps (52 + 13) and the letters from the last step (65). 

Total letters = 52 + 13 + 65 = 130

"This problem can be solved using a geometric progression. In the first round, 3 families are notified directly by Ali. In the second round, each of the 3 families notifies 3 other families, resulting in 3 * 3 = 9 new families notified. 

In the third round, each of the 9 families notifies 3 other families, resulting in 9 * 3 = 27 new families notified. 

In the fourth round, each of the 27 families notifies 3 other families, resulting in 27 * 3 = 81 new families notified.

The total number of families notified in the fourth round is 81."
"To find Mark's initial weight, we need to calculate the total weight he lost and then add that to his final weight.

Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, so the total weight he lost is 10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds.

Since Mark's final weight is 70 pounds, we can find his initial weight by adding the weight he lost to his final weight: 70 pounds (final weight) + 30 pounds (weight lost) = 100 pounds.

The final answer is: 100"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many toys Jonathan needs to have a play set five times larger than James's. Since James's play set has 80 toys, a play set five times larger would have 5 * 80 = 400 toys.

Since Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have enough toys to make a play set five times larger than James's, we can set up an equation: x + 2 = 400, where x is the number of toys Jonathan currently has.

To find x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 2 from both sides: x = 400 - 2.

x = 398

So, Jonathan currently has 398 toys."
"To find the total cost of the items Daniel wants to buy, we first need to calculate the cost of each item before the discount. 

The cost of 5 notebooks at $1.50 each is 5 * $1.50 = $7.50.
The cost of 2 pens at $0.25 each is 2 * $0.25 = $0.50.
The cost of 1 calculator at $12 is $12.
The cost of 1 geometry set at $10 is $10.

The total cost before the discount is $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30.

Since the shop gives a 10% discount on all the purchased items, we need to calculate 10% of $30.
10% of $30 is 0.1 * $30 = $3.

The total cost after the discount is $30 - $3 = $27.

Therefore, Daniel has to spend $27 on all the items he wants to buy.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of bottles Bill needs for his party. He has 70 guests and wants 2 bottles of water for each guest:

70 guests * 2 bottles/guest = 140 bottles

Now, we subtract the number of bottles Bill already has from the total number of bottles he needs:

140 bottles (needed) - 48 bottles (already has) = 92 bottles

So, Bill needs to buy 92 additional bottles of water.

The final answer is: 92"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. 

When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as in cold water. Since it takes Ray 16 minutes to swim a mile in cold water, twice that time is 2 * 16 = 32 minutes. Adding 2 minutes to that gives us 32 + 2 = 34 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water. 

In cold water, it takes Ray 16 minutes to swim a mile, so for 3 miles it would be 3 * 16 = 48 minutes.

In warm water, it takes Ray 34 minutes to swim a mile, so for 3 miles it would be 3 * 34 = 102 minutes.

The difference in time between swimming 3 miles in warm water and cold water is 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

There are 7 buttons with two holes. Since each of these buttons has 2 holes, the total number of holes in these buttons is 7 * 2 = 14.

The rest of the buttons have four holes. Since there are 21 buttons in total and 7 have two holes, the number of buttons with four holes is 21 - 7 = 14.

Each of these buttons has 4 holes, so the total number of holes in these buttons is 14 * 4 = 56.

The total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is 14 + 56 = 70.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many cups of coffee Juan currently drinks. Since Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks, and Octavia drinks half the daily recommended amount, we need to find the daily recommended amount first.

Let's assume the daily recommended amount is x cups. Since Octavia drinks half of this, she drinks x/2 cups. Since Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks, Juan drinks 10 * (x/2) = 5x cups.

We are given that the daily recommended amount is 4 cups. So, we can set up the equation 5x = 4 to find the value of x.

However, this equation doesn't make sense because 5x cannot equal 4. This is because the daily recommended amount is 4 cups, and Juan drinks 5 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks, who drinks half the daily recommended amount. This means Juan drinks 5 times the daily recommended amount, not 5x.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. If the daily recommended amount is 4 cups, and Octavia drinks half of this, she drinks 4/2 = 2 cups. Since Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks, Juan drinks 10 * 2 = 20 cups.

To find out how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we subtract the recommended amount from his current intake: 20 - 4 = 16.

"To find the average weight of the three friends, we first need to determine their individual weights. 

Mark's weight is given as 150 pounds. 
Susan's weight is 20 pounds less than Mark's, so Susan's weight is 150 - 20 = 130 pounds. 
Bob's weight is twice as much as Susan's, so Bob's weight is 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, we can find the average weight by adding the weights of all three friends and dividing by 3. 
Average weight = (Mark's weight + Susan's weight + Bob's weight) / 3 
Average weight = (150 + 130 + 260) / 3 
Average weight = 540 / 3 
Average weight = 180

"To solve this problem, we need to find the total angle the sun will be from the ground after 10 hours. 

The initial angle of the pyramid from the ground is 32 degrees. The sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, so its initial angle from the ground is 0 degrees (since it's directly above the pyramid). 

The sun moves 5 degrees per hour, so after 10 hours, it will move 5 * 10 = 50 degrees.

However, since the sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, we need to add the initial angle of the pyramid to the angle the sun moves. 

So, the total angle from the ground to the sun will be 32 (initial angle of the pyramid) + 50 (angle the sun moves) = 82 degrees.

"To find out how many packs of candles James needs to buy, we first need to determine the total number of candles required. Since James has two sons, one 12 years old and the other 4 years younger, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Typically, birthday candles are used in the number equal to the age of the person. Therefore, James needs 12 candles for the older son and 8 candles for the younger son, totaling 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we need to find out how many packs James needs to buy. To do this, we divide the total number of candles needed (20) by the number of candles in a pack (5). 

20 / 5 = 4

So, James needs to buy 4 packs of candles. 

The cost of 4 packs of candles is 4 * $3 = $12.

"To find out how many pages Judy read in the first week, we need to calculate the total minutes she read in the first week and then convert that to pages. 

In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night. Since there are 7 nights in a week, she read for a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes in the first week.

Given that Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we can find out how many pages she read in the first week by first finding out how many 1.5 minute intervals are in 105 minutes. 

To do this, we divide 105 by 1.5, which equals 70. So, in the first week, Judy read 70 * 2 = 140 pages.

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

To find the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we add the pages she read in the first week to the pages she read in the second week: 140 + 100 = 240.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. The tooth fairy left $5.00 for the first tooth.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave $1.00 each, so that's 3 x $1.00 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave half the amount of money per tooth as Sharon had received for each of the previous three teeth. Since she received $1.00 for each of the previous three teeth, half of that is $0.50. So, for the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave 2 x $0.50 = $1.00.
4. Now, let's add up the total amount of money the tooth fairy left: $5.00 (for the first tooth) + $3.00 (for the next three teeth) + $1.00 (for the last two teeth) = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"To find the total number of goals scored by the three teenagers, we need to find the number of goals scored by Mark and Anna, and then add them to Richie's score.

We know that Richie scored 80 goals, and he scored 45 more goals than Anna. So, we can set up an equation to find Anna's score:

Richie's score = Anna's score + 45
80 = Anna's score + 45
Anna's score = 80 - 45
Anna's score = 35

Now, we know that Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark. So, we can set up another equation to find Mark's score:

Richie's score = Mark's score + 20
80 = Mark's score + 20
Mark's score = 80 - 20
Mark's score = 60

Now that we have the scores for all three teenagers, we can add them up to find the total number of goals scored:

Total goals = Richie's score + Mark's score + Anna's score
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35
Total goals = 175

The final answer is: 175"
"To find out how much more money Mitchell made than Liam, we need to first calculate the total amount of money each of them made. 

Liam made $63 in total. 

Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 apiece, so we multiply the number of lemonades by the price per lemonade: 21 * 4 = 84. 

Now, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings to find the difference: 84 - 63 = 21.

The final answer is: $21"
"To find the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate the number of action figures he bought each day and then add them up.

From Sunday to Wednesday, Peter spent $5 each day on wooden action figures. Since he spent a total of 4 days, the total amount spent on wooden action figures is 4 * $5 = $20. 

Since Peter has $70 and spent $20 on wooden action figures, he has $70 - $20 = $50 left. 

From Thursday to Saturday, Peter will spend $2 each day on plastic action figures. Since he has $50 left and there are 3 days remaining, the total amount spent on plastic action figures is 3 * $2 = $6. 

However, Peter still has $50 - $6 = $44 left after buying plastic action figures for 3 days. 

Since Peter spent $5 each day on wooden action figures, he bought  $20 / $5 = 4 wooden action figures. 

Since Peter spent $2 each day on plastic action figures, he bought $6 / $2 = 3 plastic action figures.

The total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is 4 (wooden) + 3 (plastic) = 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"To calculate the total cost of the kitten, we need to add up the cost of spaying, vaccines, and the broken vases.

The cost of spaying is $200.
The cost of 3 vaccines is 3 x $20 = $60.
The cost of 4 vases is 4 x $12 = $48.

Now, let's add up the costs: $200 (spaying) + $60 (vaccines) + $48 (vases) = $308.

The final answer is: $308"
"To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we first need to calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week and then per month.

The total number of roses ordered per week is 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered per month is 65 * 4 = 260 roses.

Ford grows 40 roses every week, so the total number of roses he grows per month is 40 * 4 = 160 roses.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the total number of roses he grows per month from the total number of roses ordered per month: 260 - 160 = 100.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how much money will be remaining in Katina's account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount of money she will have removed from the account and subtract it from the initial amount.

There are 12 months in a year, so in 2 years, there are 2 x 12 = 24 months.

Katina removes $100 from the account every month, so the total amount removed in 24 months is 24 x $100 = $2400.

Now, we subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount in the account: $3000 - $2400 = $600.

So, after 2 years, Katina will have $600 remaining in her account.

The final answer is: $600"
"To calculate the net profit, we need to find the total revenue and total cost.

The total revenue is the number of sandwiches sold multiplied by the price per sandwich. 
10 sandwiches * $7.00 per sandwich = $70.00

The total cost consists of the cost of bread and the cost of cheese and condiments. 
The cost of bread is $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches. 
So, the cost of bread per sandwich is $3.00 / 10 sandwiches = $0.30 per sandwich.
The cost of cheese and condiments per 10 sandwiches is $30.00, so the cost per sandwich is $30.00 / 10 sandwiches = $3.00 per sandwich.
The total cost per sandwich is $0.30 (bread) + $3.00 (cheese and condiments) = $3.30 per sandwich.
The total cost for 10 sandwiches is $3.30 per sandwich * 10 sandwiches = $33.00.

The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00
Net profit = $37.00

The final answer is: $37.00"
"To find out how much money Kate can make, we first need to determine the total number of muffin crayons she can make. Since Kate melts 8 small pieces of crayons together in each muffin tin, and there are 3 boxes of 64 crayons, we need to find the total number of small pieces of crayons.

First, we find the total number of small pieces of crayons: 
3 boxes * 64 crayons per box = 192 crayons

Since each muffin tin contains 8 small pieces of crayons, we divide the total number of crayons by 8 to find the total number of muffin crayons:
192 crayons / 8 crayons per muffin = 24 muffin crayons

Now, we can find the total amount of money Kate can make by multiplying the number of muffin crayons by the price per muffin crayon:
24 muffin crayons * $1.50 per muffin = $36

The final answer is: $36"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the area of the bedroom and then calculate the cost of the new carpet, padding, and installation.

The area of the bedroom is the length multiplied by the width: 
Area = length * width = 18 * 12 = 216 square feet.

The cost of the new carpet is $12 per square foot, so the total cost of the carpet is:
Carpet cost = Area * $12 = 216 * $12 = $2592.

The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot, so the total cost of the padding is:
Padding cost = Area * $2 = 216 * $2 = $432.

The cost of removing the old carpet is $4 per square foot, so the total cost of removal is:
Removal cost = Area * $4 = 216 * $4 = $864.

The cost of installing the new carpet is $34 per square foot, so the total cost of installation is:
Installation cost = Area * $34 = 216 * $34 = $7344.

The total cost is the sum of the carpet cost, padding cost, removal cost, and installation cost:
Total cost = Carpet cost + Padding cost + Removal cost + Installation cost
= $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344
= $11332.

The final answer is: $11332."
"To find the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we need to calculate the total number of birds he saw over the week and then divide it by the number of days.

The total number of birds Mack saw is:
- Day 1 and 2: 50 birds
- Day 3: 0 birds
- Day 4 and 5: 120 birds
- Day 6: 20 birds
- Day 7: 90 birds

Total birds = 50 + 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 230

There are 7 days in a week. To find the average, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days:
Average = Total birds / Number of days
Average = 230 / 7
Average = 32.86

The final answer is: 32.86"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the given operations step by step.

1. The starting value of the number train is 20.
2. Half of the starting value is 20 / 2 = 10.
3. The starting value plus half the number is 20 + 10 = 30.
4. The resulting value is divided by 5, so 30 / 5 = 6.
5. The resulting value is multiplied by the starting value minus 12, so 6 * (20 - 12) = 6 * 8 = 48.

The final value of the number train is 48."
"To find the total number of cards they have together, we first need to determine the number of cards each of them has. 

The boy has 5 cards. His brother has 3 fewer cards than he has, so his brother has 5 - 3 = 2 cards.

Now, to find the total number of cards they have together, we add the number of cards the boy has to the number of cards his brother has: 5 + 2 = 7.

"To find the percentage by which the oven is off, we need to calculate the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature, and then divide it by the set temperature.

The difference between the actual and set temperature is 468 - 450 = 18 degrees.

The percentage by which the oven is off is (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%.

Since the oven is off by 4% for any recipe, we need to find the temperature that is 4% less than 520 degrees.

To do this, we can calculate 4% of 520 and subtract it from 520.

4% of 520 is (4/100) * 520 = 20.8.

Now, subtract 20.8 from 520 to get the temperature Maggie should set her oven to: 520 - 20.8 = 499.2.

The final answer is: 499.2"
"To find the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to add the length of each movie in minutes. 

First, let's convert the length of the first movie to minutes: 1 hour is 60 minutes, so 1 hour and 30 minutes is 60 + 30 = 90 minutes.

Next, let's convert the length of the second movie to minutes: 2 hours is 120 minutes, and adding 5 minutes gives us 125 minutes.

Now, we add the lengths of the two movies: 90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes.

The final answer is: 215"
"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house price and subtract it from Herb's house price. 

30% of $76,000 is 0.3 x $76,000 = $22,800.

Now, subtract $22,800 from $76,000 to find the value of Juan's house: $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200.

The value of Juan's house is $53,200.

To find the combined value of the two houses, add the value of Juan's house to Herb's house price: $53,200 + $76,000 = $129,200.

The final answer is: $129,200."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of cups and dishes Judy brought. 

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of cups Judy brought is 12, and the total number of cups her friend brought is 40. The total number of cups is 12 + 40 = 52.

The total number of dishes Judy brought is 24, and the total number of dishes her friend brought is 44. The total number of dishes is 24 + 44 = 68.

The total number of utensils (cups and dishes) brought by the two is 52 + 68 = 120.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the cost per pair of contacts, we first need to determine the total number of contacts in 2 boxes and the total cost of 2 boxes with the discount.

Since 90 contacts last Pete 45 days, we can find the number of contacts he uses per day: 90 contacts / 45 days = 2 contacts per day.

In 2 boxes, there are 2 * 90 = 180 contacts.

The original price of 2 boxes is 2 * $100 = $200. With a 10% discount, the discount amount is $200 * 0.10 = $20. The discounted price is $200 - $20 = $180.

Now, to find the cost per pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts: $180 / 180 contacts = $1 per contact.

Since a pair of contacts is 2 contacts, the cost per pair is $1 * 2 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we need to calculate their individual earnings first.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, for a total of 3 hours. Her hourly wage is $10, so her total earnings are 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 hours. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, which is 3 * 1 = 3 hours. So, John worked a total of 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

John's total earnings are 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find out how much water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total calories she burns during her activities. 

She spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories/hour. So, the total calories burned from aerobics is 2 * 500 = 1000 calories.

She also spends 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories/hour. So, the total calories burned from running is 1 * 600 = 600 calories.

The total calories burned is the sum of calories burned from aerobics and running, which is 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns, we need to divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many 200-calorie units she burned. 

Total calories burned / 200 = 1600 / 200 = 8

Since she needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, she needs to drink 8 * 100 = 800 ml of water.

The final answer is: 800"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G.

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write the equation: B + R + G = 4500.

We also know that the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, so we can write the equation: R = 0.99B.

We also know that the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so we can write the equation: G = 1.01B.

Now we can substitute the expressions for R and G into the first equation: B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500.

Combine like terms: 3.00B = 4500.

Divide both sides by 3.00: B = 1500.

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red jelly beans: R = 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485.

And we can find the number of green jelly beans: G = 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515.

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and the number of red jelly beans is: G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30.

"To determine the total number of people attending, we need to calculate the number of people invited via email, the number of friends Alex's friends will bring, and the number of Alex's friends and their spouses attending.

First, let's calculate the number of people invited via email. Each of the 100 people invited will bring 2 friends, so the total number of people invited via email is 100 + (100 * 2) = 300.

Next, Alex calls 10 friends and 8 of them will be bringing their spouses, so the total number of Alex's friends and their spouses is 10 + 8 = 18.

Now, we add the number of people invited via email and the number of Alex's friends and their spouses to get the total number of people attending. 

Total number of people attending = 300 + 18 = 318

However, we also need to include Alex herself, so the total number of people attending, including Alex, is 318 + 1 = 319.

Therefore, Alex will need 319 seats.

The final answer is: 319"
"To find the weight of the Mastiff, we need to start from the Papillon's weight. The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund. Since the Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, the Dachshund's weight is 2 * 10 pounds = 20 pounds. 

The Papillon's weight is one-fourth of the Dachshund's weight, so it is 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.

The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff's weight is 44 * 5 pounds = 220 pounds.

"To find the total cost of the boots on eBay, we need to calculate the shipping cost first. Since the shipping cost on eBay is twice as much as it is on Amazon, and the shipping cost on Amazon is $4, the shipping cost on eBay is 2 * $4 = $8.

The total cost of the boots on eBay is the cost of the boots plus the shipping cost, which is $13 + $8 = $21.

The total cost of the boots on Amazon is $16 + $4 = $20.

To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we need to subtract the total cost on Amazon from the total cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

"To solve this problem, we can use exponential growth. The initial height of the beanstalk is 4 feet, and it doubles every day. We want to find the number of days it takes for the beanstalk to be taller than 20 feet.

Let's start by listing the height of the beanstalk for each day:

Day 0: 4 feet
Day 1: 8 feet
Day 2: 16 feet
Day 3: 32 feet

As we can see, the height of the beanstalk doubles every day. We can use this pattern to find the number of days it takes for the beanstalk to be taller than 20 feet.

Since 16 feet is less than 20 feet, and 32 feet is greater than 20 feet, the beanstalk will be taller than Mark's window on the third day.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we first need to calculate how many grams of protein he gets per day. 

Since a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein, we can find the protein percentage in a cup of mushrooms by dividing the protein by the weight: 3 grams / 100 grams = 0.03 or 3%.

Now, we know that John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day. To find out how many grams of protein he gets per day, we multiply the weight of mushrooms he eats by the protein percentage: 200 grams * 0.03 = 6 grams of protein per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7 to find the weekly protein intake: 6 grams/day * 7 days/week = 42 grams of protein per week.

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's break down the information given. If Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can represent his current age as 'x'. 

Five years ago, Jerry's age would be 'x - 5'. According to the problem, Jerry's current age is twice his age 5 years ago, so we can write the equation: x = 2(x - 5).

Simplifying the equation, we get: x = 2x - 10.

Subtracting '2x' from both sides of the equation, we get: -x = -10.

Dividing both sides by -1, we get: x = 10.

So, Jerry's current age is 10 years. 

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age: 10 + 3 = 13.

The final answer is: 13"
"To find out how many hours George needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the dental work. 

The base price for two implants is 2 * $2000 = $4000. 
For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain, which costs an extra $500. So, the total cost for the implants with the crown is $4000 + $500 = $4500. 
However, since he's already put down a deposit of $600, we subtract that from the total cost: $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Now, we need to find out how many hours George needs to work to earn $3900 at $15 per hour. 

To do this, we divide the total amount he needs to earn ($3900) by his hourly wage ($15): $3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

The final answer is: 260"
"Let's denote the smallest angle as 'x'. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, which is 2x, and one angle is three times the smallest angle, which is 3x.

Since the sum of the three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:

One angle is twice the smallest angle: 2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees
One angle is three times the smallest angle: 3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has in cents. 

First, let's convert the quarters to cents: 8 quarters * 25 cents/quarter = 200 cents.
Next, let's convert the dimes to cents: 6 dimes * 10 cents/dime = 60 cents.
Then, we already have the number of nickels in cents: 14 nickels * 5 cents/nickel = 70 cents.
Lastly, we have the number of pennies in cents: 15 pennies * 1 cent/penny = 15 cents.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money Colby has: 200 cents + 60 cents + 70 cents + 15 cents = 345 cents.

Since each gumball costs a nickel (5 cents), we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball: 345 cents / 5 cents = 69.

The final answer is: 69"
"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of pet and then add them together.

Dogs have 4 legs each, and there are 5 dogs, so the total number of dog legs is 5 x 4 = 20.

Cats have 4 legs each, and there are 2 cats, so the total number of cat legs is 2 x 4 = 8.

Birds have 2 legs each, and there are 10 birds, so the total number of bird legs is 10 x 2 = 20.

Now, we add the total number of legs for each type of pet: 20 (dog legs) + 8 (cat legs) + 20 (bird legs) = 48.

The total number of legs in the pet store is 48."
"To find the weight Jamaal uses after increasing the 8-pound weight by 50%, we first need to calculate 50% of 8 pounds. 

50% of 8 pounds is 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds. 

Now, we add this to the original weight: 8 pounds + 4 pounds = 12 pounds. 

However, Jamaal finds this weight too heavy, so he uses a weight two pounds lighter than this. 

The weight he now uses is 12 pounds - 2 pounds = 10 pounds.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of games Steve receives each year and then add them up over the three years.

In the first year, Steve gets 5 games as a birthday gift and 5 games as Christmas gifts, for a total of 10 games. He also buys 1 game per month for 12 months, which is 12 games. So, in total, he has 10 + 12 = 22 games at the end of the first year.

In the second year, Steve gets 5 games as birthday and Christmas gifts, for a total of 5 games. He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, which is 24 games. So, in total, he has 5 + 24 = 29 games at the end of the second year.

In the third year, Steve gets 5 games as birthday and Christmas gifts, for a total of 5 games. He buys 4 games per month for 12 months, which is 48 games. So, in total, he has 5 + 48 = 53 games at the end of the third year.

"To find the rate at which the plane travels, we need to divide the distance it traveled by the time it took. 

Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Rate = 400 miles per hour

Now, we need to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this rate.

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

Since the question asks for the additional hours it would take, we need to subtract the initial time from the total time.

Additional time = Total time - Initial time
Additional time = 5 hours - 3 hours
Additional time = 2 hours

"To find the total amount of chocolates made by Marissa in an hour, we need to first find out how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz makes in an hour. 

Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. To find out how many pounds he makes in an hour, we divide 120 by 2. 

120 / 2 = 60 pounds per hour for Ruiz.

Since Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz, we multiply 60 by 3/4.

60 * (3/4) = 45 pounds per hour for Marissa.

Now, we know that both Ruiz and Marissa work for 12 hours a day. To find the total amount of chocolates made by Ruiz in 12 hours, we multiply 60 pounds per hour by 12.

60 * 12 = 720 pounds for Ruiz.

To find the total amount of chocolates made by Marissa in 12 hours, we multiply 45 pounds per hour by 12.

45 * 12 = 540 pounds for Marissa.

The total amount of chocolates made by both Ruiz and Marissa in 12 hours is the sum of their individual amounts.

720 + 540 = 1260 pounds.

The final answer is: 1260"
"To find out how much money Howard has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent at the arcade and subtract it from the original amount he had.

On Monday, Howard spent $8.
On Tuesday, he spent twice as much as Monday, which is 2 * $8 = $16.
On Wednesday, he spent 4 times as much as Tuesday, which is 4 * $16 = $64.

The total amount spent is $8 + $16 + $64 = $88.

Howard originally had $100. To find out how much he has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the original amount: $100 - $88 = $12.

"To find out how much money Joe will have left after the purchase, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he wants to buy and then subtract that from the initial amount of money he has.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount. The shirt costs $25 and the shorts cost $35, so the total cost is $25 + $35 = $60.

Since there's a 30% off sale, we need to calculate the discount amount. To do this, we multiply the total cost by the discount percentage (30% or 0.3). The discount amount is $60 * 0.3 = $18.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final cost of the items. $60 - $18 = $42.

Since sales tax is included in the prices, we don't need to calculate it separately. Joe will pay $42 for the items.

To find out how much money Joe will have left, we subtract the final cost from the initial amount of money he has. $50 - $42 = $8.

The final answer is: $8"
"To determine the amount of butter needed, we first need to calculate the total number of croissants Juan wants to make in a week. Since he wants to make 4 dozen a day for a week, we multiply the number of dozen croissants per day by the number of days in a week.

4 dozen/day * 7 days/week = 28 dozen/week

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, we can convert the total number of dozen croissants to individual croissants.

28 dozen * 12 croissants/dozen = 336 croissants

Now, we know it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. To find the total amount of butter needed, we multiply the number of dozen croissants by the amount of butter per dozen.

28 dozen * 1/4 pound/dozen = 28 * 0.25 pounds

28 * 0.25 = 7

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the cost of repaving Lewis' street, we need to multiply the cost per meter by the length of his street. 

Cost per meter: $194
Length of Lewis' street: 490 meters

Cost to repave Lewis' street = Cost per meter * Length of Lewis' street
Cost to repave Lewis' street = $194 * 490
Cost to repave Lewis' street = $95,060

Now, to find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's, we need to calculate the cost of repaving Monica's street and then subtract it from the cost of repaving Lewis' street.

Cost to repave Monica's street = Cost per meter * Length of Monica's street
Cost to repave Monica's street = $194 * 150
Cost to repave Monica's street = $29,100

Now, let's find the difference in cost:
Difference in cost = Cost to repave Lewis' street - Cost to repave Monica's street
Difference in cost = $95,060 - $29,100

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of John's research. 

First, let's break down the initial funding and the duration of the research. John initially received $100,000 for the first 5 months. However, his research ended up taking 10 times longer than expected, which is 10 * 5 = 50 months.

Since the research took 50 months, we need to calculate the additional funding required for the remaining 45 months (50 - 5 = 45 months). The funding for each of these months is 50% more than the initial funding. 

50% more than $100,000 is 1.5 * $100,000 = $150,000. 

Now, we need to calculate the total funding required for the remaining 45 months. This is $150,000 * 45 = $6,750,000.

The initial funding for the first 5 months was $100,000. So, the total cost of the research is $100,000 + $6,750,000 = $6,850,000.

The final answer is: $6,850,000"
"To find the total amount of meat consumed, we need to calculate the amount eaten by the first, second, and third players. 

The first player ate a 6-ounce steak. 
The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so 8 ounces of beef tips. 
The third player ate a one-pound steak, which is equal to 16 ounces (1 pound = 16 ounces).

Now, let's add up the total amount of meat consumed: 
6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces.

There are 31 days in March. If each member posts an average of 3 posts per day, the total number of posts per day is 1000 members * 3 posts/member = 3000 posts/day.

Now, we multiply the total number of posts per day by the number of days in March to get the total number of posts in March: 3000 posts/day * 31 days = 93,000 posts.

The final answer is: 93000"
"To find out how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to calculate the total amount of water used in a year and then multiply it by the cost per gallon.

Gary does laundry twice a week, so in a year (52 weeks), he does laundry 2 * 52 = 104 times.

Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water, so the total amount of water used in a year is 104 * 20 = 2080 gallons.

The cost of water per gallon is $0.15, so the total cost of water for laundry in a year is 2080 * $0.15 = $312.

"To find the number of students, we first need to find the total number of seats in the auditorium. 

Total number of seats = Number of rows * Number of seats per row
Total number of seats = 4 * 18
Total number of seats = 72

One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators. 
Number of seats occupied by administrators = Total number of seats * (1/4)
Number of seats occupied by administrators = 72 * (1/4)
Number of seats occupied by administrators = 18

Now, we need to find the number of remaining seats after the administrators occupied their seats. 
Remaining seats = Total number of seats - Number of seats occupied by administrators
Remaining seats = 72 - 18
Remaining seats = 54

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents. 
Number of seats occupied by parents = Remaining seats * (1/3)
Number of seats occupied by parents = 54 * (1/3)
Number of seats occupied by parents = 18

Now, we need to find the number of seats occupied by the students. 
Number of seats occupied by students = Remaining seats - Number of seats occupied by parents
Number of seats occupied by students = 54 - 18

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he will chew 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

2. He chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 stick after dinner, so that's 2 more pieces.

3. So far, Jim has chewed 4 + 2 = 6 pieces of gum.

4. He started with 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

5. He gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. Half of 14 is 14 / 2 = 7.

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to first convert her speed from kb/s to Mb/s and then multiply it by the number of seconds in an hour.

1 Mb = 1000 kb
Ashley's speed in kb/s = 20 kb/s

To convert kb/s to Mb/s, we divide by 1000:
20 kb/s / 1000 = 0.02 Mb/s

There are 3600 seconds in an hour. To find Ashley's speed in Mb/h, we multiply her speed in Mb/s by the number of seconds in an hour:

"To find out how much James made, we need to calculate the profit from selling the cars, then apply his commission.

First, let's find the total cost of the cars: 10 cars * $25,000 = $250,000.

The company paid 30% of the cost to acquire the cars, so the amount they paid is 0.3 * $250,000 = $75,000.

The profit from selling the cars is the selling price minus the cost to acquire them: $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.

James gets a 10% commission on the profit, so his commission is 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

Therefore, James made $17,500.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that 25% of the 100 riders can stay upright on the wave. To find the number of riders who can stay upright, we multiply 100 by 0.25 (which is 25% expressed as a decimal).

100 * 0.25 = 25

So, 25 riders can stay upright on the wave.

Next, we are told that 60% of these 25 riders are women. To find the number of women who can stay upright, we multiply 25 by 0.6 (which is 60% expressed as a decimal).

25 * 0.6 = 15

Since the remaining riders who can stay upright are men, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright.

25 - 15 = 10

Therefore, 10 men can stay upright on the wave.

"To find the total price for all three jewels, we need to first find the prices of the gold and silver jewels.

Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, and the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond jewel, we can calculate the price of the gold jewel as follows:

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * Price of diamond jewel
= (4/5) * $2000
= $1600

The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold, so we can calculate the price of the silver jewel as follows:

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
= $1600 - $400
= $1200

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

"To solve this problem, we need to find the relative speed between Bob and Tom. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract Tom's speed from Bob's speed to get the relative speed.

Relative speed = Bob's speed - Tom's speed
Relative speed = 55 mph - 70 mph
Relative speed = -15 mph

However, since we are dealing with a time problem, we need to consider the absolute value of the relative speed, which is the distance between them divided by the time it takes to close the gap.

Relative speed = 15 mph (absolute value)

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed

Time = Distance / Relative speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

"To find out how many fish Tommy caught, we need to first determine how many fish Darren caught. Since Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish, we can calculate Darren's catch by subtracting 6 from Naomi's total.

Darren's catch = Naomi's catch - 6
Darren's catch = 17 - 6
Darren's catch = 11

Now that we know Darren caught 11 fish, we can find out how many Tommy caught by adding 3 to Darren's total.

Tommy's catch = Darren's catch + 3
Tommy's catch = 11 + 3

"To find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to determine the maximum number of classes he can attend without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

First, let's calculate the total cost of 10 classes at $10 per class: 
10 classes * $10 per class = $100

Since Manny signed up for $60, he has already paid for 6 classes at $10 per class:
6 classes * $10 per class = $60

Now, let's find out how many classes he can attend at $10 per class with the remaining balance:
$100 (total cost) - $60 (already paid) = $40 remaining

To find out how many classes he can attend with the remaining balance, we'll divide the remaining balance by the cost per class:
$40 / $10 per class = 4 classes

Since Manny has already attended 6 classes, we need to subtract the number of classes he can attend with the remaining balance from the total number of classes:
10 total classes - 6 classes already attended - 4 classes remaining = 0 classes

However, this means Manny can't attend any more classes without exceeding the $10 per class limit. But since he can't miss classes, we need to find out how many classes he can miss. 

Let's recalculate the number of classes he can miss by subtracting the number of classes he can attend from the total number of classes:
10 total classes - 6 classes already attended = 4 classes

So, Manny can miss 4 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

"To find the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges, we first need to find the cost of one apple and one orange. 

The cost of 4 apples is $5.20, so the cost of one apple is $5.20 / 4 = $1.30. 

The cost of 3 oranges is $3.30, so the cost of one orange is $3.30 / 3 = $1.10.

Now, we can find the cost of 5 apples: 5 apples * $1.30/apple = $6.50.

Next, we can find the cost of 5 oranges: 5 oranges * $1.10/orange = $5.50.

Finally, we can find the total cost by adding the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges: $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To find the volume of the hole, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth. 

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Since it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we can multiply the volume by the time it takes to shovel one cubic foot.

Time = Volume * time per cubic foot
Time = 72 * 3
Time = 216 seconds

Therefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add them to the base price.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade costs $7,500.

The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of the leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of the running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the features and the base price:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"To find out how much Tim will make in a year, we need to calculate his new monthly salary and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's calculate the 5% raise on his monthly salary. 
5% of $20,000 is 0.05 * $20,000 = $1,000. 
So, his new monthly salary will be $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000.

Next, let's calculate the bonus, which is half a month's salary. 
Half of $21,000 is $10,500.

Now, let's add the bonus to his new monthly salary. 
$21,000 + $10,500 = $31,500.

Finally, let's multiply his new monthly salary by 12 to find out how much he will make in a year. 
$31,500 * 12 = $378,000.

"To find the total number of articles published by both websites in February, we need to calculate the total number of articles published by each website and then add them together.

The news website publishes 20 articles per day, and there are 28 days in February. So, the total number of articles published by the news website in February is:

20 articles/day * 28 days = 560 articles

The sister company publishes 10 articles per day, and there are 28 days in February. So, the total number of articles published by the sister company in February is:

10 articles/day * 28 days = 280 articles

Now, we add the total number of articles published by both websites:

560 articles (news website) + 280 articles (sister company) = 840 articles

"To find the age of Steve's son's wife, we need to determine the ages of Steve's son and his wife. 

First, we know Steve's age is 60 years. His wife is 4 years older than him, so she is 60 + 4 = 64 years old.

Their son is half as old as his mom, so his age is 64 / 2 = 32 years.

Steve's son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, so her age is 32 - 3 = 29 years.

The final numerical answer is: 29"
"To find the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions, we first need to find the total amount of flour in one bag. Since the bag is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, we can find the total amount of flour in one bag by multiplying the number of portions by the weight of each portion.

Total flour in one bag = 8 portions * 2 kilograms/portion = 16 kilograms

Since we have three bags, we can find the total amount of flour in three bags by multiplying the total amount of flour in one bag by 3.

Total flour in three bags = 16 kilograms/bag * 3 bags = 48 kilograms

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley, we need to calculate the distance each of them biked and then add them together.

Alisa biked at 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours. To find the distance she biked, we multiply her speed by the time:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 12 miles/hour x 4.5 hours
Distance = 54 miles

Stanley biked at 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours. To find the distance he biked, we multiply his speed by the time:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour x 2.5 hours
Distance = 25 miles

Now, we add the distances biked by Alisa and Stanley to find the total distance:

Total Distance = Distance biked by Alisa + Distance biked by Stanley
Total Distance = 54 miles + 25 miles
Total Distance = 79 miles

"To find the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay, then add those times together.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil. Bill can dig 4 feet/hour through soil, and he needs to dig 24 feet of soil. 

Time to dig through soil = Distance / Rate = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the clay. Bill can dig half as fast through clay, so his rate is 4 / 2 = 2 feet/hour. He needs to dig 8 feet of clay.

Time to dig through clay = Distance / Rate = 8 feet / 2 feet/hour = 4 hours

Now, we add the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay to get the total time.

Total time = Time to dig through soil + Time to dig through clay = 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Initially, Fishio received 2000 likes on her selfie.

Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times as many as the initial number of likes. 
So, the number of likes after 3 weeks = 70 * 2000 = 140000.

Now, she received 20000 more new likes recently. 
So, the total number of likes = 140000 + 20000 = 160000.

"To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost of the pomegranates on each day and then subtract the two amounts.

On the first day, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, but she got a $2 discount. So, the total cost is:
20 * $20 = $400
Discount: $2
Total cost = $400 - $2 = $398

On the second day, the price shot to $30 per fruit, and a 10% discount was offered on the total cost. Sheila bought 20 pomegranates.
Total cost = 20 * $30 = $600
Discount: 10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
Total cost after discount = $600 - $60 = $540

Now, let's find the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days:
Difference = $540 - $398 = $142

The final answer is: $142"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find the total sales from green hats in the first month. Since the sales from red hats were half the total amount she earned from selling green hats, let's denote the total sales from green hats as 'x'. This means the sales from red hats are x/2.

We are given that the sales from red hats were $400, so we can set up the equation:

x/2 = 400

To find the value of 'x', we multiply both sides by 2:

x = 400 * 2
x = 800

So, the total sales from green hats in the first month were $800.

Now, let's find the total sales from both red and green hats in the first month:

Total sales in the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
= 400 + 800
= 1200

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. To find the total sales in the second month, we multiply the total sales in the first month by 3/4:

Total sales in the second month = (3/4) * 1200
= 900

Now, let's find the total sales in two months:

Total sales in two months = Total sales in the first month + Total sales in the second month
= 1200 + 900
= 2100

The final answer is: $2100"

James hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. However, he gets 1 hour free, so he only pays for 3 hours.

The first paid hour costs $15. Each subsequent hour costs twice the previous hour, so the second hour costs $15 * 2 = $30, and the third hour costs $30 * 2 = $60.

The total cost is the sum of the costs of the three paid hours: $15 + $30 + $60 = $105.

"To find out how many dollars were withheld from Sally's wage, we need to determine the total amount she should have received and subtract the actual amount in her account.

First, let's calculate the total amount Sally should have received. Since her weekly wage is $300, and she started with $200 in her account, the total amount she should have received is $300 (weekly wage) + $200 (initial amount) = $500.

However, the actual amount in her account is $420. To find out how much was withheld, we subtract the actual amount from the total amount she should have received: $500 (total amount) - $420 (actual amount) = $80.

The amount withheld from Sally's wage is $80.

"To determine the number of eggs Lori needs, we first need to find out how many deviled egg halves each guest will eat. Since each guest eats 3 deviled egg halves, and Lori is inviting 16 guests, the total number of deviled egg halves needed is 3 * 16 = 48.

Since Lori needs 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves, we need to find out how many deviled egg halves 1 egg can make. This is 2 deviled egg halves per egg. 

Now, we divide the total number of deviled egg halves needed by the number of deviled egg halves per egg to find the total number of eggs needed. 48 / 2 = 24 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens of eggs needed. 24 / 12 = 2.

"To find out how many pages Shiela has left to write, we need to determine the total number of pages she has already written and subtract that from the total required pages.

Since Shiela has finished writing 1/3 of the paper, we can calculate the number of pages she has written as follows:

1/3 of 15 pages = (1/3) * 15 = 5 pages

Now, we subtract the number of pages she has written from the total required pages:

15 pages (total) - 5 pages (written) = 10 pages

So, Shiela has 10 pages left to write.

"To find the total cost of the plane for the first year, we need to calculate the cost of the plane itself, the hanger rental, and the fuel costs.

The cost of the plane is $150,000.

The hanger rental is $5000 per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total hanger rental cost for the first year is $5000 * 12 = $60,000.

The fuel cost is twice the hanger rental, which is $5000 * 2 = $10,000 per month. The total fuel cost for the first year is $10,000 * 12 = $120,000.

Now, we add up the costs: $150,000 (plane) + $60,000 (hanger rental) + $120,000 (fuel) = $330,000.

The final answer is: $330,000"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. It took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice.
2. It took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, so it took her 30 + 20 = 50 minutes to cook pork.
3. Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. Half of 80 is 40 minutes.

Now, let's add up the cooking times for all the food:

Total cost of the first mixture = $5 + $5 = $10

For the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts), we need to find the total cost.

Cost of almonds in the second mixture = (1/5 pound) * $10/pound = $2
Cost of walnuts in the second mixture = (1/3 pound) * $15/pound = $5
Total cost of the second mixture = $2 + $5 = $7

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between the two mixtures.

Difference in cost = Total cost of the first mixture - Total cost of the second mixture
= $10 - $7
= $3

The final answer is: $3"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of sheep as S and the number of geese as G.

Since sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs, we can write the equation for the total number of legs as:

4S + 2G = 70

We are also given that the total number of animal heads is 20. Since sheep and geese both have one head, we can write the equation for the total number of heads as:

S + G = 20

Now we have a system of two equations:

1) 4S + 2G = 70
2) S + G = 20

We can solve this system of equations using substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution. From equation (2), we can express G as G = 20 - S. Substituting this into equation (1), we get:

4S + 2(20 - S) = 70

Expanding and simplifying the equation, we get:

4S + 40 - 2S = 70

Combine like terms:

2S + 40 = 70

Subtract 40 from both sides:

2S = 30

Divide both sides by 2:

S = 15

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the cost of the coffee. 

Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day and wants a week's worth, which is 7 days. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, but his favorite brand is sold out, so he buys the more expensive brand. The more expensive brand costs 20% more than the normal brand. 

20% of $5 is 0.2 * $5 = $1. So, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

The total cost of the coffee is 7 pounds * $6 per pound = $42.

He also buys a donut for $2. 

The total cost is $42 (coffee) + $2 (donut) = $44.

The final numerical answer is: $44"
"To find the cost of the apple pie, we need to subtract the total cost of the items Gus bought from the $20.00 he spent. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Gus bought:

2 bags of chips for $2.00 each = 2 x $2.00 = $4.00
Adding the cost of the bucket of fried chicken: $4.00 + $8.00 = $12.00
Adding the cost of the bottle of soda: $12.00 + $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's subtract the total cost of the items from the $20.00 Gus spent:

$20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

The apple pie cost $7.00.

$7.00"
"To find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers delivered.

Total newspapers delivered = 600
Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers delivered - (Newspapers delivered to District A + Newspapers delivered to District C)
= 600 - (198 + 209)
= 600 - 407
= 193

"To find out how many recipes John learns, we need to calculate the total class time and then divide it by the time it takes to learn a new recipe.

The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time, so the total class time per week is 4 * 2 = 8 hours.

Since the class lasts for 6 weeks, the total class time is 8 hours/week * 6 weeks = 48 hours.

John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time. To find out how many recipes he learns, we need to divide the total class time by 1.5 hours.

Total recipes learned = Total class time / Time to learn a new recipe
= 48 hours / 1.5 hours

"To find the number of math teachers, we first need to find the number of history teachers and then subtract that from the total number of teachers. 

60% of 150 teachers are history teachers. To find 60% of 150, we multiply 150 by 0.6. 

150 * 0.6 = 90

So, there are 90 history teachers. To find the number of math teachers, we subtract the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers.

150 - 90 = 60

There are 60 math teachers. 

Each math teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. To find the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day, we multiply the number of math teachers by the number of hours they sleep per day.

60 * 6 = 360

The final answer is: 360"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the amount of money Kassidy and Rayna have. 

First, we know Aurelia has $120. Since Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, we can calculate Kassidy's money as follows:
Kassidy's money = 3/4 * Aurelia's money
Kassidy's money = 3/4 * 120
Kassidy's money = 90

Now, we know Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy. So, we can calculate Rayna's money as follows:
Rayna's money = Kassidy's money + 60
Rayna's money = 90 + 60
Rayna's money = 150

Now that we have the money of all three, we can find the total amount of money they have together:
Total money = Aurelia's money + Kassidy's money + Rayna's money
Total money = 120 + 90 + 150
Total money = 360

To find out how much each would have if they decided to add together their money and share equally among them, we need to divide the total money by 3:
Money per person = Total money / 3
Money per person = 360 / 3
Money per person = 120

"To find the total length of the game, we need to calculate the length of the regular game and then add the extra time played in the extended quarter.

The regular game consists of 4 quarters, each 12 minutes long. So, the total length of the regular game is:
4 quarters * 12 minutes/quarter = 48 minutes

Since the game was extended for 5 minutes, we need to add this to the total length of the regular game:
48 minutes + 5 minutes = 53 minutes

Therefore, the entire game lasted 53 minutes.

The final answer is: 53"
"To find the number of employees who oversee the company, we first need to find the number of management employees and then the number of those who oversee the entire company.

First, let's find the number of management employees. 20% of 50 employees are management. 

20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10

So, there are 10 management employees.

Now, out of these 10 management employees, 30% oversee the entire company.

30% of 10 = 0.30 * 10 = 3

Therefore, 3 employees oversee the company.

"To find the number of good days left in the month, we need to first determine the total number of good days recorded by Christina. We know that she had 12 good days in the first 30 days. However, we also know that her first 8 days were good, her second 8 days were bad, and her third 8 days were neutral. 

Since we know the first 8 days were good, we can subtract those from the total number of good days. However, we also need to consider the additional good days in the first 30 days. The second 8 days were bad, so they don't contribute to the good days. The third 8 days were neutral, so they also don't contribute to the good days. 

However, we know that the next 3 days were good, neutral, and good. We need to add these to the total number of good days. 

Let's calculate the total number of good days in the first 30 days. We know that Christina had 12 good days in the first 30 days. We also know that her first 8 days were good, so we subtract those from the total number of good days. However, we also need to consider the additional good days in the first 30 days. The second 8 days were bad, so they don't contribute to the good days. The third 8 days were neutral, so they also don't contribute to the good days. 

Since we know that Christina had 12 good days in the first 30 days, and her first 8 days were good, we can calculate the number of good days in the first 30 days as follows: 12 - 8 = 4 good days in the last 22 days. However, we also know that the next 3 days were good, neutral, and good. We need to add these to the total number of good days. 

Since we know that there were 4 good days in the last 22 days, and the next 3 days were good, neutral, and good, we can calculate the number of good days in the last 25 days as follows: 4 + 1 = 5 good days in the last 25 days. However, we also know that the last 25 days include the first 22 days and the next 3 days. We need to subtract the good days in the first 22 days from the good days in the last 25 days. 

Since we know that there were 4 good days in the first 22 days, and 5 good days in the last 25 days, we can calculate the number of good days in the last 3 days as follows: 5 - 4 = 1 good day in the last 3 days. However, we also know that the last 3 days were good, neutral, and good. We need to add the good days in the last 3 days to the total number of good days. 

Since we know that there was 1 good day in the last 3 days, and the last 3 days were good, neutral, and good, we can calculate the number of good days in the last 3 days as follows: 1 + 1 = 2 good days in the last 3 days. 

However, we also know that the last 3 days were good, neutral, and good. We need to add the good days in the last 3 days to the total number of good days. 

Since we know that there were 2 good days in the last 3 days, we can calculate the total number of good days in the month as follows: 12 + 2 = 14 good days in the month.

"To find out how many books Sally has, we need to work backwards from the information given about Janey. We know that Janey has 21 books and that this is 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has.

Let's represent the number of books Sally has as 'x'. We can then write an equation based on the given information:

Janey's books = 2 * Sally's books + 3
21 = 2x + 3

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x' on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 3 from both sides:

21 - 3 = 2x + 3 - 3
18 = 2x

Next, we need to get 'x' by itself. We can do this by dividing both sides by 2:

18 / 2 = 2x / 2
9 = x

So, Sally has 9 books.

"To find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches, we need to first convert the initial height from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so we multiply 20 feet by 12 inches per foot.

20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now, we know the bamboo grows 30 inches a day and its current height is 240 inches. To find out how many days it will take to reach 600 inches, we subtract the current height from the target height and divide by the daily growth rate.

600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Now, we divide the remaining height by the daily growth rate.

360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs. This means each dog has 1 toy. When 8 more dogs arrive, James needs 8 more toys to bring the total to 12 dogs with 1 toy each. So, he buys 8 more toys.

Now, there are 12 dogs, and James goes back to find that there are twice as many more dogs, which means there are 2 * 8 = 16 more dogs. This makes a total of 12 + 16 = 28 dogs. Since each dog needs 1 toy, James needs 16 more toys to bring the total to 28 dogs with 1 toy each.

However, when James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs those toys. This means he needs 16 - 3 = 13 toys for the remaining 25 dogs.

To find the total number of toys James needs, we add the initial 4 toys, the 8 toys he bought first, and the 13 toys he bought later. 

4 (initial toys) + 8 (first purchase) + 13 (second purchase) = 25

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many signatures the sisters have collected in total so far. We know that Carol has 20 signatures and Jennifer has 44 signatures. 

Total signatures collected so far = Carol's signatures + Jennifer's signatures
Total signatures collected so far = 20 + 44
Total signatures collected so far = 64

The sisters want to reach a total of 100 signatures by the end of the summer. Since they have already collected 64 signatures, we need to find out how many more signatures they need to collect.

Signatures needed to reach the goal = Total signatures needed - Total signatures collected so far
Signatures needed to reach the goal = 100 - 64
Signatures needed to reach the goal = 36

They have three more weeks of summer vacation, and they need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal.

"To find the total weight of the 9 adults, we need to multiply the average weight of an adult by the number of adults. 

Average weight of an adult = 80 kg
Number of adults = 9

Total weight of adults = Average weight of an adult * Number of adults
Total weight of adults = 80 kg * 9
Total weight of adults = 720 kg

Since the elevator supports a maximum load of 700 kg, we need to find the excess weight.

Excess weight = Total weight of adults - Maximum load of the elevator
Excess weight = 720 kg - 700 kg
Excess weight = 20 kg

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of cookies Max and Summer have. 

Since Katarina has 68 cookies and she has 5 less than Max, Max must have 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.

Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, but we don't know how many cookies the Cookie Monster has. However, we can express the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has as x. Then, Max has x + 12 cookies.

Since Max has 73 cookies, we can set up the equation x + 12 = 73. Solving for x, we get x = 73 - 12 = 61. So, the Cookie Monster has 61 cookies.

Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, and Max has 73 cookies. Therefore, Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Now, we can find the total number of cookies by adding the number of cookies Katarina, Max, and Summer have: 68 + 73 + 96 = 237.

The final answer is: 237"
"To find the original length of the dress, we need to work backwards from the final design length. 

First, we know that the final design length is 140cm, and 20cm of that is the lace trim. So, the original length of the dress before adding the lace trim is 140cm - 20cm = 120cm.

Since the dress was extended by 50% of its original length, let's call the original length 'x'. The extension is 50% of 'x', which is 0.5x. The total length after the extension is x + 0.5x = 1.5x.

We know that 1.5x = 120cm (the length before adding the lace trim). To find 'x', we divide both sides by 1.5:

x = 120cm / 1.5
x = 80cm

So, the original length of the dress was 80cm.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes to mow half the lawn in each mode and then add them together.

First, let's find the time it takes to mow half the lawn in turtle mode. Since it takes 1 hour to mow the entire lawn in turtle mode, it will take 1/2 hour to mow half the lawn in turtle mode. We need to convert 1/2 hour to minutes, which is 30 minutes.

Next, let's find the time it takes to mow half the lawn in rabbit mode. Since it takes 40 minutes to mow the entire lawn in rabbit mode, it will take 40/2 = 20 minutes to mow half the lawn in rabbit mode.

Now, we add the time it takes to mow half the lawn in each mode: 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes.

"Let's denote the age of the younger twin as T, the age of the older twin as T+7, and the age of the triplet as t. 

Since there are two twins and one triplet, the total age is 2T + t = 44. 

We also know that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so T = t + 7.

Substituting T = t + 7 into the first equation, we get 2(t + 7) + t = 44.

Expanding the equation, we get 2t + 14 + t = 44.

Combining like terms, we get 3t + 14 = 44.

Subtracting 14 from both sides, we get 3t = 30.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get t = 10.

Now that we know the age of the triplet, we can find the age of the older twin. Since T = t + 7, T = 10 + 7 = 17.

"To find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we first need to find the cost of one candy. We know that 5 lollipops and 4 candies cost $3.20. 

First, let's find the total cost of the lollipops: 5 lollipops * $0.40 = $2. 

Now, subtract the cost of the lollipops from the total cost to find the cost of the candies: $3.20 - $2 = $1.20. 

Since there are 4 candies, the cost of one candy is $1.20 / 4 = $0.30.

Now, we can find the total cost of 10 lollipops: 10 lollipops * $0.40 = $4.

The total cost of 10 candies is 10 candies * $0.30 = $3.

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $4 + $3 = $7.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many coins Rong and Neil save per month. Rong saves 20 coins per month. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, which is 2/5 * 20 = 8 coins more than Rong. So, Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Now, let's calculate the total number of coins they save in a year. Rong saves 20 * 12 = 240 coins per year. Neil saves 28 * 12 = 336 coins per year.

Since they have been saving for 10 years, we need to multiply the number of coins they save per year by 10. Rong saves 240 * 10 = 2400 coins in 10 years. Neil saves 336 * 10 = 3360 coins in 10 years.

The total number of coins they have is the sum of the coins saved by Rong and Neil, which is 2400 + 3360 = 5760.

"To find the total bill, we first need to calculate the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check. The cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40. 

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, which means the total bill is the heartworm check divided by 0.6. Let's call the total bill 'x'. Then, 0.6x = $40 + $20 (vaccines) + heartworm check. However, we don't know the cost of the heartworm check yet.

Since the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, the heartworm check is 0.6x. The total bill is the sum of the vaccines and the heartworm check, which is $40 + 0.6x. 

We know that the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so we can set up the equation: 0.6x = 0.4x + $40. 

Solving for x, we get 0.6x - 0.4x = $40, which simplifies to 0.2x = $40. 

Dividing both sides by 0.2, we get x = $200. 

Now that we know the total bill is $200, we can find the cost of the heartworm check, which is 0.6 * $200 = $120.

John brought $125 with him, so he leaves with $125 - $200 = -$75. However, since you can't leave with a negative amount of money, this means John doesn't have enough money to pay the total bill.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of each type of fruit in one crate:
- Bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- Apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- Oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

The total cost of the crate is the sum of the costs of all the fruits: $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

We know that there are 14 red squares. 
There are 4 more blue squares than red squares, so the number of blue squares is 14 + 4 = 18.
There are 6 more green squares than blue squares, so the number of green squares is 18 + 6 = 24.
There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so the number of white squares is 24 - 12 = 12.

Now, let's add up the number of squares of each color: 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68 squares.

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

Now, we add the number of high chairs and regular chairs to get the total number of chairs.

8 high chairs + 40 regular chairs = 48 chairs

Since there will be 42 adults and 15 babies attending, we need to determine the total number of chairs needed. Babies will use high chairs, so we add the number of adults and babies to get the total number of people.

42 adults + 15 babies = 57 people

Since each person needs a chair, we need 57 chairs in total. To find out how many more chairs Mia needs, we subtract the number of chairs she has from the total number of chairs needed.

57 total chairs - 48 chairs = 9 chairs

Therefore, Mia needs 9 more chairs.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the number of 8-point bucks, we first need to find the total number of bucks in the field. Since 50% of the deer are bucks, we can calculate this as follows:

Total deer = 50
Bucks = 50% of 50 = 0.5 * 50 = 25

Next, we need to find the number of 8-point bucks. Since 20% of the bucks are 8-point, we can calculate this as follows:

8-point bucks = 20% of 25 = 0.2 * 25 = 5

So, there are 5 8-point bucks in the field.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the total points collected by Adam, Betty, Martha, and Tom, and then subtract that from the minimum threshold of 400 points.

Adam has 50 points.

Betty collected 30% more than Adam. To find 30% of 50, we multiply 50 by 0.3, which is 15. So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.

Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom, so Martha has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up the points collected by Adam, Betty, Martha, and Tom: 50 + 65 + 105 + 35 = 255 points.

To find out how many points the class is missing, we subtract the total points collected from the minimum threshold: 400 - 255 = 145 points.

The final answer is: 145"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of great-grandchildren and then multiply it by the number of great-grandbabies each of them has.

First, let's find the number of Great Grandma Jones' children: 3.

Each of her children has 3 children of their own, so the total number of grandchildren is 3 * 3 = 9.

Each of these grandchildren has 3 babies of their own, so the total number of great-grandbabies is 9 * 3 = 27.

Therefore, there will be 27 great-grandbabies at the family reunion for Great Grandma Jones to kiss.

The final answer is: 27"
"To find out how much money Greta has left to spend, we need to calculate the amount she puts into her retirement account and her car payment, then subtract those amounts from her total paycheck.

First, let's calculate the amount she puts into her retirement account: 50% of $2400.00 is 0.5 x $2400.00 = $1200.00.

Next, let's calculate the amount she uses for her car payment: 20% of $2400.00 is 0.2 x $2400.00 = $480.00.

Now, let's subtract these amounts from her total paycheck: $2400.00 - $1200.00 - $480.00 = $720.00.

So, Greta has $720.00 left to spend.

The final answer is: $720.00"
"To find the number of pairs of pencils in the box, we first need to determine the total number of pencils in the box. Since there are 4 pencils missing, we subtract 4 from the total capacity of the box, which is 20.

20 (total capacity) - 4 (missing pencils) = 16 pencils

Now, we need to find the number of pairs of pencils. A pair consists of 2 pencils. To find the number of pairs, we divide the total number of pencils by 2.

16 pencils / 2 = 8 pairs

"To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we first need to calculate the total number of fireworks set off in the city and then find 40% of that number. 

The city is setting off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks set off in the city is 15 * 20 = 300.

40% of 300 is 0.4 * 300 = 120.

Hannah will also set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each in her backyard, which is 3 * 5 = 15 fireworks.

So, the total number of fireworks Hannah will see is 120 (from the city) + 15 (from her backyard) = 135.

The final answer is: 135"
"To find the total amount spent on snacks and drinks, we first need to determine the total number of people and the total number of items (drinks and snacks) they buy.

Aiden and his 12 friends make 13 people. When they meet up with 7 more friends, the total number of people becomes 13 + 7 = 20.

Each person buys enough drinks and snacks to fill the seats, which means each person buys 2 drinks and 3 snacks. So, the total number of drinks and snacks bought is 20 * 2 (drinks) + 20 * 3 (snacks) = 40 drinks + 60 snacks = 100 items.

Since each item costs $2, the total amount spent on snacks and drinks is 100 items * $2 = $200.

The final answer is: $200"
"To find out how many pounds of gravel Gary's truck can carry, we need to first determine how much Gordy's truck can carry. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, and Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds, Gordy's truck can carry 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.

Now, we know that the combined capacity of all three trucks is 11,600 pounds. We already know that Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds and Gordy's truck can carry 4,800 pounds. To find out how much Gary's truck can carry, we subtract the combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity of all three trucks.

Gary's truck capacity = Total capacity - (Gissela's capacity + Gordy's capacity)
Gary's truck capacity = 11,600 - (4,000 + 4,800)
Gary's truck capacity = 11,600 - 8,800
Gary's truck capacity = 2,800

The final answer is: 2800"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of dumplings each male ate. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, and each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

There are 8 males in the group, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32.

There are 6 females in the group, and each female ate 3 dumplings, so the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.

The total number of dumplings eaten by the group is 32 (by males) + 18 (by females) = 50.

Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is equal to the total number of dumplings eaten by the group, which is 50.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how much money Gerald had initially, we need to determine the total parts in the ratio and Gerald's share. The ratio is 3:2, so the total parts are 3 + 2 = 5.

Gerald's share is 3 out of 5 parts, so we can find his initial amount by multiplying his share by the total amount: (3/5) * 100 = 60.

Now, we know Gerald spent $10 on a book, so we subtract that from his initial amount to find out how much he has left: 60 - 10 = 50.

The final answer is: $50"
"To find the speed of the turtle, we need to divide the speed of the cat by 5, since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle. 

Speed of the cat = 15 feet/second
Speed of the turtle = Speed of the cat / 5
Speed of the turtle = 15 / 5
Speed of the turtle = 3 feet/second

Now, we can find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds by multiplying its speed by the time.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 3 feet/second * 40 seconds
Distance = 120 feet

The final answer is: 120"
"To find out how many hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we need to first determine how much they need to raise per hour to reach their goal. 

The total amount they need to raise is $6300, and they have already raised $2100 in 3 hours. 

The amount they need to raise in total is $6300 - $2100 = $4200.

Since they have already raised $2100 in 3 hours, the amount they need to raise per hour is $2100 / 3 = $700.

To find out how many hours they need to fundraise to raise $4200, we can divide the total amount they need to raise by the amount they raise per hour: $4200 / $700 = 6.

So, they need to fundraise for 6 more hours to reach their goal.

"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we first need to find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city. 

The city uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River. 

Next, we need to find the percentage of the water used by the city for industrial purposes. 80% of the water used by the city is used for industrial purposes. 

So, the percentage of the water used by the city for non-industrial purposes is 100% - 80% = 20%. 

Since the city uses 40% of the river's total water, the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes is 40% * 20% = 8%.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the rate at which the factory makes chocolate and vanilla ice cream per hour.

For chocolate ice cream, the factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours. To find the rate per hour, we divide the total quarts by the number of hours: 100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts per hour.

For vanilla ice cream, the factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours. To find the rate per hour, we divide the total quarts by the number of hours: 50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now, we need to find the total quarts made in 48 hours. We multiply the rate per hour for each flavor by the total number of hours and add the results together: (50 quarts/hour * 48 hours) + (12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours) = 2400 + 600 = 3000 quarts.

"To find Marcus' total bill, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he ordered and then apply the 10% discount.

First, let's calculate the total cost of each type of item:

- 5 croissants at $3.00 apiece: 5 x $3.00 = $15.00
- 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each: 4 x $2.50 = $10.00
- 3 mini quiches at $4.00 apiece: 3 x $4.00 = $12.00
- 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 apiece: 13 x $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
$15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Since Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him 10% off his purchase, we need to calculate the discount amount:
10% of $50.00 = 0.10 x $50.00 = $5.00

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total cost:
$50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many scoops Erin can buy with her $6.00. Since each scoop costs $1.50, we can divide the total amount of money Erin has by the cost of each scoop.

$6.00 ÷ $1.50 = 4

This means Erin can buy 4 scoops of ice cream. However, the deal is buy 2 scoops get 1 free, so we need to consider this when calculating the total number of scoops Erin can get.

If Erin buys 2 scoops, she will get 1 free, making it 3 scoops for the price of 2. If she buys 4 scoops, she will get 2 free, making it 6 scoops for the price of 4. Since Erin has $6.00, she can buy 4 scoops and get 2 free, which is the best deal for her.

Therefore, Erin should buy 4 scoops of ice cream.

"To find out how much more candy Amy has after two weeks, we need to calculate the total amount of candy each of them eats in two weeks and subtract that from their initial amount.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces.

Ginger starts with 100 pieces and eats 56, so she has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces left.

Amy starts with 100 pieces and eats 42, so she has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces left.

To find out how much more candy Amy has, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's remaining candy: 58 - 44 = 14.

"To find the total number of tiles needed, we first need to calculate the area of two-thirds of the bathroom. 

The area of the entire bathroom is 36 sq ft. To find two-thirds of this area, we multiply 36 by 2/3.

36 * (2/3) = 36 * 2 / 3 = 72 / 3 = 24

So, two-thirds of the bathroom is 24 sq ft. 

Since Mr. Boarden needs 24 tiles per square foot, we multiply the area of two-thirds of the bathroom by 24.

24 * 24 = 576

Therefore, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two-thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many slices were eaten by Bryce and his friends, and then subtract that from the total number of slices.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 5 people in total, including Bryce, and 2/3 of them ate 2/3 of their pizzas, we can calculate the number of slices eaten by this group. 

First, let's find out how many slices Bryce and his two friends ate in total. Since each pizza has 12 slices, and there are 5 people, there are 5 pizzas in total. 2/3 of 5 is 10/3, which is approximately 3.33. Since each pizza has 12 slices, 3.33 pizzas have 3.33 * 12 = 39.96 slices. However, since you can't eat a fraction of a slice, we'll round down to 39 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 5 people in total, and 2 friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas, the other 2 friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. 2/3 of the pizzas were eaten by 2 friends, so 1/3 of the pizzas were eaten by the other 2 friends. Since 1/3 of the pizzas were eaten by 2 friends, 2/3 of the pizzas were eaten by 2 friends. So, the other 2 friends ate ¾ of 2/3 of the pizzas. 2/3 of 5 is 10/3, which is approximately 3.33. ¾ of 3.33 is 2.5. Since each pizza has 12 slices, 2.5 pizzas have 2.5 * 12 = 30 slices.

Now, let's add the slices eaten by both groups. 39 slices + 30 slices = 69 slices.

Since there are 5 pizzas in total, and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is 5 * 12 = 60 slices.

Now, let's subtract the slices eaten from the total number of slices. 60 - 69 = -9. However, since you can't have a negative number of slices, this means that there are not enough slices to cover the number of slices eaten. This is a problem with the given information.

However, if we assume that the problem is asking for the number of slices left after the friends ate their pizzas, we can try to find the number of slices left. Since there are 5 pizzas in total, and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is 5 * 12 = 60 slices. We know that 69 slices were eaten, but we can't have a negative number of slices.

"To find the average time the cat and dog take to eat the sausages, we first need to determine the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages. 

The cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes. Since the dog eats the same number of sausages in 2/3 the amount of time the cat takes, we can calculate the dog's time as follows:

Dog's time = (2/3) * Cat's time
Dog's time = (2/3) * 30 minutes
Dog's time = 20 minutes

Now, we have the time taken by both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. To find the average time, we add their times and divide by 2:

Average time = (Cat's time + Dog's time) / 2
Average time = (30 minutes + 20 minutes) / 2
Average time = 50 minutes / 2
Average time = 25 minutes

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to first convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so we multiply 8 feet by 12 and add 4 inches.

8 feet * 12 inches/foot = 96 inches
96 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 100 inches, and it's 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's represent the length of one of Bobby's shoes as 'x'. We can write an equation based on this information:

100 = 9x + 10

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x' on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 10 from both sides:

100 - 10 = 9x + 10 - 10
90 = 9x

Next, we divide both sides by 9 to find the value of 'x':

90 / 9 = x
10 = x

The length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

"To find the total number of windows smashed by Hannah, we need to calculate the number of windows from students' cars and teachers' cars separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of windows from students' cars. There are 64 students' cars with 4 windows each. A quarter of the students' cars' windows are smashed, which is 1/4 * 64 = 16 cars. Since each car has 4 windows, the total number of windows from students' cars is 16 * 4 = 64.

Next, let's find the number of windows from teachers' cars. There are 32 teachers' cars with 2 windows each. Three-fourths of the teachers' cars' windows are smashed, which is 3/4 * 32 = 24 cars. Since each car has 2 windows, the total number of windows from teachers' cars is 24 * 2 = 48.

Now, we add the number of windows from students' cars and teachers' cars to find the total number of windows smashed by Hannah. 64 + 48 = 112.

"To find the total number of blue spools, we need to add the number of light blue and dark blue spools together. 

Total blue spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60

Next, we need to find the total number of spools. 

Total spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 150

Now, we can find the percentage of blue spools by dividing the total number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of blue spools = (60 / 150) * 100 = 40%

The final answer is: 40"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Initially, 5000 people were in line at 8:00. By midday, 2/5 of them had voted. 

2/5 of 5000 is (2/5) * 5000 = 2000 people who voted by midday.

So, the number of people remaining by midday is 5000 - 2000 = 3000.

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. 

2/3 of 3000 is (2/3) * 3000 = 2000 people who voted by 16:00.

So, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 3000 - 2000 = 1000.

"To find out how many packs of gum Parker will need, we need to calculate the total number of pieces of gum he will chew in 30 days and then divide that by the number of pieces in a pack.

Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day. To find the total number of pieces he will chew in 30 days, we multiply the number of pieces he chews per day by 30:

4 pieces/day * 30 days = 120 pieces

Now, we need to divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces in a pack to find out how many packs he will need:

120 pieces / 15 pieces/pack = 8 packs

So, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days.

"To determine the number of boxes of graham crackers needed, we first need to calculate the total number of s'mores required. 

9 kids want 2 s'mores each, so the total number of s'mores for kids is 9 * 2 = 18. 
6 adults will eat 1 s'more each, so the total number of s'mores for adults is 6 * 1 = 6. 
The total number of s'mores needed is 18 (for kids) + 6 (for adults) = 24.

Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 large s'mores, we need to divide the total number of s'mores by 8 to find out how many sleeves are needed. 
24 s'mores / 8 s'mores per sleeve = 3 sleeves.

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we need to divide the total number of sleeves needed by 3 to find out how many boxes are required. 
3 sleeves / 3 sleeves per box = 1 box.

Therefore, they will need 1 box of graham crackers.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the ages of Dora's father and mother.

Given that Dora is 15 years old, we can find her father's age by using the information that her father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. 

Let's denote Dora's father's age as F and Dora's age as D. We have the equation: F = 2D + 8. Since Dora is 15, we can substitute D = 15 into the equation to find F.

F = 2(15) + 8
F = 30 + 8
F = 38

Now that we know Dora's father is 38 years old, we can find her mother's age. We are given that Dora's mother is four years younger than her father. 

Let's denote Dora's mother's age as M. We have the equation: M = F - 4. Since F = 38, we can substitute F into the equation to find M.

M = 38 - 4
M = 34

Now that we know Dora's age (15), her father's age (38), and her mother's age (34), we can find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother.

Total combined age = D + F + M
Total combined age = 15 + 38 + 34
Total combined age = 87

"To find the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying, we need to calculate the weight of each book and then add them together.

Cindy has 3 math and science books, so the total weight of these books is 3 x 2 = 6 pounds.

Her French book weighs 4 pounds and her English book weighs 3 pounds.

Her history book weighs twice as much as her English book, so the weight of the history book is 2 x 3 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of all the books together: 6 (math and science) + 4 (French) + 3 (English) + 6 (history) = 19 pounds.

The total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is 19 pounds.

"To find the number of votes candidate C received, we first need to determine the number of votes candidate B received. 

Candidate A received 20% of the votes, which is 0.2 * 100 = 20 votes.

Candidate B received 50% more than candidate A's votes, so the number of votes candidate B received is 20 + (50% of 20) = 20 + (0.5 * 20) = 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

Since there are 100 voters in total, the number of votes candidate C received is 100 - (votes received by A + votes received by B) = 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 votes.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many apples Beck has initially. Since Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, and Boris has 100 apples, we can calculate Beck's initial apples as follows:

Beck's initial apples = Boris's apples - 23
Beck's initial apples = 100 - 23
Beck's initial apples = 77

Now, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. So, Beck's new total is:

Beck's new apples = Beck's initial apples + 10
Beck's new apples = 77 + 10
Beck's new apples = 87

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris. Boris still has 100 apples, and Beck has 87 apples. So, the difference is:

Difference = Boris's apples - Beck's new apples
Difference = 100 - 87
Difference = 13

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many books Steven has. Since Clara has two times as many books as Steven and Clara has 20 books, we can set up the equation:

2 * Steven's books = 20

To find Steven's books, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

Steven's books = 20 / 2
Steven's books = 10

Now that we know Steven has 10 books, we can find out how many books Alice has. Alice has 6 more books than Steven, so:

Alice's books = Steven's books + 6
Alice's books = 10 + 6
Alice's books = 16

Now that we know Alice has 16 books and Clara has 20 books, we can find out how many more books Clara has than Alice:

Difference = Clara's books - Alice's books
Difference = 20 - 16
Difference = 4

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the cost of a half-gallon jar. Since a gallon jar costs $5 and it's $2 more than a half-gallon jar, we can set up the equation:

Gallon jar = Half-gallon jar + $2
$5 = Half-gallon jar + $2
Half-gallon jar = $5 - $2
Half-gallon jar = $3

Now that we know the cost of a half-gallon jar, we can find the cost of 16 half-gallon jars:
16 * $3 = $48

Next, we need to find the cost of 10-gallon jars. Since a gallon jar costs $5, we can multiply this by 10:
10 * $5 = $50

Now, we can add the cost of 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars to find the total amount of money Cecelia spent:
$50 + $48 = $98

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of students who like to play music. We are given that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number who like to play basketball. Since 5 students like to play basketball, the number of students who like to play music is 2 * 5 = 10.

We know that the total number of students in the class is 50. We also know that 10 students like to bake and 5 like to play basketball. So, the number of students who like to play video games or music is 50 - 10 - 5 = 35.

Since we know that 10 students like to play music, the number of students who like to play video games is 35 - 10 = 25.

"To find the number of boys in each class, we first need to determine the total number of girls in the school. Since 40% of the students in each class are girls, and there are two classes, the total percentage of girls in the school is 80% (40% * 2 classes).

We can calculate the total number of girls in the school by multiplying the total number of students by the total percentage of girls:

Total students = 80
Total percentage of girls = 80%
Number of girls = Total students * (Total percentage of girls / 100)
= 80 * (80 / 100)
= 64

Since there are two classes, we can find the number of girls in each class by dividing the total number of girls by 2:

Number of girls in each class = Number of girls / 2
= 64 / 2
= 32

Now, we can find the number of boys in each class by subtracting the number of girls from the total number of students in each class. Since each class has the same number of students, we can divide the total number of students by 2 to find the number of students in each class:

Total students = 80
Number of students in each class = Total students / 2
= 80 / 2
= 40

Number of boys in each class = Number of students in each class - Number of girls in each class
= 40 - 32

The vendor used to buy 500 tomatoes a day at $.5 each, so his daily cost was 500 * $.5 = $250.

With the new vendor, he buys the same 500 tomatoes at $.4 each, so his new daily cost is 500 * $.4 = $200.

The daily savings is the difference between the old cost and the new cost: $250 - $200 = $50.

To find the weekly savings, we multiply the daily savings by 7: $50 * 7 = $350.

Now, we know that Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. So, we can find out how many marbles Carl has by multiplying Sean's marbles by 4.

Carl's marbles = 56 * 4 = 224

Now that we know how many marbles Carl and Cal have, we can find out their combined total by adding their marbles together.

Combined marbles = Carl's marbles + Cal's marbles

However, the problem states that the activity requires 12 groups. To find the total number of students needed for 12 groups, we can multiply 12 by 9.

12 * 9 = 108

Since there are only 54 students, we need to find out how many more students are required to form 12 groups of 9. However, the question asks for the number of groups needed, not the number of students. 

Since we already know that 6 groups can be formed with 54 students, we need to find the number of groups that can be formed with 54 students. We already know that 6 groups can be formed. To find the number of groups needed to form with 54 students, we can divide 54 by 9.

So, when Gunther began counting bananas on the third day, he found 43 bananas in the pile.

The final answer is: 43"
"To find out how much each roommate will pay per year, we first need to calculate the total annual electricity bill. Since the monthly bill is $100, we multiply this by 12 to get the yearly amount.

Total yearly bill = $100 * 12
Total yearly bill = $1200

Since there are 4 roommates, we divide the total yearly bill by 4 to find out how much each roommate will pay.

Each roommate's share = Total yearly bill / Number of roommates
Each roommate's share = $1200 / 4
Each roommate's share = $300

The final answer is: $300"
"To find out how many glasses and plates Jeff has now, we need to calculate the total number of items he initially sent and then subtract the number of broken items.

First, let's calculate the total number of glasses and plates Jeff initially sent. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, we can multiply the number of dozens by 12.

Glasses: 8 dozen * 12 = 96 glasses
Plates: 4 dozen * 12 = 48 plates

Now, let's subtract the number of broken items from the total number of items.

Glasses: 96 - 10 = 86
Plates: 48 - 6 = 42

So, Jeff has 86 glasses and 42 plates now. 

The final answer is: 
Glasses: 86
Plates: 42"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, Lorraine has 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

First, she trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 90% of 30 is 0.9 * 30 = 27. So, she trades 27 small stickers for large buttons. Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons.

Now, she has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

Next, she trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 50% of 40 is 0.5 * 40 = 20. So, she trades 20 large stickers for large buttons. Since each large sticker is worth a large button, she gets 20 large buttons.

Now, she has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

She trades the rest of her large stickers (20) for small buttons. Since each large sticker is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

Now, let's count the total number of buttons she has: 27 small buttons + 20 large buttons + 60 small buttons = 107 buttons.

The final answer is: 107"
"To find the total number of matches Joey played in one week, we need to add up the matches he played on each day.

On Monday, Joey played 2 matches.
On Friday, Joey played 1 match.
On Saturday, Joey played double the number of matches he played on Monday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 matches.

Now, let's add up the total number of matches: 2 (Monday) + 1 (Friday) + 4 (Saturday) = 7 matches.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as 'x'. Since the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, the number of votes in favor can be represented as 2x.

We know that the total number of council members is 33. The sum of the votes in favor and against the new regulation should equal the total number of council members. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:

3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 11

Since x represents the number of votes against the new regulation, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 2x:

2x = 2 * 11
2x = 22

The final answer is: 22"
"To find the total number of shirts ordered, we need to calculate the number of students for each size and add them up.

So, you will pay $133 after the discount.

The final answer is: $133"
"To find the total number of hours the 20 playlists will last, we need to first find the total number of songs across all playlists and then multiply that by the length of each song.

The total number of songs across all playlists is the number of songs in one playlist multiplied by the number of playlists: 300 songs/playlist * 20 playlists = 6000 songs.

Since each song is 10 hours long, the total number of hours the playlists will last is the total number of songs multiplied by the length of each song: 6000 songs * 10 hours/song = 60,000 hours.

The final answer is: 60000"
"To find the number of people who think horse #12 will win, we first need to find the number of people who think horse #2 will win and then the number of people who think horse #7 will win.

20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win. To find 20% of 50, we multiply 50 by 0.2.

50 * 0.2 = 10

So, 10 people think horse #2 will win.

Now, 60% of the remaining people think horse #7 will win. The remaining people are 50 - 10 = 40. To find 60% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.6.

40 * 0.6 = 24

So, 24 people think horse #7 will win.

Now, we know that 10 people think horse #2 will win, 24 people think horse #7 will win, and the rest think horse #12 will win. To find the number of people who think horse #12 will win, we subtract the number of people who think horse #2 and horse #7 will win from the total number of people.

50 - 10 - 24 = 16

So, 16 people think that horse #12 will win.

The final answer is: 16"
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given. We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. 

Let's denote the total number of Pomeranians as P. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we can set up the equation:

1/3 * P = 6

To find the total number of Pomeranians, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3:

P = 6 * 3
P = 18

Now that we know there are 18 Pomeranians, and two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can denote the total number of puppies as J. We can set up the equation:

2/3 * J = 18

To find the total number of puppies, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3/2:

J = 18 * (3/2)
J = 27

So, Jana has 27 puppies. 

The final answer is: 27"
"To find out how much more Jayden needs to buy the camera, we first need to calculate how much money he has after receiving the money from his sister. 

Jayden initially had $70. His sister gave him half of her $90 allowance, which is $45. 

So, Jayden now has $70 + $45 = $115.

The camera costs $200. To find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the amount he has from the cost of the camera: $200 - $115 = $85.

Therefore, Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera.

The final answer is: $85"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. 

Let's denote the number of cases of shingles the second house needs as 'x'. Since the first house needs 1/2 of what the second house needs, the first house needs x/2 cases of shingles.

We are given that the third house needs double the first house, so the third house needs 2 * (x/2) = x cases of shingles.

We know that the total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. We can set up an equation to represent this:

x + (x/2) + x = 250

To simplify the equation, we can multiply all terms by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + x + 2x = 500

Combine like terms:

5x = 500

Now, divide both sides by 5:

x = 100

Since the third house needs x cases of shingles, and we found that x = 100, the third house needs 100 cases of shingles.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of the items each person bought and then add them together.

Leila bought 3 cucumbers at $2 each, so the total cost for Leila is 3 * $2 = $6.

Jack bought 5 tomatoes at $1 each, so the total cost for Jack is 5 * $1 = $5.

Chase bought 1 head of lettuce at $3, so the total cost for Chase is $3.

Now, let's add the costs together: $6 (Leila) + $5 (Jack) + $3 (Chase) = $14.

"To find the number of pears George has, we need to calculate 45% of the number of bananas and add it to the number of bananas. 

First, let's find 45% of 200 bananas:
45% of 200 = 0.45 * 200 = 90

Now, let's add this to the number of bananas:
200 (bananas) + 90 (additional pears) = 290

Since George has both bananas and pears, we need to add the number of bananas and pears to find the total number of fruits:
290 (bananas and pears) + 200 (bananas) = 490

The total number of fruits George has is 490."
"To find out how many candy bars Marissa bought for Jimmy, we need to subtract the cost of the ball from the amount of money Marissa had initially. 

Marissa had $80 initially and spent $20 on the ball. 

$80 (initial amount) - $20 (cost of the ball) = $60

Now, we need to find out how many candy bars Marissa can buy with $60, given that each candy bar costs $5.

$60 (remaining amount) / $5 (cost of each candy bar) = 12

So, Marissa bought 12 candy bars for Jimmy.

12"
"To find out how much money Sam needs to spend to make 4 liters of juice, we first need to determine how many kilograms of oranges are required to make 4 liters of juice. Since Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges to make 1 liter of juice, we can multiply this by 4 to find the total amount of oranges needed for 4 liters.

5 kilograms/orange * 4 liters/orange = 20 kilograms/orange

Now, we know that each kilogram of oranges costs $3. To find the total cost, we multiply the total amount of oranges needed by the cost per kilogram.

20 kilograms/orange * $3/kilogram = $60

So, Sam would have to spend $60 to make 4 liters of juice.

The final answer is: $60"
"To find out how many books Ahmed read, we need to divide the number of books Ezra read by 2, since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed. 

Ezra read 300 books, so Ahmed read 300 / 2 = 150 books.

Now, we need to add the number of books Ezra decided to read to the number of books he has already read. Ezra decided to read 150 more books, so he will have read 300 + 150 = 450 books in total.

To find the total number of books they have read altogether, we need to add the number of books Ezra will have read to the number of books Ahmed has read. 

Total books read = 450 (Ezra) + 150 (Ahmed) = 600

The final answer is: 600"
"To calculate Tanya's earnings, we need to break down her earnings into two parts: her hourly earnings and her daily bonus.

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Since she earns $15 per hour, her total hourly earnings for Monday are 5 hours * $15/hour = $75. 

However, she also earns a daily bonus of $5 for teaching more than 3 classes. Since she teaches 4 classes on Monday, she earns the daily bonus. So, her total earnings for Monday are $75 (hourly earnings) + $5 (daily bonus) = $80.

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Her hourly earnings for Wednesday are 2 hours * $15/hour = $30.

Since she teaches less than 3 classes on Wednesday, she does not earn a daily bonus. So, her total earnings for Wednesday are $30 (hourly earnings).

To find Tanya's total earnings for the two days, we add her earnings for Monday and Wednesday: $80 (Monday) + $30 (Wednesday) = $110.

The final answer is: $110"
"To find the difference in the number of vanilla scents sold compared to the fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of each type of scent sold.

The company sold 5 vanilla scents and there are 4 vanilla scents available, so the total number of vanilla scents sold is 5 * 4 = 20.

The company sold 2 fruity scents and there are 8 fruity scents available, so the total number of fruity scents sold is 2 * 8 = 16.

Now, we need to find the difference between the total number of vanilla scents sold and the total number of fruity scents sold. 

Difference = Total vanilla scents sold - Total fruity scents sold
Difference = 20 - 16
Difference = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate how much money Bennet will make from selling the eggplants. 

He sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total amount he will make from eggplants is 20 * 3 = $60.

Since Bennet wants to make a total of $135, and he will make $60 from the eggplants, he needs to make $135 - $60 = $75 from selling the corn.

He has 25 ears of corn, and he needs to make $75 from them. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the total amount he needs to make from corn ($75) by the number of ears of corn (25).

$75 / 25 = $3

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To find the total time Tatiana has available for soccer, video games, and reading, we need to add the hours she has on Saturday and Sunday. 

Total time available = 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

She reads for 3 hours, so the remaining time for soccer and video games is:
Remaining time = Total time available - Time spent reading
Remaining time = 12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours

She plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time:
Time spent playing video games = 1/3 * 9 hours = 3 hours

Now, we can find the time spent playing soccer:
Time spent playing soccer = Remaining time - Time spent playing video games
Time spent playing soccer = 9 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours

To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we divide the time spent playing soccer by the total time available and multiply by 100:
Percentage of weekend spent playing soccer = (Time spent playing soccer / Total time available) * 100
Percentage of weekend spent playing soccer = (6 hours / 12 hours) * 100 = 50%

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how many pencils Anthony kept, we need to follow the steps of the problem.

Anthony started with 50 pencils. He gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon. 

1/2 of 50 is 50 * 0.5 = 25 pencils given to Brandon. 
So, Anthony has 50 - 25 = 25 pencils left.

Then, he gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. 

3/5 of 25 is 25 * 0.6 = 15 pencils given to Charlie. 
So, Anthony has 25 - 15 = 10 pencils left.

Therefore, Anthony kept 10 pencils.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time it takes for him to drive to the museum and back, and then add the time he spends at the museum.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Jack to drive to the museum:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 150 miles / 75 mph
Time = 2 hours

Since he drives to the museum and back, we need to multiply the time by 2:

Total driving time = 2 hours * 2 = 4 hours

Now, we add the time he spends at the museum to the total driving time:

Total time = Total driving time + Time at the museum
Total time = 4 hours + 6 hours
Total time = 10 hours

"To find out how many wheels Henry will need in total, we need to calculate the number of wheels required for the cars and the motorcycles separately, and then add them together.

For the cars, Henry needs 4 wheels for each of the 57 cars. So, the total number of wheels required for the cars is 57 * 4 = 228.

For the motorcycles, Henry needs 2 wheels for each of the 73 motorcycles. So, the total number of wheels required for the motorcycles is 73 * 2 = 146.

Now, we add the total number of wheels required for the cars and the motorcycles: 228 + 146 = 374.

Since Henry has a box with 650 wheels, we subtract the total number of wheels required from the total number of wheels available: 650 - 374 = 276.

The final answer is: 276"
"To find the amount you have to pay after a 20% discount, we need to calculate 20% of the original price and subtract it from the original price.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how many movies are in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of movies in series = Total movies / 3
= 600 / 3
= 200

Now, we know that the cost of buying the series is $6 per movie, but we need to find the total cost of the series. Since we don't know the number of movies in each series, we'll assume that the cost of the series is $6 times the number of movies in series. However, we can't calculate the total cost of the series yet because we don't know the number of series. We'll come back to this later.

Next, let's find out how many movies are not in series. We can do this by subtracting the number of movies in series from the total number of movies:

Number of movies not in series = Total movies - Number of movies in series
= 600 - 200
= 400

Now, let's find out how many of these movies are older movies. Since 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of older movies = Number of movies not in series * 0.4
= 400 * 0.4
= 160

The remaining movies are not older movies, so they are normal movies. We can find the number of normal movies as follows:

Number of normal movies = Number of movies not in series - Number of older movies
= 400 - 160
= 240

Now, we know that normal movies cost $10 each, older movies cost $5 each, and series movies cost $6 each. We can calculate the total cost of the movies as follows:

Total cost = (Number of normal movies * $10) + (Number of older movies * $5) + (Number of movies in series * $6)

However, we still don't know the number of series. Let's go back to the cost of the series. We know that the cost of the series is $6 per movie, but we need to find the total cost of the series. Since we don't know the number of series, we'll assume that the number of series is 'x'. Then, the total cost of the series is $6x.

Now, we can rewrite the total cost equation as follows:

Total cost = (Number of normal movies * $10) + (Number of older movies * $5) + $6x

Substituting the values we know, we get:

Total cost = (240 * $10) + (160 * $5) + $6x
= $2400 + $800 + $6x
= $3200 + $6x

We know that the total number of movies is 600, and we've already accounted for 400 movies (240 normal movies and 160 older movies). The remaining movies are in series, which is 200 movies. Since the number of series is 'x', we can set up the equation:

x = 200

Now, we can substitute the value of 'x' into the total cost equation:

Total cost = $3200 + $6 * 200
= $3200 + $1200
= $4400

The final answer is: $4400"

The cost of plums is 8 pounds * $1.00 per pound = $8.00
The cost of apricots is 6 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $18.00

Now, we add the costs together: $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00

The final answer is: $38.00"
"To find the distance to their vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance they traveled by driving and hiking, and then add them together.

First, let's find the speed at which they hiked. They drove at an average of 50 miles per hour, and they hiked at an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Half of 50 is 25, and 5 miles per hour less than that is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

Now, let's calculate the distance they traveled by driving. They drove for 6 hours at 50 miles per hour, so the distance they traveled by driving is 6 * 50 = 300 miles.

Next, let's calculate the distance they traveled by hiking. They hiked for 1.5 hours at 20 miles per hour, so the distance they traveled by hiking is 1.5 * 20 = 30 miles.

Now, we add the distance they traveled by driving and hiking to find the total distance to their vacation spot: 300 + 30 = 330 miles.

The final answer is: 330"
"To find the difference in their scores, we need to calculate the points each of them earns from enemies, berries, and the timer.

Let's assume Emma's score from enemies is x. Since Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, Ava's score from enemies will be x + 8.

Emma's score from berries is 3 (since she collects 3 berries), and Ava collects 3 + 3 = 6 berries.

Now, let's consider the timer. The longer Ava takes, the lower her score will be. Since Ava finishes 4 seconds slower than Emma, let's assume Emma finishes the level in t seconds. Then, Ava finishes in t + 4 seconds.

Emma's score from the timer is 30t, and Ava's score from the timer is 30(t + 4).

The total score for Emma is x + 3 + 30t, and the total score for Ava is x + 8 + 6 + 30(t + 4).

Simplifying Ava's total score, we get x + 8 + 6 + 30t + 120 = x + 134 + 30t.

The difference in their scores is (x + 134 + 30t) - (x + 3 + 30t) = 131.

"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we first need to determine the total cost of the two pizzas that are already known. Since two pizzas cost 30 dollars each, the total cost for these two pizzas is 2 * 30 = 60 dollars.

Now, we subtract the cost of these two pizzas from the total cost of all four pizzas to find the total cost of the other two pizzas. The total cost of all four pizzas is 64 dollars, so the total cost of the other two pizzas is 64 - 60 = 4 dollars.

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we can find the cost of each pizza by dividing the total cost of the other two pizzas by 2. The cost of each of the other two pizzas is 4 / 2 = 2 dollars.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Chase and Rider ride their bikes 3 times a day for 5 days, which is a total of 3 * 5 = 15 times.

On the two other days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, which means they ride 2 * 3 = 6 times each day.

So, for the two special days, they ride a total of 6 * 2 = 12 times.

Now, let's add the total number of times they ride on the usual days (15) and the special days (12) to get the total number of times they ride in a week.

15 + 12 = 27

"Let's break down the information given:

Initially, Bob had 7 fish in his pond: 3 orange and 4 white.

After buying more fish, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Let's denote the number of white fish he bought as 'x'. The number of orange fish he bought would then be 2x.

The total number of fish in the pond after buying more fish is 7 (initial fish) + x (white fish bought) + 2x (orange fish bought) = 3x + 7.

Since the total number of fish in the pond is the sum of the initial fish and the fish bought, we can also express it as 3 (initial orange fish) + x (white fish bought) + 17 (fish bought from the pet store) = 3 + x + 17 = x + 20.

Equating the two expressions for the total number of fish, we get 3x + 7 = x + 20.

Subtracting x from both sides gives us 2x + 7 = 20.

Subtracting 7 from both sides gives us 2x = 13.

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us x = 6.5.

However, since we can't buy a fraction of a fish, this is not a valid solution. Let's re-examine the problem.

The total number of fish in the pond after buying more fish is 3 (initial orange fish) + x (white fish bought) + 17 (fish bought from the pet store) = 3 + x + 17 = x + 20.

The number of white fish in the pond after buying more fish is 4 (initial white fish) + x (white fish bought).

Since Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up the equation: 3 + x = 2(4 + x).

Simplifying the equation, we get 3 + x = 8 + 2x.

Subtracting x from both sides gives us 3 = 8 + x.

Subtracting 8 from both sides gives us -5 = x.

However, this is not a valid solution since we can't have a negative number of fish.

Let's re-examine the problem again.

The total number of fish in the pond after buying more fish is 3 (initial orange fish) + x (white fish bought) + 17 (fish bought from the pet store) = 3 + x + 17 = x + 20.

The number of white fish in the pond after buying more fish is 4 (initial white fish) + x (white fish bought).

Since Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up the equation: 3 + x = 2(4 + x - 4).

Simplifying the equation, we get 3 + x = 2x.

Subtracting x from both sides gives us 3 = x.

However, this is not a valid solution since we know that Bob bought more than 3 white fish.

Let's re-examine the problem again.

The total number of fish in the pond after buying more fish is 3 (initial orange fish) + x (white fish bought) + 17 (fish bought from the pet store) = 3 + x + 17 = x + 20.

The number of white fish in the pond after buying more fish is 4 (initial white fish) + x (white fish bought).

Since Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up the equation: 3 + x = 2(4 + x - 4 + 4).

Simplifying the equation, we get 3 + x = 2(4 + x).

Simplifying further, we get 3 + x = 8 + 2x.

Subtracting x from both sides gives us 3 = 8 + x.

Subtracting 8 from both sides gives us -5 = x.

However, this is not a valid solution since we can't have a negative number of fish.

Let's re-examine the problem again.

The total number of fish in the pond after buying more fish is 3 (initial orange fish) + x (white fish bought) + 17 (fish bought from the pet store) = 3 + x + 17 = x + 20.

The number of white fish in the pond after buying more fish is 4 (initial white fish) + x (white fish bought).

Since Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up the equation: 3 + x = 2(4 + x - 4 + 4 - 3).

Simplifying the equation, we get 3 + x = 2(4 + x - 3).

Simplifying further, we get 3 + x = 2(1 + x).

Simplifying further, we get 3 + x = 2 + 2x.

Subtracting 2x from both sides gives us 3 - 2x = 2.

Subtracting 3 from both sides gives us -2x = -1.

Dividing both sides by -2 gives us x = 0.5.

However, this is not a valid solution since we can't buy a fraction of a fish.

Let's re-examine the problem again.

The total number of fish in the pond after buying more fish is 3 (initial orange fish) + x (white fish bought) + 17 (fish bought from the pet store) = 3 + x + 17 = x + 20.

The number of white fish in the pond after buying more fish is 4 (initial white fish) + x (white fish bought).

Since Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up the equation: 3 + x = 2(4 + x - 4 + 3 - 3).

Simplifying the equation, we get 3 + x = 2(4 + x).

Simplifying further, we get 3 + x = 8 + 2x.

Subtracting 2x from both sides gives us 3 - x = 8.

Subtracting 3 from both sides gives us -x = 5.

Dividing both sides by -1 gives us x = -5.

Since Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up the equation: 3 + x = 2(4 + x - 4 + 3).

Simplifying the equation, we get 3 + x = 2(3 + x).

Simplifying further, we get 3 + x = 6 + 2x.

Subtracting 2x from both sides gives us 3 - x = 6.

"To calculate the weekly fuel consumption, we need to determine the total miles driven per week and then divide it by the car's fuel efficiency.

The one-way distance between home and office is 5 miles, and Andy drives to and from work, so the total distance per day is 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles.

Since Andy drives to work from Monday to Friday, the total miles driven per week is 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.

Now, we can calculate the fuel consumption per week by dividing the total miles driven by the car's fuel efficiency: 50 miles/week / 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week.

The price of regular gas is $3/gallon, so the weekly fuel cost is 5 gallons/week * $3/gallon = $15/week.

The final numerical answer is: $15"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Carrie was given and then subtract the amount she spent.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie was given. She was given 10 twenties and 140 quarters. 

The value of 10 twenties is 10 x $20 = $200. 
The value of 140 quarters is 140 x $0.25 = $35.

So, the total amount of money Carrie was given is $200 + $35 = $235.

Carrie spent all the quarters, which is $35, and 3/5 of the twenties. 
3/5 of $200 is (3/5) x $200 = $120.

So, Carrie spent a total of $35 + $120 = $155.

The final answer is: $155"
"To find the total number of fruits Ricardo can get from his plants, we need to calculate the total number of tomatoes and eggplants separately and then add them together.

5 tomato plants * 22 tomatoes per plant = 110 tomatoes

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggplants: 
8 eggplant plants * 4 eggplants per plant = 32 eggplants

Now, we add the total number of tomatoes and eggplants together: 
110 tomatoes + 32 eggplants = 142 fruits

"To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we first need to determine the total percentage of smart TVs and analog TVs sold. 

One-fourth of the TVs are smart TVs, which is 1/4 or 25%. One-eighth of the TVs are analog TVs, which is 1/8 or 12.5%. 

The total percentage of smart TVs and analog TVs sold is 25% + 12.5% = 37.5%. 

Since the rest of the TVs are OLED, we subtract the total percentage of smart and analog TVs from 100% to find the percentage of OLED TVs. 

100% - 37.5% = 62.5%

Now, we can find the number of OLED TVs sold by multiplying the total number of TVs sold (40) by the percentage of OLED TVs (62.5% or 0.625).

Number of OLED TVs sold = 40 * 0.625 = 25

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how much money John is missing, we first need to determine how much the school will cover. Since the school is covering half the cost of the trip, we can calculate this as half of $300, which is $300 / 2 = $150.

Now, we know that John has $50 and the total cost of the trip is $300. Since the school is covering $150, John only needs to cover the remaining amount. This can be calculated as $300 - $150 = $150. However, John already has $50, so we need to subtract this from the total amount he needs to cover: $150 - $50 = $100.

The final answer is: $100"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the temperature at night and then calculate how many logs Carson needs to burn to reach the safe temperature of 32 degrees.

First, let's find the temperature at night. It's 33 degrees colder during the night compared to the day, and the day temperature is 45 degrees. 

Night temperature = Day temperature - 33
Night temperature = 45 - 33
Night temperature = 12 degrees

Since the pipes will freeze at 32 degrees, Carson needs to heat the house to at least 32 degrees. To find out how many logs he needs to burn, we'll divide the difference between the night temperature and the safe temperature by the temperature increase per log.

Number of logs needed = (Night temperature - Safe temperature) / Temperature increase per log
Number of logs needed = (12 - 32) / 5
Number of logs needed = -20 / 5
Number of logs needed = -4

Since we can't burn a negative number of logs, this means Carson needs to burn logs to heat the house up from 12 degrees to 32 degrees. We need to recalculate the number of logs needed to heat the house from 12 degrees to 32 degrees.

Number of logs needed = (Safe temperature - Night temperature) / Temperature increase per log
Number of logs needed = (32 - 12) / 5
Number of logs needed = 20 / 5
Number of logs needed = 4

"To find the total number of seashells brought back, we first need to determine the number of groups formed and the number of groups that brought back seashells.

Since 90 people were split into 9-person groups, we can find the total number of groups by dividing 90 by 9.

90 / 9 = 10

So, there were 10 groups in total.

Since 3/5 of the groups brought back seashells, we can find the number of groups that brought back seashells by multiplying 10 by 3/5.

10 * (3/5) = 6

Now, we know that each group that brought back seashells had 2 seashells. To find the total number of seashells brought back, we can multiply the number of groups that brought back seashells by 2.

6 * 2 = 12

Therefore, the total number of seashells brought back is 12.

"To find the number of people on the train after the two stops, we need to subtract the number of people who got off and add the number of people who got on.

Initially, there were 172 people on the train.

At the first stop, 47 people got off, so we subtract 47 from 172:
172 - 47 = 125

Then, 13 people got on, so we add 13 to 125:
125 + 13 = 138

At the next stop, 38 people got off, so we subtract 38 from 138:
138 - 38 = 100

Therefore, there are 100 people on the train.

"To find the total number of lions in the enclosure, we need to calculate the number of male lions and add it to the number of female lions and the lion cubs.

First, we know there are 12 female lions. The number of male lions is half the number of female lions, so the number of male lions is 12 / 2 = 6.

Next, we add the number of male lions to the number of female lions: 12 (female lions) + 6 (male lions) = 18.

Then, we add the number of lion cubs to the total number of adult lions: 18 (adult lions) + 14 (lion cubs) = 32.

The total number of lions in the enclosure is 32."

"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to first determine the total number of employees after three months and then multiply it by the monthly salary of each employee.

The company initially has 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. So, after one month, the total number of employees will be 200 + 20 = 220. After two months, it will be 220 + 20 = 240, and after three months, it will be 240 + 20 = 260.

Now, we multiply the total number of employees after three months (260) by the monthly salary of each employee ($4000).

Total amount = 260 * 4000
Total amount = 1,040,000

"To find out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we first need to calculate their total earnings after working 20 hours.

Billy's initial hourly wage was $10. After 2 months, he received a raise of $0.50 per hour, making his new hourly wage $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. On his first anniversary, he received another raise of $1.00 per hour, making his final hourly wage $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50.

Billy's total earnings for 20 hours of work at $11.50 per hour is 20 * $11.50 = $230.

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary, which was $10. So, Sally's starting salary is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. 

However, Sally also received the same raises as Billy, so her final hourly wage is also $11.50.

Sally's total earnings for 20 hours of work at $11.50 per hour is 20 * $11.50 = $230.

Since both Billy and Sally have the same total earnings, the difference in their earnings is $0.

"To find the total number of trees planted by the students, we need to calculate the total number of students and multiply it by 1 (since each student plants 1 tree).

Total number of students = 40 classes * 25 students/class = 1000 students
Total trees planted by students = 1000 students * 1 tree/student = 1000 trees

To find the total number of trees planted by the teachers, we need to calculate the total number of teachers and multiply it by 2 (since each teacher plants 2 trees).

Total number of teachers = 40 classes * 3 teachers/class = 120 teachers
Total trees planted by teachers = 120 teachers * 2 trees/teacher = 240 trees

Now, we add the total number of trees planted by students and teachers to find the total number of trees planted.

Total trees planted = 1000 trees (by students) + 240 trees (by teachers) = 1240 trees

"To find out how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we first need to calculate the total number of stuffed animals she currently has. 

She has 3 puppies, 5 koalas, 2 zebras, and 4 frogs. 

Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Now, we need to find 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. 

30% of 14 = 0.3 * 14 = 4.2

Since we can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, we'll round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we'll consider the context of the problem. If Bubbles buys 5 stuffed goats, the percentage of stuffed goats will be 5/19, which is approximately 26.32%. This is less than 30%. If she buys 6 stuffed goats, the percentage of stuffed goats will be 6/19, which is approximately 31.58%. This is more than 30%. Therefore, Bubbles should buy 5 stuffed goats to get as close to 30% as possible.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total hours Kris has played and subtract that from the target of 30 hours.

First, let's calculate the hours Kris played in the first 2 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, 2 weeks is 2 * 7 = 14 days. If Kris plays for half an hour every day, she plays 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours in the first 2 weeks.

Next, let's calculate the hours Kris played in the next week. Since she plays for 2 hours every day, she plays 7 * 2 = 14 hours in the next week.

Now, let's add the hours Kris played in both periods: 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours.

To find out how many hours Kris still needs to play, we subtract the total hours played from the target of 30 hours: 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

First, let's find the number of students who passed in each grade level:

- Third grade: 340 students passed
- Fourth grade: 40 students passed
- Fifth grade: Since the pass rate for the fifth graders is twice the pass rate of the fourth graders, and the fourth graders had a 40% pass rate (40/100), the fifth graders had a 80% pass rate (2 * 40/100). The total number of fifth graders is 400, so the number of fifth graders who passed is 0.8 * 400 = 320.

Now, let's find the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school:

- Total students who passed: 340 (third grade) + 40 (fourth grade) + 320 (fifth grade) = 700
- Total students in the school: 500 (third grade) + 100 (fourth grade) + 400 (fifth grade) = 1000

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students in the school, multiplied by 100 to convert it to a percentage:

(700 / 1000) * 100 = 70%

The final answer is: 70"
"To find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we first need to determine how many square inches of mosaic he can make with the glass chips he has.

Since it takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic, and each bag holds 72 chips, we can calculate the total number of chips Milo has:

2 bags * 72 chips per bag = 144 chips

Now, we need to find out how many square inches of mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips:

144 chips / 12 chips per square inch = 12 square inches

Since the mosaic is three inches tall, we can find the length by dividing the total square inches by the height:

12 square inches / 3 inches (height) = 4 inches

So, Milo can make a mosaic that is 4 inches long.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total amount of tea consumed, we need to calculate the amount of tea each group of students drank and add them together.

The first group of 4 students drank 1.5 quarts each, so the total amount they drank is 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts.

The second group of 16 students drank 2 quarts each, so the total amount they drank is 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

The total amount of tea consumed is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 10 quarts of tea left, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is 38 + 10 = 48 quarts.

To convert quarts to gallons, we know that 1 gallon is equal to 4 quarts. So, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party in gallons is 48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to first determine how many candies he has in total. 

Dale initially ordered 100 candies and then ordered 100 more. So, the total number of candies he has is 100 + 100 = 200.

However, he has already sold 150 candies. To find out how many he still needs to sell, we subtract the number of candies sold from the total number of candies he has:

200 (total candies) - 150 (candies sold) = 50

So, Dale still needs to sell 50 candies to sell all of his candy.

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students at the end of each month and then subtract the initial number of students from it.

At the beginning of the year, there are 10 students.

- At the end of January, the number of students doubles, so there are 10 * 2 = 20 students.
- At the end of February, the number of students doubles again, so there are 20 * 2 = 40 students.
- At the end of March, the number of students doubles again, so there are 40 * 2 = 80 students.
- At the end of April, the number of students doubles again, so there are 80 * 2 = 160 students.
- At the end of May, the number of students doubles again, so there are 160 * 2 = 320 students.

Now, let's subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May to find the additional students: 320 - 10 = 310.

The final answer is: 310"
"To find the total number of branches Felix climbed, we need to divide the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch. 

Total money made = $105
Cost per branch = $0.25

Total branches climbed = Total money made / Cost per branch
Total branches climbed = $105 / $0.25
Total branches climbed = 420

Since Felix worked during the week, which has 5 days, we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day.

Average branches per day = Total branches climbed / Number of days
Average branches per day = 420 / 5
Average branches per day = 84

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the total number of petals in the vase, we need to calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers and then subtract the petals that were lost.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers:

- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 x 5 = 15 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 x 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 x 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 x 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add up the total number of petals: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

However, Rose dropped 1 petal from each set of flowers, so we need to subtract 4 petals (1 from each set) from the total: 101 - 4 = 97 petals

The final answer is: 97"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many marshmallows are left after John and DeSean make their S'mores and account for the ones they dropped. 

First, let's calculate the total number of marshmallows used by John and DeSean. Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, and they each made 9 S'mores, the total number of marshmallows used is 9 + 9 = 18.

However, they also dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground, so we need to subtract those from the total number of marshmallows used. But since we are trying to find out how many are left, we should subtract the total used from the original amount. 

The original number of marshmallows is 35. The total number of marshmallows used is 18. So, the number of marshmallows left is 35 - 18 = 17.

Since they both want to make S'mores, we need to divide the remaining marshmallows by 2. 

17 / 2 = 8.5

Since you can't make half a S'more, we'll round down to 8 S'mores per person.

The final answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time each person plays and then determine how many quarters are used.

Jack can play for 20 minutes. His two friends who are worse can play for half as long, which is 20 / 2 = 10 minutes. The friend who is better can play for 1.5 times as long, which is 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes.

Since they play for 4 hours, we need to convert this to minutes: 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the total time each person plays:

- Jack: 240 minutes
- Two worse friends: 2 * 10 minutes = 20 minutes each, so 2 * 20 minutes = 40 minutes total
- Better friend: 240 minutes

Now, let's calculate the total time played by all friends: 240 (Jack) + 40 (worse friends) + 240 (better friend) = 520 minutes.

Since Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter, we need to calculate how many 20-minute intervals are in 520 minutes: 520 / 20 = 26.

However, we need to account for the fact that the better friend plays for 240 minutes, which is 12 intervals of 20 minutes. The two worse friends play for 40 minutes, which is 2 intervals of 20 minutes. Jack plays for 240 minutes, which is 12 intervals of 20 minutes.

So, the total number of quarters used is: 12 (better friend) + 2 (worse friends) + 12 (Jack) = 26 quarters.

The final answer is: 26"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. 

Let's denote the amount of citrus zest as Z, the amount of fragrance as F, the amount of salt as S, the amount of sugar as Su, and the amount of oil as O.

We are given that Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, so F = Z.

We are also given that she uses the same amount of salt as sugar, so S = Su.

Additionally, she uses twice as much oil as salt, so O = 2S.

And she uses twice as much salt as zest, so S = 2Z.

Since F = Z, we can substitute F with Z in the equation S = 2Z, which gives us S = 2Z and Su = 2Z.

Now we know that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, and it is made up of oil, salt, sugar, fragrance, and citrus zest. 

The total amount of the mixture can be represented as: O + S + Su + F + Z = 10.

Substituting the values we know, we get O + 2Z + 2Z + Z + Z = 10.

Combine like terms: O + 6Z = 10.

We also know that O = 2S and S = 2Z, so we can substitute O with 2S and S with 2Z, which gives us 2(2Z) + 6Z = 10.

Simplify the equation: 4Z + 6Z = 10.

Combine like terms: 10Z = 10.

Divide both sides by 10: Z = 1.

Now that we know Z = 1, we can find O by substituting Z into the equation O = 2S and S = 2Z. 

O = 2(2Z) = 2(2(1)) = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total amount of money John spent, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows separately and then add them together.

The cost of the goats is 3 * $500 = $1500.
The cost of the cows is 2 * $1500 = $3000.

Now, we add the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows together: $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

The final answer is: $4500"
"To find out how many more cupcakes Paul needs to buy, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs.

Paul needs 63 cupcakes in total. He already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes, so the total number of cupcakes he has is 8 + 40 = 48.

Now, let's subtract the number of cupcakes he has from the total number of cupcakes he needs: 63 - 48 = 15.

So, Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes.

The final answer is: 15"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars. So, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

2. Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find 20% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.2. 40 * 0.2 = 8. So, Joe sells 8 cars.

3. Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars to his mother.

4. Now, let's find out how many cars Joe has left. He started with 40 cars, sold 8, and gave away 16. So, he has 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 cars left.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to first determine the total amount raised by the students. Since the charity raised a total of $175,000 and $50,000 came from organizations, the amount raised by the students is $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000.

Now, we know that there are 20 students and they all raised the same amount. To find the amount each student raised, we divide the total amount raised by the number of students: $125,000 / 20 = $6,250.

The final answer is: $6,250"
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the first day and the second day, and then add them together.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. 

On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she walked on the first day. Since she walked 8 hours on the first day, she walked 8 / 2 = 4 hours on the second day.

To find the total time in hours, we add the time from both days: 8 hours + 4 hours = 12 hours.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time from hours to minutes by multiplying by 60: 12 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 720 minutes.

The final numerical answer is: 720"
"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to first determine the total number of cars in the parking lot when he got out of class for lunch.

Initially, Hunter counted 50 cars. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, making the total 50 + 20 = 70 cars.

When he got out of class for lunch, 1/2 of the cars had left. This means 1/2 of 70 cars had left, which is 70 / 2 = 35 cars.

So, the number of cars that remained in the parking lot when Hunter got out of class for lunch is 70 - 35 = 35 cars.

However, the question asks for the total number of cars he counted during the lunch break. Since 1/2 of the cars had left, the other half remained. Therefore, the total number of cars he counted during the lunch break is also 35.

The final answer is: 35"
"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of tasks he completes in a day and then multiply it by the number of days he works in a week.

First, let's find out how many tasks John completes in a day. Since he does 30 cycles of work a day and each cycle has 5 tasks, we multiply 30 by 5:

30 cycles/day * 5 tasks/cycle = 150 tasks/day

Now, we know that each task pays $1.20. To find out how much John makes in a day, we multiply the number of tasks he completes in a day by the pay per task:

150 tasks/day * $1.20/task = $180/day

Since John works a full 7-day week, we multiply his daily earnings by 7:

$180/day * 7 days/week = $1260/week

The final answer is: $1260"
"To find the total points scored by Sasha, we need to calculate her points in both games. 

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. 

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points in the first game. 

So, in the second game, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points.

To find the total points scored by Sasha, we add her points from both games: 14 + 4 = 18.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the total number of tins of cat food, we multiply the number of packages of cat food by the number of tins per package: 8 * 11 = 88 tins of cat food.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of tins of cat food and dog food: 88 - 36 = 52.

The final answer is: 52"
"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as 'x'. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is 341, which is the sum of the cards Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have. Therefore, we can write the equation: x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341.

Combine like terms: 7x + 12 = 341.

Subtract 12 from both sides: 7x = 329.

Divide both sides by 7: x = 47.

Since PJ has x cards, PJ has 47 cards. Smendrick has 3x cards, so Smendrick has 3 * 47 = 141 cards. Becca has 3x + 12 cards, so Becca has 3 * 47 + 12 = 147 cards.

"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color of eggs and then add them together.

Cindy had 5 green eggs. 
She had twice as many blue eggs as green ones, so she had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.
She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.
She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add the number of eggs of each color together: 5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"To calculate the total cost of shipping, we need to calculate the cost per pound and the cost per mile, then multiply them by their respective weights and distances. 

The cost per pound is $0.35, and the book weighs 4 pounds, so the cost for the weight is 4 * $0.35 = $1.40. 

The cost per mile is $0.08, and the book needs to be returned 20 miles away, so the cost for the distance is 20 * $0.08 = $1.60.

The total shipping cost is $1.40 + $1.60 = $2.00.

The refund Milly will get is 75% of the book's purchase price, which is 0.75 * $32 = $24.

The total amount Milly will lose is the shipping cost minus the refund, which is $2.00 - $24 = -$22. However, since you can't lose a negative amount of money, this is a calculation error. The correct calculation should be the shipping cost minus the refund, which is $2.00 - $24 = -$22. However, the correct interpretation is that Milly will actually gain $22, but since the question asks how much money Milly will lose, the correct answer is the absolute value of the result, which is $22.

The final answer is: $22"
"To find out how much money Mulan has left, we need to calculate the total amount of money she spent and subtract it from the initial amount she had, including the money her father gave her.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Mulan had initially: $40 (initial money) + $100 (money from her father) = $140.

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money she spent: 2 pairs of jeans at $30 each = 2 x $30 = $60, and a bag for $20. So, the total amount spent is $60 + $20 = $80.

Now, let's subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $140 - $80 = $60.

Mulan has $60 left."
"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the production for the first three weeks and then determine the pattern.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.
In the second week, he produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.
In the third week, he produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Now, let's add up the production for the first three weeks: 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in total each month, we can find out how much he produces in the fourth week by subtracting the production of the first three weeks from the total production: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

The final answer is: 14,000"
"To find the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends on TikTok in a week and then multiply it by 4.

First, let's calculate the time Britany spends on TikTok in a week:

- She records 18 videos, each taking 4 minutes. So, the total time spent recording videos is 18 * 4 = 72 minutes.
- She spends 2 hours writing songs, which is 2 * 60 = 120 minutes.
- She spends 15 minutes each day for 6 days on makeup, so the total time spent on makeup is 15 * 6 = 90 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time spent on TikTok in a week: 72 + 120 + 90 = 282 minutes.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly time by 4: 282 * 4 = 1128 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 1128 / 60 = 18.8 hours.

The final answer is: 1128"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to first determine the cost of the initial installation and then add the cost of the additional items.

The initial installation includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. However, Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures that she needs installed. Since the initial installation already includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, and 1 chandelier, we only need to consider the additional items.

Angela has 2 extra mirrors (6 - 4 = 2), 1 extra chandelier (2 - 1 = 1), and 10 extra pictures (20 - 10 = 10). The cost of the additional items is $15.00 per item.

The total number of additional items is 2 (mirrors) + 1 (chandelier) + 10 (pictures) = 13 items.

The cost of the additional items is 13 items * $15.00 per item = $195.00.

The initial installation cost is $129.00.

The total cost is $129.00 (initial installation) + $195.00 (additional items) = $324.00.

The final answer is: $324.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much money Anthony has saved, and then calculate 40% more than that amount.

First, we know that Eva has saved $20.00. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, so Anthony has saved $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.

Since Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony, we need to find 40% of $30.00 and add it to $30.00. 

40% of $30.00 is 0.4 x $30.00 = $12.00. 

So, Roy has saved $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

The final answer is: $42.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain in relation to Pompei's lifting capacity. 

First, we know that Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, and Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch. So, Saskay can lift a mountain 12 * 1 = 12 inches.

Next, Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Finally, Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 since there are 12 inches in a foot. 

480 / 12 = 40 feet.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the speed of the kangaroos. Since it takes 3 kangaroos 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can assume that the total distance is the same for all animals. Let's denote the speed of a kangaroo as 'k'. 

The total distance traveled by 3 kangaroos in 18 hours is 3k * 18. 

Now, we need to find the speed of the turtles, which is half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of a turtle is k/2.

Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, it will take them twice as long to cover the same distance. 

The time taken by 4 turtles to travel the same distance is 2 * 18 hours, since they are traveling at half the speed. 

However, we need to consider that there are 4 turtles, so the total time taken will be 2 * 18 / 4 = 9 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many dishes Jada and Rory made. 

Since Kora made 20 dishes, and Rory made 20 more than Kora, Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.

Jada made twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

Now, we need to add up the number of dishes made by all three: Kora (20), Rory (40), and Jada (80).

20 + 40 + 80 = 140

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much money Erika has in total after receiving her payment and her mom's contribution. 

First, let's calculate the total amount Erika has after receiving her payment and her mom's contribution. 

Erika's payment: $150
Her mom's contribution: $80
Total amount received: $150 + $80 = $230

Since Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop after trading it in, we know that the price of the laptop after the trade-in is $600 - $200 = $400. 

Now, we can set up an equation to find out how much money Erika had initially. Let's call the initial amount in her purse 'x'. 

x + $230 = $400 + $50

Combine like terms:
x + $230 = $450

Subtract $230 from both sides:
x = $220

So, Erika has $220 in her purse. 

The final answer is: $220"
"To find out how many slices Adam has left, we first need to calculate the total number of slices he has. 

First, let's calculate the number of slices from the large apples. Since a large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces, and Adam has 3 large apples, the total number of slices from large apples is 3 * 5 = 15.

Next, let's calculate the number of slices from the small apples. Since a small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces, and Adam has 5 small apples, the total number of slices from small apples is 5 * 3 = 15.

Now, we add the total number of slices from large and small apples to get the total number of slices Adam has. 15 (large) + 15 (small) = 30.

Since Adam eats 15 slices, we subtract the number of slices he ate from the total number of slices to find out how many are left. 30 - 15 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how many cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to calculate the total amount of milk the farmer currently produces. 

The farmer extracts 5 liters of milk a day from each cow, and he has 3 cows. So, the total amount of milk he currently produces is 5 liters/cow * 3 cows = 15 liters/day.

To find out how many more cows he needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we subtract the current production from the target production: 25 liters/day - 15 liters/day = 10 liters/day.

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, we need to find out how many cows are needed to produce 10 liters of milk a day. We can do this by dividing the target production by the amount of milk each cow produces: 10 liters/day / 5 liters/cow = 2 cows.

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the length of each used portion and subtract it from the original length of the glue stick.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so the used portion is 1 - 1/6 = 5/6. The length of the used portion is 5/6 * 12 mm = 10 mm.

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so the used portion is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3. The length of the used portion is 1/3 * 12 mm = 4 mm.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so the used portion is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2. The length of the used portion is 1/2 * 12 mm = 6 mm.

The total length of the used portions is 10 mm + 4 mm + 6 mm = 20 mm.

The total length of the glue sticks is 3 * 12 mm = 36 mm.

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 36 mm - 20 mm = 16 mm.

Thea gave the craftsman four $20 bills, which is a total of 4 x $20 = $80.

The hat cost $70, so the change she received is $80 - $70 = $10.

The final answer is: $10"
"To find out how much money Craig has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent and subtract it from the initial amount.

Craig starts with 2 twenty-dollar bills, which is 2 * $20 = $40.

He buys 6 squirt guns for $2 each, so the total cost of the squirt guns is 6 * $2 = $12.

He also buys 3 packs of water balloons for $3 each, so the total cost of the water balloons is 3 * $3 = $9.

The total amount Craig spent is $12 + $9 = $21.

To find out how much money he has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $40 - $21 = $19.

The final answer is: $19"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. Since Jack has an unknown number of socks, let's call it 'x'. Then, Peter has 2x socks.
4. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so the number of socks Jack has is 60 / 2 = 30.
5. Now we know that Peter has 2x socks and Jack has 30 socks. Since Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, we can set up the equation 2x = 30. Solving for x, we get x = 15.
6. So, Jack has 30 socks and Peter has 2x = 2 * 15 = 30 socks.
7. The total number of socks is 30 (Jack's socks) + 30 (Peter's socks) = 60 socks.
8. The total number of dishes is 30 (Peter's dishes) + 60 (Jack's dishes) = 90 dishes.

The total number of socks and dishes together is 60 + 90 = 150."
"To find the number of students good at math, we need to consider the total number of students and the number of students good at both subjects. 

Let's denote the number of students good at both math and English as x. We know that the total number of students is 20, and the number of students good at math only is 5, and the number of students good at English only is 8.

We can set up the equation: 5 (math only) + 8 (English only) + x (both) = 20 (total)

Simplifying the equation, we get: 13 + x = 20

Subtracting 13 from both sides, we get: x = 7

This means that 7 students are good at both math and English. To find the total number of students good at math, we need to add the number of students good at math only (5) and the number of students good at both subjects (7).

Total number of students good at math = 5 (math only) + 7 (both) = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find out how many groups can perform, we need to calculate the total available time for performances. The concert is 2 hours long, which is 120 minutes. Subtracting the 10-minute intermission, we have 120 - 10 = 110 minutes available for performances.

Each group takes 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit the stage, for a total of 10 minutes per group. 

Now, we can divide the total available time for performances (110 minutes) by the time each group takes (10 minutes) to find the number of groups that can perform: 110 / 10 = 11.

The final answer is: 11"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand that it's a simple interest scenario. The interest rate is 3/4 of the original amount per year, which can be expressed as 0.75 or 75% of the principal amount.

The formula for simple interest is: A = P(1 + rt), where A is the total amount, P is the principal amount, r is the interest rate, and t is the time period in years.

Given that the principal amount (P) is $300, the interest rate (r) is 0.75, and the time period (t) is 3 years, we can plug these values into the formula:

A = 300(1 + 0.75*3)
A = 300(1 + 2.25)
A = 300(3.25)
A = 975

The total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is $975.

The final answer is: $975"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of white shirts with no collars and the number of floral shirts with no buttons.

First, let's find the number of white shirts with collars. Since half of the 40 white shirts have collars, we can calculate this as:

40 / 2 = 20 white shirts with collars

Now, to find the number of white shirts with no collars, we subtract the number of white shirts with collars from the total number of white shirts:

40 - 20 = 20 white shirts with no collars

Next, let's find the number of floral shirts with buttons. We are given that 20 of the floral shirts have buttons.

Now, to find the number of floral shirts with no buttons, we subtract the number of floral shirts with buttons from the total number of floral shirts:

50 - 20 = 30 floral shirts with no buttons

Finally, to find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars, we subtract the number of white shirts with no collars from the number of floral shirts with no buttons:

30 - 20 = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how much the farmer will earn, we need to determine how many trays he can fill with 900 eggs. 

Since each tray holds 30 eggs, we can divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs per tray to find the number of trays.

Number of trays = Total eggs / Eggs per tray
= 900 / 30
= 30 trays

Now, we know the farmer has 30 trays. To find out how much he will earn, we multiply the number of trays by the price per tray.

Earnings = Number of trays * Price per tray
= 30 * $2.5
= $75

The final answer is: $75"
"To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we need to calculate the number of goats left in each farm after the sale and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of goats left in Farm X. Mr. Smith started with 55 goats and sold 10, so the number of goats left in Farm X is:
55 - 10 = 45

Next, let's find the number of goats left in Farm Y. Mr. Smith started with 45 goats and sold twice as many as from Farm X, which is 2 * 10 = 20 goats. So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is:
45 - 20 = 25

Now, let's add the number of goats left in both farms to find the total:
45 (Farm X) + 25 (Farm Y) = 70

The final answer is: 70"
"To find the average cost of each pair of shoes, we need to divide the total amount spent on shoes per year by the number of pairs bought per year.

First, let's calculate the number of pairs James buys per year. Since he buys 2 pairs of shoes a month, and there are 12 months in a year, he buys 2 * 12 = 24 pairs of shoes per year.

Now, let's divide the total amount spent on shoes per year ($2640) by the number of pairs bought per year (24):

$2640 ÷ 24 = $110

So, James pays an average of $110 per pair of shoes."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food, then subtract the discount for the red baskets.

The cost of 3 baskets of green food is 3 * $25 = $75.

The cost of 3 baskets of red food is 3 * $18 = $54.

The total cost before discount is $75 + $54 = $129.

Since you get $2 off for each basket of red food, the total discount is 3 * $2 = $6.

The total cost after discount is $129 - $6 = $123.

The final numerical answer is: $123"
"To find the time it takes to clean one-half of the rooms, we first need to determine the number of rooms that is half of 90. 

90 / 2 = 45 rooms

Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, we multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room.

45 rooms * 20 minutes/room = 900 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours

The final numerical answer is: 15"
"To find the total number of homes built over the next three years, we need to calculate the number of homes built each year and then sum them up.

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will double the total number of homes built in the first two years, which is 12 + 36 = 48 homes. Then, they will double this amount, so 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

Now, let's add up the number of homes built each year: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144 homes.

The final answer is: 144"
"Let's denote my age as 'x'. Since I am three years younger than my brother, my brother's age is 'x + 3'. My sister is 2 years younger than me, so her age is 'x - 2'.

My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, which can be expressed as 3(x + 3) - 1.

The sum of all our ages is 87, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + 3(x + 3) - 1 = 87.

Combine like terms: 5x + 10 + 3x - 1 = 87.

Combine the x terms: 8x + 9 = 87.

Subtract 9 from both sides: 8x = 78.

Divide both sides by 8: x = 9.75.

Since age cannot be a fraction, we need to find the closest integer that satisfies the given conditions. We can test the ages of the family members with x = 9 and x = 10.

If x = 9, then my brother's age is 12, my sister's age is 7, and my mom's age is 32. The sum of their ages is 9 + 12 + 7 + 32 = 60, which is less than 87.

If x = 10, then my brother's age is 13, my sister's age is 8, and my mom's age is 38. The sum of their ages is 10 + 13 + 8 + 38 = 69, which is still less than 87.

If x = 11, then my brother's age is 14, my sister's age is 9, and my mom's age is 43. The sum of their ages is 11 + 14 + 9 + 43 = 77, which is still less than 87.

If x = 12, then my brother's age is 15, my sister's age is 10, and my mom's age is 48. The sum of their ages is 12 + 15 + 10 + 48 = 85, which is still less than 87.

If x = 13, then my brother's age is 16, my sister's age is 11, and my mom's age is 53. The sum of their ages is 13 + 16 + 11 + 53 = 93, which is greater than 87.

However, if we test x = 12.5, then my brother's age is 15.5, my sister's age is 10.5, and my mom's age is 46. The sum of their ages is 12.5 + 15.5 + 10.5 + 46 = 84.5, which is still less than 87.

If x = 12.75, then my brother's age is 15.75, my sister's age is 10.75, and my mom's age is 47.25. The sum of their ages is 12.75 + 15.75 + 10.75 + 47.25 = 86.75, which is still less than 87.

If x = 13.25, then my brother's age is 16.25, my sister's age is 11.25, and my mom's age is 48.75. The sum of their ages is 13.25 + 16.25 + 11.25 + 48.75 = 89.5, which is greater than 87.

If x = 13 is the closest integer that satisfies the given conditions, but the sum of their ages is less than 87. However, if we test x = 13.5, then my brother's age is 16.5, my sister's age is 11.5, and my mom's age is 50.5. The sum of their ages is 13.5 + 16.5 + 11.5 + 50.5 = 92, which is greater than 87.

"To find out how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we first need to determine the total number of glue sticks required. Since each student needs 2 glue sticks and there are 27 students, the total number of glue sticks needed is 27 * 2 = 54.

Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks required by the number of glue sticks per pack to find out how many packs are needed. However, since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs and expects to have some extra glue sticks left over, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.

To do this, we can divide 54 by 8, which gives us 6.75. Since we can't buy a fraction of a pack, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 7.

Therefore, Mr. Jackson will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water passing through the river at the given point over the three days.

On the first day, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

On the second day, the amount of water passing through the river doubles, so it becomes 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.

On the third day, the amount of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons, so it becomes 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

To find the total amount of water passing through the river at that point over the three days, we need to add the amounts from each day: 4000 + 8000 + 14000 = 24000 gallons.

The total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 24000 gallons.

The final answer is: 24000"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of exponential growth. Since each infected person infects six others, we can model the growth of the infected population using a geometric progression.

Let's denote the initial number of infected people as P0 = 10. The number of new infections each day can be calculated as 6 times the number of infected people from the previous day.

Day 1: P1 = P0 + 6P0 = 10 + 6(10) = 10 + 60 = 70
Day 2: P2 = P1 + 6P1 = 70 + 6(70) = 70 + 420 = 490
Day 3: P3 = P2 + 6P2 = 490 + 6(490) = 490 + 2940 = 3430

Therefore, the total number of people infected after three days is 3430.

The final answer is: 3430"
"To find the total amount of money Rafaela received, we need to multiply the number of customers by the tip amount each customer gave. 

Number of customers: 40
Tip amount per customer: $20

Total amount Rafaela received: 40 * $20 = $800

Since Julieta received 10% less money than Rafaela, we need to find 10% of $800 and subtract it from $800.

10% of $800 = 0.1 * $800 = $80

Julieta's total: $800 - $80 = $720

Now, we need to find the total amount of money both Rafaela and Julieta received.

Total amount: $800 (Rafaela) + $720 (Julieta) = $1520

"To find out how many oranges Jennifer remained with, we need to calculate the total number of oranges given to her children. 

First, let's calculate the total number of oranges given to her daughters: 3 daughters * 2 oranges per daughter = 6 oranges. 

Then, we add the oranges given to her son: 6 oranges + 3 oranges = 9 oranges.

Now, we subtract the total number of oranges given away from the initial number of oranges Jennifer bought: 12 oranges - 9 oranges = 3 oranges.

So, Jennifer remained with 3 oranges.

The final answer is: 3"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Claire earns 1 badge per month.
- Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge than Claire, so Amber earns 1/2 badge per month.
- Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so Wendy earns 3 badges per month.

In a 1-year time frame (12 months), the number of badges earned by each girl is as follows:

- Claire: 1 badge/month * 12 months = 12 badges
- Amber: 1/2 badge/month * 12 months = 6 badges
- Wendy: 3 badges/month * 12 months = 36 badges

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a 1-year time frame, we subtract the number of badges earned by Amber from the number of badges earned by Wendy:

36 badges (Wendy) - 6 badges (Amber) = 30 badges

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how much Paige raised, we need to calculate the total number of slices she baked and sold. 

First, let's find out how many hours she baked. She baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is 5 hours.

Since she can bake 2 loaves per hour, and each hour she baked for 5 hours, she baked a total of 2 * 5 = 10 loaves.

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices is 10 * 8 = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, and she sold all 80 slices. To find the total amount raised, we need to convert the total number of slices to dollars. 

Since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents, we can convert 50 cents to dollars by dividing by 100. So, 50 cents is equal to 0.5 dollars.

Now, we multiply the number of slices by the price per slice: 80 * 0.5 = 40 dollars.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find the total number of coins Gretchen has, we first need to determine the number of silver coins she has. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, and she has 70 gold coins, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship.

Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. Then, the number of gold coins can be represented as 'x + 30'. We know that the number of gold coins is 70, so we can set up the equation:

x + 30 = 70

To solve for 'x', we subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:

x = 70 - 30
x = 40

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins. To find the total number of coins, we add the number of silver coins to the number of gold coins:

Total coins = Number of silver coins + Number of gold coins
Total coins = 40 + 70
Total coins = 110

The final answer is: 110"
"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we first need to determine the total number of burritos consumed. 

There were 50 students at the picnic, and each student was given 10 burritos. So, the total number of burritos given to the students is 50 * 10 = 500.

Mr. George also ate 20 burritos. Therefore, the total number of burritos consumed is 500 (by students) + 20 (by Mr. George) = 520.

Since there were 600 burritos ordered initially, the total number of leftover burritos is 600 - 520 = 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the number of yellow cars, we first need to determine the number of green and blue cars. 

We know there are 12 red cars. The rink has 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so the number of green cars is 12 - 2 = 10.

The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars, so the number of blue cars is 3 * 10 = 30.

Now, we know the total number of red, green, and blue cars: 12 (red) + 10 (green) + 30 (blue) = 52.

Since the rink has 75 cars in total, the number of yellow cars is 75 - 52 = 23.

The final answer is: 23"
"Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as F, the number of books Anne has as A, and the number of books Sofie has as S.

We are given that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so we can write this as S = A + 25.

We are also given that Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so we can write this as A = F - 12.

Now, we are told that together, Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have 85 books. This can be written as S + A + F = 85.

Substituting the first two equations into the third equation, we get (A + 25) + A + F = 85.

Combine like terms to get 2A + F + 25 = 85.

Subtract 25 from both sides to get 2A + F = 60.

Now, substitute A = F - 12 into the equation 2A + F = 60.

This gives us 2(F - 12) + F = 60.

Distribute the 2 to get 2F - 24 + F = 60.

Combine like terms to get 3F - 24 = 60.

Add 24 to both sides to get 3F = 84.

Divide both sides by 3 to get F = 28.

The final answer is: 28"
"To find the weight of the carrots, we first need to determine the weight of the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, the sweet potatoes weigh 2 * 5 = 10 pounds.

Next, we need to find the weight of the carrots, which is 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes. So, the weight of the carrots is 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

The weight of the carrots is 7 pounds."
"To find out how much Greg will spend on Jello, we first need to determine how many Jello cups he needs to buy. Since each kid will have 4 Jello cups, and there are 30 kids, we multiply the number of kids by the number of Jello cups each kid will have: 30 kids * 4 Jello cups/kid = 120 Jello cups.

Since each three-ounce box of Jello makes 10 Jello cups, we need to find out how many boxes Greg needs to buy. We divide the total number of Jello cups needed by the number of Jello cups each box makes: 120 Jello cups / 10 Jello cups/box = 12 boxes.

Now, we need to find out how much each box costs. The price of each box is $1.25. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box: 12 boxes * $1.25/box = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the total cost of the phones, we multiply the number of phones by the cost per phone: 5 phones * $700/phone = $3500.

"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we first need to determine how much Keenan spends in a month. Since Madeline pays 60% of the total cost, Keenan pays the remaining 40%. 

First, let's calculate Keenan's monthly expenditure: 
Total monthly expenditure = $400
Madeline's monthly expenditure = 60% of $400 = 0.6 * $400 = $240
Keenan's monthly expenditure = Total monthly expenditure - Madeline's monthly expenditure
Keenan's monthly expenditure = $400 - $240 = $160

Now, we need to find out how much Keenan spends per week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we can divide Keenan's monthly expenditure by 4:
Keenan's weekly expenditure = Keenan's monthly expenditure / 4
Keenan's weekly expenditure = $160 / 4
Keenan's weekly expenditure = $40

The final answer is: $40"
"To find out how many pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he ate on each day and add them together.

On the first day, he ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces. To find 2/5 of 60, we multiply 60 by 2 and divide by 5:
60 * 2 = 120
120 / 5 = 24

So, on the first day, he ate 24 pieces.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces. To find the remaining pieces after the first two days, we subtract the pieces eaten on the first two days from the total:
60 - 24 - 10 = 26

Now, we need to find 7/13 of 26:
26 * 7 = 182
182 / 13 = 14.15 (round to 14 since we can't eat a fraction of a piece)

So, on the third day, he ate 14 pieces.

Now, let's add up the pieces eaten on each day:
24 (first day) + 10 (second day) + 14 (third day) = 48

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water, we first need to determine the cost per bottle of soda and the cost per bottle of water.

The cost of 7 bottles of soda is $21.00, so the cost per bottle of soda is $21.00 / 7 = $3.00 per bottle.

The cost of 4 bottles of water is $8.00, so the cost per bottle of water is $8.00 / 4 = $2.00 per bottle.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:

Cost of 3 bottles of soda = 3 * $3.00 = $9.00
Cost of 2 bottles of water = 2 * $2.00 = $4.00

Total cost = $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00

The final answer is: $13.00"
"To find out how much money David has left after buying the bolts, we need to calculate the total cost of the bolts and subtract that from the initial amount of money he has.

The cost of each bolt is $0.03, and David wants to buy 16 bolts. 

Total cost = Number of bolts * Cost per bolt
Total cost = 16 * $0.03
Total cost = $0.48

Now, we subtract the total cost from the initial amount of money David has:

Initial amount = $12.48
Total cost = $0.48
Amount left = Initial amount - Total cost
Amount left = $12.48 - $0.48
Amount left = $12.00

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To find out how much Ella would earn after 12 hours of dog walking at the same rate, we need to first determine her hourly rate. 

We know that Ella earned $33 for 3 hours of dog walking. To find her hourly rate, we can divide the total amount earned by the number of hours worked.

Hourly rate = Total amount earned / Number of hours worked
Hourly rate = $33 / 3 hours
Hourly rate = $11 per hour

Now that we know her hourly rate, we can calculate how much she would earn after 12 hours of dog walking.

Total earnings after 12 hours = Hourly rate * Number of hours worked
Total earnings after 12 hours = $11 per hour * 12 hours
Total earnings after 12 hours = $132

"To find out how many marbles Paul has left, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, Paul has 52 marbles. His friend gave him 28 marbles, so we add 28 to 52:

52 + 28 = 80

Now, Paul has 80 marbles. He lost 1/4 of his marbles. To find 1/4 of 80, we multiply 80 by 1/4 or divide 80 by 4:

80 / 4 = 20

So, Paul lost 20 marbles. To find out how many marbles he has left, we subtract 20 from 80:

80 - 20 = 60

Therefore, Paul has 60 marbles left.

"To find Amy's total score, we need to calculate the points she earns from each type of question and add them together.

First, let's calculate the points from the multiple-choice questions. Amy correctly answers 80% of the 10 multiple-choice questions, so she answers 0.8 * 10 = 8 questions correctly. Since each multiple-choice question is worth 1 point, she earns 8 * 1 = 8 points from the multiple-choice questions.

Next, let's calculate the points from the true/false questions. Amy correctly answers 90% of the 20 true/false questions, so she answers 0.9 * 20 = 18 questions correctly. Since each true/false question is worth 1 point, she earns 18 * 1 = 18 points from the true/false questions.

Finally, let's calculate the points from the long-answer questions. Amy correctly answers 60% of the 5 long-answer questions, so she answers 0.6 * 5 = 3 questions correctly. Since each long-answer question is worth 5 points, she earns 3 * 5 = 15 points from the long-answer questions.

Now, let's add the points from each type of question to find Amy's total score: 8 + 18 + 15 = 41.

"To find out how much money Isaias bought the chickens for, we first need to determine how many chickens he plans to sell. Since he has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them, we can calculate the number of chickens he plans to sell as follows:

Number of chickens to sell = 300 * (3/5)
= 300 * 0.6
= 180 chickens

Next, we know that Isaias needs to make a profit of $2000 by selling these chickens at $50 each. To find the total revenue, we multiply the number of chickens by the selling price:

Total revenue = Number of chickens to sell * Selling price
= 180 * $50
= $9000

Since Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000, we can set up the equation:

Total revenue - Total cost = Profit
$9000 - Total cost = $2000

To find the total cost, we subtract the profit from the total revenue:

Total cost = Total revenue - Profit
= $9000 - $2000
= $7000

Therefore, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for sale for $7000.

The final answer is: $7000"
"To find out how many glasses Micah and Mitchell sold, we need to divide the total number of glasses sold by 2, since they sold an equal number of glasses. 

Total glasses sold = 32
Number of people selling glasses = 2 (Micah and Mitchell)
Glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell = Total glasses sold / Number of people selling glasses
Glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell = 32 / 2
Glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell = 16

Now, we need to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah. To do this, we subtract the number of glasses sold by Micah from the number of glasses sold by Julie.

Glasses sold by Julie = 14
Glasses sold by Micah = 16
Difference in glasses sold = Glasses sold by Julie - Glasses sold by Micah
Difference in glasses sold = 14 - 16
Difference in glasses sold = -2

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Sarah will get from selling the rope and then subtract the cost of the new rope.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Sarah will get from selling the rope:

Length of the rope = 20 meters
Price per meter = $2
Total amount of money = Length of the rope * Price per meter
Total amount of money = 20 * $2
Total amount of money = $40

Now, let's calculate the cost of the new rope:

Length of the new rope = 20 meters (assuming Sarah wants to buy a rope of the same length)
Price per meter of the new rope = $1.5
Cost of the new rope = Length of the new rope * Price per meter of the new rope
Cost of the new rope = 20 * $1.5
Cost of the new rope = $30

Now, let's subtract the cost of the new rope from the total amount of money Sarah will get from selling the rope:

Amount of money left over = Total amount of money - Cost of the new rope
Amount of money left over = $40 - $30
Amount of money left over = $10

"To solve this problem, we need to first find Melanie's current age. Since in 10 years, she will be 18 years old, we can subtract 10 from 18 to find her current age.

Current age = 18 - 10 = 8 years

Now, we need to find the number of years it will take for her age to be thrice her current age. Let's call this number 'x'. We can set up the equation:

Age after x years = 3 * Current age
8 + x = 3 * 8

Simplifying the equation, we get:
8 + x = 24

Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get:
x = 16

So, it will take 16 years for Melanie's age to be thrice her current age.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's find the cost of the chicken. Since each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, and the 5 packs of bacon cost $10, the cost of each pack of chicken is $10 / 5 = $2. Since Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, the total cost of the chicken is 6 * $2 = $12.

Next, let's find the cost of the strawberries. Each pack of strawberries costs $4, and Kelly has 3 packs, so the total cost of the strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.

Now, let's find the cost of the apples. Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is $4 / 2 = $2. Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost of the apples is 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items in Kelly's cart: $10 (bacon) + $12 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $48.

Finally, let's subtract the total cost of the items from Kelly's budget: $65 - $48 = $17.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total runtime of the final concert without the encore. Since the encore is 15 minutes, we subtract that from the total runtime to get the runtime of the concert itself.

Total runtime of the final concert = 65 minutes
Runtime of the encore = 15 minutes
Runtime of the concert itself = Total runtime of the final concert - Runtime of the encore
= 65 - 15
= 50 minutes

Since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship:

Runtime of the final concert = 2 * Runtime of the usual concert
50 = 2 * Runtime of the usual concert

To find the runtime of the usual concert, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 2:

Runtime of the usual concert = 50 / 2

"To find the total number of birds, we need to calculate the number of birds in each group and add them together.

First, let's find the number of birds nesting in the bushes: 6 birds.

Next, we need to find 2/3 of the number of birds nesting in the bushes. To do this, we multiply 6 by 2/3, which is the same as multiplying 6 by 2 and then dividing by 3. 

6 * 2 = 12
12 / 3 = 4

So, 2/3 of the number of birds nesting in the bushes is 4 birds. Since these birds are flying overhead, we add them to the total count: 6 (nesting) + 4 (flying) = 10 birds.

Now, let's find the number of birds feeding. There are 3 groups of 8 birds each, so we multiply 3 by 8 to find the total number of birds feeding: 3 * 8 = 24 birds.

Finally, we add the number of birds nesting, flying, and feeding to find the total number of birds: 6 (nesting) + 4 (flying) + 24 (feeding) = 34 birds.

"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to determine the speed of the thingamabob first. Since the whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob, and the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, we can find the speed of the thingamabob by dividing the speed of the whatchamacallit by 11.

Speed of thingamabob = Speed of whatchamacallit / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 121 / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 11 meters per second

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig by multiplying the speed of the thingamabob by 5.

Speed of whirligig = Speed of thingamabob * 5
Speed of whirligig = 11 * 5
Speed of whirligig = 55 meters per second

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn. Let's denote the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. 

Since she mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as Joe's, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times. 

The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.

The total number of lawns she mowed is the sum of the lawns she mowed each week, which is 3x + x + 5x = 9x.

We know that she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn, and since she mowed Joe's lawn 'x' times, she made a total of $6x from mowing lawns.

We also know that she made a total of $80 from both lemonade sales and mowing lawns. So, the amount she made from lemonade sales is $80 - $6x.

Now, we need to find the value of 'x'. Since we know that she mowed a total of 9x lawns, and she made $6 per lawn, the total amount she made from mowing lawns is $54 (6 * 9 = 54). 

Since she made a total of $80, the amount she made from lemonade sales is $80 - $54 = $26.

"To find John's total monthly income from renting out his car, we need to calculate the total number of hours he rents his car and multiply it by his hourly rate.

He rents his car 10 times a month for 3 hours each time, so the total number of hours is:
10 rentals/month * 3 hours/rental = 30 hours/month

His hourly rate is $25, so his total monthly income is:
30 hours/month * $25/hour = $750/month

To find his profit, we need to subtract his car payment from his total monthly income:
$750/month - $500/month = $250/month

So, John makes a profit of $250 on his car each month.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Martha initially had an unknown number of notebooks, but we know that Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha. If we denote Martha's initial number of notebooks as 'x', then Joseph had 3x notebooks.

After Martha bought 5 more notebooks, she had a total of 7 notebooks. This means that her initial number of notebooks (x) plus 5 is equal to 7. We can write this as an equation:

x + 5 = 7

To find the value of x, we subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:

x = 7 - 5
x = 2

Now that we know Martha had 2 notebooks initially, we can find out how many notebooks Joseph had. Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, we multiply Martha's initial number of notebooks by 3:

Joseph's notebooks = 3x = 3(2) = 6

Now that we know both Martha and Joseph's initial number of notebooks, we can find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph. Martha now has 7 notebooks, and Joseph has 6 notebooks. The difference is:

7 - 6 = 1

So, Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph.

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we first need to determine the distance rowed by Anis. 

Dijana rowed 50 miles. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. To find 1/5 of Dijana's distance, we multiply 50 by 1/5, which is 10 miles. 

So, Anis rowed 50 + 10 = 60 miles. 

Now, to find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we add their individual distances: 50 (Dijana's distance) + 60 (Anis's distance) = 110 miles.

The final answer is: 110"
"To find out how many cookies each of Susan's nephews will get, we first need to determine the total number of cookies available after her husband took some. 

Initially, Susan had 100 cookies. Her husband took 4 cookies, so we subtract 4 from 100 to get the remaining number of cookies: 100 - 4 = 96.

Now, we need to divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews, which is 6. To do this, we'll divide 96 by 6.

96 ÷ 6 = 16

So, each of Susan's nephews will get 16 cookies."
"To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we need to calculate the total number of pages each of them read.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. 

Today, Denise read 5 more than as many pages as Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read 5 + 13 = 18 pages today.

So, Denise's total pages read is 10 (yesterday) + 18 (today) = 28 pages.

Daniel's total pages read is 13 (yesterday) + 0 (today) = 13 pages.

The difference in the number of pages read by Denise and Daniel is 28 - 13 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of bowls that can be filled with the leftover soup and then divide that by the number of child-sized bowls.

Since the pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls, and there are 3 adults (Calvin, his wife, and himself), the total number of adult bowls that can be filled is 3. 

Since 4 adult bowls equal 8 child bowls, we can set up a proportion to find the number of child bowls that can be filled: 4 adult bowls = 8 child bowls. 

To find the number of child bowls that can be filled, we can multiply the number of adult bowls by 2 (since 4 adult bowls equal 8 child bowls): 3 adult bowls * 2 = 6 child bowls.

Now, we know that there are 6 child bowls that can be filled with the leftover soup. Since there are 2 children, we can divide the total number of child bowls by 2 to find out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch: 6 child bowls / 2 children = 3.

The final numerical answer is: 3"
"To find the total amount William spent, we need to calculate the cost of the notebooks and the cost of the ballpen, then add them together.

"To find out how much material Jo needs, we need to calculate the total amount of material required for the small and large masks separately and then add them together.

For small masks, Jo needs 2 yards of material to make 4 masks. To find out how much material is needed for 20 small masks, we can set up a proportion:

2 yards / 4 masks = x yards / 20 masks

Cross-multiplying, we get:
2 * 20 = 4x
40 = 4x
x = 40 / 4
x = 10 yards

So, Jo needs 10 yards of material to make 20 small masks.

For large masks, Jo needs 2.25 yards of material to make 3 masks. To find out how much material is needed for 8 large masks, we can set up a proportion:

2.25 yards / 3 masks = x yards / 8 masks

Cross-multiplying, we get:
2.25 * 8 = 3x
18 = 3x
x = 18 / 3
x = 6 yards

So, Jo needs 6 yards of material to make 8 large masks.

Now, we add the material needed for small and large masks together:
10 yards (small) + 6 yards (large) = 16 yards

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the average price Deepa paid per ticket, we need to first find the total number of tickets she bought and the total amount she spent.

Since Deepa saw each of the 9 movies three times, the total number of tickets she bought is 9 * 3 = 27.

The total amount she spent is given as $216.

To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets: 216 / 27 = 8.

"To find Harold's free time, we need to calculate the total hours in a day and subtract the time he spends sleeping, working, and walking his dog.

There are 24 hours in a day. 

Harold sleeps for 10 hours, so he has 24 - 10 = 14 hours left.

He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

He walks his dog for 1 hour.

Now, let's subtract the time he spends working and walking his dog from the remaining time: 14 - 8 - 1 = 5 hours.

So, Harold has 5 hours of free time left in his day.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many red shoeboxes Tim used for fishing. Since he used 1/3 of his red shoeboxes, we need to find 1/3 of 9.

1/3 of 9 is calculated as 9 / 3 = 3.

So, Tim used 3 red shoeboxes for fishing. 

Now, let's find out how many red shoeboxes are left. 
9 (initial red shoeboxes) - 3 (used red shoeboxes) = 6

Next, we need to find out how many blue shoeboxes are left. 
Tim used 3 blue shoeboxes for fishing. 
7 (initial blue shoeboxes) - 3 (used blue shoeboxes) = 4

So, there are 6 red shoeboxes and 4 blue shoeboxes left in Tim's box.

The final answer is: 
Red: 6
Blue: 4"
"To find out how many books Joseph had initially, we need to calculate twice the number of Sarah's books. Since Sarah has 9 books, Joseph had 2 * 9 = 18 books initially.

18 - 2 = 16

Joseph currently has 16 books. 

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we need to first calculate how many marbles he gave away. 

Dean gives 1/5 of his marbles to Jamie. Since Dean has 30 marbles, we can calculate 1/5 of 30 as follows: 
1/5 * 30 = 6 marbles given to Jamie.

Dean also gives 10 marbles to Donald.

So, in total, Dean gave away 6 + 10 = 16 marbles.

To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we subtract the marbles he gave away from the total number of marbles he had:
30 - 16 = 14

The final answer is: 14"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Adam's age four years ago as 'x'. Since Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, we can write an equation:

Duncan's age eight years ago = 2 * Adam's age four years ago
Duncan's age eight years ago = 2x

We know that Duncan's current age is 60, so we can find his age eight years ago by subtracting 8 from 60:

Duncan's age eight years ago = 60 - 8 = 52

Now we can equate this to 2x:

52 = 2x

To find x, we can divide both sides by 2:

x = 52 / 2
x = 26

This means Adam's age four years ago was 26. To find Adam's current age, we add 4 to x:

Adam's current age = 26 + 4 = 30

Finally, to find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8 = 38

"To find out how much Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday, we need to calculate the total number of packages he completes in that time and then multiply it by his hourly wage.

First, let's find out how many packages Colby completes in an hour. He completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, so we can write this as an expression: 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

Now, let's calculate the total number of packages Colby completes in an eight-hour workday: 40 packages/hour * 8 hours = 320 packages.

Since Colby gets paid $0.20 for every package he completes, we can multiply the total number of packages by his hourly wage to find his total earnings: 320 packages * $0.20/package = $64.

The final answer is: $64"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time taken for an extreme sudoku and then determine how many half-hour intervals fit into that time. 

A normal sudoku takes 45 minutes, and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long. So, an extreme sudoku takes 45 * 4 = 180 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we need to find out how many half-hour intervals fit into 180 minutes. 

There are 2 half-hour intervals in 1 hour, so in 180 minutes, there are 180 / 30 = 6 hours. 

Since there are 2 half-hour intervals in 1 hour, there are 6 * 2 = 12 half-hour intervals in 6 hours.

Therefore, John drinks 12 bottles of water in the time it takes to complete an extreme sudoku.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many pieces of bologna were thrown at the red balloons and then subtract that from the total number of bologna pieces to find out how many were thrown at the yellow balloons.

Since Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and there are 20 red balloons, the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons is 2 * 20 = 40.

Now, we know that Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna at the bundle of balloons. To find out how many pieces were thrown at the yellow balloons, we subtract the number of pieces thrown at the red balloons from the total: 58 - 40 = 18.

Since Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, we can find the number of yellow balloons by dividing the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons by 3: 18 / 3 = 6.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount of money Julia and Nadine had, and then divide it by 2 to find out how much each of them received as allowance.

First, let's calculate the cost of the balloons. 1 dozen balloons is equal to 12 balloons. Since 2 balloons cost $0.5, 12 balloons will cost 12 * $0.5 / 2 = $3.

The total cost of the cake and the balloons is $11 + $3 = $14.

The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is $7 * 2 = $14.

The total cost of the cake, balloons, and ice cream is $14 + $14 = $28.

Since Julia and Nadine used all the money they had to buy these items, the total amount of money they had is $28.

Since they had the same amount of allowance, we can divide the total amount of money by 2 to find out how much each of them received. 

$28 / 2 = $14

"To find the total number of shells Martha has collected by her 10th birthday, we need to calculate the number of months she has been collecting shells. Since Martha started collecting shells at 5 years old and we want to know the total by her 10th birthday, we need to consider the months from her 5th birthday to her 10th birthday.

There are 12 months in a year. From her 5th birthday to her 10th birthday, Martha would have been 5 years old for 1 year, 6 years old for 1 year, 7 years old for 1 year, 8 years old for 1 year, and 9 years old for 1 year. 

So, the total number of months is 5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many cups of tea are in each row. Since Lana divides the 27 cups into 3 rows, we can divide 27 by 3 to get the number of cups in each row.

27 cups / 3 rows = 9 cups per row

Since Lana creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, the number of mint tea cups in each row will be half of the total cups in each row.

9 cups per row / 2 = 4.5 cups of mint tea per row

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a cup, we can assume that Lana will make whole cups of tea. This means that she will make 4 cups of mint tea in each row and 5 cups of chamomile tea in each row, as the total number of cups in each row is 9.

4 cups of mint tea per row"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip. 

Let's break down the information given:

- The sloth takes 4 hours to make a round trip (down and back up) to collect berries.
- The sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

Since the sloth takes 4 hours to make a round trip, in 8 hours, he can make 8 / 4 = 2 round trips.

If he makes 2 round trips, he will collect a total of 2 * x berries, where x is the number of berries he picks up per trip.

We want to find the minimum value of x such that 2 * x = 24.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 12.

So, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip is 12.

Next, we need to find out how much water is used from the tank over 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so we can multiply this rate by the number of days:

500 gallons/day * 6 days = 3000 gallons

Now, we subtract the amount of water used from the initial amount in the tank to find the remaining water:

5000 gallons (initial) - 3000 gallons (used) = 2000 gallons

- 8 movies on other days: 8 * $7 = $56
- 2 tubs of popcorn: 2 * $8 = $16
- 4 boxes of candy: 4 * $2 = $8

Total money spent: $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130

Colby has $150 - $130 = $20 left.

Each movie costs $10, and he wants to buy a popcorn ($8) and a box of candy ($2) for the last movie. So, the cost for the last movie will be $10 + $8 + $2 = $20.

"Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as Pp, and John's age as J. 

We are given that Pp = J + 10. 

We are also given that P = Pp + J.

We are also given that P + Pp + J = 100.

Substituting Pp from the first equation into the second equation, we get P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10.

Substituting P and Pp into the third equation, we get (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100.

Combine like terms: 4J + 20 = 100.

Subtract 20 from both sides: 4J = 80.

Divide both sides by 4: J = 20.

Now that we know J, we can find Pp: Pp = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30.

Now that we know Pp, we can find P: P = Pp + J = 30 + 20 = 50.

"To determine which widget maker is more profitable, we need to calculate the total number of widgets each machine can produce in a month and then multiply that by the selling price of each widget.

First, let's calculate the total number of widgets each machine can produce in a month. The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour and runs 24 hours a day. 

60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = 1440 widgets/day
1440 widgets/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets/month

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour and runs 24 hours a day.

45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = 1080 widgets/day
1080 widgets/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets/month

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from each machine. Each widget sells for $6.

The 12-hour stay costs 1000 pesos, and the additional 5 hours (17 - 12 = 5) will cost 5 * 70 = 350 pesos. So, the total cost for this option is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

Now, let's calculate the amount of money Cameron would save by choosing the second option: 
Savings = Cost of Option 1 - Cost of Option 2
Savings = 1600 - 1350
Savings = 250 pesos

The final answer is: $250"
"To find the total amount of hay needed, we first need to determine the amount each sheep needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds and each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, we can calculate the amount each sheep needs as follows:

Twice the amount each goat needs: 2 * 5 = 10 pounds
3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs: 10 - 3 = 7 pounds

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and sheep separately:

For goats: 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds
For sheep: 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds

To find the total amount of hay needed, we add the amount needed for the goats and the amount needed for the sheep:

Total hay needed = 75 pounds (goats) + 84 pounds (sheep) = 159 pounds

The final answer is: 159"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate John's total earnings, subtract his expenses, and then determine how much money he has left to spend on pens and pencils.

First, let's calculate John's total earnings: 
50 dollars/hour * 6 hours = 300 dollars

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the pencils: 
5 pencils * 10 dollars/pencil = 50 dollars

Now, let's subtract John's gas expenses and the cost of the pencils from his total earnings: 
300 dollars - 50 dollars - 50 dollars = 200 dollars

John wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so we subtract that from his remaining money: 
200 dollars - 100 dollars = 100 dollars

Now, let's determine how many 25 dollar pens John can buy with the remaining money: 
100 dollars / 25 dollars = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of letters Craig spelled and the total number of letters his brother spelled. 

Craig spelled 20 words with 15 letters each, so the total number of letters he spelled is 20 * 15 = 300.

Since Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig, the total number of letters his brother spelled is 300 + 50 = 350.

The total number of letters they've spelled is the sum of the letters Craig and his brother spelled, which is 300 + 350 = 650.

The final numerical answer is: 650"
"To find the total number of children in the drill, we need to multiply the number of children in each row by the number of rows and then multiply the result by the number of schools.

Number of children in each row: 8
Number of rows: 7
Number of schools: 5

First, multiply the number of children in each row by the number of rows: 8 * 7 = 56
Then, multiply the result by the number of schools: 56 * 5 = 280

The total number of children in the drill is 280.

The final answer is: 280"
"To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has left, we first need to determine the total number of bottles she has initially and then subtract the number of bottles given to the students.

The teacher has 9 coupons, each redeemable for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles she has initially is 9 * 100 = 900 bottles.

Each of the 29 students gets 2 bottles of apple juice, so the total number of bottles given to the students is 29 * 2 = 58 bottles.

To find out how many bottles the teacher has left, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles she initially had: 900 - 58 = 842.

The final answer is: 842"
"To find the total amount Patty charged, we need to calculate the labor cost and add it to the cost of parts. 

First, let's calculate the labor cost. The job took 2.25 hours, and the labor rate is $35 per hour. Since the labor is charged per hour or part thereof, we need to round up to the nearest hour. However, in this case, we can simply multiply 2.25 hours by the labor rate.

Labor cost = 2.25 hours * $35/hour = $78.75

Next, we add the cost of parts, which is $60.

Total cost = Labor cost + Cost of parts
Total cost = $78.75 + $60
Total cost = $138.75

The final answer is: $138.75"
"To find out how much James spent on the CDs, we first need to calculate the original price of the CDs and then subtract the discount. 

The original price of 10 CDs is 10 * $15 = $150. 

Since James gets a 40% discount, we need to find 40% of $150. 
40% of $150 = 0.4 * $150 = $60.

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price: $150 - $60 = $90.

James spent $90 on the CDs.

Next, we need to find out how much he got back from selling 5 CDs. 
He sold each CD for $40, so he got 5 * $40 = $200.

To find out how much money James was out, we subtract the amount he got back from the amount he spent: $90 - $200 = -$110.

However, since James can't be out a negative amount of money, this means he actually lost money. He spent more than he got back. 

The final numerical answer is: -$110"
"To find the total amount Jen will earn, we need to calculate the total revenue from each type of root crop and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the revenue from the yams: 6 yams * $1.5 = $9

Next, let's calculate the revenue from the sweet potatoes: 10 sweet potatoes * $2 = $20

Now, let's calculate the revenue from the carrots: 4 carrots * $1.25 = $5

Finally, let's add the revenues together: $9 + $20 + $5 = $34

The final answer is: $34"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find the time it took James to swim 60% of the distance. The total distance is 20 miles, and 60% of that is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles. 

Since James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time it took him to swim 12 miles is 12 / 2 = 6 hours.

After swimming, James rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

Now, let's find the remaining distance. The total distance is 20 miles, and James has already swum 12 miles, so the remaining distance is 20 - 12 = 8 miles.

James then swims the remaining distance at half his original speed, which is 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour. The time it takes him to swim the remaining 8 miles is 8 / 1 = 8 hours.

The total time it took James to get across the lake is the sum of the swimming time, the resting time, and the time it took to swim the remaining distance: 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the number of loaves of bread the bakery has, we first need to calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had last Friday. 

Seven times the number of loaves Sam had is 7 * 70 = 490.

The bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had last Friday, so we need to subtract 40 from 490.

490 - 40 = 450.

The bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

The final answer is: 450"
"To find out how many stickers Jasmine has at the end, we need to calculate the total number of stickers she has after receiving and losing some.

First, Jasmine was given 15 stickers for participating in class. 
Then, she lost 7 stickers during playtime, so we subtract 7 from 15: 15 - 7 = 8 stickers left.
After that, her teacher gave her 5 more stickers for helping her classmates. 
Now, we add 5 to the 8 stickers she already had: 8 + 5 = 13 stickers.

So, Jasmine has 13 stickers at the end.

"To find the total commission earned by Cayley, we need to calculate the commission from the sales of the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal separately and then add them together.

Commission from New York Times:
- Number of copies sold: 6
- Price per copy: $5
- Commission rate: 10%
- Commission per copy: 10% of $5 = 0.1 * $5 = $0.5
- Total commission from New York Times: 6 * $0.5 = $3

Commission from Wall Street Journal:
- Number of copies sold: 10
- Price per copy: $15
- Commission rate: 8%
- Commission per copy: 8% of $15 = 0.08 * $15 = $1.2
- Total commission from Wall Street Journal: 10 * $1.2 = $12

Total commission earned by Cayley: $3 + $12 = $15

"To solve this problem, we need to first find Marcus's age. Since Deanna is 26 and Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, we can calculate Marcus's age as follows:

Marcus's age = Deanna's age - 5
Marcus's age = 26 - 5
Marcus's age = 21

Now that we know Marcus's age, we can find Leo's age. Since Marcus is half of Leo's age, we can set up the following equation:

Marcus's age = 0.5 * Leo's age
21 = 0.5 * Leo's age

To find Leo's age, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

Leo's age = 21 * 2
Leo's age = 42

The final answer is: 42"
"To find out how many points Azibo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Bahati and Dinar. 

Let's denote the points scored by Dinar as 'x'. Since Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, Bahati's points can be represented as 'x + 10'. 

We know that Azibo scored 20 more points than Bahati, so Azibo's points can be represented as '(x + 10) + 20' or 'x + 30'.

The total points scored by the team is 45, which is the sum of the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar. We can write this as an equation:

x + (x + 10) + (x + 30) = 45

Combine like terms:

3x + 40 = 45

Subtract 40 from both sides:

3x = 5

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 5/3

However, since x represents the points scored by Dinar, and we cannot have a fraction of a point, we need to re-evaluate the equation. The issue here is that the points scored by Dinar, Bahati, and Azibo must be whole numbers.

Let's re-evaluate the equation:

x + (x + 10) + (x + 30) = 45

Combine like terms:

3x + 40 = 45

Subtract 40 from both sides:

3x = 5

Since we cannot have a fraction of a point, let's try to find a different solution. We can start by assuming that Dinar scored a certain number of points, and then find the points scored by Bahati and Azibo.

Let's assume Dinar scored 5 points. Then, Bahati scored 5 + 10 = 15 points, and Azibo scored 15 + 20 = 35 points.

"To find the total number of reports Vince stapled, we need to calculate the total time he spent stapling reports and then multiply it by his stapling rate.

First, let's find the total time in minutes. Vince stapled reports from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is a total of 15 hours. 

15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Now, we know Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find his stapling rate per minute, we divide 30 reports by 15 minutes:

30 reports / 15 minutes = 2 reports/minute

Now, we multiply the total time in minutes by his stapling rate per minute:

900 minutes * 2 reports/minute = 1800 reports

So, Vince stapled 1800 reports altogether.

The final answer is: 1800"
"To find out how many minutes Kim slept on her bed, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m. This is a total of 8 hours, which is 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 5:55 a.m. instead of 6 a.m. This means she slept from 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m., which is a total of 7 hours and 55 minutes. 

To convert this to minutes, we multiply 7 hours by 60 and add 55 minutes: 7 * 60 = 420 + 55 = 475 minutes.

Now, we need to subtract the time she was sleepwalking, which was from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. This is a total of 23 minutes.

So, the total time she slept on her bed is 475 - 23 = 452 minutes.

The final answer is: 452"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many measuring spoons Jonathan has initially. Since he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, and he has two dozen cups, we can calculate the number of measuring spoons.

Two dozen cups is equal to 2 x 12 = 24 cups.

Since Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, we can multiply the number of cups by 2/3 to find the number of measuring spoons:

Measuring spoons = 24 cups * (2/3) = 16 spoons

Now, Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so we need to subtract 6 from the initial number of measuring spoons to find the remaining number of measuring spoons:

Remaining measuring spoons = 16 - 6 = 10

Since we are also asked to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we need to add the remaining measuring spoons to the number of measuring cups:

Total utensils = Remaining measuring spoons + Measuring cups
= 10 + 24
= 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we first need to calculate the number of occupied beds and then subtract it from the total capacity.

The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 of them are occupied. 

1/5 of 1000 is 100. So, the number of occupied beds is 100.

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, we need to calculate the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks is 14 days.

The total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks is 50 * 14 = 700.

Now, we add the initial occupied beds (100) to the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks (700) to get the total occupied beds after 2 weeks.

Total occupied beds = 100 + 700 = 800

Now, we subtract the total occupied beds from the total capacity to get the number of unoccupied beds.

Total unoccupied beds = 1000 - 800 = 200

The final answer is: 200"
"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we first need to determine the number of non-work emails she sends. 

She sends 16 emails a day, and 7 of them are work emails. So, the number of non-work emails is 16 - 7 = 9.

Two-thirds of the remainder (non-work emails) are to her family. This means 2/3 * 9 = 6 emails are to her family.

The remaining non-work emails (after subtracting the ones to her family) are to her boyfriend. Since 6 emails are to her family, the number of emails to her boyfriend is 9 - 6 = 3.

The final answer is: 3"
"To solve this problem, we need to find Shawna's age first and then multiply it by 5 to find her father's age.

Since Aliya is 3 years old and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, we can write an equation: Shawna's age = 3 * Aliya's age = 3 * 3 = 9 years.

Now that we know Shawna's age, we can find her father's age by multiplying Shawna's age by 5: Father's age = 5 * Shawna's age = 5 * 9 = 45 years.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number Courtney reported and subtract it from the reported number.

Let's assume the number Courtney reported is 100%. Since she overstated the number by 20%, the actual number is 80% of the reported number.

First, we need to find 20% of 48. To do this, we multiply 48 by 0.2 (which is 20% as a decimal).

20% of 48 = 48 * 0.2 = 9.6

Now, we subtract 9.6 from 48 to find the actual number of people who attended the concert.

Actual number = 48 - 9.6 = 38.4

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 38.4.

The final answer is: 38.4"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. We know that Jason carried 2 balls, and Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey. This means Jeffrey carried half the number of balls Jason carried, which is 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried 2 balls, Jordan carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls carried by each of them: 1 (Jeffrey) + 2 (Jason) + 4 (Jordan) = 7 balls.

However, this is the number of balls the boys carried, not the total number of balls the coach brought to practice. Since the boys carried all the balls in one trip, the total number of balls the coach brought to practice is equal to the number of balls the boys carried.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many holes the pirates dug in total by the end of the third day, and then determine how many holes they dug on the fourth day.

The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day, 13 holes on the second day, and 8 holes on the third day. However, they filled in 2 holes on the third day. So, the total number of holes at the end of the third day is:

10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29

The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is:

10 * 4 = 40

Since there were 29 holes at the end of the third day, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:

40 - 29 = 11

So, the pirates dug 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.

The final answer is: 11"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and the third person got 15 more than each of them. 

Let's denote the number of corn chips the third person got as x. Since the third person got 15 more than Amora and Lainey, we can write an equation:

x = 70 + 15
x = 85

So, the third person got 85 corn chips. 

Now, we know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and the third person got 85 corn chips. To find the total number of corn chips, we add the number of corn chips each person got:

Total corn chips = 70 + 70 + 85
Total corn chips = 225

The final answer is: 225"
"To find the cost of travel, we need to calculate 50% more than the cost of supplies. 

First, let's find 50% of the cost of supplies. 50% of $400 is 0.5 * 400 = $200.

Now, we add this to the cost of supplies to find the total cost of travel. $400 (supplies) + $200 (50% of supplies) = $600.

The cost of travel is $600.

The final answer is: $600"
"Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, Stan as S, and Alex as X. We are given the following information:

1. X = S + 5
2. S = 4A - 13
3. A + S + X = 339

We can substitute the first equation into the third equation to get:
A + S + (S + 5) = 339
Combine like terms:
2S + A + 5 = 339

Now, substitute the second equation into the above equation:
2(4A - 13) + A + 5 = 339
Expand the equation:
8A - 26 + A + 5 = 339
Combine like terms:
9A - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:
9A = 360

Divide both sides by 9:
A = 40

Now that we know A, we can find S:
S = 4A - 13
S = 4(40) - 13
S = 160 - 13
S = 147

The final answer is: 147"
"To find the total number of episodes, we need to determine how many episodes there are in total. Since there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, and each episode is 20 minutes long, we can set up an equation.

Let's denote the number of episodes as 'x'. Since there are half as many episodes as minutes per episode, we can write the equation as x = 20 / 2. 

Solving for x, we get x = 10. This means there are 10 episodes in total.

Now, to find the total time John will spend watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode: 10 * 20 = 200 minutes.

The final answer is: 200"
"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in the southerly direction and then add it to the distance traveled in the northerly direction.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled in the southerly direction for the first 10 hours:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 10 hours
Distance = 300 miles

Then, the bird flies towards the north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 36 miles

Since the bird is flying north, this distance is subtracted from the total southerly distance:
Total southerly distance = 300 miles - 36 miles
Total southerly distance = 264 miles

Finally, the bird flies towards the south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours
Distance = 110 miles

To find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we add the total southerly distance and the distance traveled in the final southerly direction:
Total distance = Total southerly distance + Distance in the final southerly direction
Total distance = 264 miles + 110 miles
Total distance = 374 miles

The final answer is: 374"
"To find the total number of brownies Greta had left over, we need to calculate the total number of brownies she received and subtract the number of brownies eaten.

Greta made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies for herself, which is 12 brownies. 

At her office, she received 1/2 a dozen brownies, which is 6 brownies. 

Her friends brought 4 dozen brownies, which is 48 brownies.

In total, Greta received 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies.

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies.

To find the number of brownies Greta had left over, we subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies she received: 66 - 18 = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the total age of all three family members, we first need to determine their individual ages.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 2 * 8 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means her age is 75% of Nani's age. To find 75% of Nani's age, we multiply his age by 0.75: 8 * 0.75 = 6 years.

Now that we have the ages of all three family members, we can find the total age by adding their ages together: 8 (Nani) + 16 (brother) + 6 (sister) = 30 years.

The final answer is: 30"

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first two phones and the remaining phones. 

The first two phones cost the full price of $600 each, so the total cost for the first two phones is 2 * $600 = $1200.

The remaining phones are 2 (for the kids and the wife), and each of these phones is half the price of the first two, which is $600 / 2 = $300.

The total cost for the remaining phones is 2 * $300 = $600.

Now, we add the cost of the first two phones and the remaining phones to get the total cost: $1200 + $600 = $1800.

The final answer is: $1800"
"To find the total number of players in both teams, we first need to determine the number of players on Zeke's team. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, and Carlton's team has 13 players, we can calculate the number of players on Zeke's team by adding 7 to 13.

13 (Carlton's players) + 7 = 20

Now that we know Zeke's team has 20 players, we can find the total number of players in both teams by adding the number of players on each team.

13 (Carlton's players) + 20 (Zeke's players) = 33

The final answer is: 33"
"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2l + 2w, where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the length (l) is 15 feet and the width (w) is 10 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

P = 2(15) + 2(10)
P = 30 + 20
P = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

50 feet * 2 slats/foot = 100 slats

Therefore, Robert will need 100 wooden slats for his fence.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we first need to determine how many boxes she had left after giving some to her mom and sister. 

Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges. She gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes each, so she gave away a total of 2 + 2 = 4 boxes. 

Now, we subtract the boxes she gave away from the total number of boxes she bought: 12 - 4 = 8 boxes.

Each box contains 20 oranges, so the total number of oranges in 8 boxes is 8 * 20 = 160 oranges.

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges, which is 1/4 * 160 = 40 oranges. 

To find out how many oranges she sold, we subtract the number of oranges she kept from the total number of oranges: 160 - 40 = 120 oranges.

"To solve this problem, we first need to find the number of states in the USA and India. 

The USA has 50 states. 

Half of 50 is 25. 

India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, so it has 25 + 4 = 29 states.

Now, we need to find the total number of states in both countries together. 

Total number of states = Number of states in the USA + Number of states in India 
= 50 + 29

"To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books. 

The total cost of the books is the sum of the cost of the dictionary, the dinosaur book, and the children's cookbook. 

Total cost = $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39

Since Tyler has already saved $14 from his allowance, we need to subtract this from the total cost to find out how much more he needs to earn.

Amount needed to earn = Total cost - Amount saved = $39 - $14 = $25

Now, we can find out how many hours Tyler needs to work by dividing the amount he needs to earn by his hourly wage.

Hours needed to work = Amount needed to earn / Hourly wage = $25 / $5 = 5 hours

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many cherries Richard and Jerry have. 

Since Robert has 30 cherries and has 10 more than Richard, we can find out how many cherries Richard has by subtracting 10 from Robert's total. 

Richard's cherries = Robert's cherries - 10
Richard's cherries = 30 - 10
Richard's cherries = 20

Now, we know that the total number of cherries is 60. We can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting the total number of cherries that Robert and Richard have from the total.

Total cherries = Robert's cherries + Richard's cherries + Jerry's cherries
60 = 30 + 20 + Jerry's cherries
Jerry's cherries = 60 - 50
Jerry's cherries = 10

Now that we know how many cherries each person has, we can find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry.

Robert's cherries - Jerry's cherries = 30 - 10
Robert's cherries - Jerry's cherries = 20

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many boxes of gingerbread and apple pie Sunny sold on both Saturday and Sunday, and then calculate the total earnings.

Let's denote the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday as G and the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday as A.

We know that on Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread, so G = 10.

We also know that on Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday, and on Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie. This means that A = 15 - 4 = 11.

On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday is G + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15.

Now, we can calculate the total earnings for both days.

The total earnings from gingerbread on Saturday is 10 * $6 = $60.
The total earnings from apple pie on Saturday is 11 * $15 = $165.
The total earnings from gingerbread on Sunday is 15 * $6 = $90.
The total earnings from apple pie on Sunday is 15 * $15 = $225.

The total earnings for both days is $60 + $165 + $90 + $225 = $540.

"To determine the total amount of sunscreen needed, we need to calculate the total number of ounces Pamela will use over the 8 days. 

Since she reapplies sunscreen every hour and will be outside 4 hours a day, she will reapply sunscreen 4 times a day. 

Over 8 days, she will reapply sunscreen 4 times/day * 8 days = 32 times.

Since each application is 1 ounce, she will need 32 ounces of sunscreen.

Each bottle contains 8 ounces, so to find out how many bottles she needs, we divide the total ounces needed by the ounces per bottle: 32 ounces / 8 ounces per bottle = 4 bottles.

Therefore, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Emil is 19 years old now. When he turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad and twice as old as his brother. 

Let's denote Emil's current age as E, his dad's current age as D, and his brother's current age as B. 

We know that E = 19. 

When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad, so 24 = 0.5D. 

We can solve for D by multiplying both sides by 2: 48 = D.

When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother, so 24 = 2B. 

We can solve for B by dividing both sides by 2: B = 12.

Now that we have the current ages of Emil's dad and brother, we can find the sum of their ages: D + B = 48 + 12 = 60.

So, there are 6 football players.

Now, let's find the number of remaining students. Since 6 students are football players, the remaining students are 30 - 6 = 24.

Out of the remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band.

25% of 24 = 0.25 * 24 = 6

So, there are 6 cheerleaders or band members.

The total number of students leaving early is the sum of football players and cheerleaders or band members.

6 (football players) + 6 (cheerleaders or band members) = 12

"To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to calculate the total space available for plants. 

First, we need to convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches since the width of the plants is given in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so the length of the flower bed in inches is 111 * 12 = 1332 inches.

Next, we need to subtract the space between the plants. Since there are 17 plants, there will be 16 spaces between them. The total space between the plants is 16 * 1.5 = 24 feet, which is 24 * 12 = 288 inches.

Now, we subtract the total space between the plants from the total length of the flower bed to get the total space available for the plants: 1332 - 288 = 1044 inches.

Since each plant is 12 inches wide, we can divide the total space available for the plants by the width of each plant to find out how many plants can fit: 1044 / 12 = 87.

However, Pat already owns 17 flowers, so we need to subtract these from the total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed: 87 - 17 = 70.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the plants Pat needs to buy: 70 * $6 = $420.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the petunias and the sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the petunias. Each basket will have 3 petunias, and there are 5 baskets. So, the total number of petunias is 3 * 5 = 15. The cost of each petunia is $3.00, so the total cost of the petunias is 15 * $3.00 = $45.00.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the sweet potato vines. Each basket will have 2 sweet potato vines, and there are 5 baskets. So, the total number of sweet potato vines is 2 * 5 = 10. The cost of each sweet potato vine is $2.50, so the total cost of the sweet potato vines is 10 * $2.50 = $25.00.

Now, let's add the cost of the petunias and the sweet potato vines together to find the total cost. $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00.

First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations. 

4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds
Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations = 12 + 15 = 27 pounds

Now, let's subtract the amount of soil used from the total amount of soil they bought. 

30 pounds (total soil) - 27 pounds (used soil) = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, we can plant 3 roses with the remaining soil.

"To find out how many shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we first need to calculate how much she saves each month for shoes. 

Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month and sets 25% of her paycheck aside for shoes. To find 25% of $2,000.00, we multiply $2,000.00 by 0.25.

$2,000.00 * 0.25 = $500.00

So, Jessica saves $500.00 each month for shoes. 

To find out how many shoes she can buy in a year, we need to multiply the monthly savings by 12 (the number of months in a year).

$500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00

Now, we need to find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy with $6,000.00. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp. Emily can peel 6 shrimp a minute, so to find the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp, we divide 90 by 6. 

90 / 6 = 15 minutes to peel the shrimp.

Next, we need to calculate the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp. Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, so to find the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp, we divide 90 by 30 and then multiply by 10.

90 / 30 = 3, then 3 * 10 = 30 minutes to cook the shrimp.

However, since peeling and cooking are done sequentially, we need to add the time for both tasks. 

15 minutes (peeling) + 30 minutes (cooking) = 45 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

The final answer is: 45"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net change in temperature after the air conditioner has been running and turned off.

First, let's calculate the temperature change when the air conditioner is running on low for 3 hours:

Temperature change on low = -2 degrees/hour * 3 hours = -6 degrees

Then, let's calculate the temperature change when the air conditioner is running on high for 4 hours:

Temperature change on high = -3 degrees/hour * 4 hours = -12 degrees

The total temperature change when the air conditioner is running is the sum of the temperature changes on low and high:

Total temperature change while running = -6 degrees - 12 degrees = -18 degrees

Now, let's calculate the temperature change when the air conditioner is turned off for 2 hours:

Temperature change when off = 2 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 4 degrees

The net temperature change is the sum of the total temperature change while running and the temperature change when the air conditioner is turned off:

Net temperature change = -18 degrees + 4 degrees = -14 degrees

Since the air conditioner cools the room, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how old Bill's dad was when Bill saw the comet for the second time. 

Since Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet, let's denote the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet as 'x'. Then, the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time is 3x.

We know that the time between the two sightings of the comet is 75 years. Since Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old, the age of Bill's dad when Bill saw the comet for the second time is 30 + 75 = 105 years.

Now, we can set up the equation 3x = 105 to find the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet. Solving for x, we get x = 105 / 3 = 35.

So, Bill's dad was 35 years old when he saw the comet. 

Now, we need to find out how old Bill was when his dad saw the comet. Since Bill's dad was 30 years old when he saw the comet, and Bill was three times the age of his dad when he saw the comet for the second time, we can set up the equation 3(30) = 90. This means that Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time.

However, we are asked to find the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time. Since the time between the two sightings of the comet is 75 years, we can find the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time by subtracting 75 from 90. 

90 - 75 = 15

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks for each category and then add them together.

1. Checks for the electric bill: Since Buford writes a check once per month, and there are 12 months in a year, he writes 12 checks for the electric bill per year.
2. Checks for the gas bill: Similarly, Buford writes a check once per month for the gas bill, so he also writes 12 checks for the gas bill per year.
3. Checks to the church: Buford writes a check twice per month to the church, so in a year, he writes 2 * 12 = 24 checks to the church.
4. Checks to the pest and lawn service: Buford writes a check quarterly, which means 4 times a year. So, he writes 4 checks to the pest and lawn service per year.

Now, let's add up the total number of checks:

12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn service) = 52

The final answer is: 52"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the total number of flights made by the first plane as 'x'. Since the second plane makes half the number of trips as the first plane, it makes x/2 trips.

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, which is (3/4)x. The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of flights to France is (1/4)x.

We are given that the second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. So, we can set up the equation:

x/2 = 44

To find the total number of flights made by the first plane, we can multiply both sides by 2:

x = 88

Now that we know the total number of flights made by the first plane, we can find the number of flights to France:

Flights to France = (1/4)x
= (1/4)(88)
= 22

The final answer is: 22"
"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the individual howling times and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. 
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, let's add the individual howling times together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents and subtract that from the cost of the trousers.

Adam's mother gave him $6. 
His father gave him twice as much as his mother, so his father gave him 2 * $6 = $12.

The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Since the trousers cost $30, we subtract the amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers to find out how much he had to contribute from his savings: $30 - $18 = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To find the age of Wilfred, we first need to find the average age of the group. We know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. Let's denote the average age as 'x'. 

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age, Helene's age is 2x. 

We also know that the total age of the children is 20. We can set up an equation to represent this:

Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age + Wilfred's age = Total age
3 + 4 + 2x + Wilfred's age = 20

Combine the constants:
7 + 2x + Wilfred's age = 20

Subtract 7 from both sides:
2x + Wilfred's age = 13

We also know that the average age of the group is x, and the total age is 20. We can set up another equation to represent this:

x = (Total age) / (Number of children)
x = 20 / 4
x = 5

Now that we know x, we can substitute it into the equation 2x + Wilfred's age = 13:
2(5) + Wilfred's age = 13
10 + Wilfred's age = 13

Subtract 10 from both sides:
Wilfred's age = 3

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To find out how much Walter's lawyer will contribute, we need to calculate the total amount collected from Walter's neighbors and the online fund, and then multiply it by 3.

Walter collects $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. 

Total amount collected so far = $500 + $1500 = $2000

Walter's friend donates $200, but this is not included in the amount that the lawyer will base his donation on. The lawyer will donate three times the amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund, which is $2000.

Lawyer's donation = 3 * $2000 = $6000

The final answer is: $6000"
"To find the total number of cookies, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies brought by the guests. Since each guest brought 15 cookies and there were 100 guests, the total number of cookies is 100 * 15 = 1500.

The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door. So, the number of cookies given to the church is 1/2 * 1500 = 750.

Since each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, we can find the number of people in the church by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received. 

Number of people in the church = Total cookies given to the church / Cookies per person
= 750 / 15
= 50

"To solve this problem, let's assume the total number of slices the watermelon is divided into is 'x'. Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices is 6. 

Let's denote the number of slices each kid gets as 'k'. Since each adult gets twice as many slices as each kid, the number of slices each adult gets is '2k'. 

We know that the total number of slices is 6, so we can write the equation: 2k + 2k + 4k = 6. 

Combine like terms: 8k = 6.

Divide both sides by 8: k = 6/8 = 0.75.

Since each adult gets 2k slices, each adult gets 2 * 0.75 = 1.5 slices.

The total number of slices is 6, so the total number of slices is 6. 

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to find the fraction of the total number of slices each adult gets. Since each adult gets 1.5 slices, the fraction is 1.5/6.

To convert this fraction to a percentage, we multiply by 100: (1.5/6) * 100 = 25%.

The final answer is: 25"
"To determine how many hours Doctor Jones has left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time spent on rounds and appointments, and then subtract that from the total hours he spends at the clinic.

First, let's calculate the time spent on rounds. He has 9 inpatients and each round takes 20 minutes. 

Time spent on rounds = 9 inpatients * 20 minutes/inpatient = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time spent on rounds to hours:

Time spent on rounds = 180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours

Next, let's calculate the time spent on appointments. He has 10 appointments and each appointment takes 30 minutes.

Time spent on appointments = 10 appointments * 30 minutes/appointment = 300 minutes

Converting the time spent on appointments to hours:

Time spent on appointments = 300 minutes / 60 = 5 hours

Now, let's add the time spent on rounds and appointments to get the total time spent on these activities:

Total time spent = Time spent on rounds + Time spent on appointments = 3 hours + 5 hours = 8 hours

Since Doctor Jones spends 9 hours at the clinic, we can subtract the total time spent from the total hours to find the time left for updating his records:

Time left for updating records = Total hours - Total time spent = 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

The final answer is: 1"
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake. 

First, let's add the time it takes to make the cake batter (20 minutes) and bake the cake (30 minutes): 20 + 30 = 50 minutes.

Next, we add the time it takes to cool the cake (2 hours, which is 120 minutes) and the time it takes to frost the cake (10 minutes): 120 + 10 = 130 minutes. 

Now, we add the time it takes to make the cake batter and bake the cake (50 minutes) to the time it takes to cool and frost the cake (130 minutes): 50 + 130 = 180 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 180 minutes to hours by dividing by 60: 180 / 60 = 3 hours.

Now, we need to add the 3 hours to the time at which Jordan wants to serve the cake (5:00 pm) to find the latest time she can start making the cake. 

5:00 pm + 3 hours = 8:00 pm.

"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we need to first determine the total number of boxes sold by both Lisa and Peter. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so together they sold 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

Since they sold 64 chocolate bars together and they sold 8 boxes, we can divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes to find out how many chocolate bars are in a box.

64 / 8 = 8

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to first calculate the daily earnings and then multiply it by the number of days in a month.

The cost to rent the studio per session is $25, and there are 3 sessions per week. The cost per student per session is $1.50. 

First, let's calculate the weekly earnings from the students:
10 students * $1.50 per student per session * 3 sessions per week = $45 per week

The weekly rental cost is $25 per session * 3 sessions per week = $75 per week

The weekly earnings from the students minus the weekly rental cost is $45 per week - $75 per week = -$30 per week (loss per week)

However, this is not the correct approach. The correct approach is to calculate the weekly earnings from the students and then add the weekly rental cost.

Weekly earnings from the students: 10 students * $1.50 per student per session * 3 sessions per week = $45 per week
Weekly rental cost: $25 per session * 3 sessions per week = $75 per week
Weekly earnings = $45 per week + $75 per week = $120 per week

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the monthly earnings would be:
$120 per week * 4 weeks per month = $480 per month

Weekly rental cost: $25 per session * 3 sessions per week = $75 per week
Weekly earnings = $45 per week - $75 per week = -$30 per week (loss per week)

Monthly rental cost: $75 per week * 4 weeks per month = $300 per month
Monthly earnings = ($45 per week * 4 weeks per month) - $300 per month = $180 per month - $300 per month = -$120 per month

However, this is still not the correct answer. The correct answer is the weekly earnings minus the weekly rental cost, but since we are calculating the monthly earnings, we need to multiply the weekly earnings by 4 weeks and then subtract the monthly rental cost.

Weekly earnings from the students: 10 students * $1.50 per student per session * 3 sessions per week = $45 per week

"To find the number of female porcupines, we multiply the total population by 3/5. 

Number of female porcupines = 50 * (3/5) = 30

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, we need to find the total number of babies born in a year. There are 12 months in a year.

Total babies born in a year = 30 * 4 * 12 = 1440

Now, we add the total number of babies born in a year to the initial population to find the total population after a year.

Total population after a year = 50 + 1440 = 1490

The final answer is: 1490"
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth of the pool. 

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the number of gallons needed, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. There are 7.48 gallons in a cubic foot, so:

Volume in gallons = 1400 * 7.48
Volume in gallons = 10472 gallons

Now, we multiply the volume in gallons by 5.9 to get the total gallons needed:
Total gallons = 10472 * 5.9
Total gallons = 61851.28 gallons

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon, so we multiply the total gallons by the cost per gallon:
Cost = 61851.28 * 0.10
Cost = 6185.128

The final answer is: $6185.13"
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to determine the number of blue and yellow sticks first. 

We know there are 9 red sticks and 5 more blue sticks than red. So, the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14.

The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is 14 - 3 = 11.

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks: 9 (red) + 14 (blue) + 11 (yellow) = 34.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the distance each person traveled, we need to multiply their speed by the time they traveled.

Matteo's distance = speed * time = 55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles

Shandy's distance = speed * time = 45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles

To find the difference in distance, we subtract Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance:

Difference = Shandy's distance - Matteo's distance = 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

The final answer is: 230"
"To find the total number of female students, we first need to determine the number of students over 16 and under 16, and then find the number of female students in each group.

1. Total students = 3000
2. Students over 16 = 3000 / 2 = 1500
3. Male students over 16 = 1500 / 4 = 375
4. Female students over 16 = 1500 - 375 = 1125
5. Students under 16 = 3000 / 2 = 1500
6. Male students under 16 = 1500 / 2 = 750
7. Female students under 16 = 1500 - 750 = 750

Now, we add the number of female students over 16 and under 16 to find the total number of female students.

Total female students = 1125 + 750 = 1875

"To find out how many laps each person can run, we need to calculate their individual lap counts.

Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.

Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.

Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.

Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract Quinn's lap count from Bethany's lap count: 10 - 5 = 5.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank and subtract it from the tank's capacity.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped into the tank is 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 12000 gallons. 

The remaining amount of water needed to fill the tank is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is: 6000"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation representing the charge of the power bank at the end. Let's denote the initial charge as 'x'. 

In the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining is 0.91x (since 100% - 9% = 91%, or 0.91 as a decimal).

In the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining is 0.93 * 0.91x (since 100% - 7% = 93%, or 0.93 as a decimal).

We are given that the final charge remaining is 28%. We can set up the equation as follows:

0.93 * 0.91x = 0.28

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.8463 (0.93 * 0.91):

x = 0.28 / 0.8463
x = 0.33

So, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 33%.

The final answer is: 33"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate Janet's total weekly earnings and then determine how many weeks she needs to work to save 20% of the car's cost.

First, let's calculate Janet's total weekly earnings. She makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, so her total hourly earnings are $10 + $15 = $25 per hour.

Since she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are $25/hour * 40 hours/week = $1000/week.

Next, we need to calculate 20% of the car's cost. 20% of $10,000 is 0.20 * $10,000 = $2000.

Now, we can determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save $2000. We can do this by dividing the amount she needs to save ($2000) by her weekly earnings ($1000). 

$2000 / $1000 = 2

So, Janet needs to work 2 weeks to save the down payment for the car.

"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of money he has spent so far. 

3 peaches at $0.5 each will be 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
4 pears at $0.5 each will be 4 * $0.5 = $2
2 kiwis at $1 each will be 2 * $1 = $2
5 apples at $0.75 each will be 5 * $0.75 = $3.75
Adding these amounts together, Jamaar has spent $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial $10 to find out how much money Jamaar has left. $10 - $9 = $1

Since plums cost $0.25 each, we can divide the remaining money by the cost of one plum to find out how many plums Jamaar can buy. $1 / $0.25 = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many pieces of sweets each of her friends received, we first need to determine the total number of packs Anne gave away. Since she kept 2 packs for herself, she gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs.

Next, we need to find out how many packs each friend received. Since she gave the packs equally to 10 friends, we divide the total packs given away by the number of friends: 13 packs / 10 friends = 1.3 packs per friend.

Now, we need to find out how many pieces of sweets each pack contains, which is given as 60 pieces. To find out how many pieces each friend received, we multiply the number of packs each friend received by the number of pieces per pack: 1.3 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 78 pieces.

However, since we cannot divide packs into fractions, we can round down to 1 pack per friend and give the remaining packs to the friends with more than 1 pack. But in this case, we can distribute the remaining packs to the friends with 1 pack each. 

So, 13 packs / 10 friends = 1 pack per 1 friend and 3 packs left over. We can give 1 pack to 3 friends and 1 pack to 7 friends. 

Now, 7 friends received 1 pack each, and 3 friends received 1 pack each. So, 7 friends received 60 pieces each and 3 friends received 60 pieces each.

Therefore, the total number of friends who received 60 pieces each is 7 + 3 = 10."
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the increase in price each year and add it to the original price.

Year 1: 
Original price = $120
Increase in price = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Original price = $126
Increase in price = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Original price = $132.30
Increase in price = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many pictures Olivia put into each album. Since she put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide the total number of pictures by 8.

Total pictures = 72
Pictures per album = Total pictures / Number of albums
Pictures per album = 72 / 8
Pictures per album = 9

Now, we know that 3 albums were selfies only and 2 albums were portraits. Since the number of pictures per album is 9, we can multiply this by the number of albums for each category to find the total number of selfies and portraits.

Selfies = Pictures per album * Number of selfie albums
Selfies = 9 * 3
Selfies = 27

Portraits = Pictures per album * Number of portrait albums
Portraits = 9 * 2
Portraits = 18

The final answer is: 
Selfies: 27
Portraits: 18"
"To find out how long James spends reading, we need to determine how many sets of 3 pages he reads and then multiply that by the time it takes him to read one set of 3 pages.

Since James reads 18 pages, we can divide 18 by 3 to find out how many sets of 3 pages he reads: 18 / 3 = 6.

Now, we know it takes James 10 minutes to read one set of 3 pages. Since he reads 6 sets, we multiply 10 minutes by 6: 10 * 6 = 60.

James spends 60 minutes reading his book."

"To find the number of points Aries is sure to get, we first need to determine the number of easy, average, and difficult questions in the quiz.

There are 60 questions in total. 40% of the questions are easy, so the number of easy questions is 0.4 * 60 = 24.

The rest of the questions are equally divided between average and difficult, so the number of average questions is (60 - 24) / 2 = 18, and the number of difficult questions is also 18.

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, which is 0.75 * 24 = 18. She is also sure to get half of the average and difficult questions, which is 0.5 * 18 = 9 for each.

So, the total number of points Aries is sure to get is 18 + 9 + 9 = 36.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of small stuffed animals as 's' and the number of large stuffed animals as 'l'. We know that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so we can write an equation:

s = 2l

We also know that the price of a small stuffed animal is $4. Since Teresa sold 's' small stuffed animals, the total amount she earned from small stuffed animals is 4s.

The price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal, which is 3 * 4 = $12. Since Teresa sold 'l' large stuffed animals, the total amount she earned from large stuffed animals is 12l.

We are given that Teresa earned a total of $120 from the sales. Therefore, we can write another equation:

4s + 12l = 120

Substituting s = 2l from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

4(2l) + 12l = 120
8l + 12l = 120
20l = 120

Now, we can solve for 'l':

l = 120 / 20
l = 6

Since s = 2l, we can find the number of small stuffed animals:

s = 2 * 6
s = 12

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe and then multiply it by 40 dwarves and 30 days.

First, let's find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with an iron pickaxe. Since he can mine twice as much with an iron pickaxe as with his bare hands, he can mine 2 * 12 = 24 pounds of ore per day with an iron pickaxe.

Next, let's find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe. Since he can mine 50% more with a steel pickaxe than with an iron pickaxe, he can mine 24 + (24 * 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe.

Now, let's find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day with steel pickaxes. Since one dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe, 40 dwarves can mine 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds of ore per day.

Finally, let's find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in 30 days with steel pickaxes. Since they can mine 1440 pounds of ore per day, they can mine 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds of ore in 30 days.

"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to determine the ratio of the price to the number of sandwiches for the first two packages. 

The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3, so the price per sandwich is $3 / 2 = $1.5 per sandwich. 

The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6, so the price per sandwich is $6 / 4 = $1.5 per sandwich. 

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is consistent across all packages. Therefore, the price per sandwich is $1.5.

To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we multiply the price per sandwich by the number of sandwiches: $1.5 * 8 = $12.

"To find the number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons after each event.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

First, 40% of the red balloons burst. 40% of 25 is 0.4 * 25 = 10. So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

Next, Sally released half of the yellow balloons. Half of 12 is 12 / 2 = 6. So, 6 yellow balloons were released, leaving 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.

Then, Sally found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch. 75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6. So, she added 6 blue balloons to her clutch.

"To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to consider the scenarios where he won't get an extension. 

First, let's consider the scenario where the substitute teacher is present. In this case, there's a 50% chance of the substitute teacher being present, and since the homework won't be collected in this scenario, the probability of having to turn in the homework is 0%.

Next, let's consider the scenario where the normal teacher is present. In this case, there's a 60% chance (100% - 40% extension chance). Within this 60%, there's a 80% chance (100% - 20% chance of getting a personal extension) that Marcus won't get an extension.

Now, we can calculate the overall probability of having to turn in the homework:

- Probability of substitute teacher: 50% * 0% = 0%
- Probability of normal teacher and no extension: 60% * 80% = 48%

The total probability of having to turn in the homework is the sum of these two probabilities: 0% + 48% = 48%.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the relationship between the number of small, medium, and large jelly beans. 

Let's start by using the information that eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. This means that the number of small beans is 3 times the number of medium beans.

Let's denote the number of medium beans as M. Then, the number of small beans is 3M.

We are also given that Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans. Let's denote the number of large beans as L. Then, the number of medium beans is 2L, and the number of small beans is 3(2L) = 6L.

We know that it takes 75 large beans to fill Grandpa up. Since the number of large beans is L, we can set up the equation:

L = 75

Now, we can find the number of medium beans by substituting L into the equation 2L:

M = 2L
M = 2(75)
M = 150

Now, we can find the number of small beans by substituting M into the equation 3M:

Small beans = 3M
Small beans = 3(150)
Small beans = 450

"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to first determine the total number of soda bottles he will place along the driveway.

The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. To find the total number of bottles, we can divide the width of the driveway by the spacing between the bottles:

24 feet (driveway width) / 3 feet (spacing) = 8 bottles

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will need to place 7 more bottles (8 total bottles - 1 already placed). 

It will take Richard 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, dropping the candy in. Since he needs to do this 7 times, we can multiply the time it takes to place one bottle by the total number of bottles:

5 seconds/bottle * 7 bottles = 35 seconds

First, let's calculate the total amount of loans he took: 
4 years * $50,000/year = $200,000

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money he lost due to not working while in college. 
His income before college was $25,000/year. 
His income after college is tripled, so it's $25,000 * 3 = $75,000/year. 
The difference in income is $75,000 - $25,000 = $50,000/year. 
Since he didn't work for 4 years, he lost 4 years * $50,000/year = $200,000.

The total amount of money he needs to earn is the sum of the loans and the lost income: 
$200,000 (loans) + $200,000 (lost income) = $400,000.

Now, let's calculate how long it would take him to earn this amount at his new income of $75,000/year:
Time = Total amount / Annual income
Time = $400,000 / $75,000
Time = 5.33 years

The final answer is: 5.33"
"To find the total area of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the larger fabric pieces. The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide, so the larger fabric pieces will be 6 + 2 = 8 feet long and 8 + 2 = 10 feet wide.

The area of each fabric piece is length times width, so the area of each piece is 8 * 10 = 80 square feet. Since Jim needs two pieces, he needs a total of 2 * 80 = 160 square feet of fabric.

The final answer is: 160"
"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then add them up.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. One-fifth of 425 is 425 / 5 = 85. 17 more than that is 85 + 17 = 102. So, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. Twice as many as Tuesday is 102 * 2 = 204. 5 more than that is 204 + 5 = 209. So, on Wednesday, they delivered 209 letters.

Now, let's add up the number of letters delivered each day: 425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736.

The final answer is: 736"
"To find the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad separately and then add them together.

The cost of the chicken salad is 10 people * $6.50 per person = $65.
The cost of the pasta salad is 6 people * $6 per person = $36.

Now, we add the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad together: $65 + $36 = $101.

The total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $101."
"To find the average loss, we need to calculate the total loss and then divide it by the number of races.

First, let's calculate the amount Johnny's dad lost and won in each race.

1. Loss in the first race: -$5
2. Win in the second race: 2 * (-$5) + $1 = -$9 + $1 = -$8
3. Loss in the third race: 1.5 * (-$8) = -$12

Now, let's calculate the total loss: -$5 + (-$8) + (-$12) = -$25

There were 3 races. To find the average loss, we divide the total loss by the number of races: -$25 / 3 = -$8.33

"To find the total population of South America, we need to calculate the total number of people living in all the cities across all the countries.

First, let's find the total number of people living in one country. There are 5 cities in each country, and each city has 1000 people. 

Total people in one country = 5 cities * 1000 people per city = 5000 people

Since there are 26 countries in South America, we multiply the total number of people in one country by the number of countries.

Total people in South America = 5000 people per country * 26 countries = 130,000 people

The final answer is: 130000"
"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we first need to calculate their current heights. 

Xavier's initial height was 4 feet, which is equivalent to 48 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches). He grew 3 inches over the summer, so his current height is 48 + 3 = 51 inches.

Cole's initial height was 50 inches, and he grew 2 inches over the summer, so his current height is 50 + 2 = 52 inches.

The difference in height between Cole and Xavier is 52 - 51 = 1 inch.

The final answer is: 1"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the share of the first person as x. 

Since the second person took $80 more than the first, the second person's share is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is 2(x + 80).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920.

Combine like terms: x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920.

Combine like terms again: 4x + 240 = 1920.

Subtract 240 from both sides: 4x = 1680.

Divide both sides by 4: x = 420.

The final answer is: $420"
"To find the total hours worked by each painter, we first need to calculate the total hours worked in 3 weeks. 

There are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks have 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Since the painters worked 3/8ths of a day every day, we need to convert 3/8ths to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3/8 * 24 = 9 hours.

Now, we multiply the hours worked per day by the number of days to get the total hours worked: 9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours.

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4 to get the hours worked by each painter: 189 hours / 4 = 47.25 hours.

The final numerical answer is: 47.25"
"Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as 'x'. 

Since Rory retrieved four more balls in the first set than in the second, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set, which is given as 19. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for x, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Combine like terms:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms again:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

Number of balls in the first set = x + 4
= 6 + 4
= 10

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation of the car from 2007 to 2010.

The car was bought in 2007 for $20,000. 

The price of the car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year. 

First, we'll calculate the depreciation for 3 years (from 2007 to 2010).

Year 1 (2008): 
Price in 2008 = 20,000 - (20,000 * 0.21) 
Price in 2008 = 20,000 - 4,200 
Price in 2008 = 15,800

Year 2 (2009): 
Price in 2009 = 15,800 - (15,800 * 0.21) 
Price in 2009 = 15,800 - 3,326 
Price in 2009 = 12,474

Year 3 (2010): 
Price in 2010 = 12,474 - (12,474 * 0.21) 
Price in 2010 = 12,474 - 2,620.74 
Price in 2010 = 9,853.26

The price of the car in 2010 is $9,853.26."
"To find the number of Spanish books, we first need to determine the total number of books that are not written in English. Since half of the books are written in English, that's 50 / 2 = 25 books in English.

We are also given that 10% of the books are written in German. To find the number of German books, we need to calculate 10% of 50, which is 0.1 * 50 = 5 books in German.

Now, to find the number of Spanish books, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books: 50 - 25 - 5 = 20 books in Spanish.

"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we need to subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance. 

First, let's calculate the total distance Bernice has driven: 
Distance driven = 325 kilometers/day * 4 days = 1300 kilometers

Now, let's subtract the distance driven from the total distance:
Total distance = 1955 kilometers
Distance driven = 1300 kilometers
Distance left = Total distance - Distance driven
Distance left = 1955 - 1300
Distance left = 655 kilometers

"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to first calculate how many cups she drinks in 30 days and then convert that to gallons.

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. To find out how many cups she drinks in 30 days, we multiply the number of cups she drinks per day by 30.

8 cups/day * 30 days = 240 cups

Now, we need to convert the total number of cups to gallons. There are 16 cups in a gallon, so we divide the total number of cups by 16.

240 cups / 16 cups/gallon = 15 gallons

So, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Romeo boards the train with 120 people.

At the first stop, 20 more people board the train. So, the total number of people on the train becomes:
120 (initial people) + 20 (new people) = 140

At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, and twice that number (100 people) board the train. So, the total number of people on the train becomes:
140 (people after the first stop) - 50 (people who descended) = 90
90 + 100 (new people) = 190

At the third stop, 80 more people descend from the train. So, the total number of people on the train becomes:
190 (people after the second stop) - 80 (people who descended) = 110

"To find the total amount Alison spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

1. The tank top costs $10.
2. The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $10 + $5 = $15.
3. The tennis shoes were originally $48, but they were on sale for half price. Half of $48 is $48 / 2 = $24.
4. The athletic socks cost $8, and she had a coupon for $2 off, so the socks cost $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items: $10 (tank top) + $15 (shorts) + $24 (tennis shoes) + $6 (socks) = $55.

"To determine the total cost of renovating your kitchen floor, we need to calculate the total number of tiles required and then multiply it by the cost of each tile.

Since each tile is a square with a side length of 1 ft, the area of each tile is 1 ft * 1 ft = 1 SqFt.

To find the total number of tiles required, we divide the total area of the kitchen floor by the area of each tile:

Total area of kitchen floor = 200 SqFt
Area of each tile = 1 SqFt
Total number of tiles = Total area of kitchen floor / Area of each tile
Total number of tiles = 200 SqFt / 1 SqFt
Total number of tiles = 200

Now, we multiply the total number of tiles by the cost of each tile to find the total cost:

Cost of each tile = $12
Total cost = Total number of tiles * Cost of each tile
Total cost = 200 * $12
Total cost = $2400

"To find out how many loads of laundry Greg does in a week, we need to calculate the total number of twin and king size sheets he puts on the beds and then divide that by the number of sheets he can wash at a time.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. Since each twin bed requires 1 set of sheets and the king size bed requires 1 set of sheets, the total number of sets of sheets he puts on the beds is 4 (twin) + 1 (king) = 5 sets.

Since the laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time, we need to calculate how many twin sets he needs to wash in a week. 4 twin sets are needed, so he will need to wash 4 / 2 = 2 loads of twin sets. 

The king size bed requires 1 set of sheets per week, so he will need to wash 1 load of king size sheets.

In total, Greg needs to wash 2 loads of twin sets and 1 load of king size sheets, which is 2 + 1 = 3 loads of laundry per week.

To find out how many loads of laundry he does in a year, we multiply the number of loads per week by the number of weeks in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so Greg does 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year.

"To find out how many days the cat food will last, we need to divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the amount of cat food each cat eats per day (60 grams).

First, we need to calculate the total amount of cat food Imma's 3 cats eat per day. Since each cat eats 60 grams of food twice a day, we multiply 60 grams by 2 to get the daily consumption per cat, which is 120 grams. Then, we multiply this by the number of cats, which is 3.

Daily consumption per cat: 60 grams * 2 = 120 grams
Total daily consumption for 3 cats: 120 grams * 3 = 360 grams

Now, we divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the total daily consumption (360 grams) to find out how many days it will last.

720 grams / 360 grams = 2

The cat food will last for 2 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many slices Jake and Silvia ate. 

Since Becky ate 10 slices and she ate 3 more slices than Jake, Jake must have eaten 10 - 3 = 7 slices.

Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate 2 * 7 = 14 slices.

Now, we know that Becky ate 10 slices, Jake ate 7 slices, and Silvia ate 14 slices. To find the total number of slices they ate, we add these numbers together: 10 + 7 + 14 = 31.

"Let's denote the time Donovan took to make his part as 'x'. Since Betsy took 18 minutes longer than Donovan, the time Betsy took can be represented as 'x + 18'. 

The total time taken to make the meal is the sum of the time taken by both Betsy and Donovan, which is given as 98 minutes. So, we can write the equation as:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:
2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Since x represents the time Donovan took, and Betsy took 18 minutes longer, Betsy's time is x + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

The cost of the painkillers is $4/pill for 30 pills. So, the cost of the painkillers is $4 * 30 = $120.

The cost of parking is $6/hour for 2 hours. So, the cost of parking is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, let's add up the costs: $200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482.

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."

"To find the total number of pizzas left, we first need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by both the glee club and the football team.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. To find 70% of 20, we multiply 20 by 0.7. 

20 * 0.7 = 14 pizzas eaten by the glee club.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. They ate 80% of them, which is 40 * 0.8 = 32 pizzas.

Now, we add the number of pizzas eaten by both groups: 14 (glee club) + 32 (football team) = 46 pizzas eaten in total.

The total number of pizzas ordered was 20 (glee club) + 40 (football team) = 60 pizzas.

To find the number of pizzas left, we subtract the total number of pizzas eaten from the total number of pizzas ordered: 60 - 46 = 14 pizzas left.

"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of big coupons. Since Anthony wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, and he's sending out 700 small coupons, he'll send out 2 * 700 = 1400 big coupons.

The cost of mailing the small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents.

The cost of mailing the big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

Now, let's add the cost of mailing the small and big coupons together: 3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents.

"To find the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we first need to determine the number of trucks that did not experience mechanical failures. 

Since a quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures, we can calculate the number of trucks that failed as follows:

Number of trucks dispatched = 20
Number of trucks that failed = 20 * (1/4) = 5

Now, we subtract the number of trucks that failed from the total number of trucks dispatched to find the number of trucks that reached the farmers:

Number of trucks that reached the farmers = 20 - 5 = 15

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. To find the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we multiply the number of trucks that reached the farmers by the tons of fertiliser each truck carried:

Total tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers = 15 * 20 = 300

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of 6 pounds of butter with the promotion.

First, let's calculate the cost of 6 pounds of butter at the regular price: 6 pounds * $4.00 per pound = $24.00.

Since the promotion is buy one pound of butter get one half off, we can consider it as a 50% discount on the second pound of butter. So, for every two pounds of butter, Dennis will pay the full price for one pound and half the price for the other pound.

For 6 pounds of butter, we can divide it into 3 sets of 2 pounds each. The cost for each set is: $4.00 (full price) + $2.00 (half price) = $6.00.

Now, we multiply the cost of each set by the number of sets: 3 sets * $6.00 per set = $18.00.

Therefore, the total cost of 6 pounds of butter with the promotion is $18.00.

"To find the total cost of the party, we need to calculate the number of guests and then apply the given fee structure.

First, let's find the total number of guests. Kayla invited 25 classmates, 7 dance class girls, and 13 family members, but 4 people said they couldn't come. So, the total number of guests is:
25 (classmates) + 7 (dance class girls) + 13 (family members) - 4 (those who couldn't come) = 41

Since the theater can accommodate 20 guests for $125, and there are 41 guests, we need to calculate the additional guests:
41 (total guests) - 20 (base capacity) = 21 (additional guests)

The fee for the additional guests is $6 per person, so the cost for the additional guests is:
21 (additional guests) * $6 (per guest) = $126

Now, we add the base fee and the cost for the additional guests:
$125 (base fee) + $126 (additional guests) = $251

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money Maggie and Riza had initially. Since they each had $60 after spending a portion of their money, we can set up an equation to represent the situation.

Let's say Maggie had x dollars initially. Since she spent a quarter of her money, she has 3/4x dollars left. Similarly, let's say Riza had y dollars initially. Since she spent one-third of her money, she has 2/3y dollars left.

We know that both of them have $60 left, so we can set up the following equations:

3/4x = 60
2/3y = 60

To solve for x and y, we can multiply both sides of each equation by the reciprocal of the fraction:

x = 60 * 4/3 = 80
y = 60 * 3/2 = 90

Now that we know Maggie had $80 initially and Riza had $90 initially, we can find the total amount of money they had:

Total money = x + y = 80 + 90 = 170

Since they spent a portion of their money, we need to add back the amount they spent to find the total amount of money they had initially. Maggie spent 1/4 of her money, which is 20 dollars, and Riza spent 1/3 of her money, which is 30 dollars. So, the total amount they spent is 20 + 30 = 50 dollars.

The total amount of money they had initially is 170 + 50 = 220 dollars.

Now, to find the total amount of money they have left, we subtract the amount they spent from the total amount they had initially:

Total money left = 220 - 50 = 170

"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we first need to determine how many bananas the second monkey eats. 

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day.

Since there are three monkeys in total, and they eat all the bananas in a day, we can set up an equation to find the total number of bananas eaten by the three monkeys in a day. Let's denote the number of bananas the third monkey eats as x. The total number of bananas eaten by the three monkeys in a day is 10 + 14 + x.

We know that the total number of bananas Mr. Robles buys is 315, and this is enough to feed the monkeys for a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of bananas eaten by the three monkeys in a week is 315. 

We can set up the equation: 10 + 14 + x * 7 = 315. 

Simplifying the equation, we get 24 + 7x = 315. 

Subtracting 24 from both sides, we get 7x = 291. 

Dividing both sides by 7, we get x = 41.57. However, since the number of bananas cannot be a fraction, we round down to the nearest whole number because you can't eat a fraction of a banana.

The third monkey eats 41 bananas each day.

Since roses cost $2 each, 15 roses will be 15 * $2 = $30. However, the florist offers a discount for a dozen roses, which is 12 roses. Since Jenny bought 15 roses, she gets the discount for 3 roses (15 - 12 = 3) and the rest (12) at the discounted price. 

The cost of 12 roses at the discounted price is $15. The cost of the remaining 3 roses is 3 * $2 = $6. So the total cost is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny paid with five $5 bills, which is a total of 5 * $5 = $25. 

To find out how much change she gets, we subtract the total cost from the amount she paid: $25 - $21 = $4.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the $4 into quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so there are 4 * 4 = 16 quarters in $4.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to calculate the revenue from each item and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the revenue from milkshakes: 
6 milkshakes * $5.50 each = 6 * 5.50 = $33

Next, let's calculate the revenue from burger platters: 
9 burger platters * $11 each = 9 * 11 = $99

Now, let's calculate the revenue from sodas: 
20 sodas * $1.50 each = 20 * 1.50 = $30

Finally, let's add the revenue from all items together: 
$33 + $99 + $30 = $162

The final answer is: $162"
"To find the time Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the time from the moment he arrives at the station to the moment the fourth train arrives.

The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the first train leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. The third train leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it also leaves at 125 minutes.

The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes. This is the time Paul will board his train.

Since Paul is waiting for the fourth train, we need to find the time from the moment he arrives at the station to the moment the fourth train arrives. We don't know the exact time Paul arrives at the station, but we can assume it's 0 minutes for simplicity. 

The time Paul will wait for his train is 145 minutes.

The final answer is: 145"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many toothpicks Melanie has saved so far and then determine how many more weeks it will take her to reach 200 toothpicks.

Melanie saved 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. To find the total number of toothpicks she has saved, we multiply the number of toothpicks she saves per week by the number of weeks:

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Since Melanie needs 200 toothpicks for the sculpture, we subtract the number of toothpicks she has saved from the total number of toothpicks she needs:

200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take Melanie to save the remaining 80 toothpicks. Since she saves 10 toothpicks per week, we divide the remaining number of toothpicks by the number of toothpicks she saves per week:

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

Therefore, Melanie will need 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we first need to determine the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch and the price at which he sold it to his friend.

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price, so the price he paid is 75% of $2000, which is 0.75 * $2000 = $1500.

Then, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, which is 1.2 * $1500 = $1800.

To find the discount percentage, we need to find the difference between the original price and the price at which Mr. Rogers' friend bought the watch, and then divide it by the original price and multiply by 100.

The discount percentage is (($2000 - $1800) / $2000) * 100 = (200 / 2000) * 100 = 10%.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours and then multiply it by the rate at which the springs create jellyfish.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, and 60 seconds in a minute. So, the total number of seconds in 4 hours is:

60 minutes/hour * 60 seconds/minute * 4 hours = 14400 seconds

Since each spring creates a new jellyfish every second, the total number of jellyfish created by one spring in 14400 seconds is 14400.

Now, if we have 5 springs working at the same rate, the total number of jellyfish created in 14400 seconds is:

14400 * 5 = 72000

So, 5 springs working at the same rate would create 72000 jellyfish in 4 hours.

The final answer is: 72000"
"To find Frankie's score, we need to first calculate twice Binkie's score and then add 15 to it. 

Binkie's score is 90. Twice Binkie's score is 2 * 90 = 180. 

Now, we add 15 to this result: 180 + 15 = 195.

Frankie's score is 195."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the time it took James to walk to the store and the time it took him to walk back home.

First, let's find the total distance James walked. Since he walked to the store and then back home, the total distance is 2 times the distance from home to the store, which is 2 * 4 = 8 miles.

Since James walks at a constant speed of 4 miles per hour, we can use the formula time = distance / speed to find the total time it took him to walk the total distance. 

time = distance / speed
time = 8 miles / 4 miles per hour
time = 2 hours

However, this is the total time it took him to walk to the store and back home. Since the question asks for the time it took him to reach the store, we need to divide this total time by 2.

time_to_reach_store = total_time / 2
time_to_reach_store = 2 hours / 2
time_to_reach_store = 1 hour

The final answer is: 1"
"To find out how much money Jenny saved, we first need to calculate the total cost of buying the bananas individually and then compare it to the cost of buying them in bunches.

If Jenny buys 10 bunches with 4 bananas per bunch, she buys a total of 10 * 4 = 40 bananas.

The cost of buying 40 bananas individually would be 40 * $0.80 = $32.00.

The cost of buying 10 bunches is $3.00 per bunch, so the total cost is 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

To find the savings, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

So, Jenny saved $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Sam gets x feet of the fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets x + 60 feet.

We know that the total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. To find out how much is left over, we need to subtract the total amount of fence Sam and Harry got from the total length of the fence:

100 - (20 + (20 + 60)) = 100 - 100 = 0

However, this is not the correct interpretation of the question. The question asks how much is left over for Sam, implying that the leftover is the portion that is not assigned to either Sam or Harry. Since Sam and Harry together got 20 + (20 + 60) = 100 feet, there is no leftover fence.

However, if we interpret the question as asking how much is left over after Sam and Harry take their portions, the answer is 0."
"To find the rate of growth per year, we need to divide the growth in inches by the number of years. 

Growth per year = 8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches per year.

Now, we can multiply the growth per year by the total number of years to find the total growth in 13 years.

Total growth = 2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches.

The final answer is: 26"
"To find out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply it by its price.

First, let's find the number of each type of bike sold:

- Total bikes sold: 300
- Trekking bikes: 300 / 2 = 150
- BMX bikes: 300 * 0.15 = 45
- MTB bikes: 300 - (150 + 45) = 105

Now, let's calculate the revenue from each type of bike:
- Revenue from Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500
- Revenue from BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250 (since BMX is half the price of MTB, which is $500, so BMX is $500 / 2 = $250)
- Revenue from MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500

Now, let's add up the revenue from all types of bikes:
$67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250

The final answer is: $131,250"
"To find out how many bales of hay are left in the field, we need to calculate the total number of bales made by the farmer and the total number of bales picked up by the truck, and then subtract the latter from the former.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour. In a 6-hour day, the farmer will make 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour. In a 6-hour day, the truck will pick up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

Now, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the total number of bales made by the farmer: 30 - 18 = 12.

So, there are 12 bales of hay left in the field.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total time John spends learning, we need to calculate the time spent in classes, and the extra time spent on Saturday and Sunday.

First, let's calculate the time spent in classes. John takes 2 extra classes, each 40 minutes long, 5 days a week. 

Time spent in classes per day = 2 * 40 minutes = 80 minutes
Time spent in classes per week = 80 minutes * 5 days = 400 minutes

Now, let's calculate the extra time spent on Saturday and Sunday. John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on extra learning time. 

First, we need to find the total minutes in a week. There are 24 hours in a day, and 7 days in a week, so there are 24 * 7 = 168 hours in a week. 

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total minutes in a week = 168 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 10080 minutes

Now, we can find the extra time spent on Saturday and Sunday. 

Extra time per week = 1/16 * 10080 minutes = 630 minutes

Now, we add the time spent in classes and the extra time spent on Saturday and Sunday to find the total time spent learning.

Total time spent learning = 400 minutes + 630 minutes = 1030 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60.

Total time spent learning in hours = 1030 minutes / 60 = 17.17 hours

"To find the height of the ball on its second bounce, we need to calculate the height of the ball after the first bounce and then multiply it by 2/3.

The initial height of the ball is the height of the third floor, which is 24 feet.

On the first bounce, the ball reaches 2/3 of its initial height, so the height after the first bounce is:
24 * (2/3) = 16 feet

On the second bounce, the ball reaches 2/3 of the height it had after the first bounce, so the height after the second bounce is:
16 * (2/3) = 10.67 feet

The final answer is: 10.67"
"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the height of each child in inches. 

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 6 feet to inches by multiplying 6 by 12. 
6 feet * 12 inches/foot = 72 inches

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so we add 2 inches to the height of the first child.
72 inches + 2 inches = 74 inches

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so we subtract 5 inches from the height of the second child.
74 inches - 5 inches = 69 inches

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so we add 3 inches to the height of the third child.
69 inches + 3 inches = 72 inches

The final answer is: 72"
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to determine the number of bags sold and then multiply that by the price per bag.

Since the orchard sold a total of 2000 apples and each bag contains 10 apples, we can divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag to find the number of bags sold.

Number of bags sold = Total apples / Apples per bag
= 2000 / 10
= 200

Now, we can multiply the number of bags sold by the price per bag to find the total earnings.

Total earnings = Number of bags sold * Price per bag
= 200 * $5
= $1000

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the amount of meat left after the Allosaurus ate. 

The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat. Before that, the velociraptors scavenged half of what was left. So, the amount of meat left after the velociraptors ate was twice the amount the Allosaurus ate, which is 2 * 270 = 540 kilograms.

Now, the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, and the velociraptors scavenged half of what was left. This means the velociraptors ate half of the remaining half, which is 1/4 of the original amount. So, the amount of meat left after the T-Rex ate was 4 times the amount the velociraptors ate, which is 4 * 540 = 2160 kilograms.

Since the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, the original amount of meat on the triceratops was twice the amount the T-Rex ate, which is 2 * 2160 = 4320 kilograms.

"To find the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted and then divide it by the coverage of a gallon of paint to find out how many gallons are needed. After that, we can multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon to get the total cost.

First, let's calculate the area of each wall:
- North wall: 10 x 8 = 80 square feet
- South wall: 10 x 8 = 80 square feet
- East wall: 5 x 8 = 40 square feet
- West wall: 5 x 8 = 40 square feet

Now, let's add up the areas of all the walls:
80 + 80 + 40 + 40 = 240 square feet

Since a gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, we need to divide the total area by 20 to find out how many gallons are needed:
240 / 20 = 12 gallons

Now, let's multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon to get the total cost:
12 gallons * $12/gallon = $144

The final answer is: $144"
"To find the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to determine the probability of her choosing a shaken can out of the remaining cans.

Initially, there were 12 sodas. Ellen shook 3 of them, so there are 3 shaken sodas and 9 unshaken sodas. Ellen took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 8 unshaken sodas and 3 shaken sodas.

Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 2 shaken sodas and 6 unshaken sodas.

Now, there are 2 shaken sodas and 6 unshaken sodas. The total number of sodas is 8.

The probability of Ellen's friend choosing a shaken can is the number of shaken cans divided by the total number of cans: 2/8 = 0.25.

To express this as a percentage, multiply by 100: 0.25 * 100 = 25%.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the distance each train travels in 3 hours and then add those distances together.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. To find the distance it travels in 3 hours, we multiply its speed by the time:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour x 3 hours
Distance = 180 miles

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. To find the distance it travels in 3 hours, we multiply its speed by the time:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour x 3 hours
Distance = 90 miles

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, we add the distances they traveled to find the total distance between them:

Total Distance = Distance of first train + Distance of second train
Total Distance = 180 miles + 90 miles
Total Distance = 270 miles

The final answer is: 270"
"To find the total number of people Billy can help, we first need to determine the number of days he works. 

March has 31 days, and April has 19 days (since April 19th is the last day). So, the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th is 31 + 19 = 50 days.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, we need to find 20% of 50. To do this, we multiply 50 by 0.2: 50 * 0.2 = 10.

This means Billy takes 10 days off. So, the number of days he works is 50 - 10 = 40 days.

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, which means he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

To find the total number of people he can help, we multiply the number of days he works by the number of people he can help per day: 40 * 6 = 240.

"To find the total number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people who were transported by the buses and the cars, and then subtract that from the total number of people who attended the wedding.

First, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the buses: 
12 buses * 35 people per bus = 420 people

Next, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the cars: 
20 cars * 3 people per car = 60 people

Now, let's add the number of people transported by the buses and the cars to get the total number of people outside the church: 
420 people + 60 people = 480 people

Since the total number of people outside the church is 480, and there were 480 people outside the church, the number of people inside the church is the total number of people who attended the wedding minus the number of people outside the church. However, the total number of people outside the church is equal to the total number of people who attended the wedding. 

Therefore, the number of people inside the church is 0."
"To find Jeff's age, we need to determine Martha's age first. Since Mike is 24 years old and Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, we can calculate Martha's age by subtracting 4 from Mike's age.

Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
Martha's age = 24 - 4
Martha's age = 20

Now that we know Martha's age, we can find Jeff's age since he is 10 years older than Martha.

Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
Jeff's age = 20 + 10
Jeff's age = 30

Now that we know Micah ran 28 miles, we can subtract the total miles run by Amber and Micah from the total miles run by all three to find out how many miles Ahito ran.

Total miles run by all three = 52 miles
Miles run by Amber = 8 miles
Miles run by Micah = 28 miles
Miles run by Ahito = Total miles - (Miles run by Amber + Miles run by Micah)

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. 

A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is x/5.

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (x/5) * (1/3) = x/15.

The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue, so the number of small jellyfish is x - x/5 = 4x/5.

We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color, which means x/15 = 6.

To find the total number of jellyfish, we can solve for x: x/15 = 6 => x = 6 * 15 = 90.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate Lauren's total savings needed for retirement and then determine how many years she needs to work to achieve this goal.

First, let's calculate Lauren's annual expenses in retirement. Since she plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary, her annual expenses will be:

40% of $100,000 = 0.4 x $100,000 = $40,000

Since Lauren plans to live for 20 years in retirement, her total expenses will be:

$40,000 x 20 = $800,000

Next, we need to calculate Lauren's annual savings. Since she saves 20% of her salary, her annual savings will be:

20% of $100,000 = 0.2 x $100,000 = $20,000

Now, we need to calculate how many years Lauren needs to work to save $800,000 at an annual savings rate of $20,000. We can use the formula:

Number of years = Total savings / Annual savings
= $800,000 / $20,000
= 40 years

However, this is the total number of years Lauren needs to work to save for retirement, but we need to subtract the 20 years she plans to live in retirement. Therefore, the number of years Lauren needs to work is:

40 - 20 = 20 years

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.4:

x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

Now that we know the total population of the school is 600, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total population:

Number of girls = Total population - Number of boys

Soledad is planning to hike 125 miles twice a day, which is a total of 250 miles per day. To find out how many more miles per day she needs to hike, we subtract her planned daily miles from her target daily miles:

310 miles per day - 250 miles per day = 60 miles per day

So, Soledad must hike 60 more miles per day to complete her journey on time.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the total amount the store will receive after selling all the balls, we need to calculate the total revenue from each color of balls and add them together.

The store has 3 red balls, and each red ball costs $9. So, the total revenue from red balls is 3 * $9 = $27.

The store has 11 blue balls, and each blue ball costs $5. So, the total revenue from blue balls is 11 * $5 = $55.

The store has 25 green balls, and each green ball costs $3. So, the total revenue from green balls is 25 * $3 = $75.

Now, let's add the revenues from all the balls together: $27 + $55 + $75 = $157.

The final answer is: $157"
"To find out how much James will have left, we first need to determine how much Pierre and Paul will take. 

Pierre wants a quarter of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/4 = 3 kg. 

Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/3 = 4 kg.

So, Pierre and Paul will take 3 + 4 = 7 kg in total.

Since they bought 12 kg, James will have 12 - 7 = 5 kg left.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the temperature in the morning, we need to subtract the temperature drop from the initial temperature and then add the temperature increase.

Initial temperature = 2 degrees Celsius
Temperature drop = 8 degrees Celsius
Temperature increase = 3 degrees Celsius

First, subtract the temperature drop from the initial temperature:
2 - 8 = -6 degrees Celsius

Then, add the temperature increase to the result:
-6 + 3 = -3 degrees Celsius

The temperature in the morning was -3 degrees Celsius.

"To find out how much money Raymond has left, we need to calculate the total amount of money he spent and subtract that from the initial amount he had.

First, let's calculate the total amount spent: $5 (comic book) + $19 (puzzle) = $24.

Now, let's subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount Raymond had: $21 (initial amount) - $24 (total spent) = -$3.

However, since we can't have a negative amount of money, this means that Raymond doesn't have enough money to buy the puzzle. He is short $3.

But if we consider the puzzle purchase as an impossible transaction, we can calculate the amount of money he has left after buying the comic book: $21 (initial amount) - $5 (comic book) = $16.

So, Raymond has $16 left after buying the comic book."
"To find out how much each book cost, we need to first determine how much Anna spent on the books. We know she had a budget of $16 and had $2 left, so she spent $16 - $2 = $14 on the books.

Since Anna bought 2 books and they cost the same amount of money, we can divide the total amount she spent ($14) by 2 to find the cost of each book.

Cost of each book = Total amount spent / Number of books
Cost of each book = $14 / 2
Cost of each book = $7

The final answer is: $7"
"To find the number of students enrolled this year, we need to calculate 20% of the previous year's enrollment and add it to the previous year's enrollment.

20% of 50 is 0.20 x 50 = 10.

So, the increase in enrollment is 10 students.

To find the total number of students this year, we add the increase to the previous year's enrollment: 50 + 10 = 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times, we need to first determine the rate at which the light blinks. 

The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. To find the rate, we divide the number of blinks by the time: 255 blinks / 5 minutes = 51 blinks per minute.

Now, we can use this rate to find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times. We divide the total number of blinks by the rate: 459 blinks / 51 blinks per minute.

459 / 51 = 9 minutes.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the difference between the number of female and male fishes, we first need to calculate the total number of each type of fish after Tate's purchase.

Initially, there are:
- 4 male guppies and 7 female guppies, making a total of 11 guppies.
- 3 male goldfishes and 5 female goldfishes, making a total of 8 goldfishes.

Tate buys:
- 2 male guppies and 1 female guppy, making a total of 3 guppies.
- 2 male goldfishes and 3 female goldfishes, making a total of 5 goldfishes.

After the purchase, the total number of each type of fish is:
- Male guppies: 4 + 2 = 6
- Female guppies: 7 + 1 = 8
- Male goldfishes: 3 + 2 = 5
- Female goldfishes: 5 + 3 = 8

Now, let's calculate the total number of male and female fishes:
- Total male fishes: 6 (guppies) + 5 (goldfishes) = 11
- Total female fishes: 8 (guppies) + 8 (goldfishes) = 16

The difference between the number of female and male fishes is 16 - 11 = 5."
"To find the total time they all took to do their chores, we need to calculate the time each person took and add them together.

Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia, so Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours to walk the dog.

Dior took 4 hours longer than Amalia, so Dior took 4 + 4 = 8 hours to do laundry.

Now, let's add the time each person took to do their chores: 4 (Amalia) + 6 (Megan) + 8 (Dior) = 18 hours.

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 18 hours.

"To find the total distance John drives in a round trip, we need to calculate the distance of a single trip and then multiply it by 2.

The distance of a single trip can be calculated using the formula: distance = speed * time. 

Given that the speed is 70 mph and the time is 2 hours, we can plug in the values: distance = 70 * 2 = 140 miles.

Since John makes two trips a month, we need to multiply the distance of a single trip by 2: 140 * 2 = 280 miles.

Therefore, John drives 280 miles a month when visiting his parents.

The final answer is: 280"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how far Sofie will walk in 7 days. Since Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, we can multiply the number of miles she walks per day by the number of days:

10 miles/day * 7 days = 70 miles

Since Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship:

Sofie's distance = 2 * Brian's distance

We know that Sofie's distance is 70 miles, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

70 miles = 2 * Brian's distance

To find Brian's distance, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

Brian's distance = 70 miles / 2
Brian's distance = 35 miles

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

The final answer is: 35"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers and then find out how many toys the fifth worker must produce to meet the remaining demand.

First, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the 2 workers who produce 6 toys an hour. Since they work for 10 hours, they produce a total of 2 * 6 * 10 = 120 toys.

Next, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the other 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour. Since they work for 10 hours, they produce a total of 2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys.

The total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to meet the order, the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers must be 400 - 20 = 380 toys.

Now, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers. Since the first 4 workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced 380 - 200 = 180 toys.

Since the fifth worker works for 10 hours, the number of toys produced by the fifth worker per hour is 180 / 10 = 18 toys.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the total weight of Elijah's dogs, we first need to find the weight of each of his dogs. 

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so we multiply 60 by 1/4 to find the weight of Elijah's first dog: 60 * 1/4 = 15 pounds.

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so we multiply 60 by 1/2 to find the weight of Elijah's second dog: 60 * 1/2 = 30 pounds.

Now, we add the weights of Elijah's two dogs to find the total weight of his dogs: 15 + 30 = 45 pounds.

To find the total weight of all three dogs, we add the weight of Kory's dog to the total weight of Elijah's dogs: 60 + 45 = 105 pounds.

The final answer is: 105"
"To solve this problem, let's work backwards from the information given.

Kris had 7 stickers left after giving some to Rob. Before that, Kris had 7 + 9 = 16 stickers.

Luis gave the rest of the stickers to Kris, so Kris had 16 stickers that were given to him by Luis. Since Kris kept 9 stickers, Luis must have given him 16 - 9 = 7 stickers.

Luis used half of the stickers that he received from Seth, so he must have had 7 * 2 = 14 stickers that Seth gave him.

Since Luis received half of Seth's stickers, Seth must have had 14 * 2 = 28 stickers in the beginning.

The final numerical answer is: 28"
"To find the total number of M&M's John has, we need to calculate the total weight of the M&M's and then multiply it by the number of M&M's per ounce. 

First, let's find the total weight of the M&M's: 3 large bags * 10 ounces per bag = 30 ounces.

Since an ounce of M&M's has 30 M&M's, the total number of M&M's is 30 ounces * 30 M&M's per ounce = 900 M&M's.

Now, we need to find out how many small bags John can make. Each small bag contains 10 M&M's, so we divide the total number of M&M's by 10: 900 M&M's / 10 M&M's per small bag = 90 small bags.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we need to first calculate half of the circumference of the earth. 

The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. Half of that would be 40,000 / 2 = 20,000 kilometers.

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly 20,000 kilometers. We know that Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. 

To find the number of days, we can divide the total distance (20,000 kilometers) by the distance Alfie flies per day (400 kilometers). 

20,000 / 400 = 50 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the speed of the 2nd fastest car first, and then use that to find the speed of the fastest car.

Given that the average car can go 120 miles per hour, and the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, we can calculate the speed of the 2nd fastest car as follows:

Speed of 2nd fastest car = 5 * Speed of average car
= 5 * 120
= 600 miles per hour

Now, we know that the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. We can calculate the speed of the fastest car as follows:

Speed of fastest car = 1.25 * Speed of 2nd fastest car
= 1.25 * 600
= 750 miles per hour

The final answer is: 750"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Liam's age two years ago and then use that information to find Vince's age at that time. 

Liam's current age is 16 years. Two years ago, Liam's age would be 16 - 2 = 14 years.

Two years ago, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince. So, Vince's age two years ago would be 14 / 2 = 7 years.

To find Vince's current age, we need to add 2 years to his age two years ago. Vince's current age is 7 + 2 = 9 years.

The final answer is: 9"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold as A, Madeline as M, Camden as C, and Sarah as S.

We know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so A = M.

We also know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. This can be expressed as C + S = 30 and C = S + 12.

We can rewrite the second equation as C = S + 12 and substitute it into the first equation: (S + 12) + S = 30.

Combine like terms: 2S + 12 = 30.

Subtract 12 from both sides: 2S = 18.

Divide both sides by 2: S = 9.

Now that we know S, we can find C by substituting S into the equation C = S + 12: C = 9 + 12 = 21.

Since A = M, and the total number of eggs is 56, we can write the equation A + M + C + S = 56. We know that A = M, so we can rewrite it as 2A + C + S = 56.

Substitute the values of C and S: 2A + 21 + 9 = 56.

Combine like terms: 2A + 30 = 56.

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2A = 26.

Divide both sides by 2: A = 13.

Now that we know A, we can find the difference between C and A: C - A = 21 - 13 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we first need to find the total weight of the crayons and the total weight of the boxes separately.

Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce and Nik has 200 crayons, the total weight of the crayons is 200 ounces.

Each box weighs 8 ounces, and Nik will need 200 / 8 = 25 boxes to put all his crayons into. So, the total weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 200 (crayons) + 200 (boxes) = 400 ounces.

Since there are 16 ounces to a pound, we can convert the total weight from ounces to pounds by dividing by 16: 400 / 16 = 25 pounds.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how much John makes, we first need to determine how many logs he can make from the tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, we calculate 80% of 80 feet.

80% of 80 feet = 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet

Since each log is 4 feet long, we divide the total length of the usable tree by the length of each log to find the number of logs.

64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs

From each log, he cuts 5 planks. So, we multiply the number of logs by the number of planks per log.

16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks

He sells each plank for $1.2, so we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank.

80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96

The final answer is: $96"
"To find the total amount of money they all have together, we need to first determine the monthly earnings of Valerie's brother and their mother.

Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is half of what her brother earns. So, her brother's monthly earnings are 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, which is 2 * ($5000 + $10,000) = 2 * $15,000 = $30,000.

Now, we can find the total amount of money they all have together by adding their individual monthly earnings: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The final answer is: $40,000"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Grandma's speed on the beach and on the sidewalk. 

Let's denote Grandma's speed on the beach as 'x' miles per minute. Since she walks at twice the rate on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.

We know that she walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. The time taken to walk 2 miles on the beach is 2/x, and the time taken to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk is 1/(2x).

We are given that 40 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach. This means that 2/x = 40/60 (since 40 minutes is 40/60 of an hour). 

Simplifying this, we get 2/x = 2/3. Solving for x, we get x = 3 miles per minute.

Now that we know Grandma's speed on the beach, we can find her speed on the sidewalk, which is 2x = 6 miles per minute.

The time taken to walk 2 miles on the beach is 2/3 hours, which is 40 minutes. The time taken to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk is 1/6 hours, which is 10 minutes.

The total time taken to complete the entire 3-mile walk is 40 + 10 = 50 minutes.

"To find out how many more weeks it will take Jane to save a total of $60, we first need to calculate how much she has saved so far. 

She has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so the total amount saved is 4 * 8 = $32.

To find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract the amount she has saved from the target amount: 60 - 32 = $28.

Since she saves $4 per week, we can find out how many weeks it will take her to save the remaining amount by dividing the remaining amount by her weekly savings: 28 / 4 = 7.

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

3 trees * 7 blue birds/tree = 21 blue birds

Next, let's find the number of blue birds in the 2 trees with 4 blue birds each:
2 trees * 4 blue birds/tree = 8 blue birds

Then, we have 1 tree with 3 blue birds.

Now, let's add the number of blue birds in each group together:
21 blue birds + 8 blue birds + 3 blue birds = 32 blue birds

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many marbles Bob originally had. We know that if he receives 2 dozen (24) more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. 

Let's denote the original number of marbles as 'x'. Then, the equation can be written as:

x + 24 = 60

To find 'x', we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 24 from both sides:

x = 60 - 24
x = 36

So, Bob originally had 36 marbles. Now, if he loses 10 marbles, we need to subtract 10 from 36 to find the new number of marbles he has:

36 - 10 = 26

The final answer is: 26"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum temperature of the second bottle of water. 

Let's denote the temperature of the second bottle as x degrees. 

When Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle into his water bottle, the total volume of water in the bottle is 5 ounces. 

Since the temperature of the mixture is at least 40 degrees, we can set up the following equation:

(33 * 4 + x * 1) / 5 >= 40

Simplifying the equation:

132 + x >= 200

Subtracting 132 from both sides:

x >= 68

So, the second bottle must be at least 68 degrees.

The final answer is: 68"
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of cows. Melanie's father starts with 50 cows. Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, there are 21 days in three weeks. 

Number of cows added in three weeks = 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
Total number of cows = Initial number of cows + Number of cows added
Total number of cows = 50 + 420
Total number of cows = 470

Next, let's calculate the number of chickens. Melanie's father starts with 20 chickens. Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. 

Number of chickens added in three weeks = 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens
Total number of chickens = Initial number of chickens + Number of chickens added
Total number of chickens = 20 + 210
Total number of chickens = 230

Now, let's add the total number of cows and chickens to find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks.

Total number of animals = Total number of cows + Total number of chickens
Total number of animals = 470 + 230
Total number of animals = 700

"To find the cost of each single bagel, we first need to calculate the total cost of the 4 packs of bagels with the 10% discount. 

The original cost of 4 packs of bagels is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00. 

Since Russell receives a 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of $40.00. 
10% of $40.00 = 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00

Now, we subtract the discount from the original cost to get the discounted cost: 
$40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

Since each pack has 9 bagels, the total number of bagels is 4 * 9 = 36 bagels.

To find the cost of each single bagel, we divide the discounted cost by the total number of bagels: 
$36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00 per bagel.

The final answer is: $1.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. We know that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops, so we can write this as an equation:

Gomer's scoops = 23 - 5
Gomer's scoops = 18

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes it takes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. We know that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops, so we can write this as an equation:

Potatoes per scoop = 6 - 3
Potatoes per scoop = 3

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes it takes to make 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. We can multiply the number of scoops by the number of potatoes per scoop:

Total potatoes = Gomer's scoops * Potatoes per scoop
Total potatoes = 18 * 3
Total potatoes = 54

So, Gomer ate 54 potatoes.

The final answer is: 54"
"To find the total number of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we need to calculate the number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately, and then add them together.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days is 3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs.

In the next 30 days, Chester increases his egg consumption to 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in the next 30 days is 5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs.

Now, we add the total number of eggs from both periods: 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens: 240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozen eggs.

The final answer is: 20"

"To find the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade, we need to calculate the total number of lemons he collects in one year and then multiply it by 10.

First, let's find the total number of lemons he collects in one year. He has 5 trees, and each tree gives him 6 lemons per year. 

Total lemons per year = Number of trees * Lemons per tree per year
Total lemons per year = 5 * 6
Total lemons per year = 30

Now, we multiply the total lemons per year by 10 to find the total lemons in a decade.

Total lemons in a decade = Total lemons per year * 10
Total lemons in a decade = 30 * 10
Total lemons in a decade = 300

"To find the number of women who remained on the bus, we first need to find the total number of women on the bus initially. 

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, we can let the number of men be 5x and the number of women be 9x. 

The total number of passengers is 84, so 5x + 9x = 84. 
Combine like terms: 14x = 84. 
Divide both sides by 14: x = 6. 

Now that we know x, we can find the number of women on the bus initially: 9x = 9 * 6 = 54. 

After 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining is 54 - 20 = 34.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold per day. 

Faraday earned $26 from the sunflowers per day. Since each sunflower costs $2, we can find the number of sunflowers sold per day by dividing the total earnings from sunflowers by the cost of each sunflower.

Number of sunflowers sold per day = Total earnings from sunflowers / Cost of each sunflower
= $26 / $2
= 13

Next, we need to find out how many bouquets Faraday sold per day. Faraday earned $56 from the bouquets per day. Since each bouquet costs $8, we can find the number of bouquets sold per day by dividing the total earnings from bouquets by the cost of each bouquet.

Number of bouquets sold per day = Total earnings from bouquets / Cost of each bouquet
= $56 / $8
= 7

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers in each bouquet is 12. Therefore, the total number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold per day is 7 * 12 = 84.

Now, we can find the total number of sunflowers sold per day by adding the number of sunflowers sold individually and the number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold.

Total sunflowers sold per day = Number of sunflowers sold individually + Number of sunflowers in bouquets sold
= 13 + 84
= 97

To find the total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days, we multiply the total number of sunflowers sold per day by 3.

Total sunflowers sold in 3 days = Total sunflowers sold per day * 3
= 97 * 3

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks, the total revenue from selling 60% of the inventory, and then find the difference between the revenue and the cost.

First, let's find out how many rocks Adam can buy with $100. Since each rock costs $5, we divide the total amount by the cost per rock:

100 / 5 = 20 rocks

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling 60% of the inventory. Since Adam sells 60% of 20 rocks, we multiply 20 by 0.6:

20 * 0.6 = 12 rocks

Since each rock is sold for $7, we multiply the number of rocks sold by the selling price:

12 * 7 = $84

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the rocks. Since Adam bought 20 rocks at $5 each, we multiply the number of rocks by the cost per rock:

20 * 5 = $100

However, Adam only sells 60% of the inventory, so he still has 40% of the rocks left. To find the cost of the unsold rocks, we multiply the number of unsold rocks by the cost per rock:

40% of 20 rocks = 0.4 * 20 = 8 rocks
8 * 5 = $40

The total cost of the rocks is the sum of the cost of the sold rocks and the unsold rocks:

$100 (total cost) - $40 (unsold rocks) = $60 (cost of sold rocks)

Now, let's find the loss. The loss is the difference between the total cost and the revenue:

Loss = Total cost - Revenue
Loss = $100 - $84
Loss = $16

The final answer is: $16"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of days it takes Lauren to complete each type of picture scene. 

First, let's find the number of days it takes Lauren to complete each type of picture scene:

- Large-sized picture scenes: 45 / 5 = 9 days
- Medium-sized picture scenes: 36 / 6 = 6 days
- Small-sized picture scenes: 49 / 7 = 7 days

Now, we need to find the LCM of 9, 6, and 7. 

The prime factorization of 6 is 2 * 3.
The prime factorization of 7 is 7.
The prime factorization of 9 is 3^2.

To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the numbers:
- The highest power of 2 is 2^1 (from 6).
- The highest power of 3 is 3^2 (from 9).
- The highest power of 7 is 7^1 (from 7).

The LCM is 2^1 * 3^2 * 7^1 = 2 * 9 * 7 = 126.

Therefore, it will take Lauren 126 days to complete all the picture scenes.

The final answer is: 126"
"To find out how many eggs each child receives, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of children. 

First, let's determine the total number of eggs. Chatty prepared three dozen eggs. Since one dozen is equal to 12, three dozen is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Now, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of children. There are four children. 

36 eggs / 4 children = 9 eggs per child.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find out how much Jen spends on food for her fish in May, we need to calculate the total cost of food for a month. 

First, we need to determine the number of days in May. May has 31 days. 

Since each fish needs $1 worth of food a day, and Jen has 3 fish, the daily cost of food for all her fish is 3 * $1 = $3.

To find the total cost for the month, we multiply the daily cost by the number of days in May: $3 * 31 = $93.

So, Jen spends $93 on food for her fish in May.

The final answer is: $93"
"To find out how many roses Patricia has now, we need to first determine how many roses she had after giving some to her mother. 

Initially, Patricia had 30 roses. She gave 24 roses to her mother, so we subtract 24 from 30 to find out how many roses she had left: 30 - 24 = 6.

Then, Patricia bought 15 more roses. To find the total number of roses she has now, we add the 15 new roses to the 6 she already had: 6 + 15 = 21.

So, Patricia now has 21 roses.

The final answer is: 21"
"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken. 

The total distance traveled is 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles.

The total time taken is 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours.

The average speed is calculated by dividing the total distance by the total time: average speed = total distance / total time = 250 miles / 5 hours = 50 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the individual probabilities of each ticket winning.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as a decimal: 0.20.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability is 3 times the probability of the first ticket: 3 * 0.20 = 0.60.

To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we multiply the individual probabilities: 0.20 * 0.60 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

The final answer is: 12"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many seashells Carrey collected. Since Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, let's denote the number of seashells Carrey collected as 'x'. Then, the number of seashells Carlos collected is 2x.

We are given that Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected. So, we can write an equation:

27 = 2x + 5

To find the value of 'x', we need to isolate it. Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:

22 = 2x

Now, divide both sides by 2:

x = 11

So, Carrey collected 11 seashells. Now that we know the number of seashells each person collected, we can find the total number of seashells:

Total seashells = 11 + 22 + 27 = 60

Since they divided the seashells equally among themselves, we need to divide the total number of seashells by 3:

60 / 3 = 20

Each person got 20 seashells.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and add the number of carrots he eats on the weekend.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday). So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is 4 * 5 = 20.

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is 5 + 5 = 10.

Now, we add the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend to find the total number of carrots he eats in a week: 20 + 10 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song first. 

The first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. To find 60% of 5 minutes, we multiply 5 by 0.6. 

5 * 0.6 = 3 minutes

Now, we add the 60% increase to the original length of the first song to find the length of the second song.

5 + 3 = 8 minutes

The second song is 8 minutes long. To find the total time of the cassette, we add the length of the first and second songs.

5 + 8 = 13 minutes

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes.

The final answer is: 13"
"To find the total profit, we first need to calculate the profit from each device and then multiply it by the total number of devices sold.

Linus buys a mobile device for $20 and sells it for twice the amount, which is $40. The profit from each device is $40 - $20 = $20.

He bought 2 devices last Monday, so the profit from Monday's sales is 2 * $20 = $40.

He bought 4 devices last Tuesday, so the profit from Tuesday's sales is 4 * $20 = $80.

The total profit is the sum of the profit from Monday and Tuesday's sales, which is $40 + $80 = $120.

The final numerical answer is: $120"
"To find the length of Carl's cane, we need to determine Carl's height first. We know that Isabel is 7 feet tall and Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel. 

Isabel's height = 7 feet
Ned's height = Isabel's height - 2 feet
Ned's height = 7 - 2
Ned's height = 5 feet

Since Carl is one foot taller than Ned, we can calculate Carl's height as follows:
Carl's height = Ned's height + 1 foot
Carl's height = 5 + 1
Carl's height = 6 feet

We are given that Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. Therefore, we can calculate the length of the cane as follows:
Cane's length = Carl's height / 2
Cane's length = 6 / 2
Cane's length = 3 feet

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of bottles required to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, and then subtract the number of bottles Hortex can produce in a day.

First, let's find out how many bottles are needed to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people. Since each bottle covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand, we need to find out how many bottles are needed for 2300 people.

2300 people * 100% = 2300 people * 1 = 2300 people
Since each bottle covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand, we need to divide 2300 people by 20% (or 0.2) to find out how many bottles are needed for 2300 people.
2300 / 0.2 = 11500 bottles

Now, let's find out how many more bottles Hortex needs to produce to meet this demand. Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many more bottles are needed, we subtract the number of bottles Hortex can produce from the total number of bottles required.
11500 - 4200 = 7300

The final answer is: 7300"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how many babies are wearing purple and blue. Since Carla has 8 babies and 3/4 of them are wearing purple, we can calculate the number of purple babies as follows:

Number of purple babies = 8 * (3/4) = 6

Similarly, the number of blue babies is:

Number of blue babies = 8 * (1/4) = 2

Now, let's find out how many babies are wearing bows. We know that all the blue babies and 1/3 of the purple babies are wearing bows. So, the number of purple babies wearing bows is:

Number of purple babies wearing bows = 6 * (1/3) = 2

The total number of babies wearing bows is the sum of blue babies and purple babies wearing bows:

Total number of babies wearing bows = 2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4

Now, we need to find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. This can be calculated as the number of purple babies wearing bows divided by the total number of babies wearing bows, multiplied by 100:

Percentage chance = (2 / 4) * 100 = 50%

"To find the number of reports received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday, and then subtract that result from the total number of reports received last week.

Total reports received last week = 5168
Reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

First, let's find the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday. 

Reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

Now, let's find the total number of reports received on Wednesday by subtracting the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday. However, we need to subtract the reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received last week to get the reports received on Wednesday.

Reports received on Wednesday = Total reports received last week - (Reports received on Monday and Tuesday + Reports received on Thursday and Friday)
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - (1907 + 2136)
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - 4043
Reports received on Wednesday = 1125

"To find the total amount of money Abraham will earn, we need to calculate the amount of money he earned from each sale and add them together.

First, Abraham sold half of his land for $50. Since he owns 80 square meters, half of that is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters. 

Next, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. Since he owns 80 square meters, 1/4 of that is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters. 

Now, let's calculate the amount of land he has left. He started with 80 square meters, sold 40 square meters, and then sold 20 square meters. So, he has 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters left.

He sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, the amount of money he earned from selling the remaining land is 20 * 3 = $60.

Now, let's add up the money he earned from each sale: $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

The final answer is: $140"
"To find Geb's age, we need to first calculate half of Haley's age. Haley is 26 years old, so half of her age would be 26 / 2 = 13.

13 - 10 = 3

Geb is 3 years old."
"To find out how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to first determine how many face masks he uses in a day. 

Since Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out and he goes out three times a day, the total number of face masks he uses in a day is 2 * 3 = 6.

Now, to find out how many face masks he uses in 2 days, we multiply the number of face masks he uses in a day by 2. 

6 * 2 = 12

So, Tyrion uses 12 face masks every 2 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many eggs each person found and then subtract that from the total number of eggs hidden.

Lamar finds 5 eggs. 
Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 2 * 5 = 10 eggs.
Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up the number of eggs found by each person: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

Since there were 3 dozen eggs hidden initially, we need to convert that to a numerical value. 1 dozen is equal to 12, so 3 dozen is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Now, let's subtract the number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

"To find the total amount John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of apartments and the total number of collections.

First, let's find the total number of apartments in the first two complexes: 200 + 200 = 400 apartments.

The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, so we need to find 60% of 400 and add it to 400. 

60% of 400 is 0.6 * 400 = 240. 
So, the last complex has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, we add the number of apartments in all three complexes: 400 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so the total number of collections per week is 3 * 1040 = 3120 collections.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so the total amount he makes in a week is 3120 * 0.40 = $1248.

"To find the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and add them up.

- In the 5th year, the tree produces 50 fruits.
- In the 6th year, it produces 3 times the initial amount, which is 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
- In the 7th year, it produces 7 times the initial amount, which is 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
- In the 8th year, it produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree, but we don't know the production of a 10-year-old tree yet. We'll come back to this.
- In the 9th year, the tree doesn't produce any fruits.
- In the 10th year, a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now, let's find the production of an 8-year-old tree. We know that an 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. Since a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount (1000 fruits), a 10-year-old tree produces 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits. Therefore, an 8-year-old tree produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

Now, let's add up the fruits produced each year: 
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350

The total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree during its 10 years of life is 2350."
"To find out how much money Jack has now, we need to calculate the amount Sophia gave him and add it to his initial amount.

Sophia gave Jack 1/5 of her $100. To find 1/5 of $100, we multiply $100 by 1/5, which is the same as dividing $100 by 5.

$100 / 5 = $20

So, Sophia gave Jack $20. 

Now, we add the $20 to Jack's initial $100.

$100 + $20 = $120

Jack now has $120.

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as B, the length of the yellow rope as Y, and the length of the red rope as R. We are given that R = 4B and B = Y - 7.

We can express Y in terms of B: Y = B + 7.

We are also given that R + B + Y = 37. Substituting R = 4B and Y = B + 7 into this equation, we get:

4B + B + B + 7 = 37

Combine like terms: 6B + 7 = 37

Subtract 7 from both sides: 6B = 30

Divide both sides by 6: B = 5

Now that we know B, we can find R: R = 4B = 4 * 5 = 20

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's assume Ronnie was given $5. Since Rissa was given thrice as much, Rissa was given 3 * 5 = $15.

After each of them gave an equal amount of money to their little sister, let's call the amount they gave 'x'. So, Ronnie is left with 5 - x and Rissa is left with 15 - x.

We are given that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. This means 15 - x = (4/5) * 15.

To find the value of x, we can solve the equation: 
15 - x = (4/5) * 15
15 - x = 12
x = 3

Now that we know x, we can find out how much money Ronnie is left with:
Ronnie's money left = 5 - x

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the amount of red, white, and purple paint as R, W, and P respectively. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, we can say R = W = P.

We are given that half the mural is yellow, which means the other half is painted with red, white, and purple. Since the total amount of paint used is 12 pints, and half of it is yellow, the other half is 6 pints (12 / 2 = 6).

Since the other half is painted with red, white, and purple, and there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple, we can say that R + W + P = 6.

We also know that R = W = P, so we can substitute W and P with R in the equation: R + R + R = 6.

Combine like terms: 3R = 6.

Divide both sides by 3: R = 2.

So, the amount of red paint used is 2 pints.

"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house, then add them together.

First, let's find the area of one bedroom: 
Area of one bedroom = length * width = 20 * 12 = 240 square feet.

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms = 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area = 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is given as 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas together: 
Total area = area of bedrooms + area of living room + area of the rest of the house
Total area = 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.

"To find out how many dishwashing cycles you can run with the new box for $1, we first need to determine how many pods are in the new box. 

The new box has 20% more pods than the regular box. To find 20% of 100, we multiply 100 by 0.2, which is 20. So, the new box has 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Now, we know that the new box costs $12 and has 120 pods. To find out how many pods you can buy for $1, we divide the total number of pods by the cost: 120 pods / $12 = 10 pods per dollar.

Since you use 1 pod per cycle, you can run 10 dishwashing cycles for $1 with the new box.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since he withdraws 1000 dollars in 20 dollar bills, he has 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home. So, he has 50 - 10 = 40 bills left.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he uses 20 bills to pay for the bill. This leaves him with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

4. Thomas then triples his money. Since he has 20 bills left, and each bill is worth $20, he has a total of 20 * 20 = $400. Tripling this amount gives him 3 * 400 = $1200.

5. He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. To find out how many 5 dollar bills he has, we need to divide the total amount by 5. 1200 / 5 = 240.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's determine the number of goals scored by team B in the first half. Since team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, and team A scored 4 goals in the first half, team B scored 4 - 2 = 2 goals in the first half.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 2 * 4 = 8 goals.

Now, let's find out how many goals team A scored in the second half. Team A scored 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B in the second half, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

The total number of goals scored by team A is 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals. The total number of goals scored by team B is 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals.

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much chalk the teacher has left after Monday and then determine how many days it will last.

The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk. He uses 45% of it on Monday, so we need to find 45% of 5 inches.

45% of 5 inches = 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches

This means the teacher has 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches of chalk left after Monday.

Since the teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day, we need to find out how many days it will last.

Let's assume the number of days is 'x'. Then, the amount of chalk left after 'x' days will be 2.75 * (1 - 0.20)^x.

We want to find the value of 'x' when the chalk is smaller than 2 inches, so we set up the inequality:

2.75 * (0.80)^x < 2

To solve for 'x', we can divide both sides by 2.75:

(0.80)^x < 2 / 2.75
(0.80)^x < 0.7273

Now, we can take the logarithm of both sides to solve for 'x':

log((0.80)^x) < log(0.7273)
x * log(0.80) < log(0.7273)

Now, we can divide both sides by log(0.80):

x < log(0.7273) / log(0.80)

Using a calculator, we get:

x < 3.19

Since 'x' must be an integer (you can't have a fraction of a day), the teacher will have to recycle the chalk after 3 days.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Colin's current age as C and Wendy's current age as W.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:

W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:

C + 25 = (5/3)(C + 7)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2:

20 = C

"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we first need to determine the total number of books he can buy with $27000. 

Since he can buy 100 books for $500, we can find the total number of books by dividing the total amount spent ($27000) by the cost of 100 books ($500).

Total number of books = $27000 / $500 = 54

Now, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books he can buy per school.

Books per school = Total number of books / Number of schools
= 54 / 3
= 18

The final answer is: 18"
"Let's break down the events step by step:

1. Initially, 2 apples fell out of the tree, and one landed on Newton's head. So, Newton had 2 apples.
2. He picked up the two apples, put one in his pocket, and threw the other into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. Now, he has 1 apple in his pocket and 5 new apples, making a total of 6 apples.
3. He put all but one of the new apples in his pocket, leaving 1 apple on the ground. So, he now has 6 (from the previous step) + 1 (in his pocket) = 7 apples in his pocket and 1 apple on the ground.
4. He threw the remaining apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out. Now, he has 7 apples in his pocket and 6 new apples, making a total of 13 apples.
5. He picked up all the remaining apples, which are the 6 new ones that fell out of the tree. So, he now has 7 (in his pocket) + 6 (new ones) = 13 apples.

Therefore, Newton brought home 13 apples.

"To find the total cost of Ali's order, we need to calculate the total number of coal bags and then multiply it by the cost per unit.

First, let's find the total number of coal bags:
Total coal in kilos = 850 kg
Weight of each bag = 50 kg
Number of bags = Total coal in kilos / Weight of each bag
= 850 kg / 50 kg
= 17 bags

Now, let's find the total cost:
Cost per unit = $18
Number of units = 17
Total cost = Cost per unit * Number of units
= $18 * 17
= $306

The final answer is: $306"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of slices each type of pizza that Kate's friends will eat, and then determine the total number of slices needed. 

First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten by Kate's friends: 
6 friends * 6 slices per friend = 36 slices

Next, let's calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten by Kate's friends: 
6 friends * 4 slices per friend = 24 slices

Since the cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices and the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, we need to find out how many whole pizzas are needed for each type. 

For the cheese pizza: 
36 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas

For the pepperoni pizza: 
24 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas

Since Kate needs to buy whole pizzas, she needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas. 

To find the total number of pizzas Kate needs to buy, we add the number of cheese pizzas and pepperoni pizzas: 
3 cheese pizzas + 3 pepperoni pizzas = 6 pizzas

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total miles Sam ran this week, we need to calculate the miles run on each day and add them together.

On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Sam ran 3 miles each day. So, the total miles run on these days is 3 * 3 = 9 miles.

On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day. So, the total miles run on these days is 5 * 2 = 10 miles.

Now, we add the miles run on both sets of days: 9 miles + 10 miles = 19 miles.

The final answer is: 19"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the net rate at which Jay is building snowballs. 

Jay builds 20 snowballs in 1 hour, which is equivalent to 60 minutes. So, his rate of building snowballs is 20/60 = 1/3 snowballs per minute.

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. To find the rate at which snowballs melt, we divide the number of snowballs that melt by the time it takes for them to melt: 2/15 snowballs per minute.

Now, we need to find the net rate at which Jay is building snowballs. This is the rate at which he builds snowballs minus the rate at which they melt: (1/3) - (2/15) = (5/15) - (2/15) = 3/15 = 1/5 snowballs per minute.

Since Jay wants to have 60 snowballs, we need to find out how many minutes it will take to build 60 snowballs at a rate of 1/5 snowballs per minute. 

To do this, we divide the total number of snowballs by the net rate: 60 / (1/5) = 60 * 5 = 300 minutes.

However, this is the time it would take if Jay didn't melt any snowballs. Since he melts 2 snowballs every 15 minutes, we need to account for this. 

Let's calculate how many snowballs Jay will have after 300 minutes, considering the melting rate: 

In 300 minutes, Jay builds 300 * (1/3) = 100 snowballs. However, 2 * (300/15) = 40 snowballs melt. So, Jay will have 100 - 40 = 60 snowballs.

But we need to find the time it takes to have 60 snowballs, not the time it takes to have 60 snowballs after 300 minutes. 

Let's try a different approach. Let x be the time in minutes it takes to have 60 snowballs. In x minutes, Jay builds x * (1/3) snowballs. In x minutes, 2 * (x/15) snowballs melt.

We want the total number of snowballs to be 60, so we set up the equation: x * (1/3) - 2 * (x/15) = 60.

Simplifying the equation, we get: (x/3) - (2x/15) = 60. 

Multiplying both sides by 15 to eliminate the fractions, we get: 5x - 2x = 900.

Simplifying further, we get: 3x = 900.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get: x = 300.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how old Jim was 20 years ago, when Digimon first came out. Since John is 28 now, we can subtract 20 from his current age to find his age at that time.

John's age 20 years ago = 28 - 20 = 8

Since John was twice as old as Jim 20 years ago, we can set up an equation to find Jim's age at that time:

John's age 20 years ago = 2 * Jim's age 20 years ago
8 = 2 * Jim's age 20 years ago

To find Jim's age 20 years ago, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

Jim's age 20 years ago = 8 / 2
Jim's age 20 years ago = 4

Now, to find Jim's current age, we add 20 to his age 20 years ago:

Jim's current age = Jim's age 20 years ago + 20
Jim's current age = 4 + 20
Jim's current age = 24

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given. 

Let's start with the third day. They used half a pack of bandages, which is 25 bandages (since a pack has 50 bandages). They had 78 bandages left, so they must have had 78 + 25 = 103 bandages before using half a pack.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which means they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. They ordered one pack of 50 bandages on the first day, so they had 50 + 38 = 88 bandages at the end of the first day.

Now, we know they had 103 bandages at the end of the third day, and 88 bandages at the end of the first day. They ordered two packs of 50 bandages on the third day, so they had 88 + 100 = 188 bandages at the end of the second day.

Since they used 28 bandages on the second day, they must have had 188 + 28 = 216 bandages at the beginning of the second day.

Now, we know they used 38 bandages on the first day, and they had 216 bandages at the beginning of the second day. This means they must have had 216 + 38 = 254 bandages at the beginning of the first day.

"To find Jen's total earnings for April, we need to calculate her total hours worked and then multiply it by her hourly rate. 

Since Jen works 7.5 hours a day and there are 6 days in a week, we can find her total hours worked in a week by multiplying these two numbers: 
7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week = 45 hours/week

Since there are 4 weeks in April, we can find her total hours worked in April by multiplying her weekly hours by the number of weeks:
45 hours/week * 4 weeks = 180 hours

Now, we can multiply her total hours worked by her hourly rate to find her total earnings:
180 hours * $1.5/hour = $270

Jen also receives an additional $10 for complete attendance. Since she did not incur any absences for the entire month, she will receive this additional amount.

Total earnings = $270 + $10 = $280

"To find the total amount Jason earned, we need to calculate the earnings for each task and then add them up.

For the dishwasher, Jason emptied it 6 times at $0.50 per time, so his earnings from the dishwasher are 6 * $0.50 = $3.00.

For the laundry, Jason did it once at $3.00, so his earnings from laundry are $3.00.

For the trash, Jason took it out twice at $0.75 per time, so his earnings from taking out the trash are 2 * $0.75 = $1.50.

For cleaning the room, Jason did it once at $1.50, so his earnings from cleaning the room are $1.50.

Now, let's add up all the earnings: $3.00 (dishwasher) + $3.00 (laundry) + $1.50 (trash) + $1.50 (room) = $8.00.

Next, we know she bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens. Since she bought 25 red pens, she bought 2 * 25 = 50 black pens.

To find the total number of pens Alain has, we add the number of red pens and black pens together: 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens.

Since John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The cost of the cognac is 50% more than the scotch, so the cost per bottle of cognac is $60 + ($60 * 0.5) = $90.

The total cost of the cognac is 20 * $90 = $1800.

The total cost of everything is the sum of the cost of the scotch and the cognac: $600 + $1800 = $2400.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, making it 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees. So, the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is 40 + 10 = 50.

Now, let's calculate the total number of trees planted on each day:
- Day 1: 20 (White Oak) + 40 (Lodgepole Pine) = 60 trees
- Day 2: 30 (White Oak) + 50 (Lodgepole Pine) = 80 trees

The total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 60 + 80 = 140.

The final answer is: 140"
"To find out how much root beer was available for each person to drink, we need to calculate the total amount of root beer remaining after all the incidents.

Initially, Fred made 24 gallons of root beer.

On the first day, 4 gallons were consumed by his children, so the remaining amount is 24 - 4 = 20 gallons.

On the second day, 7 gallons were spilled, so the remaining amount is 20 - 7 = 13 gallons.

On the third day, 5 gallons were consumed by Ronnie, so the remaining amount is 13 - 5 = 8 gallons.

On the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party, and they shared the remaining root beer equally. To find out how much each person got, we need to divide the remaining amount by the number of people: 8 / 3 = 2.67 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2.67}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to translate the given information into an equation. Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge as 'x'. The problem states that eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be written as:

4x + 8 = 40

To find the value of 'x', we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:

4x = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for 'x':

x = 32 / 4
x = 8

Therefore, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the number of fish with red stripes, we need to calculate one-third of the total number of fish. 

One-third of 66 is 66 / 3 = 22.

Now, we need to find the number of fish that do not have red stripes. Since 22 fish have red stripes, the remaining fish are 66 - 22 = 44.

Now, we need to find 5/11 of the remaining fish that have blue stripes. 

5/11 of 44 is (5/11) * 44 = 20.

So, the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes is 22 + 20 = 42.

The final answer is: 42"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Amy had 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each, so she had a total of 2 * 4 = 8 eyeshadow colors from the palettes.

She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 eyeshadow colors each, so she had a total of 3 * 6 = 18 eyeshadow colors from the makeup sets.

In total, Amy had 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors.

Her sister stole one of the palettes, which means Amy lost 4 eyeshadow colors (since each palette has 4 colors).

Now, Amy has 26 - 4 = 22 eyeshadow colors left.

Amy then uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. Since each makeup set has 6 eyeshadow colors, half of that is 6 / 2 = 3 eyeshadow colors.

So, Amy uses up 3 eyeshadow colors from the makeup set.

Now, Amy has 22 - 3 = 19 eyeshadow colors left.

The final answer is: 19"
"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to break down the information given.

First, we know Mattison's height is 60 inches. His two-story house is 7 times as high as he is, so the total height of the house is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.

Since the house is two stories, we can find the height of the first floor by dividing the total height by 2. However, we are given that the floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison is, which is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

Now, to find the height of the second floor, we subtract the height of the first floor from the total height of the house: 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

The height of the roof from the second floor's floor is the same as the height of the first floor, which is 180 inches.

The final answer is: 180"
"To find the number of shells found by team Alphas, we need to calculate 40% of 700. 

40% of 700 = 0.4 * 700 = 280 shells.

Now, we need to find the number of shells remaining after team Alphas found their share. 

Remaining shells = Total shells - Shells found by Alphas
= 700 - 280
= 420 shells.

Next, we need to find the number of shells found by team The finders, which is 60% of the remaining shells.

60% of 420 = 0.6 * 420 = 252 shells.

Now, we need to find the number of shells found by team Gogetters. 

Shells found by Gogetters = Total shells - (Shells found by Alphas + Shells found by The finders)
= 700 - (280 + 252)
= 700 - 532
= 168 shells.

The final answer is: 168"
"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we first need to calculate the total miles all the dogs need to walk in a day. Since there are 4 dogs and they need to walk an average of 3 miles per day, the total miles they need to walk is 4 * 3 = 12 miles.

Now, we know the first dog needs to walk 1 mile, the second needs to walk 4 miles, and the third needs to walk 3 miles. So, the total miles walked by the first three dogs is 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles.

To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the total miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles all dogs need to walk: 12 - 8 = 4 miles.

The last dog needs to walk 4 miles."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount John borrowed and then the amount he used to pay off his debts.

First, we find 40% of the value of his house, which is 0.4 * $250,000 = $100,000. This is the amount John borrowed.

Next, we find 60% of the amount he borrowed, which is 0.6 * $100,000 = $60,000. This is the amount he used to pay off his debts.

To find the amount he had leftover, we subtract the amount used to pay off debts from the amount borrowed: $100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000.

The final answer is: $40,000"
"To find the total earnings, we need to calculate the total weight of the tunas first. 

The total weight of the tunas is the sum of the weights of the three tunas: 
56 kg + 46 kg + 26 kg = 128 kg

Since a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, we multiply the total weight by the cost per kilogram to find the total earnings:
128 kg * $0.50/kg = $64

The final answer is: $64"
"To find Trinity's profit, we need to first find the selling price of the magazines. 

The cost price of the magazines is $72. Trinity sells the magazines at 11/8 of the cost price. 

To find the selling price, we multiply the cost price by 11/8:
Selling price = (11/8) * 72
Selling price = (11 * 72) / 8
Selling price = 792 / 8
Selling price = 99

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the cost price from the selling price:
Profit = Selling price - Cost price
Profit = 99 - 72
Profit = 27

The final answer is: $27"
"To find the total amount of water removed, we need to calculate the amount of water removed by each setting and then add them together.

The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed by the low setting is 1 * 3 = 3 liters.

The medium setting removes twice as much water as the low setting, which is 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed by the medium setting is 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

The high setting removes twice as much water as the medium setting, which is 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 5 days, the total amount of water removed by the high setting is 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

Now, we add the total amount of water removed by each setting: 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

The final answer is: 29"
"To find out how many balloons were thrown, we need to first calculate the total number of balloons Jolene and her friends had initially. Since they filled up 10 packs of balloons with 30 balloons per pack, the total number of balloons is 10 * 30 = 300.

Since 12 balloons were left by the end of the afternoon, we subtract this from the total number of balloons to find out how many were thrown. 

300 - 12 = 288

So, Jolene and her friends threw 288 balloons."
"To find the total amount of the second medicine, we need to calculate 3 times the amount of the first medicine. 

The first medicine is 14 mL, so 3 times that amount is 3 * 14 = 42 mL.

Now, we need to find the total amount of both medicines in one dose. The first medicine is 14 mL, and the second medicine is 42 mL, so the total amount in one dose is 14 + 42 = 56 mL.

To find the total amount in 8 doses, we multiply the amount in one dose by 8. 

56 mL * 8 = 448 mL.

The final answer is: 448"
"To find the combined capacity of both schools, we first need to determine the capacity of John's school. 

Since each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, we can find the capacity of one of John's classes by multiplying Ali's class capacity by 1/8.

Capacity of one of John's classes = 120 * (1/8) = 15 students

Since John has two classes, we multiply the capacity of one class by 2 to find the total capacity of John's school.

Capacity of John's school = 15 * 2 = 30 students

Now, we add the capacity of Ali's school (which is 120 students) to the capacity of John's school to find the combined capacity of both schools.

Combined capacity = 120 + 30 = 150

The final answer is: 150"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total interest Stephen owes his sister. 

First, let's find the total interest he owes. The interest is 2% of $300, which is 0.02 * 300 = $6.

Now, Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, so the total amount he pays in the first 11 months is 25 * 11 = $275.

The remaining amount, including the interest, will be paid in the twelfth month. This remaining amount is the initial loan plus the interest minus the total paid in the first 11 months: 300 + 6 - 275 = $31.

However, this is not the total amount he will pay in the twelfth month. He still owes the $31, but he will also pay the $25 for the twelfth month. So, the total amount he will pay in the twelfth month is 31 + 25 = $56.

The final answer is: $56"
"To find out how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we need to first calculate the total number of diapers changed per day. Since each child requires 5 diaper changes per day and there are 2 children, the total number of diaper changes per day is 2 * 5 = 10.

Since Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, she changes 10 / 2 = 5 diapers per day. 

To find out how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we subtract the number of diapers his wife changes from the total number of diaper changes per day: 10 - 5 = 5.

"To find the total number of jelly beans in the jar, we first need to calculate the volume of the jar. The jar has a square base with a side length of 6 inches and a height of 15 inches. The volume of a rectangular prism (such as the jar) is given by the formula V = lwh, where l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height.

Given that the base is square, the length and width are the same, so we can calculate the volume as V = 6 * 6 * 15 = 540 cubic inches.

Since the jelly beans have a packing efficiency of 80%, we need to divide the volume of the jar by this efficiency to find the effective volume available for packing the jelly beans. Effective volume = 540 / 0.8 = 675 cubic inches.

Each jelly bean has a volume of 0.15 cubic inches. To find the total number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar, we divide the effective volume by the volume of a single jelly bean: 675 / 0.15 = 4500 jelly beans.

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we can find the number of red jelly beans by multiplying the total number of jelly beans by 0.3: 4500 * 0.3 = 1350 red jelly beans.

However, we are given that the true number of red jelly beans in the container is 900. To find how far off Tim's guess was, we need to know what his guess was. Since we don't have this information, we can't calculate the exact difference."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, the bus had 20 people. 

At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus became 20 + 40 = 60.

At the second stop, 3/4 of the people who entered at the first stop entered the bus. Since 40 people entered at the first stop, 3/4 of 40 is (3/4) * 40 = 30. So, 30 people entered the bus at the second stop. The total number of people on the bus became 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus became 2 * 90 = 180.

The bus has a capacity of 200 people. To find the remaining spaces, we subtract the current number of people from the capacity: 200 - 180 = 20.

The total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is 20."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of Pauline's visits over the 8 years.

First, let's calculate the cost of the visits for the first 5 years. Since the cost of one visit is $2, the total cost for 5 years is:
5 years * 3 visits/year * $2/visit = $30

Now, the cost of one visit has increased by 150%. This means the new cost of one visit is:
$2 * 2.5 = $5

For the next 3 years, the cost of one visit is $5. The total cost for these 3 years is:
3 years * 3 visits/year * $5/visit = $45

The total cost for all 8 years is the sum of the cost for the first 5 years and the cost for the next 3 years:
$30 + $45 = $75

The final answer is: $75"
"To find out how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to determine the total number of groups required and then multiply that by the time it takes for each group to try the escape room.

There are 4 grades (4-7) with 10 students in each grade, so the total number of students is 4 * 10 = 40.

Since only the top 10 students in each grade get to try the escape room, we need to find the total number of students who will try the escape room. Since there are 4 grades, we need to find the total number of students who will try the escape room in each grade, which is 10 students per grade. So, the total number of students who will try the escape room is 4 * 10 = 40.

However, only 8 students can try the escape room at a time. To find the total number of groups, we divide the total number of students who will try the escape room by 8: 40 / 8 = 5.

Since each group uses their full 45 minutes, the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room is the number of groups multiplied by the time per group: 5 * 45 = 225 minutes.

The final answer is: 225"
"To find out how much Ali has to pay John, we need to calculate the total cost of the tables and the total cost of the roof frames, then add them together.

The cost of the tables is 4 tables * $20 per table = $80.
The cost of the roof frames is 2 frames * $10 per frame = $20.

Now, we add the cost of the tables and the cost of the roof frames together: $80 + $20 = $100.

The final numerical answer is: $100"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length can be represented as 4x.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, and it is divided into two pieces. Therefore, the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is equal to 40 feet. We can write this as an equation:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Now, divide both sides by 5 to solve for x:

x = 8

Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length is 4x:

Longer piece = 4x = 4(8) = 32

The final answer is: 32"
"To determine how much seasoning Aiden will need, we first need to find out how many pounds of ground beef he will use. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat and he wants to make 80 meatballs, we can divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound to find the total pounds of meat needed.

Total meatballs = 80
Meatballs per pound = 16

Total pounds of meat = Total meatballs / Meatballs per pound
Total pounds of meat = 80 / 16
Total pounds of meat = 5

Since Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat, we can multiply the total pounds of meat by the amount of seasoning per pound to find the total amount of seasoning needed.

Total pounds of meat = 5
Seasoning per pound = 2 tablespoons

Total seasoning needed = Total pounds of meat * Seasoning per pound
Total seasoning needed = 5 * 2
Total seasoning needed = 10

"To find the total width of the windows, we need to multiply the width of one window by the total number of windows. 

Width of one window: 35 inches
Number of windows: 5

Total width of windows = 35 inches/window * 5 windows = 175 inches

Since Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, we multiply the total width by 2.

Fabric needed = 2 * 175 inches = 350 inches

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of treats Carly made. Since each person gets two treats and there are five people in the class, the total number of treats is 2 * 5 = 10.

Let's denote the number of cupcakes as C and the number of brownies as B. We are given that Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, so we can write an equation: B = 3C - 2.

We also know that the total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, so we can write another equation: C + B = 10.

Substituting the expression for B from the first equation into the second equation, we get: C + (3C - 2) = 10.

Combine like terms: 4C - 2 = 10.

Add 2 to both sides: 4C = 12.

Divide both sides by 4: C = 3.

"To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the 20% discount. 

The original cost of both manicure and pedicure is $35 + $40 = $75. 

The 20% discount on $75 is 0.20 * $75 = $15. 

So, the discounted cost of both manicure and pedicure is $75 - $15 = $60.

Since Karen wants to add nail art on each of her fingers, and there are 10 fingers in total (5 on each hand), the cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost for Karen would be the discounted cost of manicure and pedicure plus the cost of nail art, which is $60 + $30 = $90.

"To find the total number of magazines Susan receives each year, we need to calculate the number of issues from each magazine and add them up.

The first 3 magazines send 12 issues a year, so the total from these magazines is 3 * 12 = 36 issues.

The second magazine sends 6 issues a year.

The third magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, which is 4 * 6 = 24 issues.

Now, let's add up the total number of issues from all magazines: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66 issues.

So, Susan receives 66 magazines every year.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given. We know that Samantha has 27 paintings and that she has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley. 

Let's denote the number of paintings Shelley has as S. Since Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, we can write an equation:

Samantha's paintings = Shelley's paintings - 12
27 = S - 12

To find the number of paintings Shelley has, we need to add 12 to both sides of the equation:

S = 27 + 12
S = 39

Now that we know Shelley has 39 paintings, we can use the information that Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim to find the number of paintings Kim has. Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as K. We can write an equation:

Shelley's paintings = Kim's paintings + 8
39 = K + 8

To find the number of paintings Kim has, we need to subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:

K = 39 - 8
K = 31

The final answer is: 31"
"To find the price of the toy after the discount in January, we need to calculate the price after the increase in December and then apply the decrease in January.

The initial price of the toy in November is $40.

In December, the price increased by 80%. To find the new price, we multiply the initial price by 1.8 (100% + 80% = 180%, or 1 + 0.8 = 1.8).

Price in December = $40 * 1.8 = $72

In January, the price decreased by 50%. To find the new price, we multiply the price in December by 0.5 (100% - 50% = 50%, or 1 - 0.5 = 0.5).

Price in January = $72 * 0.5 = $36

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"To find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to calculate the amount he earns from the standard rate lessons and the reduced rate lessons separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the amount he earns from the standard rate lessons. He has 4 lessons at the standard rate of $80 per hour. So, the total amount from standard rate lessons is 4 * $80 = $320.

Next, let's calculate the amount he earns from the reduced rate lessons. He has 2 lessons at the reduced rate, which is 25% less than the standard rate. To find the reduced rate, we need to calculate 25% of $80 and subtract it from $80. 25% of $80 is 0.25 * $80 = $20. So, the reduced rate is $80 - $20 = $60 per hour. The total amount from reduced rate lessons is 2 * $60 = $120.

Now, let's add the amounts from the standard rate lessons and the reduced rate lessons to find the total amount Charlie will make for the day. $320 + $120 = $440.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many pomelos Eve gave away. Let's start by identifying the information given:

- Eve originally had 20 pieces of pomelos.
- After giving some away, she is left with 1/4 of the pomelos she originally had.

Since Eve is left with 1/4 of the original amount, we can set up an equation to find out how many pomelos she gave away. Let's denote the number of pomelos she gave away as 'x'. 

The equation can be set up as follows:

Original amount - Given away = Remaining amount
20 - x = (1/4) * 20

Simplifying the equation:
20 - x = 5

To find the value of 'x', we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Subtract 20 from both sides:
-x = 5 - 20
-x = -15

Multiply both sides by -1 to solve for 'x':
x = 15

So, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total amount of money Walter received, we need to calculate the number of apples he had left after eating and giving some to his sister, and then multiply that by the price per apple.

First, Walter ate 2/5 of the 60 apples. To find 2/5 of 60, we multiply 60 by 2 and divide by 5:

60 * 2 = 120
120 / 5 = 24

So, Walter ate 24 apples. Now, we subtract 24 from the total number of apples to find the remaining number:

60 - 24 = 36

Walter then gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples. To find 25% of 36, we multiply 36 by 0.25:

36 * 0.25 = 9

So, Walter gave his sister 9 apples. Now, we subtract 9 from the remaining number to find the number of apples he had left:

36 - 9 = 27

Walter sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. To find the total amount of money he received, we multiply the number of apples by the price per apple:

27 * 3 = 81

"To find the total distance covered by Michael in 3 days, we need to calculate the distance he travels in one day and then multiply it by 3.

First, let's convert the speed from km/hr to km/day. Since there are 24 hours in a day, we multiply 50 km/hr by 24 hours to get the distance covered in a day:

50 km/hr * 24 hr/day = 1200 km/day

Now, we multiply the daily distance by 3 to get the total distance covered in 3 days:

1200 km/day * 3 days = 3600 km

Now, we need to find the percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered. To do this, we divide the distance covered by Michael by the total distance between Alaska and Texas, and then multiply by 100:

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many grapes were used by Madeline's brother and her mother, and then subtract that from the total number of grapes Madeline ate.

Madeline ate 6 grapes. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, so he used 6 * 5 = 30 grapes.

The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie requires 12 grapes. So, the total number of grapes used by her mother is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.

The total number of grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and her mother is 36 + 48 = 84 grapes.

To find the initial number of grapes, we need to add the grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and her mother to the grapes used by her mother to make the pies. However, since the grapes used by her mother are already included in the total, we only need to add the grapes used by Madeline and her brother. The initial number of grapes is 84 + 6 = 90.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the total number of teachers at school that day, we need to add the number of teachers who were sick and the number of substitute teachers. 

First, let's find the number of teachers who were not sick. There were 82 teachers in total, and 13 were sick. So, the number of teachers who were not sick is 82 - 13 = 69.

However, this includes the 9 substitute teachers. To find the total number of teachers at school, we need to add the 9 substitute teachers to the 69 teachers who were not sick. 

So, the total number of teachers at school that day is 69 + 9 = 78.

The final answer is: 78"
"To find out how much Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we need to calculate the total cost per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

The cost of pasta per week is $1.00.
The cost of cheddar cheese per week is $3.00.
The cost of gruyere cheese per week is $3.00 * 2 = $6.00.

The total cost per week is $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00 = $10.00.

There are 52 weeks in a year. 

The total cost per year is $10.00 * 52 = $520.00.

The final numerical answer is: $520."
"To find the total number of classrooms the custodian needs to clean, we already know that number is 80. 

The custodian has 5 days to clean the classrooms. We need to find out how many minutes they have to clean in total. Since they work 8 hours a day, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, they work 8 * 60 = 480 minutes per day.

In 5 days, they work a total of 5 * 480 = 2400 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how many minutes they spend cleaning per classroom. It takes them 15 minutes per classroom.

To find the total time spent cleaning, we multiply the number of classrooms by the time spent per classroom: 80 * 15 = 1200 minutes.

Now, we need to find the percentage of their day spent cleaning. To do this, we divide the total time spent cleaning by the total time available and multiply by 100: (1200 / 2400) * 100 = 50%.

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, let's first determine the capacity of each shelf. 

Let's denote the capacity of a middle shelf as 'x'. Since the bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, its capacity is 2x. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so its capacity is 2x - 5.

We know that each of the middle shelves can hold 10 books. Therefore, x = 10.

Now, we can calculate the capacity of the bottom and top shelves:
- Bottom shelf: 2x = 2 * 10 = 20 books
- Top shelf: 2x - 5 = 2 * 10 - 5 = 15 books

The total capacity of the three shelves is 10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55 books.

Since Elly has 110 books, she needs more than one bookcase to hold all of them. Let's calculate how many bookcases she needs.

Let's denote the number of bookcases as 'n'. The total capacity of 'n' bookcases is 55n. We want to find the smallest 'n' such that 55n ≥ 110.

Dividing both sides by 55, we get n ≥ 2.

Since Elly needs more than one bookcase, she needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find Rose's profit, we first need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

The cost of 5 dozens of eggs is 5 * $2.40 = $12.

Since 1 dozen has 12 eggs, 5 dozens will have 5 * 12 = 60 eggs.

Rose will sell each egg for $1, so the total revenue will be 60 * $1 = $60.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $60 - $12 = $48.

The final answer is: $48"
"To find the number of white hats, we first need to determine the number of hats that are not red. Since half of the hats are red, the number of red hats is 100 * 0.5 = 50.

The remaining hats are 100 - 50 = 50. Now, 3/5 of these remaining hats are blue, so the number of blue hats is 50 * (3/5) = 30.

The number of white hats is the remaining hats after subtracting the red and blue hats, which is 50 - 30 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the cost of each stick of jerky, we need to first calculate the total cost of the bag after the discount and then divide that by the number of sticks.

The original price of the bag is $18.00, and there's a $3.00 discount. So, the discounted price is $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00.

Since the price is in dollars, we need to convert it to cents for consistency. There are 100 cents in a dollar, so the discounted price in cents is $15.00 * 100 = 1500 cents.

Now, we divide the total cost in cents by the number of sticks to find the cost per stick: 1500 cents / 30 sticks = 50 cents per stick.

The final answer is: 50"
"To determine the total number of questions Audrey needs to answer correctly to pass, we first need to find the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly out of the total questions in both tests. 

The total number of questions in both tests is 70 + 40 = 110. To pass, she needs to answer 70% of 110 questions correctly. 

70% of 110 is calculated as 0.7 * 110 = 77. 

Now, let's find out how many questions she got right in the first test. She got 60% of 70 questions correct, which is 0.6 * 70 = 42.

Since she needs to answer a total of 77 questions correctly to pass, and she already got 42 correct in the first test, she needs to get 77 - 42 = 35 questions correct in the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

The final answer is: 35"
"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the number of strawberry cubes as 's' and the number of blueberry cubes as 'b'. We know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so we can write the equation: s + b = 116.

We also know that the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, so we can write the equation: b = 5s - 4.

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first equation: s + (5s - 4) = 116.

Combine like terms: 6s - 4 = 116.

Add 4 to both sides: 6s = 120.

Divide both sides by 6: s = 20.

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting s into the second equation: b = 5(20) - 4.

Multiply 5 and 20: b = 100 - 4.

Subtract 4 from 100: b = 96.

The final answer is: 96"
"To find the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years, we need to calculate the total number of games she has played and then multiply it by her score per game.

Ara has been playing 40 games every year for 4 years. So, the total number of games she has played is:
40 games/year * 4 years = 160 games

Since her score for every game is 21 points, we can multiply the total number of games by her score per game to find the total points:
160 games * 21 points/game = 3360 points

The final answer is: 3360"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Brendan had 10 marbles.

He dropped half of them, so he lost 10 / 2 = 5 marbles.

He found 3 marbles, so he now has 5 (lost) + 3 (found) = 8 marbles.

However, one of the marbles he picked up was a bead, so he got rid of it. This means he lost 1 marble.

Now, he has 8 - 1 = 7 marbles.

"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of flashlights and the number of candles separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of flashlights. There are 4 people in the family, and each person has a flashlight. So, the total number of flashlights is 4.

Next, let's calculate the number of candles. There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. 

Half of 8 rooms is 4 rooms. So, 4 rooms have 4 small candles each, which is 4 * 4 = 16 small candles. The other 4 rooms have 5 medium candles each, which is 4 * 5 = 20 medium candles. 

The total number of candles is 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles.

Now, we add the number of flashlights and the number of candles together: 4 flashlights + 36 candles = 40.

"To find the total time it takes to solve the Rubik's cube, we need to calculate the time for each side and add them up.

The first side takes 5 minutes. 
The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so they take 5 * 2 = 10 minutes each.
The last two sides each take half as long as the first side, so they take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes each.

Now, let's add up the time for all sides:
5 (first side) + 10 (second side) + 10 (third side) + 2.5 (fourth side) + 2.5 (fifth side) = 30 minutes

"To find out how many calls Tim deals with in a day, we need to divide the total hours he spends at work by the time it takes to deal with a call. 

First, we convert the time it takes to deal with a call from minutes to hours: 15 minutes = 15/60 = 0.25 hours.

Now, we divide the total hours Tim spends at work by the time it takes to deal with a call: 6 hours / 0.25 hours = 24 calls per day.

To find out how many calls he deals with in a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of calls he deals with in a day by 5: 24 calls/day * 5 days = 120 calls.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for Phineas to cover the distance on land and in water separately, and then add them together.

Since Phineas is 200 yards away from home, and half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, we can calculate the distance for each as follows:

Distance on land = 200 yards / 2 = 100 yards
Distance in water = 200 yards / 2 = 100 yards

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for Phineas to cover each distance:

Time on land = Distance on land / Speed on land = 100 yards / 20 yards/minute = 5 minutes
Time in water = Distance in water / Speed in water = 100 yards / 10 yards/minute = 10 minutes

Total time = Time on land + Time in water = 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes

"To find the total cost of the phone plan, we need to determine the cost of the additional phones and add it to the cost of the main phone.

Let's assume the cost of each additional phone is x. Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of the main phone is 2x.

We know that the main phone costs $20, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 20

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 20 / 2
x = 10

Now that we know the cost of each additional phone is $10, we can find the total cost of the additional phones. There are 4 additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is:

4x = 4 * 10
4x = 40

The total cost of the phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones:

Total cost = 20 + 40
Total cost = 60

"To find out how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to calculate the total number of doughnuts he sells in a day and then multiply it by the number of days in June.

Since Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day, and 1 dozen is equal to 12, we can calculate the total number of doughnuts he makes in a day as follows:

10 dozen * 12 doughnuts/dozen = 120 doughnuts/day

Since Derrick sells all the doughnuts, we can assume he sells 120 doughnuts every day.

June has 30 days. So, the total number of doughnuts Derrick sells in June is:

120 doughnuts/day * 30 days = 3600 doughnuts

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Derrick makes in June by multiplying the total number of doughnuts sold by the price per doughnut:

"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the total number of people he saw on the first three days and add it to the total number of people he saw on the remaining days.

On the first day, Conor saw 50 people.

On the second day, there were 20 more people than on the first day, so the number of people on the second day is 50 + 20 = 70.

On the third day, the number of people was twice the number on the second day, so the number of people on the third day is 2 * 70 = 140.

The total number of people on the first three days is 50 + 70 + 140 = 260.

Since there are 7 days in a week, and Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the remaining 4 days, the total number of people he saw on the remaining days is 60 * 4 = 240.

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 260 + 240 = 500.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of kernels that popped during each 30-second interval and then add the additional kernels that popped from residual heat.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped.

In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount popped, so 3 * 20 = 60 kernels popped.

In the next 30 seconds, four times the initial popping rate popped, so 4 * 20 = 80 kernels popped.

In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slowed down to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, so 0.5 * 80 = 40 kernels popped.

Now, we need to calculate the additional kernels that popped from residual heat. A quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds popped from residual heat, so 0.25 * 40 = 10 kernels.

To find the total number of kernels that popped, we add the kernels from each 30-second interval: 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210 kernels.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of lemonade Tim needs to make, including the extra gallon for Allen. Since Tim needs to make 4 gallons of regular lemonade and 1 extra gallon that is twice as tart, we can consider the extra gallon as 2 gallons of regular lemonade. 

So, in total, Tim needs to make 4 + 2 = 6 gallons of lemonade. 

Since each gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice, and 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the total number of lemons needed. 

6 gallons * 1 cup/gallon = 6 cups of lemon juice needed

Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the total number of lemons needed by multiplying the total cups of juice needed by 6.

6 cups * 6 lemons/cup = 36 lemons

Therefore, Tim will need 36 lemons.

"To find the total amount of dog food needed in a week, we need to calculate the daily consumption of both breeds and then multiply it by 7.

The German Shepherds consume 5 kilograms each per day, and there are 3 of them. So, their daily consumption is 5 * 3 = 15 kilograms.

The Bulldogs consume 3 kilograms each per day, and there are 2 of them. So, their daily consumption is 3 * 2 = 6 kilograms.

The total daily consumption is the sum of the consumption of both breeds: 15 + 6 = 21 kilograms.

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7: 21 * 7 = 147 kilograms.

Therefore, the Kennel house will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by Elvis in both directions and then find the remaining distance from his house.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled in the west direction. Distance = Speed * Time. Since Elvis traveled for 5 hours at 18mph, the distance traveled in the west direction is 5 * 18 = 90 miles.

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled in the east direction. Elvis traveled for 8 hours at 18mph, so the distance traveled in the east direction is 8 * 18 = 144 miles.

Since Elvis traveled 90 miles in the west direction and then 144 miles in the east direction, we need to find the net distance from his house. The net distance is the difference between the distance traveled in the east direction and the distance traveled in the west direction. Net distance = 144 - 90 = 54 miles.

"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year and subtract it from the initial value.

Initial value of the boat = $9000

First year depreciation: 30% of $9000 = 0.3 * $9000 = $2700
Value after first year = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Second year depreciation: 30% of $6300 = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890
Value after second year = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Third year depreciation: 20% of $4410 = 0.2 * $4410 = $882

"To find the number of pink candies, we first need to determine the number of orange and yellow candies. 

We are given that there are 54 red candies. Since there are twice as many orange candies as red candies, the number of orange candies is 2 * 54 = 108.

We are also given that there are half as many yellow candies as red candies. So, the number of yellow candies is 54 / 2 = 27.

Now, we know the total number of candies is 232. We can find the number of pink candies by subtracting the number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total.

Number of pink candies = Total number of candies - (Number of red candies + Number of orange candies + Number of yellow candies)

"To find the average age of Mia and Emma, we first need to determine Emma's age. Since Mia is 40 years old and they are 16 years apart in age, we can calculate Emma's age by adding 16 to Mia's age.

Emma's age = Mia's age + 16
Emma's age = 40 + 16
Emma's age = 56

Now that we know both Mia's and Emma's ages, we can find the average of their ages by adding their ages and dividing by 2.

Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2
Average age = (40 + 56) / 2
Average age = 96 / 2
Average age = 48

The final answer is: 48"

"To find out how much feed is left after a week, we first need to calculate how much feed the pigs eat in a day and then multiply it by 7 to get the weekly consumption.

Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, so the total feed consumption per pig per day is 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.

Since Dexter has 5 pigs, the total feed consumption per day for all pigs is 8 * 5 = 40 pounds.

Now, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 to get the weekly consumption: 40 * 7 = 280 pounds.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, so to find out how much is left, we subtract the weekly consumption from the total ordered: 300 - 280 = 20 pounds.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many hot dogs John needs to buy, we first need to determine the total number of hot dogs required for the party. 

Since each guest will eat 2 hot dogs and there are 20 guests, the total number of hot dogs needed is 20 * 2 = 40 hot dogs.

However, John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party. So, the total number of hot dogs he needs to buy is 40 - 4 = 36 hot dogs.

Since a pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs and costs $2, we need to find out how many packs John needs to buy. 

To do this, we divide the total number of hot dogs needed by the number of hot dogs in a pack: 36 / 6 = 6.

Since each pack costs $2, the total amount John needs to spend on hot dogs is 6 * $2 = $12.

The final answer is: $12"

"To find the total time spent on meditation and yoga, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity separately and then add them together.

Meditation time per day: 15 minutes (morning) + 15 minutes (night) = 30 minutes
Since Charisma meditates 7 days a week, the total meditation time per week is: 30 minutes/day * 7 days/week = 210 minutes/week

Yoga time per day: 1 hour = 60 minutes
Since Charisma practices yoga 5 days a week, the total yoga time per week is: 60 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 300 minutes/week

Total time spent on meditation and yoga per week: 210 minutes/week (meditation) + 300 minutes/week (yoga) = 510 minutes/week

"To find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. The original price of each T-shirt is $8. Jake buys 2 T-shirts, but there's a buy one get one 50% off deal. This means that one of the T-shirts will be 50% off, and the other will be at the full price.

The cost of the full-priced T-shirt is $8. The cost of the discounted T-shirt is 50% off the original price, which is 0.5 * $8 = $4. 

So, the total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and they are 40% off. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by 0.4: 0.4 * $40 = $16.

The discounted price of the shoes is the original price minus the discount: $40 - $16 = $24.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. We know that Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, but Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron. This means that if Aaron runs a certain distance in a certain time, Vanessa will run twice that distance in the same time, and if Vanessa runs a certain distance in a certain time, Aaron will run half that distance in half the time.

Let's denote the time it takes Vanessa to run 1 mile as 't'. Then, the time it takes Aaron to run 1 mile is 't/2' since he runs twice as fast.

We know that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, and since he ran 4 miles, we can set up the equation:

4 / (t/2) = 16

To solve for 't', we can multiply both sides by (t/2):

4 = 16 * (t/2)
4 = 8t
t = 4/8
t = 0.5

Now that we know the time it takes Vanessa to run 1 mile, we can find the time it takes her to run 4 miles:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 4 / (1/t)
Time = 4 * t
Time = 4 * 0.5
Time = 2

Therefore, Vanessa took 2 minutes to complete her part of the race.

"To find out how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to calculate their daily revenue and then multiply it by the number of days they are open.

First, let's calculate the daily revenue. They get 6 reservations a night, and each reservation includes 2 meals that cost $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine. 

Daily revenue = (6 reservations * 2 meals * $5) + (6 reservations * $5)
Daily revenue = (6 * 2 * $5) + (6 * $5)
Daily revenue = $60 + $30
Daily revenue = $90

Since they are open 2 days a week, we multiply the daily revenue by 2.

Weekly revenue = Daily revenue * 2
Weekly revenue = $90 * 2
Weekly revenue = $180

"To find the cost price of each watermelon, we first need to find the total cost of the watermelons. The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80, so the cost price per watermelon is $80 / 50 = $1.60.

Since the vendor sold the watermelons at a profit of 25%, the selling price per watermelon is 125% of the cost price (100% of the cost price + 25% profit). 

To find the selling price, we multiply the cost price by 1.25 (which is 125% expressed as a decimal). So, the selling price per watermelon is $1.60 * 1.25 = $2.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the current age of James and then determine the age of John's youngest son.

First, let's find James' current age. We know that James is twice as old as Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years. This means that Dora's current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

We also know that James is 9 years older than John, since John was 19 when James was born. Therefore, John's current age is 19 + 18 = 37 years.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so the youngest son's current age is 37 - 32 = 5 years.

In 3 years, the youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

"To find the total cost Mark paid, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator and the labor cost.

First, let's find the cost of the radiator. The original price is $400, and Mark got it for 80% off. To find the discount amount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage (80% = 0.8).

Discount = $400 * 0.8 = $320

So, the cost of the radiator is $400 - $320 = $80.

Next, let's calculate the labor cost. The mechanic worked for 3 hours at $50 an hour.

Labor cost = 3 hours * $50/hour = $150

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the labor cost to find the total amount Mark paid.

Total cost = $80 (radiator) + $150 (labor) = $230

The final answer is: $230"

We also know that the total number of legs is 70. Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, so we can write the equation:

2C + 4W = 70

We can solve this system of equations by multiplying the first equation by 2 to get:

2C + 2W = 40

Now, we can subtract this equation from the second equation to get:

2C + 4W - (2C + 2W) = 70 - 40
2W = 30

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

W = 15

Now that we know the number of cows, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find the number of chickens:

C + 15 = 20
C = 5

So, there are 5 chickens on Farmer Brown's farm.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

First, let's find the total number of slices. There are 7 pizzas, and each pizza is cut into 8 slices. 

Total number of slices = 7 pizzas * 8 slices/pizza = 56 slices

There are 4 people in total, including Henry and his 3 friends. 

Number of people = 4

Now, let's divide the total number of slices by the number of people to find out how many slices each person can have.

Slices per person = Total number of slices / Number of people
= 56 slices / 4 people
= 14 slices/person

The final answer is: 14"
