"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to first determine how many eggs she has left after eating and baking. 

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast and bakes 4 for muffins, so she uses a total of 3 + 4 = 7 eggs. 

Now, let's subtract the number of eggs she uses from the total number of eggs she lays: 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.

Janet sells these 9 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each. To find out how much she makes, we multiply the number of eggs she sells by the price per egg: 9 * 2 = 18.

The final answer is: $18"
"To find the total number of bolts needed, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber first. Since it's half the amount of blue fiber, and there are 2 bolts of blue fiber, we can calculate the white fiber as follows:

White fiber = 2 bolts (blue) / 2 = 1 bolt

Now, we add the blue fiber and white fiber to get the total number of bolts:

Total bolts = 2 bolts (blue) + 1 bolt (white) = 3 bolts

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the profit Josh made, we first need to determine the total value of the house after the repairs. 

The original value of the house was $80,000. Josh put in $50,000 in repairs, which increased the value of the house by 150%. 

To find the new value of the house, we can set up an equation: 

New Value = Original Value + (Original Value * 150%)

New Value = $80,000 + ($80,000 * 1.5)
New Value = $80,000 + $120,000
New Value = $200,000

Now, we need to find the profit Josh made. The profit is the difference between the new value of the house and the total amount Josh spent (the original price of the house plus the repairs).

Profit = New Value - (Original Value + Repairs)
Profit = $200,000 - ($80,000 + $50,000)
Profit = $200,000 - $130,000
Profit = $70,000

The final answer is: $70,000"
"To find the total number of meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total meters he runs in one sprint session and then multiply it by the number of sessions he has in a week.

Since James runs 3 sprints in a session, and each sprint is 60 meters, the total meters he runs in one session is:
3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/session

Since James runs 3 sessions a week, the total meters he runs in a week is:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

The final answer is: 540"
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to determine the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon meals. 

In the morning, Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups of feed. In the afternoon, she gives them another 25 cups of feed. The total amount of feed given in these two meals is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

Since Wendi feeds each chicken 3 cups of feed per day, and she has a flock of 20 chickens, the total amount of feed needed per day is 3 * 20 = 60 cups.

Now, to find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we subtract the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon meals from the total amount of feed needed per day. 

60 (total feed needed per day) - 40 (feed given in morning and afternoon) = 20 cups.

So, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining glasses. The first glass costs $5. 

The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3. 

The third glass costs 60% of $3, which is 0.6 * $3 = $1.8. 

We can see that the cost of each subsequent glass is 60% of the previous glass's cost. This forms a geometric sequence with the first term a = $5 and the common ratio r = 0.6.

The total number of glasses Kylar wants to buy is 16. Since the first glass is already accounted for, we need to find the cost of the remaining 15 glasses. 

The cost of the remaining glasses can be calculated using the formula for the sum of a geometric series: S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.

Plugging in the values, we get S = $5 * (1 - 0.6^15) / (1 - 0.6).

S = $5 * (1 - 0.6^15) / 0.4

S ≈ $5 * (1 - 0.00006103515625) / 0.4

S ≈ $5 * 0.99993896484375 / 0.4

S ≈ $5 * 2.49964246171875

S ≈ $12.49761230859375

The cost of the first glass is $5. 

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining glasses: $5 + $12.49761230859375.

The total cost is approximately $17.49761230859375.

The final answer is: $17.50"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of sheep in Toulouse and Charleston first. 

Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, and Seattle has 20 sheep, we can calculate the number of sheep in Charleston as follows:
Charleston = 4 * Seattle = 4 * 20 = 80

Now, we know that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. So, we can calculate the number of sheep in Toulouse as follows:
Toulouse = 2 * Charleston = 2 * 80 = 160

Now, we have the number of sheep in Toulouse (160), Charleston (80), and Seattle (20). To find the total number of sheep, we add these numbers together:
Total = Toulouse + Charleston + Seattle = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260

The final answer is: 260"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, let's find out how long it would take Carla to download the file without any interruptions. Since she can download 2 GB/minute, we can divide the total file size by her download rate:

200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes

However, Windows forces a restart 40% of the way through the download. To find out how much of the file Carla has downloaded before the restart, we can multiply the total file size by 0.4:

200 GB * 0.4 = 80 GB

Since Carla can download 2 GB/minute, we can find out how long it takes her to download 80 GB:

80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes

After the restart, Carla has to start the download from the beginning. So, she has to download the entire 200 GB again. As we calculated earlier, it would take her 100 minutes to download the entire file. However, we need to add the 20 minutes it took for the restart and the 40 minutes it took to download 80 GB before the restart.

Total time = 40 minutes (downloaded before restart) + 20 minutes (restart) + 100 minutes (downloaded after restart) = 160 minutes

The final answer is: 160"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and calculate the distance traveled in each segment.

First, John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph. The distance traveled in this segment is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 60 mph * 3 hours = 180 miles

Then, he spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so no distance is traveled in this segment.

Next, he drives for 0.5 hours (half an hour) at 30 mph. The distance traveled in this segment is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 mph * 0.5 hours = 15 miles

Finally, he drives for the remaining 1.5 hours (4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours) at 80 mph. The distance traveled in this segment is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 80 mph * 1.5 hours = 120 miles

The total distance traveled is the sum of the distances in each segment:
Total Distance = 180 miles + 0 miles + 15 miles + 120 miles = 315 miles

However, since John is trying to get home, we need to consider the distance he traveled in the first 3 hours as the distance from home. The distance he traveled in the last 4 hours is the distance from his current location to home.

The distance from home is the difference between the total distance traveled and the distance traveled in the first 3 hours:
Distance from home = Total Distance - Distance traveled in the first 3 hours
= 315 miles - 180 miles
= 135 miles

The final answer is: 135"
"To find Eliza's total earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately, then add them together.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings are 40 hours * $10/hour = $400.

For the overtime hours, she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours. Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, so her overtime rate is $10 * 1.2 = $12/hour. Her overtime earnings are 5 hours * $12/hour = $60.

Her total earnings for the week are $400 + $60 = $460.

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and then add them together.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the downloads were reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which is 54. Then, we subtract 54 from 180 to get 126 downloads in the third month.

Now, we add the downloads from each month together: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The final answer is: 366"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the donuts: 3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen is 3 x $68 = $204.

Next, let's find the cost of the mini cupcakes: 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen is 2 x $80 = $160.

Now, let's find the cost of the mini cheesecakes: 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen is 6 x $55 = $330.

Finally, let's add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost is $694."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of planting the tree and the annual expenses, and then find the point at which the total earnings from selling lemons exceed these costs.

The initial cost of planting the tree is $90. The annual expenses are $3 for watering and feeding the tree. 

The tree grows 7 lemons per year, and each lemon can be sold for $1.5. So, the total annual earnings from selling lemons are 7 * $1.5 = $10.5.

To find the break-even point, we need to calculate the total cost of the tree and the total annual expenses. The total cost of the tree is $90, and the total annual expenses are $3. 

Let's denote the number of years it takes to break even as 'x'. The total cost of the tree and the total annual expenses for 'x' years are $90 + $3x. The total earnings from selling lemons for 'x' years are $10.5x.

To find the break-even point, we set the total earnings equal to the total cost and solve for 'x':

$10.5x = $90 + $3x

Subtract $3x from both sides:

$7.5x = $90

Divide both sides by $7.5:

x = $90 / $7.5
x = 12

So, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

The final answer is: 12"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume Melanie started with 'x' vacuum cleaners.

At the green house, she sold a third of her vacuum cleaners, which is x/3.

At the red house, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners.

At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, which is (x - x/3 - 2).

We know that after selling at all the houses, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the equation:

x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

To simplify the equation, let's first find a common denominator for the fractions:

x - x/3 - 2 - (2x - 2x/3 - 4)/2

Combine like terms:

x - x/3 - 2 - (4x/3 - 2)/2

Multiply both sides by 6 to eliminate the fractions:

6x - 2x - 12 - (4x - 2)/2

Combine like terms:

4x - 12 - 2x + 1

Simplify:

2x - 11

Now, set the equation equal to 30 (since we multiplied both sides by 6):

2x - 11 = 30

Add 11 to both sides:

2x = 41

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20.5

However, since Melanie can't sell a fraction of a vacuum cleaner, we'll round down to the nearest whole number.

x = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to find the number of students who enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance, and then subtract that from the total number of students.

20% of 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance:
20 * 0.2 = 4 students

The remaining students are 20 - 4 = 16 students.

25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:
16 * 0.25 = 4 students

The number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is the remaining students after subtracting the students who enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance:
16 - 4 = 12 students

To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100:
(12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is: 60"
"To determine the maximum profit, we need to calculate the potential future value of both options and compare them.

The jewelry market is expected to rise by 2.5%, so the future value of the $5,000 jewelry purchase would be:
$5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,000 * 1.025 = $5,125

The electronic gadgets market is expected to rise by 1.2%, so the future value of the $8,000 electronic gadgets purchase would be:
$8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,000 * 1.012 = $8,096

Since the future value of the electronic gadgets ($8,096) is greater than the future value of the jewelry ($5,125), the merchant should choose the electronic gadgets to maximize profit.

The profit would be the difference between the future value and the initial cost:
$8,096 - $8,000 = $96

The final answer is: $96"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance covered on the first day and the distance covered on the second day.

On the first day, both trains travel 80 miles westward. Since they are traveling in the same direction, they cover the same distance. 

On the second day, they travel 150 miles northward. Again, since they are traveling in the same direction, they cover the same distance.

So, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 80 miles + 150 miles = 230 miles.

The final answer is: 230"
"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:

She works 35 hours a week as a teacher and gets paid $20 per hour. Since she works 50 weeks a year, her total hours worked as a teacher in a year is:
35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year

Her earnings from teaching in a year is:
1750 hours/year * $20/hour = $35,000/year

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:

She works 15 hours a week as a coach and gets paid $30 per hour. Since she works 50 weeks a year, her total hours worked as a coach in a year is:
15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year

Her earnings from coaching in a year is:
750 hours/year * $30/hour = $22,500/year

Now, let's add her earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary:
$35,000/year + $22,500/year = $57,500/year

The final answer is: $57,500"
"To find out how many eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in a week and then multiply it by 4.

Since Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning, she eats 3 eggs per day. 

There are 7 days in a week, so she eats 3 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 21 eggs/week.

In 4 weeks, she will eat 21 eggs/week * 4 weeks = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens she will eat in 4 weeks.

84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozens.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much time Marissa has left to walk the remaining distance. 

She has walked 4 miles in 1 hour and 2 miles in another hour, so she has walked a total of 6 miles in 2 hours. 

The total distance of the trail is 12 miles, and she has already walked 6 miles, so she has 12 - 6 = 6 miles left to walk.

Since she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, and the total distance is 12 miles, she needs to cover the total distance in 12 / 4 = 3 hours.

She has already walked for 2 hours, so she has 3 - 2 = 1 hour left to walk the remaining 6 miles.

To find her required speed, we divide the remaining distance by the remaining time: 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total amount of water in the orange drink, we first need to calculate two-thirds of 10 liters. Two-thirds of 10 liters is (2/3) * 10 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters. Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the remaining one-third is 10 - 6.67 = 3.33 liters of non-water content.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water in the pineapple drink. Three-fifths of 15 liters is (3/5) * 15 = 45/5 = 9 liters. The remaining two-fifths is 15 - 9 = 6 liters of non-water content.

When we add the orange and pineapple drinks together, we have a total of 10 + 15 - 1 = 24 liters. The total amount of water in the orange drink is 6.67 liters, and the total amount of water in the pineapple drink is 9 liters. 

The total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 6.67 + 9 = 15.67 liters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15.67}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how old Raymond was when his son was born and then subtract that from the current age of Samantha to find out how many years ago it was.

First, let's find out how old Raymond is now. Since Samantha is 31 and Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, Raymond is 31 - 6 = 25 years old.

Since Raymond had a son at the age of 23, we need to find out how many years have passed since then. To do this, we subtract 23 from Raymond's current age: 25 - 23 = 2.

However, this is the number of years that have passed since Raymond's son was born, not how many years ago it was. Since we want to know how many years ago it was, we don't need to do anything else.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total number of DVDs sold by Billy, we need to calculate the number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers.

The first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each, so the total number of DVDs sold to them is 3 * 1 = 3.

The next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so the total number of DVDs sold to them is 2 * 2 = 4.

The last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs, so the total number of DVDs sold to them is 0.

Now, we add the number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers: 3 + 4 = 7.

So, the total number of DVDs sold by Billy on Tuesday is 7.

"To find the total number of centimeters the candle will be shorter, we need to calculate the total time it burns and multiply it by the rate at which it melts.

The candle burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, which is a total of 4 hours.

The rate at which the candle melts is 2 centimeters per hour.

So, the total number of centimeters the candle will be shorter is 4 hours * 2 centimeters/hour = 8 centimeters.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the original price of the book, we need to determine the amount of the discount and add it to the discounted price. 

First, let's find the amount of the discount: 
Discount = 25% of the original price
Let's denote the original price as 'x'. 
Then, the discount is 0.25x.

The discounted price is the original price minus the discount: 
Discounted price = x - 0.25x = 0.75x

We know the discounted price is $19.50. 
So, we can set up the equation: 
0.75x = 19.50

To find 'x', we need to divide both sides by 0.75: 
x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book was $26.

The final answer is: $26"
"To find the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples, we can multiply the cost of each item by the quantity and add them together.

Cost of chicken meal: $12
Cost of milk: 5 packs * $3 = $15
Cost of apples: 4 apples * $1.50 = $6
Total cost of chicken, milk, and apples: $12 + $15 + $6 = $33

Since Marie paid a total of $50, we can subtract the total cost of the chicken, milk, and apples from the total amount paid to find the cost of the pizza boxes.

Cost of pizza boxes: $50 - $33 = $17

Now, we can divide the cost of the pizza boxes by the cost of each box to find the number of boxes ordered.

Number of boxes of pizza: $17 / $8.50 = 2

"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to calculate the total number of cartons she buys and then multiply it by the cost per carton.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she will go through 60 servings in 60 days. Each carton has 15 servings, so we need to divide 60 by 15 to find out how many cartons she buys:

60 servings / 15 servings per carton = 4 cartons

Now, we multiply the number of cartons by the cost per carton:

4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00

So, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream after 60 days.

The final answer is: $16.00"
"To find the distance Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to determine the distance between the two stops. 

First, let's find the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip. Since Henry's second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip is 60 - 15 = 45 miles.

Now, we know that Henry's first stop was after 20 miles. So, the distance from the first stop to the second stop is the difference between the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip and the distance from the first stop. 

Distance from the first stop to the second stop = Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip - Distance from the first stop
= 45 - 20
= 25 miles

"Let's break down the information given. We know that one pair of heels costs $33 and the other costs twice as much, which means the second pair costs 2 * $33 = $66. 

The total cost of the two pairs of heels is $33 + $66 = $99. We are also told that the two pairs of heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. 

Let's represent the cost of the boots as 'x'. Since the two pairs of heels cost $99 and they are five dollars less than the boots, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 99.

To find the cost of the boots, we need to solve for 'x'. We can do this by adding 5 to both sides of the equation: x = 99 + 5.

x = 104

"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given ratio of their ages. Let's assume Darrell's age is 7x and Allen's age is 11x, where x is a common multiplier.

We know that the total of their ages is 162, so we can write the equation: 7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms: 18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18: x = 9

Now that we have the value of x, we can find Darrell's and Allen's current ages. Darrell's age is 7x = 7(9) = 63, and Allen's age is 11x = 11(9) = 99.

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age: 99 + 10 = 109

"To find the average guess, we need to calculate the total number of guesses and divide it by the number of people who made a guess.

The first person guessed 80 jelly beans.
The second person guessed 20 more than half of the first person's guess, which is (80 / 2) + 20 = 60.
The third person guessed 25% more than the first person's guess, which is 80 + (80 * 0.25) = 100.

Now, let's add up all the guesses: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

There are 3 people who made a guess. To find the average, we divide the total by 3: 240 / 3 = 80.

"To find the total hours John spends taking care of dogs in a week, we need to first calculate the total hours he spends per day and then multiply it by 7 (the number of days in a week).

Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business. Since John takes care of 10 dogs, the total hours he spends per day is:
10 dogs * 0.5 hours/dog = 5 hours/day

Now, we multiply the daily hours by 7 to get the total hours per week:
5 hours/day * 7 days/week = 35 hours/week

The final answer is: 35"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let's represent the number of silver coins as 'x'. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins can be represented as 'x + 30'.

We know that the total number of coins is 110, which is the sum of the number of gold and silver coins. So, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 30) = 110

Combine like terms:

2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:

2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 40

Since x represents the number of silver coins, and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is x + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70.

The final answer is: 70"
"To find out how many jewels Siobhan has, we need to first determine how many jewels Aaron has. 

Since Raymond has 40 jewels, half of Raymond's jewels would be 40 / 2 = 20. 

Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, so Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.

Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, so Siobhan has 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.

"To find the total points scored by Mike, we first need to calculate the points scored in the second 20 minutes. 

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points. 
In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. 
25% of 4 points is 0.25 * 4 = 1 point. 
So, in the second 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 + 1 = 5 points. 
Now, we add the points scored in both periods: 4 + 5 = 9 points.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to first determine how many yogurts he eats in 30 days and then calculate the cost.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. In 30 days, he will eat 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

The sale is 4 yogurts for $5.00. To find the cost of 1 yogurt, we divide $5.00 by 4. So, the cost of 1 yogurt is $5.00 / 4 = $1.25.

Now, we multiply the number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days (60) by the cost of 1 yogurt ($1.25) to find the total cost. 60 * $1.25 = $75.00.

The final answer is: $75.00"
"To find out how many LEGO sets John still has, we need to first calculate how much money he made from selling the LEGO sets and then subtract the cost of the video games and the remaining money.

John sells 13 LEGO sets for $15 each, so the total amount of money he made is:
13 LEGO sets * $15 per set = $195

He then buys 8 video games for $20 each, so the total cost of the video games is:
8 video games * $20 per game = $160

After buying the video games, he has $5 left. To find out how much money he spent, we subtract the remaining money from the total amount he made:
$195 - $5 = $190

Now, we subtract the cost of the video games from the money he spent:
$190 - $160 = $30

This means he spent $30 on something else, but we are not given any information about what that is. However, we are asked about the LEGO sets. Since he sold 13 LEGO sets and we don't have any information about buying or selling any more LEGO sets, we can conclude that he still has 0 LEGO sets.

The final answer is: 0"
"To find John's running speed, we first need to calculate the total hours he runs per week. 

He runs 3 hours on the first day. The other two days, he runs half as much as the first day, which is 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours per day. 

So, the total hours he runs per week is 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours.

Now, we know John runs 60 miles a week and 6 hours a week. To find his speed, we divide the total miles by the total hours: 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Dana's running and walking speeds. We know that she can skip at 3 miles per hour, which is half as fast as she can run. So, her running speed is twice her skipping speed, which is 2 * 3 = 6 miles per hour.

We also know that Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk. So, her walking speed is one-fourth of her running speed, which is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, we need to find out how much time Dana spends running and walking in six hours. She spends one-third of the time running, which is 6 * (1/3) = 2 hours. She spends two-thirds of the time walking, which is 6 * (2/3) = 4 hours.

Now, we can calculate the distance she travels while running and walking. The distance she travels while running is her running speed multiplied by the time she spends running, which is 6 * 2 = 12 miles. The distance she travels while walking is her walking speed multiplied by the time she spends walking, which is 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles.

The total distance she travels is the sum of the distance she travels while running and walking, which is 12 + 6 = 18 miles.

The final answer is: 18"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the age of Brandon's iPhone. 

First, we know that Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old. 
Since Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, we can calculate Ben's iPhone age by multiplying Suzy's age by 2. 
Ben's iPhone age = 2 * 1 = 2 years.

Next, we know that Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. 
We can calculate Brandon's iPhone age by multiplying Ben's age by 4. 
Brandon's iPhone age = 4 * 2 = 8 years.

The final answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the distance Polly can throw the javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone and then subtract the dragon's reach from that distance.

When Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone. Since she can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone, she can throw it 3 * 400 = 1200 feet with the gemstone.

The dragon's flames reach 1000 feet. To find the distance outside the dragon's reach where Polly can still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's reach from the distance Polly can throw with the gemstone: 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet.

The final answer is: 200"
"To find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we need to first determine the total number of pieces of pie that were available. Since Grandma Jones cut each pie into 8 pieces and she baked 5 pies, the total number of pieces is 5 * 8 = 40.

We know that at the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken, we subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces: 40 - 14 = 26.

So, the guests took 26 pieces of pie.

The final answer is: 26"
"To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we first need to determine how many calories you have left to consume. 

Your daily calorie target is 2000, and you have already consumed 1800 calories. 

2000 (daily target) - 1800 (already consumed) = 200 calories left

Since each serving of chips has 250 calories, we can divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving to find out how many servings you can have.

200 calories / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings

Since a 300g bag has 5 servings, we can multiply the number of servings by the weight of the bag to find out how many grams you can eat.

0.8 servings * 300g = 240g

The final answer is: 240"
"To find Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost.

First, let's calculate the total cost. Since one pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10.00, and Charlie makes 10 candles per pound, the cost per candle is $1.00 ($10.00 / 10 candles). 

To make 20 candles, the total cost would be 20 candles * $1.00 per candle = $20.00.

Next, let's calculate the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, and he makes 20 candles. The total revenue would be 20 candles * $2.00 per candle = $40.00.

Now, let's calculate the net profit. The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.

The final answer is: $20.00"
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply it by the time it takes to write one article (4 hours).

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. To find 2/5 of 5, we multiply 5 by 2/5:
5 * (2/5) = 2
So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 7 * 2 = 14 articles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles she wrote in the three days:
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles

Since it takes 4 hours to write one article, the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours

The final answer is: 104"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many Post-it notes Candice had after placing one on each of the 220 cups of coffee. We know she had 80 initially and had 23 remaining after placing the notes on the cups. 

First, let's find out how many Post-it notes Candice used at the coffee shop. This can be calculated by subtracting the remaining Post-it notes from the initial amount: 80 - 23 = 57. 

Since she placed one note on each of the 220 cups, the total number of Post-it notes used at the coffee shop is 220. However, we know that 57 were used in total, so the remaining Post-it notes must have come from the package she purchased. 

Now, let's find out how many Post-it notes were in the package. This can be calculated by subtracting the Post-it notes used at the coffee shop from the total used: 220 - 57 = 163. 

However, this is the number of Post-it notes used from the package, not the total number of Post-it notes in the package. Since Candice purchased a package, we can assume that the package was not empty. Therefore, the total number of Post-it notes in the package must be more than 163. 

To find the total number of Post-it notes in the package, we need to add the remaining Post-it notes to the number of Post-it notes used from the package: 163 + 23 = 186.

The final answer is: 186"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many blue ties John bought. Since he spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is:

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
= 2 * 5
= 10

Now, we need to find the cost of each red tie. Since the red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, the cost of each red tie is:

Cost of each red tie = Cost of each blue tie + (50% of the cost of each blue tie)
= $40 + (0.5 * $40)
= $40 + $20
= $60

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent on red ties:

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of each red tie
= 10 * $60
= $600

Finally, we can find the total amount spent on ties by adding the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties:

Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
= $200 + $600
= $800

The final answer is: $800"
"To find the number of pieces Tracy obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches and then divide it by the length of each piece.

1 foot is equal to 12 inches. So, 4 feet is equal to 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Now, we divide the total length of the wire (48 inches) by the length of each piece (6 inches):

48 ÷ 6 = 8

Tracy obtained 8 pieces."
"To find the total number of units in the building, we need to multiply the number of floors by the number of units per floor. 

Number of floors: 15
Number of units per floor: 8

Total units = Number of floors * Number of units per floor
Total units = 15 * 8
Total units = 120

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we need to find 1/4 of the total units to determine the number of unoccupied units.

1/4 of the total units = (1/4) * Total units
1/4 of the total units = (1/4) * 120
1/4 of the total units = 30

The total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"To find out how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to first calculate how much he makes per day and then multiply that by 7.

First, let's find out how many eggs Lloyd sells per day. Since he sells eggs by the dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs produced by 12 to find out how many dozens he sells per day.

Eggs produced per day: 252
Eggs sold per day (in dozens): 252 / 12 = 21 dozen

Now, let's calculate Lloyd's daily income from egg sales.

Price per dozen: $2
Eggs sold per day (in dozens): 21
Daily income: 21 * $2 = $42

To find out Lloyd's weekly income, we multiply his daily income by 7.

Weekly income: $42 * 7 = $294

The final answer is: $294"
"To find the total time Tom spends traveling, we need to calculate the time he spends going and coming back. 

First, let's find the time he spends going from 1 to 4 PM. Since he travels at 10 miles per hour, we need to find the distance he covers in 3 hours (from 1 to 4 PM). However, we don't know the distance, but we can find it using the formula distance = speed * time. 

Since the time is 3 hours, the distance is 10 * 3 = 30 miles.

Now, let's find the time he spends coming back. The distance is the same, 30 miles, and his speed is 6 mph. Using the formula time = distance / speed, we get time = 30 / 6 = 5 hours.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he removes 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is:

30 * 1/4 = 30 * 0.25 = 7.5 pounds

Since Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds, and the comic books weigh 7.5 pounds, the remaining weight that needs to be removed from toys is:

15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, the number of toys that need to be removed is:

7.5 / 0.5 = 15

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total revenue for each day, we need to calculate the revenue from truck tires and car tires separately and then add them together.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires at $60 each and 4 car tires at $40 each. The total revenue from truck tires is 6 * $60 = $360. The total revenue from car tires is 4 * $40 = $160. The total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires at $40 each. The total revenue from car tires is 12 * $40 = $480. There is no revenue from truck tires on Friday.

To find the day with higher revenue, we compare the revenues: $520 (Thursday) and $480 (Friday). Thursday has higher revenue.

The difference in revenue between the two days is $520 - $480 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find the total number of kittens, we first need to determine the number of kittens each cat has had. 

Patchy, the first cat, has had thrice the number of adopted kittens. Since the Doubtfire sisters adopted 7 kittens, Patchy has had 3 * 7 = 21 kittens.

Trixie, the other cat, has had 12 kittens.

Now, we add the number of adopted kittens (7) to the number of kittens each cat has had: 7 (adopted) + 21 (Patchy's kittens) + 12 (Trixie's kittens) = 40.

The Doubtfire family now has 40 kittens.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find out how many bags Jean can fill, we first need to determine the number of lollipops remaining after eating 2. 

Jean starts with 30 lollipops and eats 2, so the remaining lollipops are 30 - 2 = 28.

Since Jean wants to package 2 lollipops in one bag, we need to divide the remaining lollipops by 2 to find out how many bags can be filled.

28 lollipops / 2 lollipops per bag = 14 bags

The final answer is: 14"
"To find out how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to calculate how many times he can afford the total cost of a movie outing, which is the sum of the ticket price and the popcorn price.

The total cost of a movie outing is $7 (ticket) + $7 (popcorn) = $14.

Now, let's divide the total amount of money Peter has ($42) by the cost of a movie outing ($14) to find out how many times he can go to the movies.

$42 ÷ $14 = 3

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times.

"To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck, we need to first determine the remaining weight capacity of the bridge after the truck and driver are on it. 

The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. The weight limit of the bridge is 5000 pounds. 

Remaining weight capacity = Weight limit - Combined weight of driver and empty truck
Remaining weight capacity = 5000 - 3755
Remaining weight capacity = 1245 pounds

Since each box weighs 15 pounds, we can find the maximum number of boxes by dividing the remaining weight capacity by the weight of each box.

Maximum number of boxes = Remaining weight capacity / Weight of each box
Maximum number of boxes = 1245 / 15
Maximum number of boxes = 83

The final answer is: 83"
"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to first calculate the total cost after the delivery vendor's fee. 

The original bill was $40.00. The vendor added a 25% fee to this amount. To find 25% of $40.00, we multiply $40.00 by 0.25. 

$40.00 * 0.25 = $10.00

Now, we add the 25% fee to the original bill: 
$40.00 + $10.00 = $50.00

Next, we add the $3.00 delivery fee to the total: 
$50.00 + $3.00 = $53.00

Finally, we add the $4.00 tip to the total: 
$53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00

The final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00.

"To find the number of good oranges, we first need to find the total number of unripe and bad oranges. 

There are 1 bad oranges and 20% of 25 oranges are unripe. 
20% of 25 = (20/100) * 25 = 5 oranges are unripe.

Now, we know that there are 2 sour oranges. 
So, the total number of unripe, bad, and sour oranges = 5 (unripe) + 1 (bad) + 2 (sour) = 8 oranges.

Now, we can find the number of good oranges by subtracting the total number of unripe, bad, and sour oranges from the total number of oranges.
Number of good oranges = Total number of oranges - Total number of unripe, bad, and sour oranges
= 25 - 8

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the value of the pension after 30 years and then find 5% of that value.

First, let's find the total value of the pension after 30 years. Since Marcy works for 30 years, she gets the full pension for 10 years (30 - 20 = 10) and the additional 5% for the remaining 20 years.

The annual pension for the first 10 years is $50,000. 

The annual pension for the next 20 years is 5% of the value of the pension after 10 years. Let's call the value of the pension after 10 years 'V'. Then, the annual pension for the next 20 years is 0.05V.

The total value of the pension after 30 years is the sum of the pensions for the first 10 years and the next 20 years. This can be represented as:

Total Value = 10 * $50,000 + 20 * 0.05V

Since the total value of the pension after 10 years is equal to the annual pension for the next 20 years, we can set up the equation:

V = 10 * $50,000

V = $500,000

Now, we can substitute V into the equation for the total value of the pension after 30 years:

Total Value = 10 * $50,000 + 20 * 0.05 * $500,000
Total Value = $500,000 + $50,000
Total Value = $550,000

However, this is the total value of the pension after 30 years, not the annual pension. To find the annual pension, we need to divide the total value by 30.

Annual Pension = Total Value / 30
Annual Pension = $550,000 / 30
Annual Pension = $18,333.33

The final answer is: $18,333.33"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the first half of the year and the second half of the year separately, and then add them together.

The first half of the year is 6 months, so the cost for the first half is 6 * $140 = $840.

For the second half of the year, the company charges 10% less than the initial amount. To find the cost for the second half, we need to calculate 10% of $140 and subtract it from the initial amount.

10% of $140 = 0.1 * $140 = $14
Cost for the second half = $140 - $14 = $126
Cost for the second half for 6 months = 6 * $126 = $756

Now, we add the cost for the first half and the second half to get the total amount paid by Aleena:
Total amount = $840 + $756 = $1596

The final answer is: $1596"
"To determine how far Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to find out how many miles she can drive per gallon. We know that she has traveled 100 miles since her last fill-up and that it took 4 gallons to fill up her tank again. 

First, let's find out how many miles she can drive per gallon. We can do this by dividing the total distance she has traveled (100 miles) by the amount of gas she used (4 gallons). 

100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon

Now that we know she can drive 25 miles per gallon, we can find out how many miles she can drive on a full tank by multiplying the miles per gallon by the total capacity of her tank (12 gallons).

25 miles per gallon * 12 gallons = 300 miles

So, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas.

"To find the total number of people sent by the schools, we need to calculate the number of students and coaches for both the girls' and boys' teams.

Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys'), and each team has 5 players. So, the total number of students from each school is 2 teams * 5 players/team = 10 students.

Each school also has 2 coaches, one for each team. So, the total number of coaches from each school is 2 coaches.

Now, we multiply the number of students and coaches from each school by the total number of schools to find the total number of people sent by all schools.

Total students = 10 students/school * 4 schools = 40 students
Total coaches = 2 coaches/school * 4 schools = 8 coaches

Total people = Total students + Total coaches = 40 + 8 = 48

"To find the total number of gems, we need to calculate the number of each type of gem and add them together.

First, we know there are 175 diamonds. 

Next, we are told there are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds. So, the number of rubies is 175 - 35 = 140.

Then, we are told there are twice the number of emeralds as rubies. So, the number of emeralds is 2 * 140 = 280.

Now, we add the number of each type of gem together: 175 (diamonds) + 140 (rubies) + 280 (emeralds) = 595.

The final answer is: 595"
"To find the number of boys, we know there are twice as many boys as girls. Since there are 60 girls, the number of boys is 2 * 60 = 120.

The total number of students is the sum of boys and girls, which is 60 + 120 = 180.

Since there are 5 students to every teacher, we can find the number of teachers by dividing the total number of students by 5. 

Number of teachers = Total number of students / 5

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much money Bailey received in total from her weekly allowance and then subtract that from the total amount she has at the end of 8 weeks.

Bailey receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks. So, the total amount she receives from her allowance is:
$5/week * 8 weeks = $40

Since Bailey has a total of $100 at the end of 8 weeks, and she received $40 from her allowance, we can set up the equation:
Initial amount + $40 = $100

To find the initial amount, we subtract $40 from both sides of the equation:
Initial amount = $100 - $40
Initial amount = $60

So, Bailey started with $60.

"To find out how much Shiela will pay each month, we need to calculate the total cost of the cell phones first, then divide it by the number of months.

The total cost of the cell phones is 5 units * $150/unit = $750.

Since a 2% interest will be charged for each unit, the total interest for 5 units is 5 * 2% = 10% of the total cost. 

10% of $750 is 0.1 * $750 = $75.

So, the total amount Shiela needs to pay is $750 (cost) + $75 (interest) = $825.

Since the total amount is to be paid in 3 months, we divide the total amount by 3: $825 / 3 = $275.

Therefore, Shiela will pay $275 each month for 3 months.

The final answer is: $275"
"To find the total amount Artie will make, we need to calculate the total revenue from each type of flower and then add them together.

First, let's round the prices to the nearest dollar:
- Marigolds: $2.74 → $3
- Petunias: $1.87 → $2
- Begonias: $2.12 → $2

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from each type of flower:
- Marigolds: 12 pots * $3/pot = $36
- Petunias: 9 pots * $2/pot = $18
- Begonias: 17 pots * $2/pot = $34

Now, let's add the total revenue from each type of flower:
$36 + $18 + $34 = $88

The final answer is: $88"
"To find the average square footage of a level, we need to first find the total square footage of the sandcastle and then divide it by the number of levels.

Since each level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can start with the top level and work our way down. 

The top level has a square footage of 16. 
The second level will have half of 16, which is 8. 
The third level will have half of 8, which is 4. 
The fourth level will have half of 4, which is 2.

Now, we add up the square footage of all levels: 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30.

There are 4 levels in total. To find the average square footage, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels: 30 / 4 = 7.5.

The final answer is: 7.5"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year. 

First, let's find out how many days are in a year. There are 365 days in a year.

The puppy will eat 1 cup of dog food for the first 180 days. So, the amount of dog food used in the first 180 days is 180 cups.

The puppy will eat 2 cups of dog food for the rest of its life, which is 365 - 180 = 185 days. So, the amount of dog food used in the rest of the year is 2 * 185 = 370 cups.

The total amount of dog food used in the first year is 180 + 370 = 550 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the total number of bags of dog food used in the first year is 550 / 110 = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much laundry Raymond and David do.

Since Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, and she does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can find out how much laundry David does by dividing 400 by 4.

David's laundry = 400 / 4 = 100 pounds

Since Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, we can find out how much laundry Raymond does by dividing 400 by 2.

Raymond's laundry = 400 / 2 = 200 pounds

Now, we need to find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do.

Difference = Raymond's laundry - David's laundry
= 200 - 100
= 100 pounds

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the better price, we need to calculate the cost per flower for each package option. 

For the package of 3 flowers, the cost per flower is $2.50 / 3 = $0.8333 per flower.

For the package of 2 flowers, the cost per flower is $1 / 2 = $0.5 per flower.

Since $0.5 per flower is less than $0.8333 per flower, the package of 2 flowers is the better option.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price. 18 flowers / 2 flowers per package = 9 packages. The cost of 9 packages of 2 flowers is 9 * $1 = $9.

To find the cost of buying 18 flowers at the package of 3 flowers, we calculate 18 flowers / 3 flowers per package = 6 packages. The cost of 6 packages of 3 flowers is 6 * $2.50 = $15.

The difference in cost is $15 - $9 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To find the cost of the grooming after the discount, we need to calculate 30% of the original price and subtract it from the original price.

The original price is $100. 
30% of $100 is 0.3 x $100 = $30.

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price: $100 - $30 = $70.

The final cost of the grooming is $70.

The final answer is: $70"
"To find out how much water the girls got, we need to calculate 1/6 of 24 liters for each girl. 

1/6 of 24 liters is 24 / 6 = 4 liters. Since there are two girls, they got a total of 4 * 2 = 8 liters.

Now, we subtract the total amount of water the girls got from the initial 24 liters: 24 - 8 = 16 liters.

Then, the boy got 6 liters of water. We subtract this from the remaining 16 liters: 16 - 6 = 10 liters.

So, the amount of water left is 10 liters.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many stickers Charlie has left, we need to calculate the total number of stickers he had initially and then subtract the number of stickers he gave away or used.

Initially, Charlie had 10 stickers.

He bought 21 stickers from a store, so now he has 10 + 21 = 31 stickers.

He got 23 stickers for his birthday, so now he has 31 + 23 = 54 stickers.

Then, he gave 9 stickers to his sister, so now he has 54 - 9 = 45 stickers.

Finally, he used 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card, so now he has 45 - 28 = 17 stickers.

Therefore, Charlie has 17 stickers left.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find Alex's weight, we need to calculate 4 times Grace's weight and then subtract 2 pounds from that result. 

First, we multiply Grace's weight by 4: 125 * 4 = 500 pounds. 

Then, we subtract 2 pounds from that result: 500 - 2 = 498 pounds.

Now, we know Alex weighs 498 pounds. To find their combined weights, we add Grace's weight to Alex's weight: 125 + 498 = 623 pounds.

The final answer is: 623"
"To find the total number of thorns, we need to multiply the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush, and then multiply that result by the number of thorns per rose.

First, we multiply the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush: 3 * 25 = 75

Then, we multiply the result by the number of thorns per rose: 75 * 8 = 600

So, there are 600 thorns in total.

The final answer is: 600"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let's represent the number of games the team lost as 'x'. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games they won can be represented as 'x + 8'.

We know that the total number of games played is 22, which is the sum of the games won and lost. So, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:

2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 7

Since x represents the number of games lost, the number of games won is x + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total number of quilt blocks, we need to calculate the total number of years Gene has been vacationing and multiply it by the number of vacations he goes on per year.

Gene has been vacationing since he was 23 years old and is now 34, so he has been vacationing for 34 - 23 = 11 years.

Since he goes on four vacations a year, the total number of quilt blocks is 11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 quilt blocks.

The final answer is: 44"
"To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the number of times it rang each time it went off and add them together.

The first time it went off, it rang 4 times.

The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time, so it rang 3 * 4 = 12 times.

The third time it went off, it rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we add the number of times it rang each time: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To find Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we first need to calculate her salary after five years of service, and then calculate the increase for the next three years.

Initially, Sylvie's salary is $600. 

After one year, her salary will be 600 + (600 * 0.10) = 600 + 60 = $660.

After two years, her salary will be 660 + (660 * 0.10) = 660 + 66 = $726.

After three years, her salary will be 726 + (726 * 0.10) = 726 + 72.60 = $798.60.

After four years, her salary will be 798.60 + (798.60 * 0.10) = 798.60 + 79.86 = $878.46.

After five years, her salary will be 878.46 + (878.46 * 0.10) = 878.46 + 87.846 = $966.306.

Since Sylvie has already reached the five-year mark, she will receive a 10% increase every year for the next three years. 

After six years, her salary will be 966.306 + (966.306 * 0.10) = 966.306 + 96.6306 = $1062.9366.

After seven years, her salary will be 1062.9366 + (1062.9366 * 0.10) = 1062.9366 + 106.29366 = $1169.23026.

After eight years, her salary will be 1169.23026 + (1169.23026 * 0.10) = 1169.23026 + 116.923026 = $1286.153286.

The final answer is: $1286.15"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as 'H' and the number of copies Marilyn sold as 'M'. We know that M = 10H, since Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's.

We also know that the total number of copies sold is 88,000, so we can write the equation: M + H = 88,000.

Substituting M = 10H into the equation, we get 10H + H = 88,000, which simplifies to 11H = 88,000.

To find the value of H, we divide both sides of the equation by 11: H = 88,000 / 11.

H = 8000.

The final answer is: 8000"
"To find out how many gift bags Christina needs, we first need to calculate the number of guests she expects to attend. Since 1/4 of the invited guests don't show up, we can find the number of guests who will attend by subtracting 1/4 from the total number of invited guests.

16 (invited guests) - (1/4 * 16) = 16 - 4 = 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we multiply the number of guests attending by 0.75 to find the total number of gift bags needed.

12 (guests attending) * 0.75 (gift bags per guest) = 9

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of gift bags needed by the cost per gift bag.

9 (gift bags) * $2 (cost per gift bag) = $18

The final answer is: $18"
"To find the total amount of potato salad needed, we need to calculate the amount an adult and a child will eat and then multiply it by the number of adults and children respectively.

An adult will eat 10 lbs of potato salad, and a child will eat half as much as an adult, which is 10 / 2 = 5 lbs.

There are 20 adults, so the total amount of potato salad needed for adults is 20 * 10 = 200 lbs.

There are 5 children, so the total amount of potato salad needed for children is 5 * 5 = 25 lbs.

To find the total amount of potato salad needed, we add the amount for adults and children: 200 + 25 = 225 lbs.

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.

225"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem.

We know that Cindy has 4 pets. Since Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.

We also know that Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia. Since Marcia has 6 pets, Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets.

To find the total number of pets the three have, we need to add the number of pets each one has: 4 (Cindy) + 6 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan) = 28.

"To find Jackson's age, we need to determine Corey's age first. Since James is 10 and 1 year younger than Corey, Corey must be 10 + 1 = 11 years old.

Now, we know Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy's age is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

Since Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, Jackson's age is 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it takes Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles before his diet change. Since Lee runs 2 seconds faster than Gerald, we can set up an equation:

Time it takes Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles = Time it takes Lee to run the 400-meter hurdles + 2 seconds

We know that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds. So, we can substitute this value into the equation:

Time it takes Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles = 38 + 2
Time it takes Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles = 40 seconds

Now, we know that Gerald's diet improved his speed by 10%. To find out how much time he will save, we need to calculate 10% of 40 seconds:

10% of 40 seconds = 0.1 * 40 = 4 seconds

Since Gerald's diet improved his speed by 10%, he will save 4 seconds. To find out how long it takes him to run the 400-meter hurdles with his improved diet, we subtract 4 seconds from his original time:

Time it takes Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles with his improved diet = 40 - 4
Time it takes Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles with his improved diet = 36 seconds

The final answer is: 36"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of cats, then the number of rabbits, and finally add them up with the number of dogs to get the total number of pets.

Given that there are two cats for every dog, and the number of dogs is 60, we can find the number of cats by multiplying the number of dogs by 2.

Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
= 2 * 60
= 120

Now, we know that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. We can find the combined number of dogs and cats by adding the number of dogs and cats.

Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
= 60 + 120
= 180

Now, we can find the number of rabbits by subtracting 12 from the combined number of dogs and cats.

Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
= 180 - 12
= 168

Finally, we can find the total number of pets in the neighborhood by adding the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits.

Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
= 60 + 120 + 168
= 348

The final answer is: 348"
"To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we first need to find the total number of girls and then subtract the number of girls in the girl scout.

First, let's find the number of boys and girls. We know that 2/5 of the students are boys. 

Number of boys = (2/5) * 200 = 80

Since there are 200 students in total, the number of girls can be found by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students.

Number of girls = 200 - 80 = 120

Now, we know that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. 

Number of girls in the girl scout = (2/3) * 120 = 80

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls.

Number of girls not in the girl scout = 120 - 80 = 40

"To find out how many hours James slept, we need to calculate 2/3 of the hours Harry slept. 

Harry slept 9 hours, so 2/3 of 9 is (2/3) * 9 = 6 hours. 

Since James slept 2/3 of what Harry slept, James slept 6 hours. 

To find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we need to subtract the hours James slept from the hours Harry slept. 

9 (Harry's hours) - 6 (James' hours) = 3 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many 16-ounce cans of tomatoes Freda used to make 32 ounces of sauce. Since the sauce is made from the tomatoes in the cans, and the volume of the sauce is half the volume of the tomatoes, we can infer that the total volume of the tomatoes used is twice the volume of the sauce.

The total volume of the sauce is 32 ounces, so the total volume of the tomatoes used is 2 * 32 = 64 ounces.

Since each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces, we can divide the total volume of the tomatoes by the volume of each can to find the number of cans used: 64 / 16 = 4 cans.

Each can contains 3 tomatoes, so the total number of tomatoes used is 4 cans * 3 tomatoes/can = 12 tomatoes.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes. 

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as 'x'. Since 5 cars took an exit, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is x + 20 (the 20 cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes). 

We know that the total number of cars originally on the motorway was 30, and 5 cars took an exit. So, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 30 - 5 = 25.

Now, we can set up an equation: x + 20 = 25. Solving for x, we get x = 5.

"To find out how many potted plants Mary will have left, we first need to determine the total number of potted plants she has initially. She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, so the total number of potted plants she has is 2 * 40 = 80.

Yesterday, she received 18 new potted plants, so the total number of potted plants she has now is 80 + 18 = 98.

Tomorrow, she will give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to her friends and family, so she will give away 40 potted plants.

To find out how many potted plants Mary will have left, we subtract the number of potted plants she gave away from the total number of potted plants she has now: 98 - 40 = 58.

"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell and add them up.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. 
1/4 of 20 is 5, so the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. 
We are given that the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times, so the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

Now, we add up the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell: 
20 (first friend) + 25 (second friend) + 70 (third friend) + 60 (fourth friend) = 175

The total number of doorbell rings is 175."

"To find out how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to calculate the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends separately, and then add them together.

On weekdays, John drinks a glass of water with each meal, which includes breakfast, lunch, and dinner. So, that's 3 glasses per day. Since there are 5 weekdays, he drinks 3 * 5 = 15 glasses of water on weekdays.

On weekends, John drinks a glass of water with breakfast and lunch, but not with dinner, as he prefers soda with dinner. So, that's 2 glasses per day. Since there are 2 weekend days, he drinks 2 * 2 = 4 glasses of water on weekends.

Now, let's add the glasses of water John drinks on weekdays and weekends: 15 (weekdays) + 4 (weekends) = 19 glasses of water.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many pieces Poppy and her mom have placed, and then subtract that from the total number of pieces.

Poppy places a quarter of the pieces, which is 1/4 of 1000. To find 1/4 of 1000, we multiply 1000 by 1/4 or divide by 4.

1000 / 4 = 250

So, Poppy places 250 pieces.

Now, there are 1000 - 250 = 750 pieces left.

Her mom places a third of the remaining pieces, which is 1/3 of 750. To find 1/3 of 750, we multiply 750 by 1/3 or divide by 3.

750 / 3 = 250

So, her mom places 250 pieces.

Now, we need to find out how many pieces are left after her mom places her pieces. We subtract the number of pieces her mom placed from the remaining pieces.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 2 episodes of a 1-hour show, which is a total of 2 * 1 = 2 hours.

On Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. Let's call the number of episodes 'x'. Since each episode is 30 minutes, the total time he watched on Wednesday is 30x minutes.

On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, which is a total of 1.5 hours.

On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, which is a total of 2 hours.

The total time he watched TV is 7 hours. We can set up an equation to represent this:

2 (Monday and Tuesday) + 30x (Wednesday) + 1.5 (Thursday) + 2 (Friday) = 7

Combine like terms:

2 + 30x + 1.5 + 2 = 7

Combine the constants:

5.5 + 30x = 7

Subtract 5.5 from both sides:

30x = 1.5

Divide both sides by 30:

x = 0.05

Since x represents the number of episodes, and each episode is 30 minutes, we can multiply x by 30 to find the total time in minutes:

0.05 * 30 = 1.5 minutes

However, this doesn't make sense because we're looking for the number of episodes, not the total time in minutes. We made a mistake in our calculation. Let's go back to the equation:

30x + 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 7

Combine like terms:

30x + 5.5 = 7

Subtract 5.5 from both sides:

30x = 1.5

Divide both sides by 30:

x = 0.05

However, this is still not correct. Let's re-evaluate the equation:

30x + 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 7

Combine like terms:

30x + 5.5 = 7

Subtract 5.5 from both sides:

30x = 1.5

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as 'x'. Since Henry wants to make twice as many cookies this year, he plans to bake 2x cookies.

However, he actually baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the total number of cookies he baked is 2x + 15.

After dropping 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies left. This can be represented by the equation: 2x + 15 - 5 = 110.

Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 10 = 110.

Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation, we get 2x = 100.

Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get x = 50.

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To find the total cost of gas after the cashback rewards, we need to first calculate the total cost of gas without the rewards, and then subtract the cashback amount.

The cost of gas per gallon is $3.00, and the person is buying 10 gallons. 

Total cost of gas = cost per gallon * number of gallons
Total cost of gas = $3.00 * 10
Total cost of gas = $30.00

The cashback reward is $0.20 per gallon, and the person is buying 10 gallons.

Total cashback = cashback per gallon * number of gallons
Total cashback = $0.20 * 10
Total cashback = $2.00

Now, we subtract the total cashback from the total cost of gas to find the final cost.

Final cost = Total cost of gas - Total cashback
Final cost = $30.00 - $2.00
Final cost = $28.00

The final answer is: $28.00"
"To find the total number of fruit roll-ups eaten by each person, we need to multiply the width and length of each roll-up. 

Beatrice's roll-up is 2 roll-ups wide and 24 rolls long, so the total number of roll-ups is 2 * 24 = 48.

Marcell's roll-up is 3 roll-ups wide and 14 rolls long, so the total number of roll-ups is 3 * 14 = 42.

To find the average number of roll-ups eaten, we need to add the total number of roll-ups eaten by each person and divide by 2. 

Total roll-ups eaten = 48 + 42 = 90

Average roll-ups eaten = 90 / 2 = 45

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many sets of 10 feet Julia rows in 64 seconds, and then multiply that by the amount of water taken on per set.

First, let's find out how many seconds it takes Julia to row 10 feet. We know it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, so we can divide 16 by 2 to get the time it takes to row 10 feet.

16 seconds / 2 = 8 seconds per 10 feet

Now, let's find out how many sets of 10 feet Julia rows in 64 seconds. We can divide 64 by 8 to get the number of sets.

64 seconds / 8 seconds per 10 feet = 8 sets of 10 feet

Since it takes 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, and Julia rows 8 sets of 10 feet, we can multiply the number of sets by the amount of water taken on per set.

8 sets * 2 liters per set = 16 liters

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how many photographs Brittany's phone can hold. We know that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs and it's 6 times more than Brittany's phone. 

Let's denote the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold as B. Then, we have the equation: 6B = 1800. 

To find B, we divide both sides by 6: B = 1800 / 6 = 300.

Now, we know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Let's denote the number of birds in Jamal's photograph as D. Then, we have the equation: 300 = 50D.

To find D, we divide both sides by 50: D = 300 / 50 = 6.

"To calculate Sasha's profit, we need to first find the total cost of the lumber and the total selling price. 

The total cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $10 = $100. 
The total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $16 = $80. 
The total cost of all the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since prices have gone up by 50%, the new price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each. 
The new price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 each.

The total selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $15 = $150. 
The total selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $24 = $120. 
The total selling price of all the lumber is $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit is the total selling price minus the total cost, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

Since the total amount of sugar and water is 120, we can set up the equation: 7x + 13x = 120

Combine like terms: 20x = 120

Divide both sides by 20: x = 6

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the number of teaspoons of sugar used: 7x = 7(6) = 42

"To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we first need to determine the total number of vehicles that were already at the port. We know that there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles initially is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of vehicles at the port after the second day is 30. To find the number of vehicles brought in on the second day, we subtract the initial number of vehicles from the total number of vehicles: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can find the number of containers brought in on the second day by dividing the number of vehicles brought in by the number of vehicles per container: 20 / 5 = 4.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find Lylah's salary four years ago. 

Let's assume Lylah's salary four years ago was 'x'. Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can express Adrien's salary as 1.3x. We are given that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000, so we can set up the equation:

1.3x = 40000

To find 'x', we can divide both sides by 1.3:

x = 40000 / 1.3
x = 30769.23

So, Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30769.23.

Now, we need to find Adrien's salary four years later. We are given that his salary increased by 40% of his original salary. We can express this as:

New salary = Original salary + (40% of Original salary)
= 40000 + (0.4 * 40000)
= 40000 + 16000
= 56000

Now, we need to find Lylah's salary four years later. Since their salaries increased simultaneously, we can assume the percentage increase in Lylah's salary is the same as Adrien's, which is 40%. We can express Lylah's new salary as:

New salary = Original salary + (40% of Original salary)
= 30769.23 + (0.4 * 30769.23)
= 30769.23 + 12307.69
= 43076.92

Now, we can find the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later by adding their new salaries:

Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary
= 56000 + 43076.92
= 99076.92

"To find the total hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we need to calculate her sleep hours for each day and add them up.

On Monday, Sadie slept 8 hours.

For the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday), she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours each day.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Sunday), she slept 1 hour more than the previous two days, so she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours each day.

Now, let's calculate the total hours for each period:

- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday and Wednesday: 2 days * 6 hours = 12 hours
- Thursday to Sunday: 5 days * 7 hours = 35 hours

Adding up the total hours: 8 + 12 + 35 = 55 hours

"To find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour and the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour.

First, let's calculate the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours. 

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, let's calculate the remaining time after 3 hours. 
Total time = 7 hours
Time already run = 3 hours
Remaining time = Total time - Time already run
Remaining time = 7 hours - 3 hours
Remaining time = 4 hours

Now, let's calculate the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour for the remaining 4 hours.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour * 4 hours
Distance = 20 miles

Now, let's add the distances from both parts to find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours.

Total distance = Distance at 10 mph + Distance at 5 mph
Total distance = 30 miles + 20 miles
Total distance = 50 miles

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many letters Jennie stamped and then subtract that from the total number of letters that were already stamped when she began.

We know that Jennie put stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps. Since there are 60 letters needing stamps, one-third of that is 60 / 3 = 20 letters.

We also know that after Jennie stamped 20 letters, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. This means that the 20 letters Jennie stamped were added to the pile of already-stamped letters.

So, to find out how many letters were in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began, we need to subtract the 20 letters Jennie added from the current total of 30 letters.

30 (current total) - 20 (letters Jennie added) = 10

Therefore, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of spoons Julia initially bought. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Julia initially bought a package of spoons, but we don't know the quantity yet.
2. Her husband bought a package of 5 new spoons and gave them to Julia.
3. Julia used 3 spoons while making the stew.
4. After using the spoons, Julia had a total of 12 spoons.

Let's denote the number of spoons Julia initially bought as 'x'. Since her husband gave her 5 more spoons, the total number of spoons she had before using any would be 'x + 5'. After using 3 spoons, she had 'x + 5 - 3' spoons left. We know that this number equals 12.

Now, we can set up an equation to solve for 'x':

x + 5 - 3 = 12

Simplifying the equation:

x + 2 = 12

Subtracting 2 from both sides:

x = 10

So, Julia initially bought 10 spoons.

"To find the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together, we first need to determine the number of friends Amy has. Since Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, and Lily has 50 friends, we can calculate Amy's friends by adding 20 to Lily's total.

Amy's friends = Lily's friends + 20
Amy's friends = 50 + 20
Amy's friends = 70

Now, to find the total number of friends they have together, we add the number of friends Lily and Amy have.

Total friends = Lily's friends + Amy's friends
Total friends = 50 + 70
Total friends = 120

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to determine the cost of each item and then multiply it by the quantity.

First, let's find the cost of a watermelon. Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, and each pepper costs $15, the cost of a watermelon is 3 * $15 = $45.

Next, we find the cost of an orange. An orange costs 5 dollars less than a watermelon, so the cost of an orange is $45 - $5 = $40.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of each item:

- 4 watermelons: 4 * $45 = $180
- 20 peppers: 20 * $15 = $300
- 10 oranges: 10 * $40 = $400

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is the sum of the costs of all items: $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

The final answer is: $880"
"To find the total profit, we first need to calculate the total time spent by doctors and the total amount charged to patients.

The hospital sees 500 people a day, and each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes. To find the total time spent by doctors, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. 

24 minutes is 24/60 = 0.4 hours per patient.

The total time spent by doctors is 500 patients * 0.4 hours/patient = 200 hours.

The doctors charge $150 an hour, so the total amount charged by doctors is 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000.

The hospital charges $200 an hour, so the total amount charged to patients is 200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000.

The profit is the difference between the total amount charged to patients and the total amount charged by doctors. 

Profit = $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.

The final answer is: $10,000."
"To find the number of elves left, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, Nissa hires 60 seasonal workers.

A third of the elves quit after children vomit on them. To find a third of 60, we divide 60 by 3:
60 / 3 = 20

So, 20 elves quit, leaving 60 - 20 = 40 elves.

Then, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. To find the number of elves left, we subtract 10 from 40:
40 - 10 = 30

Therefore, 30 elves are left.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total expenditure for the two months, we need to add the expenditure in May and June. 

The expenditure in May was $500. 
The expenditure in June was $60 less than May, so it is $500 - $60 = $440.

Now, we add the expenditures for May and June: $500 + $440 = $940.

The final numerical answer is: $940"
"To find the total number of tickets used, we need to calculate the total number of rides taken by Pam and Fred and then multiply it by the cost of each ride.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, so she took a total of 2 + 2 = 4 rides.
Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, so he took a total of 4 + 2 = 6 rides.

The total number of rides taken by both Pam and Fred is 4 + 6 = 10 rides.

Since each ride costs 6 tickets, the total number of tickets used is 10 * 6 = 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we need to first determine how many miles he walked on Tuesday. 

Since Walt walked 6 times as many miles on Tuesday as he did on Monday, and he walked 4 miles on Monday, we can calculate the miles walked on Tuesday by multiplying the miles walked on Monday by 6. 

Miles walked on Tuesday = 4 * 6 = 24 miles.

Now, we know that the total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. We already know the miles walked on Monday (4 miles) and Tuesday (24 miles). To find the miles walked on Wednesday, we subtract the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage.

Miles walked on Wednesday = Total mileage - (Miles walked on Monday + Miles walked on Tuesday)
= 41 - (4 + 24)
= 41 - 28
= 13 miles.

"To find out how many video games Bobby has, we first need to determine how many video games Brian has after losing 5. 

Brian initially had 20 video games but lost 5, so he has 20 - 5 = 15 video games.

Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian. To find out how many video games Bobby has, we multiply the number of video games Brian has by 3 and then subtract 5.

3 times the number of video games Brian has is 3 * 15 = 45.

5 fewer than 45 is 45 - 5 = 40.

Bobby has 40 video games.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the number of female Scottish unicorns, we first need to find the total number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands. Since one third of the 27 unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands = 27 * (1/3)
= 27 * 1/3
= 9

Now, we know that two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female. So, we can calculate the number of female Scottish unicorns as follows:

Number of female Scottish unicorns = 9 * (2/3)
= 9 * 2/3
= 6

"To find out how many questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate the total number of questions he was able to complete in each test and then subtract that from the total number of questions in each test.

For the first test, Mark had 8 hours to complete 75 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour. 

First, let's find out how many questions Mark could have completed in 8 hours: 
8 hours * 5 questions per hour = 40 questions

Since Mark had 75 questions in the first test, he left 75 - 40 = 35 questions incomplete.

For the second test, Mark had 6 hours to complete 100 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour.

Now, let's find out how many questions Mark could have completed in 6 hours: 
6 hours * 5 questions per hour = 30 questions

Since Mark had 100 questions in the second test, he left 100 - 30 = 70 questions incomplete.

To find the total number of questions Mark left incomplete, we add the incomplete questions from both tests: 
35 (from the first test) + 70 (from the second test) = 105 questions

"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine the total number of semi-automatic cars. We know that there are 20 cars in total, with 12 being automatic and 4 being manual. 

Total number of cars = 20
Automatic cars = 12
Manual cars = 4

To find the number of semi-automatic cars, we subtract the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars:
Semi-automatic cars = Total number of cars - (Automatic cars + Manual cars)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16
Semi-automatic cars = 4

Now, we can find the percentage of semi-automatic cars by dividing the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiplying by 100:
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 0.2 * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 20%

"To solve this problem, we can start by representing the number of baby bees as 'x'. Since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, the number of worker bees is 2x. 

We also know that there are twice as many babies as queens, so the number of queens is x/2. 

The total number of bees in the hive is 700, which is the sum of worker bees, baby bees, and queens. We can write this as an equation:

x + 2x + x/2 = 700

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + 4x + x = 1400

Combine like terms:

7x = 1400

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 200

Now that we know the number of baby bees, we can find the number of worker bees, which is 2x:

Worker bees = 2 * 200 = 400

The final answer is: 400"
"To find out how much money Jordan would earn in one week, we need to calculate the total hours he would work in a week and then multiply it by his hourly wage.

Since Jordan plays video games for 2 hours a day, if he spent that time working instead, he would work 2 hours a day. There are 7 days in a week, so the total hours he would work in a week is 2 hours/day * 7 days/week = 14 hours/week.

Jordan earns $10 an hour, so his weekly earnings would be 14 hours/week * $10/hour = $140/week.

The final answer is: $140"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of food items and non-food items separately and then add them together.

The food items are milk and eggs, which cost 2 dollars and 3 dollars respectively. So, the total cost of food items is 2 + 3 = 5 dollars.

The non-food items are light bulbs, cups, and roach traps, which cost 3 dollars, 3 dollars, and 4 dollars respectively. However, there is a 10% tax on these items. 

First, we need to find the total cost of non-food items before tax, which is 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars. 

Then, we calculate the tax, which is 10 * 0.1 = 1 dollar.

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of non-food items to get the total cost of non-food items, which is 10 + 1 = 11 dollars.

Finally, we add the cost of food items and non-food items to get the total cost, which is 5 + 11 = 16 dollars.

"To calculate the total profit, we first need to determine the total income and total expenses. 

Kim has 3 current clients and 5 potential clients, making a total of 8 clients. Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. 

Total bottles of bleach needed per week: 8 clients * 2 bottles/client = 16 bottles
Total packs of cloths needed per week: 8 clients * 1 pack/client = 8 packs

The cost of bleach per week: 16 bottles * $2/bottle = $32
The cost of cloths per week: 8 packs * $5/pack = $40

Total expenses per week: $32 (bleach) + $40 (cloths) = $72

Since Kim's total income per week is $92, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total expenses from the total income.

Profit per week = Total income - Total expenses
Profit per week = $92 - $72
Profit per week = $20

"To find out how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare and then multiply it by the number of hectares, and finally, we need to consider the number of harvests within a year.

First, let's find the total number of pineapples per hectare: 
100 pineapples/hectare * 10 hectares = 1000 pineapples

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, there are 4 harvests within a year (12 months / 3 months per harvest = 4 harvests).

Now, let's multiply the total number of pineapples per hectare by the number of harvests within a year:
1000 pineapples/hectare * 10 hectares * 4 harvests = 40000 pineapples

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of the bees that left in the first 6 hours return. So, 1/2 * 30 = 15 bees return.
3. The number of bees that have left but not returned is 30 - 15 = 15 bees.
4. In the next 6 hours, two times as many bees as the ones that left in the first 6 hours fly from the hive and leave. So, 2 * 30 = 60 bees leave.
5. The total number of bees that left but not returned is now 15 (from step 3) + 60 (from step 4) = 75 bees.
6. In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive. So, 75 bees return.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. We know that Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends. 

Let's represent the number of friends Dorothy has as 'x'. Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, we can represent Charlie's friends as 3x. We are given that Charlie has 12 friends, so we can set up the equation 3x = 12.

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3. This gives us x = 12 / 3, which simplifies to x = 4. 

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find the number of friends James has. We are told that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. Since Dorothy has 4 friends, we can represent James' friends as 4 * 4 = 16.

"To determine the time it takes for each person to get home, we need to calculate the distance in feet and then divide it by their respective speeds.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15,840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10,560 feet

Now, let's calculate the time it takes for each person to get home:

Steve's time: 15,840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: 10,560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 36 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve will be the winner. To find out how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to subtract the winner's time from the loser's time.

Waiting time = Tim's time - Steve's time = 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Dave ate 14 french fries initially.
2. The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 french fries.
   Now, the total amount eaten by Dave and the seagull is 14 + 7 = 21 french fries.
3. Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate a total of 3 * 3 = 9 french fries.
   Now, the total amount eaten is 21 + 9 = 30 french fries.
4. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries. Let's denote the initial amount of fries as 'x'. 
   After the seagull and pigeons ate, the remaining amount is x - 30.
   The raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries, which is (2/3) * (x - 30).
   The remaining amount after the raccoon is (x - 30) - (2/3) * (x - 30).
   Simplifying this, we get (1/3) * (x - 30).
5. After the raccoon, ants carried off a final french fry, leaving 5 behind. 
   So, the remaining amount after the raccoon is (1/3) * (x - 30) - 1 = 5.
   Now, we can solve for 'x'.
   (1/3) * (x - 30) = 6
   x - 30 = 18
   x = 48

"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the length of each type of baked good in feet and then add them together.

First, let's convert the length of each type of baked good from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

- Each roll is 4 inches long, which is 4/12 = 1/3 feet long.
- Each croissant is 6 inches long, which is 6/12 = 0.5 feet long.
- Each baguette is 2 feet long.

Now, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good:

- Rolls: 300 rolls * 1/3 feet per roll = 100 feet
- Croissants: 120 croissants * 0.5 feet per croissant = 60 feet
- Baguettes: 60 baguettes * 2 feet per baguette = 120 feet

Now, let's add the lengths together to find the total length of the baked goods:

"To find out who the winner is, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Since he's running back and forth, the total distance he covers is 2 times the length of the field for each run. So, the total distance Blake ran is 15 * 2 * 100 = 3000 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 2 * 100 = 200 yards. Then, she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 2 * 40 = 80 yards. She does this 34 times, so the total distance she covers is 34 * 80 = 2720 yards. 

To find the total distance Kelly ran, we add the initial 200 yards to the distance she ran to the 40-yard line and back: 2720 + 200 = 2920 yards.

Now, we compare the distances: Blake ran 3000 yards, and Kelly ran 2920 yards. Blake is the winner.

To find out how much farther the winner ran than the loser, we subtract the loser's distance from the winner's distance: 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the price increase every two months and add it to the original price. 

The original price of the bag of marbles is $20. 

After 2 months, the price increases by 20% of $20, which is 0.20 * $20 = $4. 
The new price after 2 months is $20 + $4 = $24.

After 4 months, the price increases by 20% of $24, which is 0.20 * $24 = $4.80.
The new price after 4 months is $24 + $4.80 = $28.80.

After 6 months, the price increases by 20% of $28.80, which is 0.20 * $28.80 = $5.76.
The new price after 6 months is $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56.

After 8 months, the price increases by 20% of $34.56, which is 0.20 * $34.56 = $6.912.
The new price after 8 months is $34.56 + $6.912 = $41.472.

After 10 months, the price increases by 20% of $41.472, which is 0.20 * $41.472 = $8.2944.
The new price after 10 months is $41.472 + $8.2944 = $49.7664.

"To find the total worth of all the toys, we need to calculate the cost of each type of toy and then add them together.

The doll costs as much as 3 action figures. Since an action figure costs $5, the doll costs 3 * $5 = $15.

One red car costs $4. Since there are 5 red cars, the total cost of the red cars is 5 * $4 = $20.

The total cost of the action figures is 3 * $5 = $15.

Now, we add the cost of the doll, the red cars, and the action figures together: $15 (doll) + $20 (red cars) + $15 (action figures) = $50.

The total worth of all the toys is $50.

"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the difference in income between hiring the accountant and doing the taxes herself.

If Jackie does the taxes herself, she'll lose $35/hour in missed income for 3 hours of freelance work. So, the total income lost is $35/hour * 3 hours = $105.

The cost of hiring the accountant is $90.

Now, let's calculate the difference in income: 
Income from doing taxes herself - Income from hiring the accountant = $105 - $90 = $15

So, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

The final answer is: $15"
"To find out how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the computer accessories and subtract that from her budget.

The total cost of the computer accessories is:
- Computer: €1090
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Total cost = €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102 = €1323

"To determine how many times Sandra has to babysit, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she needs for the Spanish flans and divide that by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting job.

First, let's calculate the total number of eggs needed for 15 Spanish flans. Since each flan requires 3 eggs, we multiply 15 by 3:

15 * 3 = 45 eggs

Now, we know Sandra gets 9 eggs per babysitting job. To find out how many times she needs to babysit, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysit:

45 eggs / 9 eggs per babysit = 5

So, Sandra has to babysit 5 times to get enough eggs for 15 Spanish flans.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's denote Brooke's current age as B and Seth's current age as S. We are given that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write an equation:

S = 2B

We are also given that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. This means that in 2 years, Seth's age will be S + 2 and Brooke's age will be B + 2. The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write another equation:

S + 2 + B + 2 = 28

Combine like terms:

S + B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

S + B = 24

Now we can substitute the first equation (S = 2B) into this equation:

2B + B = 24

Combine like terms:

3B = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B into the first equation:

S = 2B
S = 2(8)
S = 16

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much money Jimmy has, we need to first determine what ""twice the money Ethel has"" is. Since Ethel has $8, twice that amount would be 2 * 8 = 16.

"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of the hat, jacket, and pants separately and then add them together.

The cost of the hat is given as $25.

The cost of the jacket is three times the cost of the hat, so it is 3 * $25 = $75.

The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. To find the average, we add the costs of the hat and jacket and divide by 2. The average cost of the pants is ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50.

Now, we add the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants together to find the total cost of each uniform: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

"To find out how much Jessica pays in a year, we first need to calculate the increased minimum payments for each debt. 

The minimum payment for the student loans is $300, so 50% more than that would be 1.5 * $300 = $450. 

The minimum payment for the credit card is $200, so 50% more than that would be 1.5 * $200 = $300. 

The minimum payment for the mortgage is $500, so 50% more than that would be 1.5 * $500 = $750.

Now, we add up the increased minimum payments for each debt: $450 + $300 + $750 = $1500.

To find out how much Jessica pays in a year, we multiply the total monthly payment by 12: $1500 * 12 = $18,000.

"To find the total time it takes Billy to peel and cut all the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel one potato and multiply it by the total number of potatoes, then add the time it takes to cut one potato and multiply it by the total number of potatoes.

Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds = 5/60 minutes (converting seconds to minutes)

Total time to peel all potatoes: 60 potatoes * 1.5 minutes/potato = 90 minutes
Total time to cut all potatoes: 60 potatoes * (5/60) minutes/potato = 5 minutes

Now, we add the total time to peel and cut all potatoes: 90 minutes + 5 minutes = 95 minutes

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much they made in total from selling lemonade and then subtract the cost of sugar to find the cost of lemons.

Let's start by finding the total revenue from selling lemonade. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. So, the revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10.

Since they made $25 in profit, and we know that profit is revenue minus cost, we can set up an equation to find the total revenue. Let's denote the number of gallons as 'g'. The total revenue is $10g. The cost of lemons and sugar per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5. The total cost is $5g. The profit is $25, so we can write the equation as:

$10g - $5g = $25

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$5g = $25

Dividing both sides by $5, we get:

g = 5

Now that we know they made 5 gallons, we can find the total revenue:

Total revenue = $10g = $10 * 5 = $50

The cost of lemons and sugar per gallon is $5, so the total cost is $5g = $5 * 5 = $25. Since they made $25 in profit, the cost of sugar is $50 - $25 = $25. 

The cost of lemons is the total cost minus the cost of sugar, which is $25 - $25 = $0. However, this is not possible since they must have spent some money on lemons. This means that the initial assumption that the profit is $25 is incorrect. 

However, we can find the cost of lemons if we assume that the profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost. Let's denote the cost of lemons as 'L' and the cost of sugar as $2. The total cost is L + $2. The profit is $25, so we can write the equation as:

$10g - (L + $2) = $25

We already know that g = 5, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

$50 - (L + $2) = $25

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$48 - L = $25

Subtracting $48 from both sides, we get:

-L = -$23

Dividing both sides by -1, we get:

L = $23

The final answer is: $23"
"To find the number of Chinese participants, we first need to subtract the number of Japanese participants from the total number of participants. 

Total participants = 240

Chinese participants = 160

Now, we know that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants.

Number of girls on the Chinese team = Chinese participants - Number of boys
Number of girls on the Chinese team = 160 - 60
Number of girls on the Chinese team = 100

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations and calculate the expenses step by step.

1. Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent: 
   1/4 of 6000 = 6000 * 1/4 = 1500

2. He spends 1/3 on car fuel:
   1/3 of 6000 = 6000 * 1/3 = 2000

3. The remaining amount after rent and car fuel is:
   6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500

4. He donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity:
   Half of 2500 = 2500 * 1/2 = 1250

5. The remaining amount after donation is:
   2500 - 1250 = 1250

6. He gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$:
   Total given away = 200 + 700 = 900

7. The remaining amount after giving money to his daughter and wife is:

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of white carnations and then calculate the number of red roses.

Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. Since Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations, we can write an equation:

200 = 5x

To find the value of 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we know the number of white carnations is 40, we can find the number of red roses. Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, we can write another equation:

Red roses = 4x
Red roses = 4 * 40
Red roses = 160

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

M - 2 = (1/2) * 28 + 5

Simplifying the equation:

M - 2 = 14 + 5
M - 2 = 19
M = 21

Now that we know Mark's age, we can find Jean's age by adding 2 to Mark's age:

J = M + 2
J = 21 + 2
J = 23

"To find the total time for each team, we need to calculate the time for each runner and add them up.

The well-rounded team has each member running 400 meters in 55 seconds. Since there are four members, the total time for the well-rounded team is 4 * 55 = 220 seconds.

The less well-rounded team's first runner runs 400 meters in 60 seconds. The second runner is 3 seconds faster, so they run 400 meters in 60 - 3 = 57 seconds. The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so they run 400 meters in 57 - 3 = 54 seconds. The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so they run 400 meters in 54 - 3 = 51 seconds. The total time for the less well-rounded team is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 162 seconds.

To find the difference in time between the two teams, we subtract the time of the less well-rounded team from the time of the well-rounded team: 220 - 162 = 58 seconds.

The faster team will win by 58 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, and then find the difference between these two probabilities.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die is the probability of rolling a 4, 5, or 6. There are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, 6) out of 6 possible outcomes, so the probability is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5 or 50%.

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5, since there are 3 even numbers (2, 4, 6) out of 6 possible outcomes. Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 = 0.25 or 25%.

To find the difference in probability, we subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3: 50% - 25% = 25%.

"To calculate the total amount Mandy should pay, we need to calculate the interest for 3 months and add it to the initial amount.

The formula for simple interest is: Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

In this case, the principal is $100, the rate is 2% or 0.02, and the time is 3 months.

Interest = $100 * 0.02 * 3
Interest = $6

Now, we add the interest to the principal to get the total amount Mandy should pay:
Total Amount = Principal + Interest
Total Amount = $100 + $6
Total Amount = $106

The final answer is: $106"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total cost incurred by the trader, which includes the cost of buying the bags and the cost of transportation. 

Let's denote the number of bags as 'x'. The cost of buying 'x' bags at $20 per bag is 20x. The cost of transporting 'x' bags at $2 per bag is 2x. 

The total cost is the sum of these two costs: total_cost = 20x + 2x = 22x.

The trader sold the bags at $30 each, so the total revenue is 30x.

The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost: profit = total_revenue - total_cost = 30x - 22x = 8x.

We are given that the profit is $400, so we can set up the equation: 8x = 400.

To find the number of bags, we need to solve for x: x = 400 / 8 = 50.

"To find out how much each friend paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets, food, and rides, and then divide it by 3.

First, let's find the cost of the food. They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. Since they spent $20.25 on tickets, the cost of food is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.

The cost of the rides is 2 rides * $33 per ride = $66.

Now, let's add up the total cost: $20.25 (tickets) + $15.75 (food) + $66 (rides) = $102.

Since they split the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3: $102 / 3 = $34.

The final answer is: $34"
"To find out how many peaches John collects, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he collects peaches and then multiply it by the number of peaches he collects per minute.

Since John collects peaches for 3 hours, we need to convert the hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Now, we know John collects 2 peaches per minute. To find the total number of peaches, we multiply the total minutes by the peaches collected per minute:

180 minutes * 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches

The final answer is: 360"
"To find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ducks needs per day, we first need to calculate the total pounds of insects they need per week. Since there are ten ducks and each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week, we multiply the number of ducks by the pounds of insects each duck needs per week.

10 ducks * 3.5 pounds/duck/week = 35 pounds/week

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of insects they need per day. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total pounds of insects needed per week by 7.

35 pounds/week / 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day

So, the flock of ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day to survive.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net change in the number of trees Tom has each year. 

Tom plants 10 trees a year and chops down 2 trees a year, so the net change is 10 - 2 = 8 trees per year.

Since Tom starts with 50 trees, we need to calculate the total number of trees after 10 years. 

In 10 years, the net change is 8 * 10 = 80 trees. So, the total number of trees after 10 years is 50 + 80 = 130 trees.

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find the number of trees that die, we multiply 130 by 0.3: 130 * 0.3 = 39 trees.

Now, we subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees: 130 - 39 = 91 trees.

The final answer is: 91"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there were 18 pink plastic flamingos on Sue's front yard.

On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. They painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back out on Sue's front yard. So, now there are 6 white flamingos and 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos.

On Sunday morning, the neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection. Now, there are 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos.

The total number of flamingos on Sue's front yard is 30 pink + 6 white = 36 flamingos.

To find out how many more pink plastic flamingos were out than white plastic flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find out how much change Violetta will get, we first need to determine how many crayons she can buy with $20. Since one crayon costs $2, we can divide the total amount she has ($20) by the cost of one crayon ($2).

20 / 2 = 10

This means Violetta can buy 10 crayons. However, she needs 5 different colors, and it's not specified that she can buy multiple crayons of the same color. Therefore, we can assume she will buy one crayon of each color.

Since she can buy 10 crayons and she needs 5, the number of crayons she can buy is equal to the number of colors she needs.

Now, to find out how much change she will get, we need to calculate the total cost of the crayons she buys. Since she buys 5 crayons at $2 each, the total cost is:

5 * 2 = 10

To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount she has:

20 - 10 = 10

So, Violetta will get $10 in change.

"To find the cost of a pen, we need to add the cost of a pencil and an eraser, since a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined. 

Cost of a pencil: $1.20
Cost of an eraser: $0.30
Cost of a pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser
Cost of a pen = $1.20 + $0.30
Cost of a pen = $1.50

Now, we need to find the cost of 8 pens. 

Cost of 8 pens = Cost of a pen * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $1.50 * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $12.00

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we first need to calculate the total pounds of carrots that will be used by the restaurants. 

Each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants. 

Total pounds of carrots used = Number of restaurants * Pounds per restaurant
Total pounds of carrots used = 40 * 2
Total pounds of carrots used = 80 pounds

Now, we subtract the total pounds of carrots used from the total pounds of carrots available to find out how many pounds will not be used.

Pounds of carrots not used = Total pounds of carrots - Total pounds of carrots used
Pounds of carrots not used = 200 - 80
Pounds of carrots not used = 120

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Initially, Elaine had 20 Pokémon cards.

In the first month, she collected three times the number of cards she initially had: 3 * 20 = 60 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month: 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months: (60 + 40) * 2 = 200 cards.

Now, let's add up the total number of cards Elaine has: 20 (initial cards) + 60 (first month) + 40 (second month) + 200 (third month) = 320 cards.

"Let's break down the information given. Mark edits 1000 sentences each week, and Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence. Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, he also edits 1000 sentences for Publisher B.

We know that Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays 2 * 5 cents = 10 cents per sentence.

Mark's total earnings from Publisher A are 1000 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 5000 cents.

Mark's total earnings from Publisher B are 1000 sentences * 10 cents/sentence = 10000 cents.

To find Mark's total weekly earnings, we add his earnings from both publishers: 5000 cents + 10000 cents = 15000 cents.

"To calculate John's total earnings for the year, we need to consider both the one-time monetary reward and the 5% raise in salary.

First, let's calculate the total amount John earns from his weekly salary for the year. Since he makes $2000 per week and works every week of the year (52 weeks), his total earnings from his salary would be:

2000 * 52 = 104,000

Now, let's calculate the 5% raise in salary. A 5% raise on $2000 is:

2000 * 0.05 = 100

So, his new weekly salary would be:

2000 + 100 = 2100

Now, let's calculate his total earnings from his new salary for the year:

2100 * 52 = 109,200

Adding the one-time monetary reward of $5000 to his total earnings from his salary, we get:

109,200 + 5000 = 114,200

Therefore, John's total earnings for the year would be $114,200.

"To find the total number of barrels of wine produced per year, we need to calculate the total number of tons of grapes produced per year and then multiply it by the number of barrels of wine each ton can make.

First, let's find the total number of tons of grapes produced per year. Since each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year and there are 10 acres, we multiply 5 tons/acre by 10 acres:

5 tons/acre * 10 acres = 50 tons

Next, we know that each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine. So, we multiply the total number of tons of grapes by 2:

50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels

Therefore, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year.

"To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the slices used for the sandwiches, omelets, and the macaroni and cheese dish separately and then add them together.

For the sandwiches, Carl ate 7 days' worth of sandwiches (since he ate one every day for a week) with 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. So, the total slices used for sandwiches = 7 * 2 = 14.

For the omelets, Carl ate 3 days' worth of omelets with one more slice per omelet than per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 3 slices per omelet. So, the total slices used for omelets = 3 * 3 = 9.

For the macaroni and cheese dish, Carl used 8 slices of cheese.

Now, let's add the slices used for sandwiches, omelets, and the macaroni and cheese dish together: 14 (sandwiches) + 9 (omelets) + 8 (macaroni and cheese) = 31.

"To find the total number of pens Janet has now, we need to calculate the number of blue and red pens she bought and add them to the initial number of pens she had.

Janet initially had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, so she had a total of 22 + 10 = 32 pens.

Each bag of blue pens contains 9 pens, and she bought 6 bags, so she bought 6 * 9 = 54 blue pens.

Each bag of red pens contains 6 pens, and she bought 2 bags, so she bought 2 * 6 = 12 red pens.

Now, let's add the number of blue and red pens she bought to the initial number of pens she had: 32 (initial pens) + 54 (blue pens) + 12 (red pens) = 98 pens.

"To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we first need to find the total score she needs for the semester. Since there are six tests and she wants an average of 93, we multiply the desired average by the number of tests:

6 tests * 93 average = 558 total score

Since Brinley can remove the lowest score, we need to find the lowest of the five scores she already has. The scores are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. The lowest score is 71.

Now, we subtract the lowest score from the total score to find the total of the remaining four scores:

558 total score - 71 lowest score = 487 remaining total

We add the remaining four scores Brinley has to the remaining total:

89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367

Now, we subtract the sum of the four scores from the remaining total to find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test:

We are also given that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, the total cost of twenty dozen cups is $36,000 - $1200 = $34,800.

Since there are 24 cups in a dozen, twenty dozen cups will be 20 * 24 = 480 cups.

To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of twenty dozen cups by the number of cups: $34,800 / 480 = $72.50.

The final answer is: $72.50"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy and the total amount of money she has earned so far. 

The total cost of the items is the cost of the jacket plus the cost of 2 pairs of shoes: 
$30 (jacket) + 2 * $20 (shoes) = $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved before she started babysitting. She earns $5 each time she babysits the neighbor's kids, so the total amount she has earned from babysitting is 4 * $5 = $20. 

The total amount of money Sara has is the sum of the money she already had and the money she earned from babysitting: 
$10 (initial savings) + $20 (babysitting earnings) = $30.

To find out how much more money Sara needs, we subtract the total amount she has from the total cost of the items: 
$70 (total cost) - $30 (total amount she has) = $40.

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she must mow the lawn to earn the remaining amount, we divide the remaining amount by the amount she earns per lawn mowing: 
$40 (remaining amount) / $4 (lawn mowing earnings) = 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's denote the number of red chickens as R and the number of white chickens as W. We know that W = R + 2.

We also know that the total number of eggs collected is 42. Since red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and white chickens produce 5 eggs a day, we can set up the following equation:

3R + 5W = 42

Substituting W = R + 2 into the equation, we get:

3R + 5(R + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3R + 5R + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8R + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8R = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

R = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the time Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park since he walks around the edge. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the dimensions of the park, l = 6 miles and w = 1.5 miles, we can substitute these values into the formula:

P = 2(6 + 1.5)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles/hour, we can find the time he spends walking by dividing the perimeter by his speed:

Time = Perimeter / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of customers Sloane counted on the first day. Let's denote the number of customers on the first day as x.

On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so the number of customers on the second day is x + 50.

The total number of customers by the third day was 500, which is the sum of the customers from the first two days and the customers on the third day. Since the number of customers on the third day is the same as the number on the second day (because the problem doesn't mention any change in the number of customers on the third day), we can write the equation:

x + (x + 50) + (x + 50) = 500

Combine like terms:

2x + 100 = 500

Subtract 100 from both sides:

2x = 400

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 200

So, Sloane counted 200 customers on the first day. 

Now, we need to find the number of customers she counted on the third day. Since the number of customers on the third day is the same as the number on the second day, we can use the expression x + 50:

x + 50 = 200 + 50
= 250

The final answer is: 250"
"Let's denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as 'x' gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the initial amount of water in the big pool is 2x gallons.

Since both pools leak at 4 gallons/minute, the rate of water loss for both pools is 8 gallons/minute. 

In 4 minutes, the total water lost from both pools is 8 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 32 gallons.

The big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as 'y'. Then, the current amount of water in the big pool is 4y.

We can set up the equation based on the initial and current water levels:

Initial water in the big pool - Initial water in the small pool = Current water in the big pool - Current water in the small pool - Total water lost
2x - x = 4y - y - 32
x = 3y - 32

Since the initial amount of water in the big pool is twice as much as the small pool, we can also set up another equation:
2x = 4y - 32 (water lost from the big pool in 4 minutes)

Substituting x from the first equation into the second equation:
2(3y - 32) = 4y - 32
6y - 64 = 4y - 32
2y = 32
y = 16

Now that we have the current amount of water in the small pool (y), we can find the initial amount of water in the small pool (x):
x = 3y - 32
x = 3(16) - 32
x = 48 - 32
x = 16

However, this is the initial amount of water in the small pool. We need to find the current amount of water in the small pool. Since the small pool lost 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons in 4 minutes, the current amount of water in the small pool is:
y = x - 16
y = 16 - 16
y = 0

The final answer is: 0"
"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy and then divide that by her hourly wage.

The total cost of the items is the cost of the shoes plus the cost of the belt: $320.00 + $32.00 = $352.00.

Now, we divide the total cost by Lori's hourly wage: $352.00 ÷ $8.00 = 44 hours.

The final answer is: 44"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Janeth will pay in 12 months and then subtract that from the initial amount borrowed plus the additional 10% interest.

First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth will pay in 12 months:

$165/month * 12 months = $1980

Now, let's calculate the total amount Janeth borrowed with the additional 10% interest:

$2000 + (10% of $2000) = $2000 + $200 = $2200

Now, let's subtract the total amount Janeth will pay from the total amount she borrowed with interest:

$2200 - $1980 = $220

So, Janeth's remaining balance by then will be $220.

The final answer is: $220"
"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to determine the number of dahlias and add it to the number of roses.

We know there are 4 roses in the vase. We also know there are 7 more dahlias than roses. 

To find the number of dahlias, we add 7 to the number of roses: 
4 (roses) + 7 = 11 dahlias

Now, we add the number of roses and dahlias to find the total number of flowers in the vase:
4 (roses) + 11 (dahlias) = 15

"To find the average age of the three in three years, we first need to find their current ages and then add 3 to each age. 

Given that Harriet is 21 years old, and she is half the age of Zack, we can find Zack's age by multiplying Harriet's age by 2. 

Zack's age = 2 * Harriet's age = 2 * 21 = 42

Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, so we can find Adrian's age by multiplying Harriet's age by 3.

Adrian's age = 3 * Harriet's age = 3 * 21 = 63

Now, we have the current ages of the three: Harriet (21), Zack (42), and Adrian (63). To find their ages in three years, we add 3 to each age.

Harriet's age in 3 years = 21 + 3 = 24
Zack's age in 3 years = 42 + 3 = 45
Adrian's age in 3 years = 63 + 3 = 66

To find the average age, we add their ages and divide by 3.

Average age = (24 + 45 + 66) / 3
Average age = 135 / 3
Average age = 45

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Yuri and Brianna. 

Naomi scored 68 points. 
Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. 
Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. 
Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. 
Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

The total points scored by the four students is 251. 
We know that Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna scored 68, 44, and 85 points respectively. 
So, the total points scored by these three students is 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points.

To find out how many points Jojo scored, we subtract the total points scored by the other three students from the total points scored by all four students. 
Jojo scored 251 - 197 = 54 points.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much water is left in the tank after Celine used 90 liters. 

Initial water in the tank = 120 liters
Water used by Celine = 90 liters
Water left in the tank = Initial water - Water used
Water left in the tank = 120 - 90
Water left in the tank = 30 liters

Now, Celine collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left. 
Rainwater collected = 2 * Water left in the tank
Rainwater collected = 2 * 30
Rainwater collected = 60 liters

Total water in the tank now = Water left in the tank + Rainwater collected
Total water in the tank now = 30 + 60
Total water in the tank now = 90 liters

"To find the total number of flowers Andy plants, we need to calculate the number of petunias first. Since he plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, we subtract 40 from the number of geraniums.

Number of geraniums: 90
Number of petunias = Number of geraniums - 40
Number of petunias = 90 - 40
Number of petunias = 50

Now, we add the number of geraniums and petunias to find the total number of flowers.

Total flowers = Number of geraniums + Number of petunias
Total flowers = 90 + 50
Total flowers = 140

"To find the total amount spent on advertising for the two years, we need to calculate the amount spent in the second year first. 

The company spent a third of $15000 in the second year. To find a third of $15000, we divide $15000 by 3.

$15000 / 3 = $5000

Now, we add the amount spent in the first year to the amount spent in the second year to find the total amount spent on advertising for the two years.

$15000 + $5000 = $20000

The total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is $20000."

"To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we first need to determine the total number of cards James has after the changes. Initially, he has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards. 

After losing 8 water type cards, he has 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards. 

Then, he buys 14 grass type cards, so he now has 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards.

The total number of cards James has is 30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96 cards.

The probability of picking a water type card is the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards, which is 32/96.

To find the percentage, we multiply by 100: (32/96) * 100 = 33.333...%.

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance of picking a water type card is 33%."
"To find out how much Chad still owes, we need to calculate the total cost of his meal and then subtract the gift card amount.

The base burrito costs $6.50. 
He adds extra meat for $2.00, extra cheese for $1.00, avocado for $1.00, and 2 sauces for $0.25 each, which is 2 * $0.25 = $0.50. 
So, the total cost of the add-ons is $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $4.50.
The total cost of the meal before the upgrade is $6.50 + $4.50 = $11.00.
He upgrades his meal for an extra $3.00, so the new total is $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the combined rate at which Kalinda and her mom can add pieces to the puzzle. 

Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute. Her mom can add half as many pieces per minute, which is 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute.

The combined rate is 4 (Kalinda's rate) + 2 (her mom's rate) = 6 pieces per minute.

Since there are 360 pieces in the puzzle, we need to divide the total number of pieces by the combined rate to find the time it will take to complete the puzzle.

Time = Total pieces / Combined rate
Time = 360 / 6
Time = 60 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

Time in hours = 60 / 60
Time in hours = 1 hour

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, there were 120 baby watermelons. After two months, 30% of them were ready for harvest. 

30% of 120 is 0.3 * 120 = 36. So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest after two months.

This means that 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons were not ready for harvest after two months.

When Ashlyn came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 melons were ready for harvest. 

3/4 of 84 is (3/4) * 84 = 63. So, 63 watermelons were ready for harvest after two weeks.

This means that 84 - 63 = 21 watermelons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks.

"To find the number of penguins left sunbathing, we need to determine how many penguins are not in the ocean or the cave. 

First, let's find out how many penguins jump in the ocean. Since one-third of the penguins jump in, we can calculate this by dividing the total number of penguins (36) by 3.

36 / 3 = 12 penguins jump in the ocean.

Next, let's find out how many penguins go inside the cave. Again, one-third of the penguins go inside, so we divide the total number of penguins (36) by 3.

36 / 3 = 12 penguins go inside the cave.

Now, we need to find the total number of penguins that are either in the ocean or the cave. We add the number of penguins in the ocean and the number of penguins in the cave.

12 (ocean) + 12 (cave) = 24 penguins

Since there are 36 penguins in total, we subtract the number of penguins in the ocean and the cave from the total to find the number of penguins left sunbathing.

36 (total) - 24 (ocean and cave) = 12 penguins

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many tomatoes Steve eats in a week and then divide that by the number of tomatoes a vine can produce per week.

Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, he eats 6 * 7 = 42 tomatoes per week.

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats half as much as Steve, which is 42 / 2 = 21 tomatoes per week.

The total number of tomatoes they eat per week is 42 (Steve) + 21 (girlfriend) = 63 tomatoes per week.

Since each vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week, the number of vines needed is 63 / 3 = 21 vines.

"To determine the number of pizzas John needs to order, we need to calculate the total number of slices required and then divide that by the number of slices per pizza.

First, let's find the total number of slices required. Since there are 20 friends and each friend needs 4 slices, the total number of slices required is:
20 friends * 4 slices per friend = 80 slices

Since pizzas are sold in 8 slices per pizza, we need to divide the total number of slices required by the number of slices per pizza:
80 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 10 pizzas

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas to ensure each of his 20 friends gets 4 slices.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Ram starts with 25 pens. He uses 5 pens to make 1 new pen, so he gets 1 new pen. Now, he has 25 - 5 = 20 pens left. He uses 5 of the remaining 20 pens to make 1 new pen, so he gets 1 new pen. Now, he has 20 - 5 = 15 pens left. He continues this process until he has used up all the pens.

To find the total number of new pens he gets, we can see a pattern. In each step, he gets 1 new pen and uses 5 pens. So, the number of new pens he gets is equal to the number of times he can divide 25 by 5, which is 5. 

However, this is not the total number of pens he has. We also need to add the initial 25 pens. 

So, the total number of pens Ram gets is 25 (initial pens) + 5 (new pens) = 30.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of students who went out through exit A, then the number of students remaining, and finally, the number of students who went out through exit C.

First, let's find the number of students who went out through exit A. 30% of 1000 students went out through exit A. 

30% of 1000 = 0.3 * 1000 = 300 students.

Now, we need to find the number of students remaining after 300 students went out through exit A. 

Remaining students = Total students - Students who went out through exit A

"To find out how many hours Mike spends writing a week, we need to calculate the total number of letters he writes and then multiply it by the time it takes him to write one page.

First, let's find out how many letters Mike writes in a week. He has 3 pen pals left, and each of them sends 2 letters a week. So, the total number of letters he receives is 3 * 2 = 6 letters.

Since he responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters a week. 

Each letter is 5 pages long, so the total number of pages he writes in a week is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

It takes Mike 6 minutes to write one page, so the total time he spends writing in a week is 30 * 6 = 180 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60. So, 180 minutes is equal to 180 / 60 = 3 hours.

Therefore, Mike spends 3 hours writing a week.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Griffin had 24 french fries.

Kyle took 5 fries from Griffin. So, Griffin was left with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.

Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, which means Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Now, Griffin has 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

Ginger gave Griffin a certain number of fries, let's call it 'x'. After this, Griffin had 9 + x fries.

Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had taken, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. Now, Griffin has 9 + x - 2 = 7 + x fries.

We are given that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation 7 + x = 27.

To find the value of 'x', we subtract 7 from both sides of the equation: x = 27 - 7 = 20.

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

The final answer is: 20"

28 = 2(2x)

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 2:

14 = 2x

Now, divide both sides by 2:

7 = x

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

Total hours worked per week = 6 hours/day * 4 days/week = 24 hours/week
Total hours worked in 5 weeks = 24 hours/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours

The makeup artist charges $250 per hour. 

Total cost before discount = 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000

After the movie is done, the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount. 

Discount amount = 10% of $30,000 = 0.1 * $30,000 = $3,000

Total amount Jean paid = Total cost before discount - Discount amount
= $30,000 - $3,000
= $27,000

The final answer is: $27,000"
"To find out how much each person paid, we need to first calculate the total cost of the party supplies. 

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the cake, presents, decorations, invitations, and goodie bags. 

Total cost = $12 (cake) + $43 (presents) + $15 (decorations) + $4 (invitations) + $22 (goodie bags)
Total cost = $96

Since Isabelle split the cost evenly with her two parents, there are a total of 3 people sharing the cost. 

To find out how much each person paid, we divide the total cost by 3.

$96 ÷ 3 = $32

Each person paid $32."
"To find out how much the chef spent, we need to calculate the total weight of the onions and then multiply it by the cost per pound.

The chef bought 4 bags of onions, and each bag weighs 50 pounds. So, the total weight of the onions is:
4 bags * 50 pounds/bag = 200 pounds

Since a pound of onions costs $1.50, the total cost is:
200 pounds * $1.50/pound = $300

The chef spent $300."
"To find out how many calories Sue consumed, we first need to determine how many cookies she ate. 

On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 5 cookies, so Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday.

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 13 cookies, so Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.

In total, Sue ate 20 + 26 = 46 cookies. 

Her sister ate 5 + 13 = 18 cookies.

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, Sue consumed 46 * 200 = 9200 calories, and her sister consumed 18 * 200 = 3600 calories.

The difference in calories consumed is 9200 - 3600 = 5600."
"To find the number of boys in the third class, we first need to determine the total number of girls in the school. Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, and there are 3 classes with 20 students each, the total number of students in the school is 3 * 20 = 60.

Given that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls, the total number of girls in the school is 15 + 12 = 27. 

Since the school is 50% girls, the total number of boys in the school is also 60 - 27 = 33.

Now, we need to find the number of girls in the third class. Since the school is 50% girls, the third class should also have 50% girls. The total number of students in the third class is 20, so the number of girls in the third class is 20 * 0.5 = 10.

To find the number of boys in the third class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in the third class: 20 - 10 = 10.

So, the current number of apps on Travis's tablet is 70.

The final answer is: 70"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how many cougars Rick killed today. We know he killed 15 cougars last night and three fewer cougars today. So, the number of cougars he killed today is 15 - 3 = 12.

Now, we know that Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars today. Since he killed 12 cougars today, he killed 3 * 12 = 36 wolves today.

We already know that Rick killed 10 wolves last night. So, the total number of wolves he killed is 10 + 36 = 46.

We also know that Rick killed 15 cougars last night and 12 cougars today. So, the total number of cougars he killed is 15 + 12 = 27.

To find the total number of animals Rick killed, we add the total number of wolves and cougars: 46 (wolves) + 27 (cougars) = 73.

"To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we first need to determine how many times Anne went down the slide. Since Anne went down 30% less than Mitchel, we need to calculate 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30.

30% of 30 is 0.3 x 30 = 9. 

So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Since Robert went down 4 times as much as Anne, we multiply the number of times Anne went down by 4.

21 x 4 = 84

Robert went down the water slide 84 times.

84"
"To find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we first need to determine how many cows Mr. Sylas added to each stall. 

Initially, each stall had 20 cows. Mr. Sylas bought 40 cows and divided them equally among the 10 stalls. 

To find out how many cows he added to each stall, we divide the total number of new cows (40) by the number of stalls (10). 

40 / 10 = 4

So, Mr. Sylas added 4 cows to each stall. 

Now, we need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. We know that each stall has 20 original cows and 4 new cows. 

The total number of cows in each stall is 20 + 4 = 24.

To find the total number of cows in 8 stalls, we multiply the number of cows in one stall by 8.

24 * 8 = 192

"To find the total weight of the redwood tree, we first need to calculate the total number of 10-foot sections. 

The redwood tree is 200 feet tall, so we divide 200 by 10 to get the total number of sections: 200 / 10 = 20 sections.

Each section weighs 400 pounds, so we multiply the number of sections by the weight per section: 20 * 400 = 8000 pounds.

Now, we need to find 30% of the total weight that termites ate. To do this, we multiply the total weight by 0.3 (which is the decimal equivalent of 30%): 8000 * 0.3 = 2400 pounds.

To find the remaining weight of the redwood, we subtract the weight eaten by termites from the total weight: 8000 - 2400 = 5600 pounds.

The final answer is: 5600"

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, and Andrea has 52 apples. So, Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.
2. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.
3. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.
4. To find the total number of fruits, we need to add the number of apples and bananas that both Andrea and Jamal have. 
   Total fruits = (Andrea's apples + Jamal's apples + Andrea's bananas + Jamal's bananas)
   Total fruits = (52 + 44 + 24 + 48)
   Total fruits = 168

"To determine the total amount of flour needed, we need to calculate the amount of flour required for each day and then add them together.

For today, Carla is making 36 cookies. Since two cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many dozens are in 36 cookies. 

36 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 3 dozen cookies

Since 2 cups of flour are needed for 1 dozen cookies, we multiply the number of dozens by 2 to find the total amount of flour needed for today.

3 dozen cookies * 2 cups per dozen = 6 cups of flour for today

For tomorrow, Carla is making 30 cookies. Again, we need to find out how many dozens are in 30 cookies.

30 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 2.5 dozen cookies

Since 2 cups of flour are needed for 1 dozen cookies, we multiply the number of dozens by 2 to find the total amount of flour needed for tomorrow.

2.5 dozen cookies * 2 cups per dozen = 5 cups of flour for tomorrow

Now, we add the amount of flour needed for both days to find the total amount of flour needed.

6 cups of flour for today + 5 cups of flour for tomorrow = 11 cups of flour

"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two-thirds of the pennies in the cup, we need to first calculate two-thirds of 9,300 pennies.

Two-thirds of 9,300 can be calculated as (2/3) * 9,300.

To find the value of two-thirds of 9,300, we can multiply 9,300 by 2 and then divide by 3.

First, multiply 9,300 by 2: 9,300 * 2 = 18,600

Then, divide 18,600 by 3: 18,600 / 3 = 6,200

Since each penny is worth $0.01, we can multiply 6,200 by 0.01 to find the total dollar amount.

6,200 * 0.01 = $62.00

3. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has.
   First, we find twice the number of trees Ferdinand has: 2 * 3 = 6.
   Then, we add 5 to that: 6 + 5 = 11.
   So, Harry has 11 trees.

Now, we need to find the difference in the number of trees between Harry's yard and Ferdinand's yard.
Harry has 11 trees, and Ferdinand has 3 trees.
The difference is 11 - 3 = 8.

"To find the total price of the house, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and the transfer fee, then add them to the selling price.

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, which is 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500.

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price, which is 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000.

The total price of the house is the sum of the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee: $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

To find out how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we subtract her budget from the total price: $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know it takes 20 minutes for the oil to heat up to 300 degrees. Then, it takes 40% longer to heat up to 400 degrees. 

40% of 20 minutes is 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes. So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat up to 400 degrees.

After warming the oil, it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil. It took 28 minutes to warm up the oil, so it will take 28 - 5 = 23 minutes to cook.

The total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is the sum of the time it took to warm up the oil and the time it took to cook. 

Total time = 28 minutes (to warm up the oil) + 23 minutes (to cook) = 51 minutes.

"To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we first need to determine the total number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette. 

The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches, which is 900 * 0.1 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so it takes 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

The total number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette is 90 + 180 = 270 stitches.

Since the whole sweater is a 1800-stitch project, the total number of stitches used for the body and the sleeves is 1800 - 270 = 1530 stitches.

The body takes 900 stitches, so the sleeves take 1530 - 900 = 630 stitches in total.

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam: R = 6S
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam: (R + 9) = 3(S + 9)

We can substitute the first equation into the second one to solve for S:

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the equation:

6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtract 3S from both sides:

Number of cobras: 40
Number of spots per cobra: 70
Total spots on cobras: 40 * 70 = 2800

Since the mambas have half the number of spots as the cobras, we can find the number of spots per mamba by dividing the number of spots per cobra by 2.

Number of spots per mamba: 70 / 2 = 35

Now, we can find the total number of spots on the mambas by multiplying the number of mambas by the number of spots per mamba.

Number of mambas: 60
Number of spots per mamba: 35
Total spots on mambas: 60 * 35 = 2100

To find the total number of spots on all the snakes, we add the total spots on the cobras and the mambas.

Total spots on all snakes: 2800 + 2100 = 4900

"To find the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace, we first need to calculate the total space occupied by the topaz gemstones and then subtract that from the total length of the necklace. 

Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and there are 8 of them, so the total space occupied by the gemstones is 8 inches. 

The remaining space for the sterling silver beads is 25 inches (total length of the necklace) - 8 inches (space occupied by gemstones) = 17 inches.

Each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long, so the number of beads that can fit in 17 inches is 17 / 0.25 = 68.

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

The total number of stars in the 6-star rows is 2 * 6 = 12 stars.

Now, we can find the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows: 24 + 12 = 36 stars.

Since the flag has 76 stars in total, the number of stars in the 5-star rows can be found by subtracting the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows from the total number of stars: 76 - 36 = 40 stars.

Since each 5-star row has 5 stars, we can find the number of 5-star rows by dividing the total number of stars in the 5-star rows by 5: 40 / 5 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the number of trucks needed, we need to calculate the total weight of the flagstones and divide it by the weight capacity of each truck.

First, let's find the total weight of the flagstones: 
80 flagstones * 75 pounds per flagstone = 6000 pounds

Now, let's divide the total weight by the weight capacity of each truck:
6000 pounds / 2000 pounds per truck = 3

So, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

The final answer is: 3"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the speed of the car in the slow lane. Since it's traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, we can calculate it as follows:

Speed of the car in the fast lane = 60 miles/hour
Speed of the car in the slow lane = 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour

Now, we know the distance covered by both cars is the same, which is 480 miles. We can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

For the car in the fast lane:
Time = 480 miles / 60 miles/hour = 8 hours

Since the car in the slow lane travels at half the speed, it will take twice the time to cover the same distance. Therefore, the time taken by the car in the slow lane is:

Time = 8 hours * 2 = 16 hours

The final answer is: 16"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem.

Ali has 22 medals. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.

Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

It's given that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have. Let's represent the total number of medals given out as 'x'. Then, we can write the equation:

39 = x / 10

To solve for 'x', we multiply both sides of the equation by 10:

x = 39 * 10
x = 390

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is 390.

The final answer is: 390"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of chocolate bars available. Since each packet contains 5 chocolate bars and there are 8 packets, the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

We know that each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, and there are 4 adults. So, the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 * 6 = 24.

Now, we need to find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children. This can be calculated by subtracting the number of chocolate bars given to adults from the total number of chocolate bars: 40 - 24 = 16.

Since there are 8 children, and the remaining chocolate bars are to be shared equally among them, we divide the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children: 16 / 8 = 2.

Therefore, each child will get 2 chocolate bars.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much Susan earns, we need to calculate the total time she works and then multiply it by her hourly wage.

First, let's find the total time she works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total time.

3 hours (working time) - 0.5 hours (pause time) = 2.5 hours

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to convert the total working time to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Now, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes:

150 minutes / 10 minutes/interval = 15 intervals

Since she earns $5 per interval, we multiply the number of intervals by her earnings per interval:

15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

So, Susan earns $75 for the online task.

The final answer is: $75"
"To find the total points of all three players after the extra points are distributed, we first need to calculate their points after the fourth round.

Initially, Mike has 21 points. 
Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

After the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. 
Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point. Now, Mike has 21 + 1 = 22 points.
Jim has 18 points, so he doesn't get an extra point. Jim still has 18 points.
Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point. Now, Tony has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

Now, let's calculate the total points of all three players after the extra points are distributed:
Mike has 22 points, Jim has 18 points, and Tony has 43 points.
Total points = 22 + 18 + 43 = 83

The final answer is: 83"
"To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we first need to determine how many oranges the sons washed. The oldest son is 8 years old, and he washes 8 oranges. The youngest son is half as old as the oldest, so he is 8 / 2 = 4 years old. He washes 4 oranges.

In total, the sons wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges. Will bought 15 oranges, so to find out how many are left unwashed, we subtract the number of oranges washed from the total number of oranges: 15 - 12 = 3.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the total count of activities, we need to calculate the number of exercises done on each day and then add them together.

On the first day, Darren did:
- 100 pushups
- 50 squats
- 20 dumbbell presses

Total exercises on the first day = 100 + 50 + 20 = 170

On the second day, Darren did:
- 20 more pushups than the first day, so 100 + 20 = 120 pushups
- 10 fewer squats than the first day, so 50 - 10 = 40 squats
- Doubled the number of dumbbell presses, so 20 * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses

Total exercises on the second day = 120 + 40 + 40 = 200

Total exercises in two days = 170 + 200 = 370

The final answer is: 370"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day and then divide the total amount of rice available by this daily consumption.

First, let's calculate the daily consumption of rice. Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day (lunch and dinner). So, the daily consumption per person is 0.2 kg/meal * 2 meals = 0.4 kg/day.

Since there are 5 members in the household who eat rice every lunch and dinner, the total daily consumption is 0.4 kg/day * 5 people = 2 kg/day.

Now, let's calculate how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last. We can do this by dividing the total amount of rice available (42 kg) by the daily consumption (2 kg/day).

42 kg / 2 kg/day = 21 days

Since we want to know how many weeks the rice will last, we need to convert the number of days to weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so:

21 days / 7 days/week = 3 weeks

Therefore, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks. 

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we first need to calculate the total number of crates he sold in the week. 

Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he sold bread for 5 days. 

He sold 20 crates over the weekend, which is 2 days. 
He sold 15 crates on Tuesday, 12 crates on Wednesday, and 18 crates on Thursday.

Total crates sold = 20 (weekend) + 15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday) = 65 crates

Since Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, he had 5 working days. His target for the week is 120 crates. 

To find the target for 5 working days, we need to calculate the daily target: 
Daily target = 120 / 7 = 17.14 (approximately)

Since we can't sell a fraction of a crate, we'll consider the daily target as 17 crates per day for 5 working days. 

Total target for 5 working days = 17 * 5 = 85 crates

Now, let's find the difference between the total target and the total crates sold:
Difference = Total target - Total crates sold = 85 - 65 = 20 crates

Sam was 20 crates off from his target for the week.

"To find the total cost of the desk, we need to determine the last bid made by Carmen. 

Since there are 3 other people who bid once, and Carmen bids after each of them, there are a total of 4 people who bid once. The bids rise by $50 each time, so we need to find the total number of bids made.

Let's denote the number of bids as 'n'. The total number of people who bid is 4, and each person bids once, so n = 4.

The first bid is $200, and each subsequent bid is $50 more than the previous one. We can represent the last bid as 200 + 50(n-1), since there are n-1 bids after the first one.

Now, we can substitute n = 4 into the equation to find the last bid:
Last bid = 200 + 50(4-1)
Last bid = 200 + 50(3)
Last bid = 200 + 150
Last bid = 350

Since Carmen wins the desk with the last bid, the total cost of the desk is $350.

The final answer is: $350"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to find the total miles driven, the total cost of driving, and the total bonus paid.

First, let's find the total miles driven. Since John goes to work and back each day, the total miles driven per day is 2 * 30 = 60 miles. He goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year, so the total miles driven per year is 60 * 5 * 50 = 15,000 miles.

The cost of driving is $2 per mile, so the total cost of driving per year is 15,000 * $2 = $30,000.

John also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus paid per year is $150 * 12 = $1,800.

The total cost per year is the sum of the cost of driving and the bonus, which is $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

The final numerical answer is: $31,800"
"To find out how many minutes Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to add the minutes he exercised on both days. 

Monday: 16 minutes
Sunday: 23 minutes
Combined: 16 + 23 = 39 minutes

Since Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to multiply the combined minutes by 2.

Combined minutes: 39
Twice the combined minutes: 39 * 2 = 78 minutes

Therefore, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal.

The final answer is: 78"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the folding process. When a piece of paper is folded vertically, it creates two layers: the front and the back. 

In a standard tabloid, the pages are arranged in a way that the first page is on the left back, the second page is on the left front, and so on. This means that the first page is on the back, and the second page is on the front of the first half of the paper. 

Since we have 32 pages, we can divide them into two halves: the first 16 pages and the last 16 pages. The first 16 pages will be printed on the first half of the paper, and the last 16 pages will be printed on the second half of the paper.

However, we need to consider that the first page is on the back of the first half, and the second page is on the front of the first half. This means that the first page is shared with the second page, and the last page is shared with the second-to-last page.

So, we have 16 pages on the first half and 16 pages on the second half, but we need to subtract 1 from each half because the first page is shared with the second page, and the last page is shared with the second-to-last page.

Therefore, the total number of pages is 16 + 16 - 1 = 31.

However, we also need to consider the fact that the first page is on the back of the first half, and the second page is on the front of the first half. This means that we need to add 1 to the total number of pages to account for the first page.

So, the total number of pages is 31 + 1 = 32.

But, we are not counting the first page as a separate piece of paper, we are counting the number of pieces of paper used. Since the first page is on the back of the first half, it is part of the first half of the paper. Therefore, we need to add 1 to the total number of pages to account for the first page.

So, the total number of pieces of paper used is 32 + 1 = 33.

The final answer is: 33"
"To find out how much money Annika has left, we need to calculate the amount she spent on food and snacks, and then subtract that from the initial amount she brought.

Annika spent half of $50 on food and snacks, which is 50 / 2 = $25.

She also spent an additional $10 on rides.

So, the total amount she spent is $25 (food and snacks) + $10 (rides) = $35.

Now, let's subtract the total amount she spent from the initial amount she brought: $50 - $35 = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we first need to determine how many books she sold in the first year. 

Let's denote the number of books sold in the current year as 'x'. Since she sold twice as many books in the first year, the number of books sold in the first year is 2x.

We know that the total number of books sold in the first two years is the sum of the books sold in the first year and the current year, which is 2x + x = 3x. 

We also know that there are 50 unsold books, and the total number of books is 250. So, the total number of books sold is 250 - 50 = 200.

Since the total number of books sold is 3x, we can set up the equation 3x = 200. Solving for x, we get x = 200 / 3 = 66.67. However, since the number of books cannot be a fraction, we'll round down to the nearest whole number, which is 66.67 ≈ 67 (rounding up to 66 would be incorrect as it would leave 1 book unsold).

Now that we know the number of books sold in the current year is 67, we can find the number of books sold in the first year, which is 2x = 2 * 67 = 134.

The total amount of money earned in the second year is the number of books sold in the second year multiplied by the price of each book, which is 45 * 20 = 900.

The final answer is: $900"
"To find out how much Watson made in April, we need to calculate his total earnings from his hourly wage and the weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate his total hours worked in a week: 
10 hours/day * 5 days/week = 50 hours/week

Since Watson earns $10 per hour, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:
50 hours/week * $10/hour = $500/week

Since the company performed well for the whole month, Watson received a $300 bonus each week. 
So, his total weekly earnings are:
$500/week (hourly wage) + $300/week (bonus) = $800/week

Now, let's calculate his total earnings for the month of April, which has 4 weeks:
$800/week * 4 weeks = $3200

Therefore, Watson made $3200 in April."
"To find out how many people John lost to, we need to calculate 20% of 20, since he beat 80% of the people he arm wrestled.

20% of 20 is calculated as 0.20 * 20 = 4.

So, John lost to 4 people. 

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many loaves are sold in the afternoon, we first need to determine how many loaves are left after the morning sales. 

The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. 

Two-thirds of 60 is calculated as (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves. 

So, 40 loaves are sold in the morning. 

Now, we need to find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales. 

The total number of loaves produced is 60, and 40 are sold in the morning. 

60 - 40 = 20 loaves are left after the morning sales.

Half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening. 

Half of 20 is calculated as (1/2) * 20 = 10 loaves.

Since the remaining loaves are divided equally between the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much weight Joey loses per week and then multiply that by the number of weeks it takes Sandy to lose the same amount of weight.

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. To find out how much weight Joey loses per week, we divide the total weight lost by the number of weeks:

Weight lost per week = Total weight lost / Number of weeks
Weight lost per week = 8 pounds / 4 weeks
Weight lost per week = 2 pounds per week

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, we multiply the weight lost per week by the number of weeks it takes Sandy:

Total weight lost = Weight lost per week * Number of weeks
Total weight lost = 2 pounds/week * 4 weeks
Total weight lost = 8 pounds

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose 8 pounds.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total savings, we need to calculate the savings on the tubs of ice cream and the packets of milk separately and then add them together.

The original price of one tub of ice cream is $13, and it's now sold at $11. The discount on one tub of ice cream is $13 - $11 = $2.

Since you're buying 2 tubs of ice cream, the total discount on the ice cream will be 2 * $2 = $4.

The original price of one packet of milk is not given, but we know that it was sold at a discount of $0.5. Let's assume the original price of one packet of milk is x. The discounted price of one packet of milk is x - $0.5.

Since you're buying 4 packets of milk, the total discount on the milk will be 4 * ($x - $0.5).

However, we don't know the original price of the milk packet. To find the total savings, we need to know the original price of the milk packet. 

But, we can still express the total savings as an equation: Total Savings = 2 * $2 + 4 * ($x - $0.5).

To find the total savings, we need the original price of the milk packet."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and legs grown by the person after 15 days.

The person grows an extra arm every 3 days. To find out how many arms they will grow in 15 days, we divide 15 by 3. 

15 / 3 = 5

So, the person will grow 5 extra arms.

The person grows an extra leg every 5 days. To find out how many legs they will grow in 15 days, we divide 15 by 5.

15 / 5 = 3

So, the person will grow 3 extra legs.

In total, the person will grow 5 extra arms and 3 extra legs. 

To find the total number of new limbs, we add the number of extra arms and legs.

5 (extra arms) + 3 (extra legs) = 8

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount spent by Theo on the business suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket, and then subtract this amount from the total amount he has, $6000. We also need to subtract the amount he wants to save, $2000.

First, let's calculate the cost of the business suits:
6 suits * $100 each = $600

Next, let's calculate the cost of the suitcases:
3 suitcases * $50 each = $150

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket. The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. The cost of a business suit is $100, so 5 times this amount is:
5 * $100 = $500
$700 more than this is:
$500 + $700 = $1200

Now, let's add up the total amount spent by Theo on the business suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket:
$600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950

Now, let's subtract the total amount spent and the amount he wants to save from the total amount he has:
$6000 - $1950 - $2000 = $2050

So, Theo has $2050 to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a day and then multiply it by 7 to get the total number of eggs consumed in a week.

First, let's find out how many people eat 3 eggs each day and how many people eat 2 eggs each day. 

There are 5 people in the family, and 3 people eat 3 eggs each day. So, the number of people eating 3 eggs each day is 3. The remaining people eat 2 eggs each day, which is 5 - 3 = 2 people.

Now, let's calculate the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a day. 

The 3 people eating 3 eggs each day will consume 3 * 3 = 9 eggs. The 2 people eating 2 eggs each day will consume 2 * 2 = 4 eggs. 

So, the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a day is 9 + 4 = 13 eggs.

To find the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7. 

13 eggs/day * 7 days = 91 eggs

"To find Trent's age, we need to first determine Jane's age. Since Quinn is 30 and Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, we can calculate Jane's age by subtracting 3 from Quinn's age.

Jane's age = Quinn's age - 3
Jane's age = 30 - 3
Jane's age = 27

Now that we know Jane's age, we can find Trent's age. Trent is 5 years older than Jane, so we add 5 to Jane's age to find Trent's age.

Trent's age = Jane's age + 5
Trent's age = 27 + 5
Trent's age = 32

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find Noah's current age. Since Cera is 46 years old now, six years ago, Cera was 40 years old. We are given that six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. So, Noah's age six years ago was 40 / 2 = 20 years.

Now, we know that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, the population of Chile six years ago was 20 * 3000 = 60,000.

We are also given that the population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now. So, the current population of Chile is 60,000 * 2 = 120,000.

The final answer is: 120,000"
"Let's break down the information given. 

Let's denote the number of players on the defense as D. 

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2D.

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is D/2.

We know that the total number of players on the team is 105. Therefore, the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams is equal to 105.

We can write the equation as: 2D + D + D/2 = 105

To simplify the equation, we multiply all terms by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 4D + 2D + D = 210

Combine like terms: 7D = 210

Now, divide both sides by 7 to solve for D: D = 210 / 7
D = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total number of people invited, we first need to calculate the number of people from the 2 families with 6 people and the 3 families with 4 people.

For the 2 families with 6 people, the total number of people is 2 * 6 = 12.
For the 3 families with 4 people, the total number of people is 3 * 4 = 12.
The total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.

However, 8 people couldn't come due to illness. So, we subtract 8 from the total number of people invited: 24 - 8 = 16.

Then, 1/4 of the people who couldn't come due to illness had previous commitments. 1/4 of 8 is 2. So, we subtract 2 from the number of people who couldn't come due to illness: 8 - 2 = 6.

Now, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come due to illness and previous commitments from the total number of people invited: 16 - 6 = 10.

"To find the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store, we need to calculate the total number of marbles first.

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and added them to a store that had 50. So, the total number of marbles in the store after buying from Johanna is 20 + 50 = 70.

His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna, his father gave him 2/5 * 20 = 8 marbles.

Now, the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store is 70 (initial marbles) + 20 (bought from Johanna) + 8 (given by his father) = 98 marbles.

Since each marble weighs 2kgs, the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store is 98 * 2 = 196 kgs.

"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (such as a pool) is length x width x height.

Given dimensions: 
- Length (L) = 6 feet
- Width (W) = 4 feet
- Height (H) = 5 feet

Volume = L x W x H = 6 x 4 x 5 = 120 cubic feet

Now, we need to find the cost to fill the pool. The cost is given as $0.1 per cubic foot. 

Cost = Volume x Cost per cubic foot
Cost = 120 cubic feet x $0.1 per cubic foot
Cost = $12

"To find the total number of children in the classroom, we need to calculate the number of girls, nongendered children, and then add them to the number of boys.

Given that there are 30 boys, and the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:
Girls = 3 * Boys = 3 * 30 = 90

Next, we are told that there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys. To find the number of nongendered children, we can multiply the number of boys by 1/10:
Nongendered children = 1/10 * Boys = 1/10 * 30 = 3

Now, we can find the total number of children by adding the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
Total children = Boys + Girls + Nongendered children = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123

"To solve this problem, we need to use the given ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This means that for every 1 electric pole, 3 electric wires are needed.

Let's denote the number of electric poles as 'x'. According to the given ratio, the number of electric wires will be 3x.

We are given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45. So, we can set up the equation:

3x = 45

To find the value of x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 45 / 3
x = 15

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required by the electric company to supply the electricity in the neighborhood is 15.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of people who left the party. We know that 1/4 of the total number of people left, and 22 men stayed. 

Let's denote the total number of people as 'x'. Since 1/4 of the people left, 3/4 of the people stayed. We can set up the equation:

3/4 * x = 22 + (number of women who stayed)

We know that the total number of people at the beginning was 25 men + 15 women = 40 people. So, x = 40.

Now, we can substitute x = 40 into the equation:

3/4 * 40 = 22 + (number of women who stayed)

30 = 22 + (number of women who stayed)

Subtract 22 from both sides:

8 = (number of women who stayed)

Since there were 15 women at the beginning, we can find the number of women who left:

15 - 8 = 7 women left

The total number of women who stayed is 8, but the question asks for the number of women left. Therefore, the answer is 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the cost of the pen, we need to first determine the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book, and the book costs $4, the magazine costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, we know that the pen costs $1 less than the magazine. So, the cost of the pen is $2 - $1 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To find the total number of pencils Jam has, we know she has 3 boxes and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils. Since we know the number of loose pencils, we can find the number of pencils in the boxes by subtracting the loose pencils from the total: 26 - 2 = 24 pencils in the boxes.

Since each box contains an equal number of pencils, we can divide the total number of pencils in the boxes by the number of boxes to find the number of pencils in each box: 24 / 3 = 8 pencils per box.

Now, we know Jam has 24 pencils in 3 boxes, and Meg has 46 pencils. To find the total number of pencils, we add the number of pencils Jam and Meg have: 24 + 46 = 70 pencils.

To find the number of boxes needed to store all the pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils per box: 70 / 8 = 8.75. Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure all pencils fit. Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

The final answer is: 9"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total weakening effect of the ice cubes and the added cream.

First, let's calculate the number of ice cubes needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, so the number of ice cubes needed is:

65 / 13 = 5

Since each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, 5 ice cubes will make it 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters weaker.

Next, we need to consider the effect of adding 15 milliliters of cream. Since any added liquid weakens the coffee, the total weakening effect of the cream is 15 milliliters.

Now, we add the weakening effects of the ice cubes and the cream to find the total weakening effect:

60 milliliters (from ice cubes) + 15 milliliters (from cream) = 75 milliliters

The final answer is: 75"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the trade ratio. The given ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record. This means that for every 2 old records, 1 new record is given.

Since 5 people come in and leave with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of new records as 7. However, we need to find out how many old records were traded for these new records.

Let's use the ratio to set up an equation. If 2 old records are traded for 1 new record, then the total number of old records traded for 7 new records can be calculated as follows:

2 old records / 1 new record = x old records / 7 new records

To find the value of x, we can cross-multiply:

2 * 7 = 1 * x
14 = x

However, this is the number of old records traded for 1 new record. Since there are 5 people, and each person is trading, we need to multiply this number by 5 to get the total number of old records brought in:

14 * 5 = 70

So, the 5 people brought in a total of 70 old records.

The final answer is: 70"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of junior programmers and the number of senior programmers. 

The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, which is 100. So, the number of junior programmers is 2/5 * 100 = 40.

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers is 100 - 40 = 60.

The junior programmers are each paid $2000 per month, so the total amount paid to junior programmers is 40 * $2000 = $80,000.

Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so they are paid $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month.

The total amount paid to senior programmers is 60 * $2400 = $144,000.

The total amount paid to all programmers is the sum of the amount paid to junior programmers and senior programmers, which is $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

The final answer is: $224,000"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as 'x'.

Initially, there were x people on the bus.

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the total number of people became x + 5.

At the second bus stop, 7 people got down, so the total number of people became (x + 5) - 7 = x - 2.

Then, 8 more people got in, so the total number of people became (x - 2) + 8 = x + 6.

We are given that the total number of people heading to the third stop is 20, so we can set up the equation:

x + 6 = 20

To solve for x, we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:

x = 20 - 6
x = 14

The final answer is: 14"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops and eats 2 on his way to school. So, he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left.

2. He passes 14 out to his friends, so now he has 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops left.

3. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now, he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.

4. He eats 3 more lollipops that night, so he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops left.

5. He eats 2 more lollipops in the morning, so he has 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops left.

"To find the time it takes to fully charge the phone, we need to first determine how many percentage points are left to charge. Since the phone is already at 60% charged, it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more to be fully charged.

Since the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time it takes to charge 40% as follows:

40 percentage points / 1 percentage point per 3 minutes = 40 * 3 minutes = 120 minutes

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we need to first calculate the total number of lollipops she has after her mother gives her 10 more. 

Erin initially has 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her 10 more, so Erin now has 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops.

Then, Erin gives 3 lollipops to Ella. To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we subtract 3 from 17. 

17 - 3 = 14

So, Erin has 14 lollipops left.

The final answer is: 14"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip, apply the rewards and the coupon to the current shopping trip, and then find the final amount paid.

The customer spent $80 on their last shopping trip, which means they earned $80 / $20 = 4 rewards. 

On this shopping trip, they spent $43 and used their rewards. Since they had 4 rewards, they used $4 off the price. 

The coupon took twice the amount of rewards off the price, which is 2 * $4 = $8. 

So, the total discount applied is $4 (from rewards) + $8 (from the coupon) = $12.

The final amount paid is $43 (price) - $12 (discount) = $31.

The final answer is: $31"
"To determine which job pays more, we need to calculate the net pay for each job.

For Job A, the total income is $15/hour * 2000 hours/year = $30,000/year. The state tax rate is 20%, so the tax amount is $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000. The net pay for Job A is $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

For Job B, the total income is $42,000. The property tax is $6,000, so the net income before taxes is $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000. The state tax rate is 10%, so the tax amount is $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600. The net pay for Job B is $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

To find the difference in net pay between the two jobs, we subtract the net pay of Job A from the net pay of Job B: $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

The final numerical answer is: $8,400"
"To find the number of unmanned ruined castles, we first need to find the total number of ruined castles. 

40% of the 220 castles are ruins. To find 40% of 220, we multiply 220 by 0.4.

220 * 0.4 = 88

So, there are 88 ruined castles in Scotland. 

Half of the ruined castles are unmanned. To find half of 88, we divide 88 by 2.

88 / 2 = 44

Therefore, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland.

The final answer is: 44"
"To find the total cost of each offer, we need to calculate the total amount paid in advance and the total amount paid in installments.

- Total cost: $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450

Cozy Homes' offer:
- Advance payment: $1,100
- Monthly installments: 9 * $250 = $2,250
- Total cost: $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350

DJ has 8 guns, Nick has 10 guns, RJ has 1 gun, and Richard has 5 guns. 

Total number of guns = 8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24

Now, we need to divide the total number of guns by the number of people. There are 4 people in total.

Number of people = 4

Guns per person = Total number of guns / Number of people

"To find the final value of Maria's shares, we need to calculate the stock price after the first year and then after the second year.

Initially, Maria buys 8 shares for $8 each, so the total cost is 8 * 8 = $64.

The stock price increases by 50% in the first year. To find the new price, we multiply the original price by 1.5 (100% + 50% = 150%, or 1 + 0.5 = 1.5). 

New price after the first year = $8 * 1.5 = $12.

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. To find the new price, we multiply the price after the first year by 0.75 (100% - 25% = 75%, or 1 - 0.25 = 0.75).

New price after the second year = $12 * 0.75 = $9.

Now, we multiply the new price after the second year by the number of shares to find the final value of Maria's shares.

Final value = 8 * $9 = $72.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of students in the two equal groups as 'x'. Since the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the smallest group is 'x - 10'.

We know that the total number of students in the class is 200, and the sum of the students in all three groups is equal to 200. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 70

Since the smallest group has 'x - 10' students, we can find the number of students in the smallest group by subtracting 10 from x:

x - 10 = 70 - 10

"Let's break down the information given. Farmer Brown has a total of 60 animals, and the number of chickens is twice the number of cows. 

Let's denote the number of cows as 'c' and the number of chickens as '2c'. Since the total number of animals is 60, we can set up the equation:

c + 2c = 60

Combine like terms:

3c = 60

Divide both sides by 3:

c = 20

So, the number of cows is 20. Since the number of chickens is twice the number of cows, the number of chickens is 2 * 20 = 40.

Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each. The total number of legs for the chickens is 40 * 2 = 80, and the total number of legs for the cows is 20 * 4 = 80.

The total number of legs for all the animals is 80 + 80 = 160.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the weights of the other animals and then add them to the weight of the container.

Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can set up the following equations based on the given information:

1. The blue beetle weighs the same as the pink frog, so the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
2. The green toad also weighs the same as the pink frog, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.
3. The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
4. The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we can find the total weight of the animals and the container by adding their weights together:

Total weight = weight of pink frog + weight of blue beetle + weight of green toad + weight of yellow snake + weight of red bird + weight of container
Total weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20
Total weight = 260 pounds

"To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we need to first determine how many cookies are used by her son and her husband. 

Her son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, so the total number of cookies her son eats is 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so the total number of cookies her husband eats is 1 * 7 = 7 cookies.

The total number of cookies used by her son and her husband is 20 + 7 = 27 cookies.

Since each bag has 36 cookies, and 27 cookies are used by her son and her husband, the number of cookies left for Jenny is 36 - 27 = 9 cookies.

Therefore, Jenny eats 9 cookies.

"To find the percentage increase in the amount of money the factory is making per day, we need to first calculate the difference in the amount of money they are making per day now and the amount they used to make.

The factory used to make $100 per tractor and sold 10 tractors a day, so they made $100 * 10 = $1000 per day.

Now, they make $220 per silo and sell 5 silos a day, so they make $220 * 5 = $1100 per day.

The difference in the amount of money they are making per day now and the amount they used to make is $1100 - $1000 = $100.

To find the percentage increase, we divide the difference by the original amount and multiply by 100:

"To find the total time John spent, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and then add them up.

John spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours swimming. 

He also watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so the total time spent watching shows is 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

The total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows is 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours.

We are given that watching shows was 30% of the total time, so we can set up the equation: 30% of total time = 15 hours. 

To find the total time, we can convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100: 30 / 100 = 0.3. 

Now we can set up the equation: 0.3 * total time = 15. 

To find the total time, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.3: total time = 15 / 0.3 = 50 hours.

We are also given that John spent 40% of his time sightseeing. To find the time spent sightseeing, we can convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100: 40 / 100 = 0.4.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the activities and then subtract that from Morgan's budget to find out how much money is left for her friends. 

The cost of mini-golf for Morgan and her friends is $5 per round. Since they will play one round, the total cost for mini-golf is $5. 

The cost of the arcade tokens is $5. 

The cost of riding the go-karts twice is 2 * $10 = $20.

The total cost of the activities is $5 (mini-golf) + $5 (arcade tokens) + $20 (go-karts) = $30.

Morgan's budget is $90. To find out how much money is left for her friends, we subtract the total cost of the activities from her budget: $90 - $30 = $60.

Since each friend will not be charged for the activities, the $60 is the amount that can be used to buy something for her friends. However, the question asks for the number of friends she can invite, not the amount of money she can spend on them. 

Since the problem does not specify what she can buy for her friends, we will assume that she can invite as many friends as the budget allows, assuming each friend will get $0. 

However, this is not a practical assumption, as it would not make sense to invite friends if they are not getting anything. A more practical assumption would be that she can invite friends and give them a certain amount of money, but the problem does not specify this. 

Given the information provided, we can only assume that she can invite friends and give them $0 each. However, this is not a practical solution. 

A more practical solution would be to assume that she can invite friends and give them a certain amount of money, but the problem does not specify this. 

However, if we assume that she can invite friends and give them a certain amount of money, we can calculate the number of friends she can invite. 

Let's assume she wants to give each friend $x. The total amount of money she can spend on her friends is $60. 

The number of friends she can invite is $60 / x.

"To find out how much money Marisa saves in her piggy bank, we need to first calculate how much money she spends on lollipops each day and then subtract that from her daily pocket money.

Marisa gets $5 as pocket money every day. She buys 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each, so the total cost of lollipops is 4 * 0.25 = $1.

Now, let's subtract the cost of lollipops from her daily pocket money: $5 - $1 = $4.

Since she saves for 5 days, we multiply the daily savings by 5: $4 * 5 = $20.

The final answer is: $20"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how much change Billy has after buying the candy. 

Billy starts with $10. He buys candy for $1.5 per pound. Let's call the number of pounds of candy he buys 'x'. The total cost of the candy is 1.5x. 

The change Billy has after buying the candy is 10 - 1.5x.

Next, Billy spends half of his change on gumballs. Since he bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, the total cost of the gumballs is 40 * 0.05 = $2. 

Since Billy spends half of his change on gumballs, the amount he spent on gumballs is half of his change, which is (10 - 1.5x) / 2. We know this amount is equal to $2. 

Now, we can set up an equation to solve for x:

(10 - 1.5x) / 2 = 2

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2:

10 - 1.5x = 4

Next, we subtract 10 from both sides:

-1.5x = -6

Now, we divide both sides by -1.5:

x = 4

So, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the age of Carver's son, we need to first determine Carver's age and then calculate twice that age. 

Let's denote Carver's age as C and his son's age as S. We are given that C = 45. 

We are also given that C = 2S - 5. 

We can substitute the value of C into the equation: 45 = 2S - 5.

To solve for S, we need to isolate S on one side of the equation. 

First, we add 5 to both sides: 45 + 5 = 2S - 5 + 5
This simplifies to: 50 = 2S

Next, we divide both sides by 2: 50 / 2 = 2S / 2
This simplifies to: 25 = S

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the total distance the train travels in one trip, we need to add the distances between the three cities. The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles, and the distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles. 

The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs, which is 75 + 100 = 175 miles. So, the distance from the third city to the first city is 175 - 50 = 125 miles.

The total distance for one trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train travels this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles.

To find out how many days the train goes between services, we need to divide the total distance it can travel before needing service (18,000 miles) by the total distance it travels in a day (900 miles).

18,000 / 900 = 20 days.

"To find the amount of stuffing needed for the collie beds, we first need to find the average amount of stuffing between the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds. 

The average amount of stuffing for a collie bed is (8 + 2) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for the chihuahua beds: 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.

Next, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for the collie beds: 3 * 5 = 15 pounds.

Finally, we add the total amount of stuffing needed for the chihuahua beds and the collie beds: 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total time taken for the trip, we need to calculate the time taken for each part of the trip and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time taken for the trip to his friend's house. The distance is 200 miles and the speed is 70 mph. 

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 200 miles / 70 mph
Time = 2.857 hours (approximately)

However, he had to take a detour that added 10 miles to his trip. So, the actual distance traveled to his friend's house is 200 + 10 = 210 miles. 

Time taken for the detour = 10 miles / 70 mph
Time taken for the detour = 0.143 hours (approximately)

Total time taken to reach his friend's house = 2.857 hours + 0.143 hours
Total time taken to reach his friend's house = 3 hours

Now, let's calculate the time taken for the trip back home. The distance is 240 miles and the speed is 80 mph.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 240 miles / 80 mph
Time = 3 hours

Total time taken for the trip = Time taken to reach his friend's house + Time taken for the trip back home
Total time taken for the trip = 3 hours + 3 hours
Total time taken for the trip = 6 hours

"To find the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we first need to find the total number of students present on Friday. 

The total number of fourth-graders is 96. On Friday, 5 girls and 4 boys were absent, so the total number of absent students is 5 + 4 = 9. 

The number of students present on Friday is 96 - 9 = 87.

We know that 43 out of the 96 fourth-graders are girls. So, the number of boys is 96 - 43 = 53.

Since 4 boys were absent, the number of boys present on Friday is 53 - 4 = 49.

The final answer is: 49"
"To find the total number of kids in the park, we need to determine the number of boys and then add it to the number of girls. 

Since there are twice the number of boys as girls, and there are 6 girls, we can calculate the number of boys by multiplying the number of girls by 2. 

Number of boys = 2 * 6 = 12

Now, we can find the total number of kids by adding the number of boys and girls.

Total number of kids = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total number of kids = 12 + 6
Total number of kids = 18

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as M, the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting as S, and the number of customers kicked out for physical violence as V.

We are given that M = 3.

We are also given that the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting (S) equals four times the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks minus 5. So, S = 4M - 5 = 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7.

We are also given that the number of customers kicked out for physical violence (V) is three times the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting. So, V = 3S = 3(7) = 21.

We are given that a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart. The total number of people kicked out is the sum of the people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence. So, M + S + V = 50.

Substituting the values we found earlier, we get 3 + 7 + 21 = 31. This is the sum of the people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence.

To find the number of people kicked out for other reasons, we subtract the sum from the total number of people kicked out. So, 50 - 31 = 19.

The final answer is: 19"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many points Erin has after scoring 14 points. We know that Erin now has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8 points. 

Let's denote the number of points Erin had before scoring 14 points as 'x'. After scoring 14 points, Erin will have x + 14 points. Since Erin now has three times more points than Sara, we can set up the equation:

x + 14 = 3 * 8

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 14 = 24

Subtracting 14 from both sides of the equation, we get:

x = 10

So, Erin had 10 points before scoring 14 points.

"To calculate the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to break down the costs into different categories.

First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames. Each picture frame costs $20, and the logo etching costs an additional 20% of the frame's cost. 

20% of $20 is 0.2 * $20 = $4. 
So, the total cost of each picture frame with the logo etching is $20 + $4 = $24.

Since there are 44 seniors, the total cost of the picture frames is 44 * $24 = $1056.

Next, 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each. The total cost of the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the cords for the officers. 1/4 of the seniors are officers, which is 44 / 4 = 11 officers.

The cost of the cords for the officers is 11 * $12 = $132.

To find the total cost of the senior gifts, we add the costs of the picture frames, pins, and cords: $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

The final answer is: $1198"
"To find the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we first need to calculate the materials cost. Since the original price of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400 and making it yourself saves 20%, we can calculate the materials cost as follows:

Original price = $400
Savings = 20% of $400 = 0.20 * $400 = $80
Materials cost = Original price - Savings = $400 - $80 = $320

So, the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper is $320.

The final answer is: $320"
"To find the total number of tennis shoes sold, we need to calculate the number of shoes sold each day and then add them together.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes they sold on Friday, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the amount they did the day before, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six people returned their pairs because they didn't fit, so we need to subtract those from the total number of shoes sold on Sunday. 14 - 6 = 8 pairs.

Now, let's add up the total number of shoes sold: 14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 8 (Sunday) = 50 pairs.

Since each pair has 2 shoes, we multiply the total number of pairs by 2 to get the total number of shoes sold: 50 * 2 = 100.

"To find the total amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we first need to find the value of the faulty equipment and subtract it from the total amount spent.

The total amount spent on equipment is $400,000. 
40% of the equipment was faulty. 
To find the value of the faulty equipment, we multiply the total amount by 40% (or 0.4).

Value of faulty equipment = $400,000 * 0.4
Value of faulty equipment = $160,000

Now, we subtract the value of the faulty equipment from the total amount spent to find the value of the functioning equipment.

Value of functioning equipment = Total amount - Value of faulty equipment
Value of functioning equipment = $400,000 - $160,000
Value of functioning equipment = $240,000

"To find out how much milk Mary collects every day, we need to calculate the milk from the half of the sheep that gives 1 kg of milk and the half that gives 2 kg of milk.

First, let's find out how many sheep are in each half. Since Mary has 30 sheep, half of them would be 30 / 2 = 15 sheep.

The first half of the sheep gives 1 kg of milk each, so the total milk from this half would be 15 * 1 = 15 kg.

The second half of the sheep gives 2 kg of milk each, so the total milk from this half would be 15 * 2 = 30 kg.

Now, let's add the milk from both halves to find the total milk collected every day: 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg.

"To find the number of pupils who like the color yellow, we first need to determine the number of pupils who like blue, then the number who like green, and finally subtract those from the total number of pupils.

First, half of the class likes blue. Since there are 40 pupils in the class, half of them would be 40 / 2 = 20 pupils who like blue.

Now, one-fourth of the remaining pupils like green. The remaining pupils after those who like blue are 40 - 20 = 20. One-fourth of 20 is 20 / 4 = 5 pupils who like green.

The total number of pupils who like blue or green is 20 (blue) + 5 (green) = 25. 

To find the number of pupils who like yellow, we subtract the number of pupils who like blue or green from the total number of pupils: 40 - 25 = 15.

"To find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we need to calculate the number of apples picked each day and add them together.

On Monday, Lucy sold all the apples picked, but we don't know the number of apples picked. However, we do know that she made $56 from selling them at $4 per piece. To find the number of apples picked on Monday, we can divide the total amount earned by the price per apple:

$56 ÷ $4 = 14 apples

So, Lucy picked 14 apples on Monday.

On Tuesday, she picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she did the previous day, which is 2 * 12 = 24 apples.

Now, we can add the number of apples picked each day to find the total:

14 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 24 (Wednesday) = 50 apples

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how many socks Lindsay has washed, we need to calculate the total number of socks from the pairs and the loose socks. 

Since each pair consists of 2 socks, washing 10 pairs means Lindsay has washed 10 * 2 = 20 socks from the pairs. 

Adding the 15 loose socks, the total number of socks washed is 20 + 15 = 35.

Since there are 50 socks in total, the number of socks Lindsay has missed is 50 - 35 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how many cookies are left for Rachel, we need to start with the initial number of cookies she bought, which is 23. Then, we add the number of cookies Janet gave her, which is 42. 

23 (initial cookies) + 42 (cookies from Janet) = 65 cookies

After that, we need to subtract the number of cookies her brother ate, which is 44.

65 (total cookies) - 44 (cookies eaten) = 21 cookies

So, there are 21 cookies left for Rachel.

The final answer is: 21"
"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the monthly interest and then add it to the principal amount. 

First, let's find the total interest she has to pay over five months. The formula for simple interest is:

Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

Here, Principal = $3,650, Rate = 10% or 0.10, and Time = 5 months.

Interest = $3,650 * 0.10 * 5
Interest = $1,825

Now, we need to find the total amount she has to pay, which is the sum of the principal and the interest.

Total Amount = Principal + Interest
Total Amount = $3,650 + $1,825
Total Amount = $5,475

Since she has to pay an equal amount every month for 5 months, we divide the total amount by 5.

Monthly Payment = Total Amount / 5
Monthly Payment = $5,475 / 5
Monthly Payment = $1,095

The final answer is: $1,095"
"To find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked, we need to calculate the total distance each person hiked.

Cho hiked at a speed of 14 kilometers per hour for 8 hours. To find the total distance Cho hiked, we multiply the speed by the time:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 14 km/h * 8 h
Distance = 112 km

Chloe hiked at a speed of 9 kilometers per hour for 5 hours. To find the total distance Chloe hiked, we multiply the speed by the time:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 9 km/h * 5 h
Distance = 45 km

Now, we need to find the difference in the distances hiked by Cho and Chloe:

Difference = Distance hiked by Cho - Distance hiked by Chloe
Difference = 112 km - 45 km
Difference = 67 km

The final answer is: 67"
"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we first need to determine how many silver and gold pesos each of them has.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. 

Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos. 
Anna also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

Now, let's add up the total number of silver and gold pesos each of them has:
Axel's total: 50 (silver) + 80 (gold) = 130 pesos
Anna's total: 100 (silver) + 120 (gold) = 220 pesos

To find the total number of pesos they have together, we add Axel's total and Anna's total:
130 (Axel's total) + 220 (Anna's total) = 350 pesos

The final answer is: 350"
"To find the total profit per hour, we first need to determine the total revenue and the total cost.

Millie buys supplies for $18 to make 3 pitchers of lemonade. Each pitcher holds 12 cups of lemonade, so she can make 3 * 12 = 36 cups of lemonade.

She sells each cup of lemonade for $1, so her total revenue will be 36 * $1 = $36.

Her total cost is $18.

To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the revenue: $36 - $18 = $18.

Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, we need to find out how many hours it takes her to sell all the lemonade. Since she has 36 cups, and she sells 4 cups per hour, it will take her 36 / 4 = 9 hours to sell all the lemonade.

To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours: $18 / 9 = $2.

The final numerical answer is: $2"
"To find the initial amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we can use the information that he sold 3/5 of his land and had 12.8 hectares left. 

Let's denote the initial amount of land as x hectares. Since he sold 3/5 of his land, he was left with 2/5 of his land, which is equal to 12.8 hectares. 

We can set up the equation: (2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2 to isolate x:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land initially.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the number of female members in the choir, we first need to calculate 50% of the total members. 

50% of 52 is 0.5 * 52 = 26. 

Since there are 26 female members, and half of them can't make it to the show, we need to find half of 26. 

Half of 26 is 26 / 2 = 13. 

So, 13 female members can't make it to the show. This means 26 - 13 = 13 female members are still performing.

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them. 

To find the total number of people who sang in the performance, we add the number of female members who made it to the show and the number of teachers. 

13 (female members) + 3 (teachers) = 16.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find Wilson's current math grade, we need to calculate the average of his 5 test scores.

159 + 81 = 240
240 + 86 = 326
326 + 74 = 400

Next, we divide the sum by the number of tests to find the average:
400 / 5 = 80

So, Wilson's current math grade is 80. 

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the erasers and the cost of the pencils separately and then add them together.

The cost of 6 erasers is 6 * $2 = $12.

Now, we add the cost of the erasers and the pencils together: $12 + $24 = $36.

The final numerical answer is: $36"
"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to calculate the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu and add it to the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson.

First, let's find the number of messages James delivers to Mr. Yu. Since he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can multiply the number of messages to Ms. Thompson by 1/3.

Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * Messages to Ms. Thompson
Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * 66
Messages to Mr. Yu = 22

Now, we can add the number of messages to Mr. Yu and Ms. Thompson to find the total number of messages James delivers.

Total messages = Messages to Ms. Thompson + Messages to Mr. Yu
Total messages = 66 + 22
Total messages = 88

The final answer is: 88"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of the rides for both David and Dasha.

Since David buys a ride bracelet for $30, he gets 9 rides for free. 

Dasha buys tickets for 9 rides. Each ride costs 2 tickets at $2 per ticket, so the total cost for Dasha is 9 rides * 2 tickets per ride * $2 per ticket = $36.

The total cost for Dasha is $36, and the cost for David is $30. To find the amount David saves, we subtract the cost for David from the cost for Dasha: $36 - $30 = $6.

The final numerical answer is: $6"
"To find out how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we need to first determine the total number of gifts she has to wrap. 

Total gifts = gifts for family + gifts for friends + gifts for teachers
Total gifts = 6 + 4 + 2
Total gifts = 12

Since Monica wants to make a bow for each gift, she will need to use the total amount of ribbon for 12 bows. 

Total ribbon = 144 inches

Now, we can divide the total ribbon by the total number of gifts to find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each gift bow.

Ribbon per bow = Total ribbon / Total gifts
Ribbon per bow = 144 / 12
Ribbon per bow = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of parts in the ratio, which is 5 + 6 = 11. 

Next, we divide the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts in the ratio to find the value of one part. 

165 / 11 = 15

Now, we multiply the value of one part by the number of parts each person has to find the number of popsicles each person has. 

Betty has 5 parts, so she has 5 x 15 = 75 popsicles.
Sam has 6 parts, so he has 6 x 15 = 90 popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has.

90 - 75 = 15

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total cost of the streaming services, we need to calculate the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus. 

The normal cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 each, so together they cost $20. However, Tim saves 20% by bundling them. 

20% of $20 is 0.2 * $20 = $4. 

So, the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $20 - $4 = $16. 

The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $16 (bundled Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26. 

Since Tim was paying $60 for the cable package, he saves $60 - $26 = $34 by cancelling his cable subscription.

The final answer is: $34"

"To find the total number of books Wendy wants to place, we first need to determine the number of books in the shelving system and then add 20 more than double that amount.

The shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns, so the total number of books it can hold is 6 * 6 = 36.

Now, we need to find double the number of books in the shelving system, which is 2 * 36 = 72.

Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books, so we add 20 to 72: 72 + 20 = 92.

Therefore, Wendy will need to carry 92 books to complete her task.

The final answer is: 92"
"To find out how many Valentine's Day cards Erica has now, we need to calculate the total number of cards she initially had, added to the cards her dad brought, and then subtract the cards she passed out and add the cards she received.

Initially, Erica made 20 Valentine's cards.

Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards that had 15 cards each, so 2 * 15 = 30 cards.

She initially had 20 cards, and her dad brought 30, so 20 + 30 = 50 cards.

She passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 to her family, so 24 + 5 = 29 cards.

Now, she has 50 - 29 = 21 cards.

She received 17 cards from family and friends, so 21 + 17 = 38 cards.

Therefore, Erica now has 38 Valentine's Day cards.

The final answer is: 38"
"To find out how many slices are left, we first need to determine how many slices Jenny gave away. 

Jenny gave 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices, we can calculate the number of slices Bill received as follows:

1/3 * 12 = 4 slices

Jenny gave 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. We can calculate the number of slices Mark received as follows:

1/4 * 12 = 3 slices

In total, Jenny gave away 4 + 3 = 7 slices.

Jenny ate 2 slices, so the total number of slices she gave away or ate is 7 + 2 = 9 slices.

To find out how many slices are left, we subtract the total number of slices given away or eaten from the total number of slices:

12 - 9 = 3 slices

"To find the total number of bugs, we need to calculate the number of millipedes and stink bugs first.

Nancy saw 90 spiders. The number of millipedes is 1/3rd of the number of spiders, so the number of millipedes is 90 / 3 = 30.

The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12, so the number of stink bugs is 2 * 30 - 12 = 48.

Now, we add up the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs to find the total number of bugs: 90 + 30 + 48 = 168.

The final answer is: 168"

"To find the total amount the builder earns in a year, we need to calculate his daily earnings and then multiply it by the total number of days he works in a year.

First, let's find the total number of days the builder works in a year. He works 4 weeks every month, and there are 12 months in a year. 

Total weeks worked in a year = 4 weeks/month * 12 months = 48 weeks/year

Since he works 6 days a week, the total number of days he works in a year is:
Total days worked in a year = 48 weeks/year * 6 days/week = 288 days/year

Now, let's find his daily earnings:
Daily earnings = $50/day

Now, we can find his total earnings in a year:
Total earnings in a year = Total days worked in a year * Daily earnings
Total earnings in a year = 288 days/year * $50/day
Total earnings in a year = $14400/year

"To find out how many bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of flour and milk required for the quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. Since Mark is making a quadruple batch, we multiply the ingredients by 4:

- Flour: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups
- Milk: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark will need to buy:
12 cups / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags of flour

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so Mark will need to buy:
4 cups / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles of milk

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour:
6 bags of flour - 2 bottles of milk = 4

"To find the energy saved, we first need to calculate the original energy consumption and the new energy consumption. 

The original energy consumption can be calculated by multiplying the power (watts) by the time (hours) and then converting it to kilowatt-hours (kWh). 

Original energy consumption = 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 Wh (or 7.2 kWh per day)

Since 1 kWh = 1000 Wh, we can convert the original energy consumption to kWh.

Now, let's calculate the new energy consumption after reducing the usage by 5 hours.

New energy consumption = 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 Wh (or 2.7 kWh per day)

The energy saved per day is the difference between the original and new energy consumption.

Energy saved per day = 7.2 kWh - 2.7 kWh = 4.5 kWh

To find the total energy saved in 30 days, we multiply the energy saved per day by 30.

Total energy saved in 30 days = 4.5 kWh/day * 30 days = 135 kWh

"To determine the total cost of the meat and cheese, we first need to calculate the total number of sandwiches required to serve 20 people. Since each sandwich serves 4 people, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each sandwich serves:

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, we need a total of 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

The cost of the meat is $7.00 per pound, so the total cost of the meat is:
5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00

The cost of the cheese is $3.00 per pound, so the total cost of the cheese is:
5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

The total cost of the meat and cheese is the sum of the cost of the meat and the cost of the cheese:
$35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

The final answer is: $50.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the initial number of corns and cannolis Allan has at home. 

Since Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis and he has 40 cannolis, the initial number of corns is 2 * 40 = 80.

Allan bought 60 more cannolis and 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. So, he bought 60 cannolis and 60 - 40 = 20 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. Since he bought 60 cannolis, he bought 60 - 20 = 40 corns.

Now, we need to add the initial number of corns and cannolis to the number of corns and cannolis Allan bought. The initial number of corns is 80 and the initial number of cannolis is 40. The number of corns Allan bought is 40 and the number of cannolis he bought is 60.

The total number of corns is 80 + 40 = 120 and the total number of cannolis is 40 + 60 = 100.

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 120 + 100 = 220.

The final answer is: 220"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Elliott wants to walk 10,000 steps a day. He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. Since half of 10,000 is 5,000, he completed 5,000 steps on his walks to and from school.

He also took an additional 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So, the total steps he completed so far are 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000.

After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal of 10,000 steps. This means that the total steps he completed after his jog is 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000.

Since he completed 6,000 steps before his jog, the number of steps he took during his jog is 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000.

The final answer is: 2000"
"To find out how many minutes Toby will be early, we first need to determine how long it will take him to read the book. 

The book is 45 pages long and averages 200 words per page, so the total number of words in the book is 45 * 200 = 9000 words.

Toby can read 300 words per minute, so the time it will take him to read the book is 9000 / 300 = 30 minutes.

It takes 10 minutes to get to the airport, so the total time Toby will spend is 30 + 10 = 40 minutes.

Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes, so the time he will be early is 60 - 40 = 20 minutes.

"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to first determine the number of employees and their total hours worked in each month.

In May, the company hired 40 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours per week for 4 weeks, so the total hours worked by each employee in May is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in May is 160 * $15 = $2400.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 1/4 * 40 = 10 employees left. So, the remaining number of employees is 40 - 10 = 30. Each of these employees worked 160 hours in June, and the total amount paid to each employee in June is 160 * $15 = $2400.

The total amount paid to the employees in May is 40 * $2400 = $96,000. The total amount paid to the employees in June is 30 * $2400 = $72,000.

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000.

"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The sale is ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means that for every 2 pounds of taffy, she pays $3 for the first pound and $1.50 for the second pound (since it's half off). So, the cost of 2 pounds of taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the magnets. She bought 4 magnets at $0.25 each, so the total cost of the magnets is 4 x $0.25 = $1.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items: $4.50 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1 (magnets) = $7.

Sally started with $10, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from the initial amount: $10 - $7 = $3.

"To find the total amount spent by Tim, we first need to calculate the cost of the two packages of fireworks and the finale firework.

The first package of fireworks costs $400. The second package costs twice as much, so it's 2 * $400 = $800.

The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Tim gets a 20% discount on the two packages. To find the discount amount, we multiply the total cost by 0.20: $1200 * 0.20 = $240.

The discount amount is subtracted from the total cost: $1200 - $240 = $960.

The finale firework costs $150. Adding this to the discounted cost of the fireworks, we get $960 + $150 = $1110.

The total amount spent by Tim is $1110.

"To determine the number of dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we need to calculate the total number of cookies she will eat in 30 days and then divide that by the number of cookies her recipe makes.

Shannon eats 2 cookies per night. To find the total number of cookies she will eat in 30 days, we multiply the number of cookies she eats per night by the number of days:

2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies

Since Shannon's recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies she will eat by 12 to find out how many dozens she needs to make:

60 cookies / 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozen cookies

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozen cookies to have enough for 30 days. 

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. 

First, let's find the number of candles that smell like wet dog. Since 5% of the candles have this defect, we can calculate it as follows:

Number of candles that smell like wet dog = Total number of candles * Percentage of candles with the defect
= 50000 * 0.05
= 2500

Now, we need to find the number of candles that are both defective and guaranteed not to explode. Since 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode, 1% of the candles are guaranteed to explode. However, we are interested in the candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. 

Since the problem doesn't provide information about the relationship between the two defects, we can assume that the defects are independent. Therefore, we can find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode by multiplying the number of candles that smell like wet dog by the percentage of candles that are guaranteed to explode:

Number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode = Number of candles that smell like wet dog * Percentage of candles that are guaranteed to explode
= 2500 * 0.01

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathered from the tallest trees as T, from the average trees as A, and from the shortest trees as S. 

Since Joanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees, we have T = 30.

From the shortest trees, she gathered half of 30, which is 15. So, S = 15.

The total number of apples Joanne gathered is the sum of the apples from the three types of trees: T + A + S = 30 + A + 15.

Now, let's consider Joanne's sister. She gathered twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, so her total from the tallest trees is 2T = 2 * 30 = 60.

She gathered three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so her total from the shortest trees is 3S = 3 * 15 = 45.

Since she didn't gather any apples from the average trees, her total is 60 + 45 = 105.

The combined total of the apples gathered by both sisters is 500. So, the total number of apples Joanne gathered is 500 - 105 = 395.

We already know that Joanne gathered 30 + 15 = 45 apples from the tallest and shortest trees. Therefore, the number of apples she gathered from the average trees is 395 - 45 = 350.

The final answer is: 350"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D.

We know that the total number of heads is 180, and since each animal has one head, we can write the equation:

C + D = 180

We also know that the total number of bumps is 304, and since camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump, we can write the equation:

2C + D = 304

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve for C and D by subtracting the first equation from the second equation:

(2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can substitute this value into the first equation to solve for D:

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

Therefore, there are 56 dromedaries in the herd.

The final answer is: 56"
"To find the total distance traveled by Tom, we need to break down the information given.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day. So, the total distance covered in the first 4 days is 4 * 200 = 800 kilometers.

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. 30% of 800 kilometers is 0.3 * 800 = 240 kilometers. So, the total distance covered in the next two days is 240 kilometers.

On the next day, he wasn't traveling at all, so the distance covered is 0 kilometers.

During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total distance covered in the second week is 7 * 300 = 2100 kilometers.

Now, let's add up the distances covered in each segment: 
- First 4 days: 800 kilometers
- Next two days: 240 kilometers
- Next day: 0 kilometers
- Second week: 2100 kilometers

Total distance = 800 + 240 + 0 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.

The final answer is: 3140"
"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to work backwards from Peter's locker size. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, Zack's locker must be 4 times as big as Peter's locker.

Let's calculate Zack's locker size:
Zack's locker size = 4 * Peter's locker size
Zack's locker size = 4 * 5 cubic inches
Zack's locker size = 20 cubic inches

Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, Timothy's locker must be twice as big as Zack's locker.

Let's calculate Timothy's locker size:
Timothy's locker size = 2 * Zack's locker size
Timothy's locker size = 2 * 20 cubic inches
Timothy's locker size = 40 cubic inches

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the elevation where Stanley's comb fell, we need to subtract the distance it fell from Stanley's initial elevation. 

Stanley's initial elevation: 10,000 feet
Distance the comb fell: 4,000 feet
Elevation where the comb fell: 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet

Now, we need to find the difference between the elevation where the comb fell and Oliver's elevation to determine how much Oliver needs to climb.

Elevation where the comb fell: 6,000 feet
Oliver's elevation: 3,000 feet
Distance Oliver must climb: 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet

The final answer is: 3000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Mr. Josue initially had $5000 in capital. The first bank gave him $4000, so now he has $5000 + $4000 = $9000.

The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, which is 2 * $4000 = $8000. 

Now, we add the amount he received from the second bank to his current capital: $9000 + $8000 = $17000.

So, Mr. Josue now has $17000 in capital.

The final answer is: $17000"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock.
2. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each. So, the total number of cats taken away is 4 * 5 = 20.
3. The remaining cats on the rock are 50 - 20 = 30.
4. Later, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find 3/5 of 30, we multiply 30 by 3/5, which is (30 * 3) / 5 = 90 / 5 = 18.
5. The number of cats that ran after the mouse is 18, so the remaining cats on the rock are 30 - 18 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into the different pricing periods and calculate the cost for each period.

The first 6 months are $8 a month, so the cost for this period is:
6 months * $8/month = $48

The next 8 months are at the normal rate of $12 a month, so the cost for this period is:
8 months * $12/month = $96

After that, the price increased to $14 a month. Since 2 years is 24 months, and we've already accounted for 14 months, there are 10 months left at the new rate. The cost for this period is:
10 months * $14/month = $140

Now, let's add up the costs for each period to find the total cost for 2 years:
$48 + $96 + $140 = $284

The total cost for 2 years of the service is $284.

The final answer is: $284"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let the cost of the jogger jeans be x. Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, the cost of the tattered jeans is x + $6.

The total savings is $6, and Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. This means that 1/3 of the total savings is from the jogger jeans, and 2/3 of the total savings is from the tattered jeans.

We can set up the equation for the total savings:

(1/3) * (x - (x + 6)) + (2/3) * (28 - (x + 6)) = 6

Simplifying the equation:

(1/3) * (-6) + (2/3) * (22 - x) = 6

-2 + (44 - 2x)/3 = 6

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

-6 + 44 - 2x = 18

Combine like terms:

38 - 2x = 18

Subtract 38 from both sides:

-2x = -20

Divide both sides by -2:

x = 10

The jogger jeans cost $10. Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, the tattered jeans cost $10 + $6 = $16.

The difference in cost between the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is $10 - $16 = -$6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To find the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and then add them together.

The capacity of the 4 buses is 4 x 60 = 240 employees.
The capacity of the 6 minibusses is 6 x 30 = 180 employees.
The capacity of the 10 minivans is 10 x 15 = 150 employees.

Now, we add the capacities together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

The final answer is: 570"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder and then calculate the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden.

Let's denote the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders as x. Since the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is x + 10.

Lillian has 3 homemade feeders and 3 store-bought feeders. The total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3(x + 10), and the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3x.

The total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden is the sum of the birds attracted to the homemade and store-bought feeders: 3(x + 10) + 3x.

We are given that each bird feeder attracts 20 birds throughout the day. Since Lillian has 6 feeders in total, the total number of birds attracted to all feeders is 6 * 20 = 120.

We can set up an equation to represent the situation: 3(x + 10) + 3x = 120.

Simplifying the equation, we get 3x + 30 + 3x = 120.

Combine like terms: 6x + 30 = 120.

Subtract 30 from both sides: 6x = 90.

Divide both sides by 6: x = 15.

Now that we know x, we can find the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders: x + 10 = 15 + 10 = 25.

The total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3 * 25 = 75.

The total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3 * 15 = 45.

The total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden is 75 + 45 = 120.

However, this is not the answer we are looking for. We need to find the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders, which is 75.

The final answer is: 75"
"To find the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The bagel costs $4. 
The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. To find 25% of $4, we multiply $4 by 0.25, which is $1. Then, we add this to the cost of the bagel: $4 + $1 = $5. 
The cake costs half the price of the bagel, which is $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, we add the costs of all the items together: $4 (bagel) + $5 (soup) + $2 (cake) = $11.

The final answer is: $11"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cards Kenny sold to get the remaining $50. Since he sold the cards for $1.5 each, we can divide $50 by $1.5 to find out how many cards he sold.

$50 / $1.5 = 33.33

However, since we can't sell a fraction of a card, we'll round down to 33 cards. This is the number of cards Kenny sold.

Now, let's find out how many cards he kept. We know that he kept 1/3 of his cards. If we let x be the total number of cards he started with, then 1/3 of x is the number of cards he kept.

1/3 * x = number of cards kept

We also know that the number of cards he kept plus the number of cards he sold equals the total number of cards he started with.

x = number of cards kept + number of cards sold
x = (1/3)x + 33

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction.

3x = 3 * (1/3)x + 3 * 33
3x = x + 99

Now, we can subtract x from both sides to get:

2x = 99

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = 99 / 2
x = 49.5

Since we can't have a fraction of a card, we'll round up to 50 cards. However, we need to check if this is the correct answer. If Kenny had 50 cards, he would have 1/3 * 50 = 16.67 cards left, which we round down to 16.67, but we know he had 33 cards left after selling some. This is not correct.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, the caterer prepared enough hot dogs for half of the guests to have two hot dogs. Since there are 36 guests, half of them would be 36 / 2 = 18. So, the caterer prepared enough hot dogs for 18 guests to have two hot dogs each.

This means the caterer prepared 18 * 2 = 36 hot dogs for the first 18 guests. However, since the caterer prepared enough for 18 guests to have two hot dogs, the total number of hot dogs prepared is 36.

Now, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hot dog. This means that the 18 guests who were initially supposed to have two hot dogs got their second hot dog, and the remaining 22 guests (40 - 18 = 22) also got a second hot dog.

Since the caterer had prepared 36 hot dogs, and 40 guests got a second hot dog, there are not enough hot dogs for the 40th guest. This means that the 40th guest did not get a second hot dog.

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the number of letters in Indras' sister's name, we first need to find half of the letters in Indras' name. 

Indras has 6 letters in her name. Half of 6 is 3. 

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name, so it has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

The total number of letters in both names is 6 (Indras) + 7 (her sister) = 13.

The final numerical answer is: 13"
"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the total cost of the items before the discount and then apply the 20% discount.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- The set of pot and pans costs $120.00
- The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00
- 5 separate utensils at $5.00 each will cost 5 x $5.00 = $25.00

The total cost of the items before the discount is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

Now, let's apply the 20% discount to the total cost:

20% of $165.00 is 0.20 x $165.00 = $33.00

The discount amount is $33.00, so we subtract this from the total cost:

$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

The final cost of Charlotte's order is $132.00.

The final answer is: $132.00"
"To find out how much more money Dora needs, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy and subtract the amount of money she already has.

The total cost of the items is: $6 (skipping rope) + $11 (board game) + $2 (playground ball) = $19.

Dora has a total of $2 (her allowance) + $16 (from her mother) = $18.

To find out how much more money she needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost: $19 (total cost) - $18 (amount she has) = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many dragons Prince Arthur and Prince Walter slew, and then use that information to find out how many dragons Prince Bruce slew.

Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons. Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, so Prince Arthur slew 3/4 * 100 = 75 dragons.

Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so Prince Walter slew 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.

Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so Prince Bruce slew 1/5 * 150 = 30 dragons.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we first need to determine how much gas was in each container. Since 15 gallons were equally divided into 5 containers, we can divide 15 by 5 to find the amount in each container.

15 gallons / 5 containers = 3 gallons per container

Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we can convert the 3 gallons to pints by multiplying 3 by 8.

3 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 24 pints

Josey needed 1/4 of a container, so we need to find 1/4 of 24 pints.

1/4 * 24 pints = 6 pints

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money George had initially. Since he had 1% of his money left after spending $5, we can set up an equation to find the initial amount.

Let's denote the initial amount as 'x'. Since 1% of 'x' is $5, we can write the equation as:

0.01x = 5

To find 'x', we can divide both sides by 0.01:

x = 5 / 0.01
x = 500

So, George initially had $500.

Now, let's find out how much he spent on chips. He bought 3 bags of chips for 40 cents each, so the total cost of chips is:

3 * 0.40 = $1.20

Since he spent $5 in total, the amount he spent on candy bars is:

5 - 1.20 = $3.80

Now, we need to find out how many candy bars he bought. Each candy bar costs 75 cents, so we can divide the total amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar:

3.80 / 0.75 = 5.07

Since we can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can buy 5 candy bars for $3.75 and still have $0.05 left, which is not enough to buy another candy bar. Therefore, George bought 5 candy bars.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many lollipops each of Ray's friends received, we need to first determine how many lollipops he shared with his friends. 

Ray had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself, so he shared 25 - 5 = 20 lollipops with his friends.

Since he shared the lollipops equally among his four friends, we need to divide the total number of lollipops shared (20) by the number of friends (4).

20 ÷ 4 = 5

So, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the remaining weight of the cake, we first need to determine how much of the cake was eaten. Since Rory and her mom each had a piece, that's 2 pieces in total. 

The cake was cut into 8 pieces, and 2 were eaten, so 8 - 2 = 6 pieces are left. 

Since the cake weighs 20 ounces and it was cut into 8 equal pieces, we can find the weight of each piece by dividing the total weight by the number of pieces: 20 ounces / 8 = 2.5 ounces per piece.

Now, we multiply the weight of one piece by the number of remaining pieces: 2.5 ounces * 6 = 15 ounces.

The remaining cake weighs 15 ounces."
"To find out how many oranges each person will get, we need to first calculate the total number of oranges Sitti and Juris have. 

Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges. 

Total oranges = 34 + 22 = 56

Since they are sharing the oranges with 6 other friends, including themselves, the total number of people sharing the oranges is 8 (Sitti, Juris, and 6 friends).

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people.

Oranges per person = Total oranges / Total people
= 56 / 8
= 7

So, everyone will get 7 oranges. 

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the cost per serving, we first need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients. 

Antoine wants to double the amount of onions, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The cost of onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, which costs 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

Since the soup serves 6 people, the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes Bernadette to get to the theater and then calculate how much earlier she needs to leave than Wayne.

Since it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, and Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's, Bernadette's drive will take 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, and it takes her 16 minutes to get to the theater, she needs to leave 16 + 5 = 21 minutes before Wayne.

However, since Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, Bernadette needs to leave 21 minutes before Wayne's 4 minutes, which is 21 - 4 = 17 minutes.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 17 minutes earlier than Wayne to get to the theater first.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we first need to find the width of the room. We know the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards. 

First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. There are 3 feet in a yard, so 3 yards is equal to 3 * 3 = 9 feet.

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is length times width (A = lw). We can rearrange this formula to solve for the width: width = area / length. 

Plugging in the values we know, we get width = 360 / 9 = 40 feet.

Now that we have the width, we can find the perimeter of the room using the formula P = 2l + 2w, where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width.

Plugging in the values we know, we get P = 2(9) + 2(40) = 18 + 80 = 98 feet.

The final answer is: 98"
"To find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we need to calculate the total number of beads each sister has.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
1 pack of red beads = 1 x 20 = 20 beads
2 packs of clear beads = 2 x 20 = 40 beads
Total beads Elizabeth has = 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
3 packs of blue beads = 3 x 20 = 60 beads
4 packs of red beads = 4 x 20 = 80 beads
Total beads Margareth has = 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, let's find the difference in the number of beads between the two sisters:
Difference = Total beads Margareth has - Total beads Elizabeth has
= 140 - 60
= 80

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the final temperature of the house, we need to calculate the temperature increase due to the oven and the temperature decrease due to the open window.

First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to the oven. The oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour, and Marcus bakes for 3 hours. So, the total temperature increase is 5 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 15 degrees.

Now, let's calculate the temperature decrease due to the open window. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Since the window is open for 30 minutes, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are there in 30 minutes. 30 minutes / 10 minutes = 3 intervals. So, the total temperature decrease is 2 degrees/interval * 3 intervals = 6 degrees.

Now, let's subtract the temperature decrease from the temperature increase: 15 degrees (increase) - 6 degrees (decrease) = 9 degrees.

The initial temperature of the house was 40 degrees. So, the final temperature is 40 degrees + 9 degrees = 49 degrees.

The final answer is: 49"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it took James to complete each segment of the triathlon. 

Let's start with the swim. Since James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon, and Jon took 40 minutes, we can calculate James' swim time as follows:

James' swim time = Jon's swim time - (10% of Jon's swim time)
= 40 - (0.1 * 40)
= 40 - 4
= 36 minutes

Next, we know that James took 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. Since Jon took 1 hour and 20 minutes (or 80 minutes) for the bike ride, we can calculate James' bike time as follows:

James' bike time = Jon's bike time + 5 minutes
= 80 + 5
= 85 minutes

Now, let's find out how long it took Jon to complete the triathlon. We know that Jon took 40 minutes for the swim, 80 minutes for the bike ride, and 50 minutes for the run. So, the total time taken by Jon is:

Jon's total time = 40 + 80 + 50
= 170 minutes

We are given that Jon won by 10 minutes, which means James took 10 minutes longer than Jon to complete the triathlon. Therefore, James' total time is:

James' total time = Jon's total time + 10 minutes
= 170 + 10
= 180 minutes

Now, we can find out how long it took James to complete the run by subtracting his swim and bike times from his total time:

James' run time = James' total time - James' swim time - James' bike time
= 180 - 36 - 85
= 59 minutes

The final answer is: 59"
"To find the length of Movie A, we need to first find the length of Movie B and then calculate one-fourth of that length.

Movie C is 1.25 hours, which is equal to 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes.

Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so Movie B is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes.

Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, so Movie A is 80 / 4 = 20 minutes.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay, we need to calculate the total cost of the hay and subtract it from the amount of money he has.

First, let's find out how many miles the horse runs in 30 minutes. Since the horse runs at 32MPH, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. 

30 minutes is 0.5 hours (since 1 hour = 60 minutes).

Now, we can calculate the distance the horse runs in 0.5 hours:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 32MPH * 0.5 hours
Distance = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile, the total hay consumed is:
Total Hay = Distance * (1/2 bail/mile)
Total Hay = 16 miles * (1/2 bail/mile)
Total Hay = 8 bails

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost of the hay is:
Total Cost = Total Hay * Cost per bail
Total Cost = 8 bails * $3/bail
Total Cost = $24

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of:
Total Money = 6 * $5
Total Money = $30

Now, we can find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay:
Change = Total Money - Total Cost
Change = $30 - $24
Change = $6

The final answer is: $6"
"To find out how many trays Rozanne can put out, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs she has. 

Rozanne uses 4 dozen eggs from cases. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 4 dozen eggs would be 4 * 12 = 48 eggs. 

In addition to the eggs from the cases, she also uses 2 loose eggs. So, the total number of eggs is 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Each glass of eggnog needs 5 eggs, so the total number of glasses she can make is 50 / 5 = 10 glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, the total number of trays she can put out is 10 / 5 = 2 trays.

The final answer is: 2"

First, let's calculate Joey's final score: 
Joey's initial score: 214 points
Joey's score after his turn: 214 + 26 = 240 points

Next, let's calculate Marcy's final score: 
Marcy's initial score: 225 points
Marcy's score after her turn: 225 + 10 = 235 points

Now, let's find the difference between their final scores: 
Difference = Joey's final score - Marcy's final score
Difference = 240 - 235
Difference = 5

So, Joey is winning by 5 points.

"To find the salesman's profit, we first need to calculate the total revenue from the flash sale and the sales to the department store.

The salesman sold 17 sneakers at $20 each during the flash sale, so the revenue from the flash sale is:
17 * $20 = $340

The salesman sold the remaining 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers to the department store at $25 each. The revenue from the sales to the department store is:
31 * $25 = $775

The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from the flash sale and the sales to the department store:
$340 + $775 = $1115

The cost of the case of 48 sneakers is $576. To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the total revenue:
$1115 - $576 = $539

The salesman's profit is $539.

The final answer is: $539"
"To find the total number of crayons Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the total number of crayons in the six packets with eight pieces each and the four packets with sixteen pieces each.

First, let's calculate the total number of crayons in the six packets with eight pieces each:
6 packets * 8 crayons/packet = 48 crayons

Next, let's calculate the total number of crayons in the four packets with sixteen pieces each:
4 packets * 16 crayons/packet = 64 crayons

Now, we add the total number of crayons from both types of packets to find the overall total:
48 crayons + 64 crayons = 112 crayons

The final answer is: 112"
"Let's break down the information given. 

If you buy a movie super ticket for $20, you get one popcorn with a soda for $1 extra. This means the total cost for the super ticket and the combo is $21. 

If you buy a movie ticket for $12 and a combo of popcorn and soda at regular price, the total cost is $12 + (popcorn price + soda price). 

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the total cost of the regular option is $21 - $2 = $19. 

Now, let's set up an equation for the regular option: 12 + (popcorn price + 3) = 19. 

Simplifying the equation, we get popcorn price + 15 = 19. 

Subtracting 15 from both sides, we get popcorn price = 4.

The regular price of popcorn is $4. 

The final answer is: $4"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the cost of filling one balloon before the price increase. 

Let's denote the original cost of filling one balloon as 'x'. The total cost of filling 20 balloons is $900, so we can set up the equation:

20x = 900

To find the value of 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 20:

x = 900 / 20
x = 45

So, the original cost of filling one balloon was $45.

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20, making the new cost $65 per balloon.

Now, we need to find the total cost of filling 170 balloons at the new price. We can multiply the new cost per balloon by the number of balloons:

Total cost = 65 * 170
Total cost = 11050

The final answer is: 11050"
"To find the average speed of the car during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled at 60 mph for 2 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 60 mph x 2 hours
Distance = 120 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled at 30 mph for 1 hour:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 30 mph x 1 hour
Distance = 30 miles

Now, let's find the total distance traveled:
Total Distance = 120 miles + 30 miles
Total Distance = 150 miles

The total time taken for the trip is 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours.

To find the average speed, we divide the total distance by the total time:
Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
Average Speed = 150 miles / 3 hours
Average Speed = 50 mph

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the value of the sapphires and rubies Jenna has after the trade.

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. This means she has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left.

The value of the sapphires she has left is 5 * $800 = $4000.

The value of the rubies she got in the trade is 2 * $1200 = $2400.

To find the total value of all her jewels, we add the value of the sapphires and rubies together: $4000 + $2400 = $6400.

The final numerical answer is: $6400"
"To find the total number of apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of apples they eat per day and then multiply it by 30.

Marin and Nancy each eat 4 apples a day. So together, they eat 4 + 4 = 8 apples per day.

Now, we multiply the total number of apples they eat per day by 30 to find the total number of apples they eat in 30 days: 8 * 30 = 240.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the total volume of soil needed, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed and then multiply it by the number of beds. 

The volume of one raised bed is calculated as length * width * height. 
Volume = 2 feet * 8 feet * 2 feet = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:
Total Volume = 32 cubic feet/bed * 10 beds = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. To find the number of bags needed, we divide the total volume by the volume per bag:
Number of bags = Total Volume / Volume per bag = 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet/bag = 160 bags.

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:
Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag = 160 bags * $12/bag = $1920.

The final answer is: $1920"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of green cards first. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:

Number of red cards = 15
60% of 15 = 0.6 * 15 = 9
Number of green cards = 15 + 9 = 24

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards:
Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
= 15 + 24
= 39

To find the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards:
Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
= 15 + 24 + 39
= 78

"To find the total number of puppies with spots, we need to add the number of puppies with spots from Jennifer's and Brandon's dogs. Jennifer has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon has 4 puppies with spots. So, the total number of puppies with spots is 3 + 4 = 7.

Next, we need to find the total number of puppies. Jennifer has 8 puppies, and Brandon has 12 puppies. So, the total number of puppies is 8 + 12 = 20.

To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we need to divide the total number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiply by 100. 

(7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

"To find the total weight of the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and add them together.

The farmer buys 2 boxes of sugar cubes, each weighing 1 pound, so the total weight of sugar cubes is 2 * 1 = 2 pounds.

He buys 4 bags of carrots, each weighing 12 pounds, so the total weight of carrots is 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.

He buys 42 bales of hay, each weighing 75 pounds, so the total weight of hay is 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.

He buys 20 sacks of oats, each weighing 65 pounds, so the total weight of oats is 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

The total weight of all the feed is 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3400 pounds.

Since the farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, we need to divide the total weight of the feed by the truck's capacity to find the number of trips needed.

3400 / 2250 = 1.511 (round up to the nearest whole number since we can't make a fraction of a trip)

So, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To find out how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate the total earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the earnings from aluminum cans. Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans a week. Since an aluminum can is worth 2 cents, her weekly earnings from aluminum cans are 3 cans/week * 2 cents/can = 6 cents/week. 

For a four-week month, her earnings from aluminum cans would be 6 cents/week * 4 weeks = 24 cents.

Next, let's calculate the earnings from plastic bottles. Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles a week. Since a plastic bottle is worth 3 cents, her weekly earnings from plastic bottles are 5 bottles/week * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents/week.

For a four-week month, her earnings from plastic bottles would be 15 cents/week * 4 weeks = 60 cents.

Now, let's add the earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles together. 24 cents (aluminum cans) + 60 cents (plastic bottles) = 84 cents.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find out how many plants Shondra has, we need to first determine how many plants Toni has. Since Frederick has 10 plants and Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, we can calculate Toni's plants as follows:

Toni's plants = Frederick's plants + (60% of Frederick's plants)
Toni's plants = 10 + (0.6 * 10)
Toni's plants = 10 + 6
Toni's plants = 16

Now that we know Toni has 16 plants, we can find out how many plants Shondra has. Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni, so we subtract 7 from Toni's total:

Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
Shondra's plants = 16 - 7
Shondra's plants = 9

"To find out how many students Miss Maria has, we first need to determine the total number of cards she has. 

She has six decks of basketball cards with 25 cards in each deck. So, the total number of basketball cards is 6 * 25 = 150.

She has five boxes of baseball cards with 40 cards in each box. So, the total number of baseball cards is 5 * 40 = 200.

The total number of cards is the sum of basketball and baseball cards: 150 + 200 = 350.

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so the remaining cards are 350 - 50 = 300.

If her students got ten cards each, we can find the number of students by dividing the remaining cards by the number of cards each student got: 300 / 10 = 30.

Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each and received a $1 discount. First, we calculate the total cost before the discount: 20 * 0.45 = $9. Then, we subtract the discount: $9 - $1 = $8.

Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each and received a 10 percent discount. First, we calculate the total cost before the discount: 20 * 0.50 = $10. Then, we find 10 percent of $10: 0.10 * $10 = $1. We subtract the discount from the total cost: $10 - $1 = $9.

Now, we compare the costs: Kelly paid $9 and Becky paid $8. To find out how much more Kelly paid, we subtract Becky's cost from Kelly's cost: $9 - $8 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To find the total number of pieces of laundry, we need to calculate the number of each item per room and then multiply it by the total number of rooms.

Each room has:
- 2 sheets
- 1 comforter
- Twice as many pillow cases as sheets: 2 * 2 = 4 pillow cases
- Twice as many towels as pillow cases: 2 * 4 = 8 towels

Total number of items per room: 2 (sheets) + 1 (comforter) + 4 (pillow cases) + 8 (towels) = 15 items

Now, multiply the total number of items per room by the total number of rooms: 15 items/room * 80 rooms = 1200 items

The final answer is: 1200"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of shoes Fireman Frank has at the end of the week.

First, let's calculate the number of shoes he gets:

- 5 pairs on Monday = 5 x 2 = 10 shoes
- 15 pairs on Wednesday = 15 x 2 = 30 shoes
- 30 pairs on Friday = 30 x 2 = 60 shoes

Now, let's add the shoes he already had to the shoes he got:
200 (initial shoes) + 10 (Monday) + 30 (Wednesday) + 60 (Friday) = 300 shoes

However, he gets rid of 180 shoes on Saturday. To find the total number of shoes he has on Sunday, we subtract the shoes he got rid of from the total:
300 - 180 = 120 shoes

The final answer is: 120"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of cupcakes Mary can decorate with her sprinkles and then divide that number by the number of cupcakes each pan can hold.

First, let's find the total number of cupcakes Mary can decorate. Since each jar of sprinkles can decorate 8 cupcakes and she has 6 jars, the total number of cupcakes is 6 jars * 8 cupcakes/jar = 48 cupcakes.

Next, we need to divide the total number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes each pan can hold, which is 12. 

48 cupcakes / 12 cupcakes/pan = 4 pans.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the amount of change Theo received, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought and subtract that from the $10 she gave the cashier.

First, let's find the cost of the paper. The paper costs $1 less than three times the price of the pen. Since the pen costs $2, three times that is 3 * $2 = $6. The paper costs $1 less than that, so the paper costs $6 - $1 = $5.

The total cost of the items is the cost of the pen plus the cost of the paper, which is $2 + $5 = $7.

To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the $10 Theo gave the cashier: $10 - $7 = $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of pencils used and then subtract that from the initial number of pencils.

Initially, there are 30 students with 10 pencils each, so the total number of pencils is 30 * 10 = 300.

After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used. This means 1/5 * 300 = 60 pencils were used.

The remaining pencils after two months are 300 - 60 = 240.

At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. This means 1/3 * 240 = 80 pencils were left.

The final answer is: 80"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as 'x'. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as (x/2) + 2.

Since Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, we can set up the equation: (x/2) + 2 = 5.

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate the variable. First, subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: (x/2) = 5 - 2, which simplifies to (x/2) = 3.

Next, multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction: x = 3 * 2, which simplifies to x = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the combined length of the remoras, we need to convert their individual lengths to feet and then add them together. 

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 6 inches to feet by dividing by 12. 

6 inches / 12 = 0.5 feet

Since there are two remoras, we multiply the length of one remora by 2.

0.5 feet * 2 = 1 foot

Now, we add the length of the remoras to the length of the shark.

10 feet (shark) + 1 foot (remoras) = 11 feet

To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy, we divide the combined length of the remoras by the length of the shark and multiply by 100.

(1 foot / 10 feet) * 100 = 10%

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the total number of students as 'x'. We know that three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer, which means one-fourth do not have a desktop computer. Since 20 students do not have a desktop computer, we can set up the equation:

1/4 * x = 20

To solve for 'x', we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4 to isolate 'x':

x = 20 * 4
x = 80

So, there are 80 students at that grade level. 

The final answer is: 80"
"To find out how many days Jason has to break in the shoes, we need to multiply the number of days he has (21 days, since there are 7 days in a week and he has 3 weeks) by the number of days he walks per week (4 days). 

21 days * 4 days/week = 84 days

Now, we need to find out how many minutes he has to walk each day. To do this, we divide the total number of minutes (240 minutes) by the total number of days (84 days).

240 minutes / 84 days = 2.857 minutes/day

So, Jason has to spend approximately 2.86 minutes walking each day to break in the new shoes.

The final answer is: 2.86"
"To find out how many books each child got, we need to first determine the total number of books Sarah bought. Since each book costs $15 and she spent $300, we can divide the total amount spent by the cost of each book.

Total amount spent = $300
Cost of each book = $15

Total number of books = Total amount spent / Cost of each book
Total number of books = $300 / $15
Total number of books = 20

Since Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, we can divide the total number of books by 4 to find out how many books each child got.

Number of books per child = Total number of books / 4
Number of books per child = 20 / 4
Number of books per child = 5

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we need to first find the total number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts. We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to do this.

Let's denote:
- D as the set of kids allergic to dairy
- P as the set of kids allergic to peanuts

We know:
- |D| = 9 (number of kids allergic to dairy)
- |P| = 6 (number of kids allergic to peanuts)
- |D ∩ P| = 3 (number of kids allergic to both)

Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we can find the total number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts as:
|D ∪ P| = |D| + |P| - |D ∩ P|
|D ∪ P| = 9 + 6 - 3
|D ∪ P| = 12

Now, to find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we subtract the total number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts from the total number of kids in the class:
|D ∪ P| = 12
Total kids in the class = 32
Kids not allergic to anything = Total kids in the class - |D ∪ P|
Kids not allergic to anything = 32 - 12
Kids not allergic to anything = 20

"To find the total number of people going on the tour, we need to calculate the total number of employees and add the number of tour guides.

First, let's find the total number of employees: 
There are 3 groups of 200 employees each, so the total number of employees is 3 * 200 = 600.

Next, we need to add the number of tour guides. Each group has 7 tour guides, and there are 3 groups, so the total number of tour guides is 3 * 7 = 21.

Now, we add the total number of employees and tour guides: 600 (employees) + 21 (tour guides) = 621.

The final answer is: 621"
"To find the total cost of the trip, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel.

The cost of the plane tickets is $5000 each, and since there are two people, the total cost of the plane tickets is 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

The hotel is 20% more expensive than normal, so the new price is 1.2 * $1500 = $1800 per day. Since they are there for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is the sum of the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel, which is $10,000 + $5400 = $16,400.

The final answer is: $16,400"
"To find out how many tubes of paint Jasper has, we need to determine the number of tubes of blue and yellow paint he has.

Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint. Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, so Jasper has 4 / 2 = 2 tubes of blue paint.

Ben has 3 tubes of yellow paint. Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, so Jasper has 3 * 3 = 9 tubes of yellow paint.

To find the total number of tubes of paint Jasper has, we add the number of blue and yellow tubes: 2 (blue) + 9 (yellow) = 11.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we first need to determine the weight of the 2010 penny. 

Since the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can calculate its weight by multiplying the weight of the 1959 penny by 3/4.

Weight of 1959 penny = 48 grains
Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * 48 grains
Weight of 2010 penny = 36 grains

Now, we can find the combined weight of the two pennies by adding their individual weights.

Combined weight = Weight of 1959 penny + Weight of 2010 penny
Combined weight = 48 grains + 36 grains
Combined weight = 84 grains

The final answer is: 84"

"To find the total amount of money Stetson gave up, we first need to determine how many oranges he ate. Since Stetson ate 2/5 of the oranges and they picked 60 oranges, we can calculate the number of oranges he ate as follows:

Number of oranges eaten = (2/5) * 60
= 2 * 12
= 24

Since Stetson gave up $10 for each orange he ate, we can multiply the number of oranges eaten by the amount he gave up per orange:

Total amount given up = Number of oranges eaten * Amount per orange
= 24 * 10
= 240

"To find out how many hours James runs a week, we need to first calculate the total miles he runs in a week. Since he runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week, we multiply the miles per day by the number of days:

12 miles/day * 5 days/week = 60 miles/week

Next, we need to find out how many hours he runs in a week. We know he runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour. To find the total hours, we divide the total miles by the speed:

60 miles/week ÷ 10 miles/hour = 6 hours/week

So, James runs 6 hours a week.

"To determine the total amount of oats needed, we need to calculate the daily consumption of oats by the horses and then multiply it by the number of days.

Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and there are 2 meals per day. So, the daily consumption per horse is 5 pounds/meal * 2 meals = 10 pounds/day.

Since Uncle Ben has 4 horses, the total daily consumption is 10 pounds/day * 4 horses = 40 pounds/day.

For 5 days, the total consumption would be 40 pounds/day * 5 days = 200 pounds.

Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats, so the number of bags needed is 200 pounds / 50 pounds/bag = 4 bags.

"To find the cost per individual razor after the discount, we need to first calculate the total cost of 2 packs of razors with the sale and the coupon.

Since the razors are buy one get one free, Heather will only pay for 1 pack of razors. The cost of 1 pack is $4.00. She also has a $2.00 coupon, so the total cost of 1 pack will be $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since she buys 2 packs, the total cost will be 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

Now, we need to find the total number of razors in 2 packs. Since each pack contains 4 razors, 2 packs will contain 2 * 4 = 8 razors.

To find the cost per individual razor, we divide the total cost by the total number of razors: $4.00 / 8 = $0.50.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.50 * 100 = 50 cents.

3 * 64"" = 192""

The 2 girls on top of the 3 are also 64"" tall each. 
2 * 64"" = 128""

The shortest girl at the top is 60"" tall.

Now, we add up the heights of all the levels:
256"" + 192"" + 128"" + 60"" = 636""

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches):
636"" / 12 = 53 feet

"To find the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car, we need to calculate the cost of the morning rides and the cost of the afternoon rides separately, and then add them together.

The cost of the morning rides is the cost per ride multiplied by the number of rides. Since Paul drives twice a day for 14 days, he drives a total of 2 * 14 = 28 rides in the morning. The cost per ride is $6, so the total cost of the morning rides is 28 * $6 = $168.

The cost of the afternoon rides is also the cost per ride multiplied by the number of rides. Since Paul drives twice a day for 14 days, he drives a total of 2 * 14 = 28 rides in the afternoon. The cost per ride is $2, so the total cost of the afternoon rides is 28 * $2 = $56.

To find the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car, we add the cost of the morning rides and the cost of the afternoon rides: $168 + $56 = $224.

"To find out how many Greek orange pies Brianne and Ashley can make, we first need to determine the total number of oranges they have. 

Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so she has 5 * 10 = 50 oranges. 

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so she has 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

In total, they have 50 + 70 = 120 oranges.

Since one Greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, we can divide the total number of oranges by 3 to find out how many pies they can make: 120 / 3 = 40.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation for each venue and then equate them to find the break-even point.

Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'. 

For the first venue, the total cost is the flat fee of $200 plus the cost of food for each guest, which is $5x. So, the total cost for the first venue is 200 + 5x.

For the second venue, the total cost is the cost per guest, which is $25x.

To find the break-even point, we set the two costs equal to each other:

200 + 5x = 25x

Now, we need to solve for x. Subtract 5x from both sides:

200 = 20x

Now, divide both sides by 20:

10 = x

"Let's denote the number of insects David found as D, the number of insects Bodhi found as B, and the number of insects Lily found as L. 

We know that Lily found 7 more than David, so we can write an equation: L = D + 7.

We also know that David found half of what Bodhi found, so we can write another equation: D = B/2.

We are also given that together they collected 43 insects, so the sum of the insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43: L + D + B = 43.

Now we can substitute the first equation into the third equation: (D + 7) + D + B = 43.

Combine like terms: 2D + B + 7 = 43.

Subtract 7 from both sides: 2D + B = 36.

Now we can substitute the second equation into this one: 2(D) + B = 36, 2(B/2) + B = 36.

Simplify the equation: B + B = 36.

Combine like terms: 2B = 36.

Divide both sides by 2: B = 18.

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects David found: D = B/2 = 18/2 = 9.

Finally, we can find the number of insects Lily found: L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16.

"To find the total yards of yarn used, we need to calculate the yards used by Mariah and her grandma separately and then add them together.

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, and there are 364 yards in a skein. To find 1/4 of 364, we multiply 364 by 1/4 (which is the same as dividing by 4).

364 yards / 4 = 91 yards

So, Mariah used 91 yards of yarn.

Mariah's grandma used 1/2 of a skein, which is the same as 2/4. To find 2/4 of 364, we multiply 364 by 2 and then divide by 4.

364 * 2 = 728
728 / 4 = 182 yards

So, Mariah's grandma used 182 yards of yarn.

Now, we add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma together.

91 yards (Mariah) + 182 yards (grandma) = 273 yards

"Let's break down the information given. Suzie bought 4 packs of gum in total. She bought 2 packs of strawberry gum, 1 pack of grape gum for $2, and 1 pack of green apple gum. 

Since she paid half as much for the green apple gum as she did for the grape gum, the green apple gum cost $2 / 2 = $1.

The total cost of the 3 packs of gum (grape, green apple, and 1 pack of strawberry) is $7. So, the total cost of the 3 packs is $7. 

The cost of the 3 packs is $7, and the cost of the green apple gum is $1. The cost of the grape gum is $2. So, the total cost of the 2 packs of strawberry gum is $7 - $1 - $2 = $4.

Since Suzie bought 2 packs of strawberry gum, the cost of each pack of strawberry gum is $4 / 2 = $2.

"To find the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to determine which type of wood gives him the most sticks per dollar spent. 

Let's calculate the cost per stick for each type of wood:

For a 2 x 4 piece of wood, Frederick can get 200 sticks for $4. 
Cost per stick = $4 / 200 sticks = $0.02 per stick

For a 2 x 8 piece of wood, Frederick can get 400 sticks for $6.
Cost per stick = $6 / 400 sticks = $0.015 per stick

Since the 2 x 8 piece of wood gives him the most sticks per dollar, we'll use that to maximize the number of popsicle sticks. 

Now, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces of wood Frederick can buy with his $24:
Number of 2 x 8 pieces = $24 / $6 = 4

Since each 2 x 8 piece of wood gives him 400 sticks, the total number of sticks he can make is:
Total sticks = 4 * 400 = 1600

The final answer is: 1600"
"To find the total cost of snowshoes for Mario's dogs, we first need to determine the total number of snowshoes required. Since each dog has 4 legs and Mario has 6 dogs, the total number of legs is 6 * 4 = 24.

Since each dog needs a pair of snowshoes, and each pair covers 4 legs, we need to divide the total number of legs by 4 to get the total number of pairs of snowshoes required. However, since each dog needs a pair, we simply need to multiply the number of dogs by 2 (one pair per dog).

So, the total number of pairs of snowshoes required is 6 * 2 = 12.

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of pairs of snowshoes by the cost per pair, which is $12.00.

Total cost = 12 * $12.00 = $144.00

The final answer is: $144.00"
"To find out how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips for a week and then subtract the cost of the weekly pass.

Janet takes two bus trips per day, five days a week. So, the total number of bus trips per week is 2 * 5 = 10.

Each bus trip costs $2.20, so the total cost of her bus trips for a week is 10 * $2.20 = $22.

The weekly bus pass costs $20. To find out how much Janet would save, we subtract the cost of the pass from the total cost of her bus trips: $22 - $20 = $2.

Therefore, Janet would save $2 by buying a weekly bus pass.

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of cows and sheep at both the farm and the zoo, and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of cows at the zoo. We know the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, and the farm has 30 cows. So, the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.

Next, let's find the number of sheep at the farm. We know the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does. Since the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's find the total number of animals at the farm. The farm has 30 cows and 10 sheep, so the total number of animals at the farm is 30 + 10 = 40.

The total number of animals at the zoo is 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80.

Finally, let's add the total number of animals at the farm and the zoo together: 40 + 80 = 120.

The final answer is: 120"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many items Sophia bought. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of items Sophia bought, we can represent the number of items Sophia bought as 'x'. 

Rose bought 4 times the number of items Sophia bought, so the total number of items Rose bought is 4x. We know that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, so the total number of items Rose bought is 12 + 4 = 16. 

Since Rose bought 4 times the number of items Sophia bought, we can set up the equation 4x = 16. To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 4, which gives us x = 4.

So, Sophia bought 4 items in total. Since we don't know how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can represent the number of onions Sophia bought as 'a' and the number of potatoes as 'b'. We know that a + b = 4.

However, we can also represent the number of onions and potatoes Rose bought in terms of 'a' and 'b'. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of items Sophia bought, we can write the equation 4(a + b) = 12 + 4. 

Simplifying the equation, we get 4a + 4b = 16. Dividing both sides of the equation by 4, we get a + b = 4. 

Since we already know that a + b = 4, we can conclude that a = 2 and b = 2. Therefore, Sophia bought 2 onions and 2 potatoes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the number of days Andy has to reach his goal, we need to calculate the time difference between his birthday and today. 

December has 31 days, and his birthday is on the 19th of July, which is the 7th month. So, we need to calculate the days from December 31st to July 19th.

December has 31 days, so from December 31st to December 31st is 0 days. 
January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. 
February has 28 days (assuming a non-leap year), so from February 1st to February 28th is 28 days. 
March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 31st is 31 days. 
April has 30 days, so from April 1st to April 30th is 30 days. 
May has 31 days, so from May 1st to May 31st is 31 days. 
June has 30 days, so from June 1st to June 30th is 30 days. 
July has 19 days, so from July 1st to July 19th is 19 days.

Total days = 0 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 180 days

Now, we need to calculate the total calories Andy needs to burn to reach his goal. 
He wants to lose 30 pounds, and he needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound. 
Total calories = 30 pounds * 3500 calories/pound = 105,000 calories

Now, we need to calculate the daily calorie deficit. 
Daily calorie deficit = Total calories / Total days 
= 105,000 calories / 180 days 
= 583.33 calories/day

The final answer is: 583.33"
"To find out how much Gerald has left, we need to calculate his total earnings for the week and then subtract the amount he spent.

Since Gerald works for a week, which has 7 days, and he earns $30 per day, his total earnings for the week would be:

$30/day * 7 days = $210

Now, we subtract the amount he spent from his total earnings:

$210 - $100 = $110

Gerald has $110 left."
"To find out how many milliliters of water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total distance she will run. Since each lap is 0.25 km and she needs to run 8 laps, we multiply the number of laps by the distance per lap.

Distance = Number of laps * Distance per lap
Distance = 8 * 0.25 km
Distance = 2 km

Since Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs, we multiply the total distance by the amount of water needed per kilometer.

Total water needed = Distance * Water per kilometer
Total water needed = 2 km * 60 ml/km
Total water needed = 120 ml

The final answer is: 120"
"To find out how much money Julie had left, we need to calculate the amount she spent on clothes and CDs, and then subtract that from the initial amount.

First, let's calculate the amount she spent on clothes: 20% of $500 is 0.20 x $500 = $100.

Now, let's subtract the amount spent on clothes from the initial amount: $500 - $100 = $400.

Next, let's calculate the amount she spent on CDs: 25% of $400 is 0.25 x $400 = $100.

Now, let's subtract the amount spent on CDs from the remaining amount: $400 - $100 = $300.

The final answer is: $300"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let's denote the cost of the lot as 'x'. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write the equation: x + 3x = 120,000.

Combining like terms, we get 4x = 120,000.

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 4: x = 120,000 / 4 = 30,000.

Since the cost of the house is 3x, we multiply x by 3: 3 * 30,000 = 90,000.

The house cost $90,000.

The final answer is: $90,000"
"To find the profit, we first need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

The total cost is the cost of the canvas bags, which is 8 packs * 5 bags per pack * $4 per bag = 8 * 5 * 4 = $160.

The total revenue is the selling price of the bags, which is 8 bags * $8 per bag = 8 * 8 = $64.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $64 - $160 = -$96. However, since profit cannot be negative, it seems there's an error in the problem. Assuming the problem is meant to be a positive profit, let's re-evaluate the problem.

If we assume the total revenue is higher than the total cost, we can re-calculate the profit. However, given the information, the total revenue is less than the total cost, indicating a loss.

However, if we assume the problem is meant to be a positive profit, we can re-calculate the total revenue and cost. 

Let's assume the total revenue is higher than the total cost. The total revenue is $64, and the total cost is $160. To make the profit positive, the total revenue should be higher than the total cost.

Let's assume the total revenue is $200. The profit would be $200 - $160 = $40.

However, the problem states that the total revenue is $64. To make the profit positive, we need to re-calculate the selling price of the bags.

Let's assume the selling price per bag is x. The total revenue is 8 * x = $64. To find the selling price per bag, we can divide the total revenue by the number of bags: x = $64 / 8 = $8.

Since the selling price per bag is already $8, the problem as stated does not allow for a positive profit. However, if we assume the problem is meant to be a positive profit, we can re-calculate the cost of the bags.

Let's assume the cost per bag is y. The total cost is 8 * 5 * y = $160. To find the cost per bag, we can divide the total cost by the number of bags: y = $160 / (8 * 5) = $4.

However, the problem states that the cost per bag is $4. Since the selling price per bag is $8, the profit per bag is $8 - $4 = $4. The total profit is 8 bags * $4 per bag = $32.

The final answer is: $32"
"To find the total number of punches Joe threw, we need to calculate the total time of the fight and multiply it by the average punches thrown per minute.

The fight lasts for 5 rounds of 3 minutes each, so the total time is 5 * 3 = 15 minutes.

Since Joe throws 25 punches per minute, the total number of punches thrown is 15 * 25 = 375.

The final answer is: 375"
"To find out how many cookies Kelsie made, we need to first determine how many cookies Josh made. Since Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, and Suzanne made 36 cookies, we can calculate Josh's cookies as follows:

Josh's cookies = Suzanne's cookies / 4
Josh's cookies = 36 / 4
Josh's cookies = 9

Now that we know Josh made 9 cookies, we can find out how many Kelsie made. Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh, so we can calculate Kelsie's cookies as follows:

Kelsie's cookies = 2 * Josh's cookies
Kelsie's cookies = 2 * 9
Kelsie's cookies = 18

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total amount of money Ali has. 

Ali has four $10 bills, which is 4 * $10 = $40. 
He also has six $20 bills, which is 6 * $20 = $120. 
The total amount of money Ali has is $40 + $120 = $160.

Ali gives his sister half of the total money, which is $160 / 2 = $80. 
So, Ali is left with $160 - $80 = $80.

Now, Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount to buy dinner. 
3/5 of $80 is (3/5) * $80 = $48.

To find the amount of money Ali has after buying dinner, we subtract the amount he spent from the remaining amount: 
$80 - $48 = $32.

"To find the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour, we need to calculate the individual rates of each person and then add them together.

Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Bobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony, so Bobby can pick 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.

Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy can pick 2 * 5 = 10 quarts per hour.

Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy, so Ricky can pick 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

Now, let's add the individual rates together to find the total number of quarts of strawberries that they can pick per hour: 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29.

"To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we first need to determine how many cups of raisins she has available for the oatmeal cookies. 

Since she wants to divide the raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, we can divide the total number of cups of raisins by 3. 

Total cups of raisins = 27
Cups of raisins for oatmeal cookies = Total cups of raisins / 3
Cups of raisins for oatmeal cookies = 27 / 3
Cups of raisins for oatmeal cookies = 9

Now, we need to find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make with 9 cups of raisins. Each batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins. 

Number of batches = Cups of raisins for oatmeal cookies / Cups of raisins per batch
Number of batches = 9 / (3/4)
To divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal.
Number of batches = 9 * (4/3)
Number of batches = 12

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we first need to calculate her daily and weekly electric consumption before and after adding the new device.

Before adding the new device, Ada's daily electric consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. Since there are 24 hours in a day, her daily consumption is 12 * 24 = 288 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per day.

After adding the new device, her daily consumption will be 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour. So, her daily consumption will be 14 * 24 = 336 kWh per day.

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7. 

Before adding the new device, Ada's weekly consumption is 288 * 7 = 2016 kWh.
After adding the new device, her weekly consumption is 336 * 7 = 2352 kWh.

The cost of electricity is $1.50 per kWh. So, the weekly cost before adding the new device is 2016 * $1.50 = $3024.
The weekly cost after adding the new device is 2352 * $1.50 = $3528.

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is $3528 - $3024 = $504.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how long it would take one person to paint a whole house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, it would take them twice as long to paint a whole house, which is 10 days.

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can calculate the total hours it would take one person to paint a whole house by multiplying the number of days by 24:

10 days * 24 hours/day = 240 hours

Now, if 5 people are painting a whole house, we can divide the total hours it would take one person to paint a whole house by the number of people:

240 hours / 5 people = 48 hours

So, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off. So, the number of people left on the bus is 48 - 8 = 40.

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (which is 8) get into the bus. So, 5 * 8 = 40 people get in. Now, the total number of people on the bus is 40 (who were already there) + 40 (who got in) = 80.

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off. So, the number of people left on the bus is 80 - 21 = 59.

Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on. Since 21 got off, 3 times fewer would be 21 / 3 = 7. So, 7 people get in. Now, the total number of people on the bus is 59 (who were already there) + 7 (who got in) = 66.

The final number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop is 66."

   Jame's age in 8 years will be 22 + 8 = 30 years.
   Twice Jame's age in 8 years will be 2 * 30 = 60 years.
   So, Jame's cousin's age in 8 years will be 60 - 5 = 55 years.
3. Since Jame's cousin will be 55 in 8 years, his current age is 55 - 8 = 47 years.

"To find the cost of one monitor, we first need to determine the cost of the printer. Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, and the computer cost $1,100, the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700.

The total cost of the computer and the printer is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800. 

Since Errol bought 2 monitors, the cost of the two monitors is the total cost minus the cost of the computer and the printer: $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.

To find the cost of one monitor, we divide the total cost of the monitors by 2: $600 / 2 = $300.

Now, we know that the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 600 + 4 * 60 shells.

First, we calculate 4 times the number of shells brought by the boys: 4 * 60 = 240.

Then, we add this to the number of shells brought by the boys: 600 + 240 = 840.

Since there are 10 girls (half of 20 kids), we need to find out how many shells each girl brought. To do this, we divide the total number of shells brought by the girls by the number of girls: 840 / 10 = 84.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much Elvis needs to save in the first half of the month. 

Let's assume the number of days in the first half of the month is x. Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half, the number of days in the second half is also x.

The total number of days in the month is 30 (April has 30 days). So, the total number of days in the first half is 15 (half of 30).

Now, let's denote the amount Elvis saves in the first half as y. Then, the amount he saves in the second half is 2y.

The total amount Elvis needs to save in the month is $1125. So, we can set up the equation:

y + 2y = 1125

Combine like terms:

3y = 1125

Divide both sides by 3:

y = 375

Now that we know Elvis saves $375 in the first half, we can find out how much he needs to save in the second half. Since he saves twice as much in the second half, the amount he saves in the second half is 2y = 2 * 375 = 750.

"To find out how much more Jairus will get than Jenny, we need to calculate the total amount each of them will receive and then find the difference.

Jairus gets $0.8 for each task, and he finished 20 tasks. So, his total earnings will be 0.8 * 20 = $16.

Jenny gets $0.5 for each task, and she also finished 20 tasks. So, her total earnings will be 0.5 * 20 = $10.

Now, let's find the difference between Jairus' and Jenny's earnings: 16 - 10 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let's represent the amount of money Brad gets as 'x'. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff's amount can be represented as 4x.

We know that the total amount of money they are dividing is $100. So, the sum of the money Jeff and Brad get should equal $100. We can write this as an equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms:

5x = 100

Now, divide both sides by 5 to solve for x:

x = 20

Since x represents the amount Brad gets, and Jeff gets 4 times as much, we can find Jeff's amount by multiplying x by 4:

Jeff's amount = 4x = 4 * 20 = 80

The final answer is: $80"
"To find the total miles Jeff walks in a week, we need to calculate the total miles he walks each day and then multiply it by the number of days he works in a week.

Since Jeff walks to work and back each day, the total miles he walks each day is 2 times the distance to work, which is 2 * 3 miles = 6 miles.

Now, we multiply the daily miles by the number of days he works in a week: 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week.

The final answer is: 30"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Elise writes the alphabet in full twice, which means she writes 26 letters each time. So, she writes 26 + 26 = 52 letters in the first two steps.

2. Then, she writes half of the alphabet once. Half of the alphabet is 26 / 2 = 13 letters.

3. So, after the first three steps, Elise has written 52 + 13 = 65 letters.

4. Finally, she re-writes everything she has already written. This means she re-writes 65 letters.

5. To find the total number of letters Elise has written, we add the letters she wrote in the first three steps to the letters she re-wrote: 65 + 65 = 130.

The final answer is: 130"

"To find Mark's initial weight, we need to calculate the total weight he lost and then add that to his final weight.

Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, so the total weight he lost is:
10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds

Now, we add the total weight lost to his final weight to find his initial weight:
Initial weight = Final weight + Total weight lost
Initial weight = 70 pounds + 30 pounds
Initial weight = 100 pounds

The final answer is: 100"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many toys Jonathan needs to have a play set five times larger than James's. Since James's play set has 80 toys, a play set five times larger would have 5 * 80 = 400 toys.

Since Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have enough toys to make a play set five times larger than James's, we can set up an equation: x + 2 = 400, where x is the number of toys Jonathan currently has.

To find x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 2 from both sides: x = 400 - 2.

x = 398

So, Jonathan currently has 398 toys."
"To find the total cost of the items Daniel wants to buy, we first need to calculate the cost of each item without the discount. 

The cost of 5 notebooks at $1.50 each is 5 * $1.50 = $7.50.
The cost of 2 pens at $0.25 each is 2 * $0.25 = $0.50.
The cost of 1 calculator at $12 is $12.
The cost of 1 geometry set at $10 is $10.

The total cost of all the items without the discount is $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30.

Since the shop gives a 10% discount on all the purchased items, we need to calculate 10% of $30, which is 0.1 * $30 = $3.

The total cost with the discount is $30 - $3 = $27.

The cost of five cans of fruit drinks at $2 each is 5 x $2 = $10.

Now, let's add the costs together: $20 + $3 + $10 = $33.

Carly pays with a $50 bill, so the change she gets back is $50 - $33 = $17.

The final answer is: $17"
"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we need to break down her sales into two parts: the first $1000 and the sales above $1000.

For the first $1000, she earns a 30% commission:
$1000 * 0.30 = $300

For the sales above $1000, which is $2500 - $1000 = $1500, she earns an additional 10% commission:
$1500 * 0.10 = $150

Now, we add the two amounts together to find her total earnings:
$300 + $150 = $450

The final answer is: $450"
"To determine how many additional bottles of water Bill needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles he already has and the total number of bottles he needs.

Bill started with 2 cases of water, each containing 24 bottles. So, the total number of bottles he has is 2 * 24 = 48.

Since Bill wants to have 2 bottles of water for each of his 70 guests, the total number of bottles he needs is 70 * 2 = 140.

To find out how many additional bottles he needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles he needs: 140 - 48 = 92.

Therefore, Bill needs to buy 92 additional bottles of water.

The final answer is: 92"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. 

When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as in cold water. Since it takes Ray 16 minutes to swim a mile in cold water, twice that time is 2 * 16 = 32 minutes. Adding 2 minutes to that gives us 32 + 2 = 34 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water. 

In cold water, it takes Ray 16 minutes to swim a mile, so to swim 3 miles it will take him 3 * 16 = 48 minutes.

In warm water, it takes Ray 34 minutes to swim a mile, so to swim 3 miles it will take him 3 * 34 = 102 minutes.

The difference in time between swimming 3 miles in warm water and cold water is 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

"To find the average weight of the three friends, we first need to find their individual weights. 

Mark's weight is given as 150 pounds. 
Susan's weight is 20 pounds less than Mark's, so Susan's weight is 150 - 20 = 130 pounds. 
Bob's weight is twice as much as Susan's, so Bob's weight is 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, we need to find the average weight of the three friends. To do this, we add their weights and divide by 3. 
Average weight = (Mark's weight + Susan's weight + Bob's weight) / 3 
Average weight = (150 + 130 + 260) / 3 
Average weight = 540 / 3 
Average weight = 180

"To solve this problem, we need to find the total angle the sun will be from the ground after 10 hours. 

The initial angle of the sun from the ground is 32 degrees (the angle of the pyramid). The sun is moving 5 degrees per hour upward. 

After 10 hours, the sun will have moved 10 * 5 = 50 degrees upward.

So, the total angle from the ground to the sun will be the initial angle of the pyramid (32 degrees) plus the angle the sun has moved upward (50 degrees).

Total angle = 32 + 50 = 82 degrees.

"To find out how many packs of candles James needs to buy, we first need to determine the total number of candles required. Since James has two sons, one 12 years old and the other 4 years younger, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Typically, birthday candles are used in the number equal to the age of the person. Therefore, James needs 12 candles for the older son and 8 candles for the younger son, totaling 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we need to find out how many packs James needs to buy. To do this, we divide the total number of candles needed (20) by the number of candles in a pack (5). 

20 / 5 = 4

So, James needs to buy 4 packs of candles. 

The cost of 4 packs of candles is 4 * $3 = $12.

"To find out how many pages Judy read in the first week, we need to calculate the total minutes she read in the first week and then convert that to pages. 

In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night. Since there are 7 nights in a week, she read for a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes in the first week.

Given that Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we can find out how many pages she read in the first week by first finding out how many 1.5 minute intervals are in 105 minutes. 

To do this, we divide 105 by 1.5, which equals 70. So, in the first week, Judy read 70 * 2 = 140 pages.

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

To find the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we add the pages she read in the first week to the pages she read in the second week: 140 + 100 = 240.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. 

First, the tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth. 

Then, for the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 each, so that's 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.

For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as Sharon had received for each of the previous three teeth. Since Sharon received $1.00 for each of the previous three teeth, half of that is $0.50. So, for the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon: $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many goals Mark and Anna scored. 

Let's start with Anna's goals. We know that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, and Richie scored 80 goals. So, we can set up an equation to find Anna's goals:

Richie's goals = Anna's goals + 45
80 = Anna's goals + 45

Now, we can solve for Anna's goals by subtracting 45 from both sides of the equation:

Anna's goals = 80 - 45
Anna's goals = 35

Now that we know Anna's goals, we can find Mark's goals. We know that Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, and Richie scored 80 goals. So, we can set up an equation to find Mark's goals:

Richie's goals = Mark's goals + 20
80 = Mark's goals + 20

Now, we can solve for Mark's goals by subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation:

Mark's goals = 80 - 20
Mark's goals = 60

Now that we know Mark's and Anna's goals, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers:

Total goals = Richie's goals + Mark's goals + Anna's goals
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35
Total goals = 175

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Peter spent on wooden action figures and the total amount he spent on plastic action figures, then determine how many of each type he can buy.

First, let's calculate the amount spent on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday. Peter spent $5 each day for 4 days, so the total amount spent on wooden action figures is 5 * 4 = $20.

Next, let's calculate the amount Peter has left after buying wooden action figures. He started with $70 and spent $20, so he has 70 - 20 = $50 left.

Now, let's calculate the number of plastic action figures Peter can buy with the remaining money. He has $50 left and each plastic action figure costs $2, so he can buy 50 / 2 = 25 plastic action figures.

Since Peter buys plastic action figures from Thursday through Saturday, he will buy 5 plastic action figures each day for 4 days. So, the total number of plastic action figures he buys is 5 * 4 = 20.

To find the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we add the number of wooden action figures (4) and the number of plastic action figures (20). 

The total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is 4 + 20 = 24.

"To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we first need to calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week and then per month.

The total number of roses ordered per week is 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered per month is 65 * 4 = 260 roses.

Ford grows 40 roses every week, so the total number of roses he grows per month is 40 * 4 = 160 roses.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the total number of roses he grows per month from the total number of roses ordered per month: 260 - 160 = 100 roses.

"To find out how much money will be remaining in Katina's account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount of money she will have removed from her account and subtract that from the initial amount.

There are 12 months in a year, so in 2 years, there are 2 x 12 = 24 months.

Katina removes $100 from her account every month, so in 24 months, she will remove 24 x $100 = $2400.

Now, we subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount: $3000 - $2400 = $600.

So, after 2 years, Katina will have $600 remaining in her account.

"To calculate the net profit, we need to find the total revenue and total cost.

The total revenue is the number of sandwiches sold multiplied by the price per sandwich. 
10 sandwiches * $7.00 per sandwich = $70.00

The total cost consists of the cost of bread and the cost of cheese and condiments. 
The cost of bread is $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches. 
So, the cost of bread per sandwich is $3.00 / 10 sandwiches = $0.30 per sandwich.
The cost of cheese and condiments per 10 sandwiches is $30.00, so the cost per sandwich is $30.00 / 10 sandwiches = $3.00 per sandwich.
The total cost per sandwich is $0.30 (bread) + $3.00 (cheese and condiments) = $3.30 per sandwich.
The total cost for 10 sandwiches is $3.30 per sandwich * 10 sandwiches = $33.00.

The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00
Net profit = $37.00

The final answer is: $37.00"
"To find out how much money Kate can make, we first need to determine the total number of muffin crayons she can make. Since Kate melts 8 small pieces of crayons together in each muffin tin, and there are 3 boxes of 64 crayons, we need to find the total number of small pieces of crayons.

First, we find the total number of small pieces of crayons: 
3 boxes * 64 crayons per box = 192 crayons

Since each muffin tin contains 8 small pieces of crayons, we divide the total number of crayons by 8 to find the total number of muffin crayons:
192 crayons / 8 crayons per muffin = 24 muffin crayons

Now, we can find the total amount of money Kate can make by multiplying the number of muffin crayons by the price per muffin crayon:
24 muffin crayons * $1.50 per muffin = $36

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the area of the bedroom and then calculate the cost of the new carpet, padding, and installation.

The area of the bedroom is the length multiplied by the width: 
Area = length * width
Area = 18 * 12
Area = 216 square feet

The cost of the new carpet is $12 per square foot, so the total cost of the carpet is:
Carpet cost = Area * $12
Carpet cost = 216 * $12
Carpet cost = $2592

The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot, so the total cost of the padding is:
Padding cost = Area * $2
Padding cost = 216 * $2
Padding cost = $432

The cost of removing the old carpet is $4 per square foot, so the total cost of removing the old carpet is:
Removal cost = Area * $4
Removal cost = 216 * $4
Removal cost = $864

The cost of installing the new carpet is $34 per square foot, so the total cost of installation is:
Installation cost = Area * $34
Installation cost = 216 * $34
Installation cost = $7344

The total cost is the sum of the carpet cost, padding cost, removal cost, and installation cost:

"To find the percentage by which the oven is off, we need to calculate the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature, and then divide it by the set temperature.

The difference between the actual and set temperature is 468 - 450 = 18 degrees.

The percentage by which the oven is off is (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%.

Since the oven is off by 4% for any recipe, we need to find the temperature that is 4% less than 520 degrees.

First, we find 4% of 520: 0.04 * 520 = 20.8.

Then, we subtract 20.8 from 520 to get the temperature Maggie should set: 520 - 20.8 = 499.2.

"To find the cost per pair of contacts, we first need to determine the total number of contacts and the total cost of the boxes.

Since 90 contacts last Pete 45 days, we can find the number of contacts he uses per day by dividing 90 by 45:

90 contacts / 45 days = 2 contacts per day

Since Pete buys 2 boxes, the total number of contacts will be:

90 contacts/box * 2 boxes = 180 contacts

The total cost of the boxes with a 10% discount is:

$100.00 * 2 boxes = $200.00
10% discount = $200.00 * 0.10 = $20.00
Total cost with discount = $200.00 - $20.00 = $180.00

Now, we can find the cost per pair of contacts by dividing the total cost by the total number of contacts:

Cost per pair = Total cost / Total number of contacts
= $180.00 / 180
= $1.00

The final answer is: $1.00"
"To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we need to calculate their individual earnings first.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, for a total of 3 hours. Her hourly wage is $10, so her total earnings are 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 hours. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, which is 3 * 1 = 3 hours. So, John worked a total of 4 + 3 = 7 hours. His total earnings are 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find out how much water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total calories she burns during her activities. 

She spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories/hour. So, the total calories burned from aerobics is 2 * 500 = 1000 calories.

She also spends 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories/hour. So, the total calories burned from running is 1 * 600 = 600 calories.

The total calories burned is the sum of calories burned from aerobics and running, which is 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns, we need to divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many times she needs to drink 100 ml of water.

Total calories burned / 200 = 1600 / 200 = 8

So, Hannah needs to drink 8 * 100 ml of water.

The final answer is: 800"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G.

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so B + R + G = 4500.

We also know that R = 0.99B (1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans) and G = 1.01B (1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans).

Substituting the expressions for R and G into the first equation, we get:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

3.01B = 4500

Divide both sides by 3.01:

B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

R = 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
G = 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is:

G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the average of the three measurements, we need to first find the third measurement. Jared's initial typing speed is 47 WPM, and it increased to 52 WPM. If he continues to increase his typing speed once more by 5 words, his new typing speed will be 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

Now, we have the three measurements: 47, 52, and 57. To find the average, we add them up and divide by 3.

Average = (47 + 52 + 57) / 3
Average = 156 / 3
Average = 52

The final answer is: 52"
"To find the difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks, we need to calculate the weight change for each option and then find the difference.

If Martin eats Cheerios every day for breakfast, he'll lose 1.25 pounds/week. After 5 weeks, he'll lose 1.25 * 5 = 6.25 pounds.

If Martin eats donuts every day for breakfast, he'll gain 1.75 pounds/week. After 5 weeks, he'll gain 1.75 * 5 = 8.75 pounds.

The difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options is 8.75 - 6.25 = 2.5 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2.5}$"
"To determine the total number of people attending, we need to calculate the number of people invited via email, the number of friends Alex's friends will bring, and the number of Alex's friends and their spouses.

First, let's calculate the number of people invited via email. Each of the 100 people invited will bring 2 friends, so the total number of people invited via email is 100 + (100 * 2) = 300.

Next, Alex calls 10 friends and 8 of them will bring their spouses, so the total number of Alex's friends and their spouses is 10 + 8 = 18.

Now, we add the number of people invited via email and the number of Alex's friends and their spouses to get the total number of people attending. 

Total number of people = 300 (via email) + 18 (Alex's friends and their spouses) = 318

However, we also need to consider Alex herself, so we add 1 to the total number of people.

Total number of people = 318 + 1 = 319

Therefore, Alex will need 319 seats.

The final answer is: 319"
"To find the weight of the Mastiff, we need to start from the Papillon's weight. The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, and the Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher. 

First, we find the Dachshund's weight: 10 pounds * 2 = 20 pounds.

Then, we find the Papillon's weight: 20 pounds / 4 = 5 pounds.

Finally, we find the Mastiff's weight: 5 pounds * 44 = 220 pounds.

The final answer is: 220"
"To find the total cost of the boots on eBay, we need to calculate the shipping cost first. Since the shipping cost on eBay is twice as much as it is on Amazon, and the shipping cost on Amazon is $4, the shipping cost on eBay is 2 * $4 = $8.

The total cost of the boots on eBay is the cost of the boots plus the shipping cost, which is $13 + $8 = $21.

The total cost of the boots on Amazon is $16 + $4 = $20.

To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we subtract the total cost on Amazon from the total cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To solve this problem, we can use exponential growth. The initial height of the beanstalk is 4 feet, and it doubles every day. We want to find the number of days it takes for the beanstalk to be taller than 20 feet.

Let's start by calculating the height of the beanstalk for each day:

Day 1: 4 feet
Day 2: 8 feet
Day 3: 16 feet
Day 4: 32 feet

As we can see, the beanstalk is taller than 20 feet on the 4th day. Therefore, it will take 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to first find out how many grams of protein he gets per day. 

Since a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein, we can find the protein percentage in a cup of mushrooms by dividing the protein by the weight: 3 grams / 100 grams = 0.03 or 3%.

Now, we know that John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day. To find out how many grams of protein he gets per day, we multiply the weight of mushrooms he eats by the protein percentage: 200 grams * 0.03 = 6 grams of protein per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7 to find the weekly protein intake: 6 grams/day * 7 days/week = 42 grams of protein per week.

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's break down the information given. If Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can represent his current age as 'x'. 

Five years ago, Jerry's age would be 'x - 5'. According to the problem, Jerry's current age is twice his age 5 years ago, so we can write the equation: x = 2(x - 5).

Simplifying the equation, we get: x = 2x - 10.

Subtracting '2x' from both sides of the equation, we get: -x = -10.

Dividing both sides by -1, we get: x = 10.

So, Jerry's current age is 10 years. 

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age: 10 + 3 = 13.

The final answer is: 13"
"To find out how many hours George needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the dental work. 

The base price for two implants is 2 * $2000 = $4000. 
For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain, which costs an extra $500. So, the total cost for the implants with the crown is $4000 + $500 = $4500. 
However, since he's already put down a deposit of $600, we subtract that from the total cost: $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Now, we need to find out how many hours George needs to work to earn $3900 at $15 per hour. 

To do this, we divide the total amount he needs to earn ($3900) by his hourly wage ($15): $3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

The final answer is: 260"
"Let's denote the smallest angle as 'x'. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it's 2x. The other angle is three times the smallest angle, so it's 3x.

We know that the sum of the three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:

One angle is twice the smallest angle: 2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees
The other angle is three times the smallest angle: 3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has in cents. 

First, let's convert the quarters to cents: 8 quarters * 25 cents/quarter = 200 cents.
Next, let's convert the dimes to cents: 6 dimes * 10 cents/dime = 60 cents.
Then, we already have the number of nickels in cents: 14 nickels * 5 cents/nickel = 70 cents.
Lastly, let's convert the pennies to cents: 15 pennies * 1 cent/penny = 15 cents.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money Colby has: 200 cents + 60 cents + 70 cents + 15 cents = 345 cents.

Since each gumball costs a nickel (5 cents), we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball: 345 cents / 5 cents = 69.

The final answer is: 69"
"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of pet and then add them together.

Dogs have 4 legs each, and there are 5 dogs, so the total number of dog legs is 5 x 4 = 20.

Cats have 4 legs each, and there are 2 cats, so the total number of cat legs is 2 x 4 = 8.

Birds have 2 legs each, and there are 10 birds, so the total number of bird legs is 10 x 2 = 20.

Now, we add the total number of legs for each type of pet: 20 (dog legs) + 8 (cat legs) + 20 (bird legs) = 48.

The total number of legs in the pet store is 48."
"To find the weight Jamaal uses after increasing the 8-pound weight by 50%, we first need to calculate 50% of 8 pounds. 

50% of 8 pounds is 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds. 

Now, we add this to the original weight: 8 pounds + 4 pounds = 12 pounds. 

However, Jamaal finds this weight too heavy, so he uses a weight two pounds lighter than this. 

The weight he now uses is 12 pounds - 2 pounds = 10 pounds.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of games Steve receives each year and then sum them up over the three years.

In the first year, Steve gets 5 games as a birthday gift and 5 games as Christmas gifts, for a total of 10 games. He also buys 1 game per month for 12 months, which is 12 games. So, in total, he has 10 + 12 = 22 games in the first year.

In the second year, Steve gets 5 games as birthday and Christmas gifts, for a total of 10 games. He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, which is 24 games. So, in total, he has 10 + 24 = 34 games in the second year.

In the third year, Steve gets 5 games as birthday and Christmas gifts, for a total of 10 games. He buys 4 games per month for 12 months, which is 48 games. So, in total, he has 10 + 48 = 58 games in the third year.

"To find the rate at which the plane is traveling, we need to divide the distance it traveled by the time it took. 

Distance = 1200 miles
Time = 3 hours

Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Rate = 400 miles per hour

Now, we need to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this rate.

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

Since the question asks for the additional hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles, we need to subtract the initial 3 hours from the total time.

Additional Time = Total Time - Initial Time
Additional Time = 5 hours - 3 hours
Additional Time = 2 hours

"To find the total amount of chocolates made by Marissa in an hour, we need to first find out how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz makes in an hour. 

Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. To find out how many pounds he makes in an hour, we divide 120 by 2. 

120 / 2 = 60 pounds per hour for Ruiz.

Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in 2 hours. Since Ruiz makes 60 pounds in an hour, we need to find 3/4 of 120 pounds (which is what Ruiz makes in 2 hours). 

3/4 * 120 = 90 pounds per hour for Marissa.

Now, we know that Ruiz makes 60 pounds per hour and Marissa makes 90 pounds per hour. They both work for 12 hours a day. 

Ruiz's total production in 12 hours = 60 * 12 = 720 pounds
Marissa's total production in 12 hours = 90 * 12 = 1080 pounds

Total amount of chocolates made together = 720 + 1080 = 1800 pounds

"To find out how much money Joe will have left after the purchase, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he wants to buy and then subtract that from the initial amount of money he has.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount. The shirt costs $25 and the shorts cost $35, so the total cost is $25 + $35 = $60.

Since there's a 30% off sale, we need to calculate the discount amount. To do this, we multiply the total cost by the discount percentage (30% or 0.3). The discount amount is $60 * 0.3 = $18.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final cost of the items. $60 - $18 = $42.

Since sales tax is included, we don't need to add any additional tax to the final cost. Joe will pay $42 for the items.

To find out how much money Joe will have left, we subtract the final cost from the initial amount of money he has. $50 - $42 = $8.

"To find out how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we first need to calculate the total number of croissants he wants to make in a week. Since he wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day, and there are 7 days in a week, we multiply 4 dozen by 7.

4 dozen/day * 7 days = 28 dozen

Since there are 12 croissants in a dozen, we multiply 28 dozen by 12 to get the total number of croissants.

28 dozen * 12 croissants/dozen = 336 croissants

Now, we know it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. To find out how much butter is needed for 336 croissants, we multiply the number of croissants by the amount of butter needed per dozen.

336 croissants * (1/4 pound/croissants) = 336 * 0.25 = 84 pounds

So, Juan will need 84 pounds of butter to make 336 croissants.

"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial funding for the first 5 months and the additional funding for the remaining 45 months.

The initial funding for the first 5 months is $100,000.

For the remaining 45 months, the funding is 50% more than the initial funding per month. Since 50% more than $100,000 is $150,000, the monthly funding for the remaining 45 months is $150,000.

To find the total funding for the remaining 45 months, we multiply the monthly funding by the number of months: $150,000 * 45 = $6,750,000.

Now, we add the initial funding for the first 5 months to the total funding for the remaining 45 months: $100,000 + $6,750,000 = $6,850,000.

DVD 2 has been played 135 times and can be played 1000 times before breaking, so it can be played 1000 - 135 = 865 more times.

Now, we add the number of times each DVD can be played before breaking to the number of times each has already been played: 356 + 644 + 135 + 865 = 2000.

The final answer is: 2000"
"To find the total cost of the physical therapy, we need to calculate the total number of hours John attended therapy and then multiply it by the cost per hour.

John went to physical therapy for 6 weeks, twice a week, for 2 hours at a time. So, the total number of sessions is 6 weeks * 2 sessions/week = 12 sessions.

Since each session is 2 hours long, the total number of hours is 12 sessions * 2 hours/session = 24 hours.

The cost per hour is $125. Therefore, the total cost is 24 hours * $125/hour = $3000.

The final answer is: $3000"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he will chew 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

2. He chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 stick after dinner, so that's 2 more pieces.

3. So far, Jim has chewed 4 + 2 = 6 pieces of gum.

4. He started with 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

5. He gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. Half of 14 is 14 / 2 = 7.

6. So, Jim gives 7 pieces to his sister and is left with 14 - 7 = 7 pieces.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find Charmaine's age 4 years from now, we first need to determine her current age. Since she will be 16 in 12 years, we subtract 12 from 16 to find her current age.

16 (future age) - 12 (years until then) = 4 (current age)

Now, we add 4 years to her current age to find her age 4 years from now.

4 (current age) + 4 (years from now) = 8

So, Charmaine will be 8 years old 4 years from now.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach, we need to calculate the total amount spent by each coach and then find the difference.

The baseball coach bought 9 new baseballs for $3 each, so the total amount spent by the baseball coach is 9 x $3 = $27.

The basketball coach bought 8 new basketballs for $14 each, so the total amount spent by the basketball coach is 8 x $14 = $112.

Now, let's find the difference between the amounts spent by the two coaches: $112 - $27 = $85.

The final answer is: $85"
"To find the total number of flowers that have bloomed, we first need to find the total number of flowers in the garden. Since there are 10 rows with 20 flowers in each row, we can multiply the number of rows by the number of flowers in each row.

Total flowers = 10 rows * 20 flowers/row = 200 flowers

Since only 4/5 of the flowers have bloomed, we can multiply the total number of flowers by 4/5 to find the number of bloomed flowers.

Number of bloomed flowers = Total flowers * (4/5)
= 200 * (4/5)
= 200 * 4 / 5
= 800 / 5
= 160

The final answer is: 160"
"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to first convert her speed from kb/s to Mb/s and then multiply it by the number of seconds in an hour.

1 Mb = 1000 kb
Ashley's speed in kb/s = 20 kb/s

To convert kb/s to Mb/s, we divide by 1000:
20 kb/s / 1000 = 0.02 Mb/s

There are 3600 seconds in an hour. To find Ashley's speed in Mb/h, we multiply her speed in Mb/s by the number of seconds in an hour:
0.02 Mb/s * 3600 s/h = 72 Mb/h

The final answer is: 72"
"To find the total number of cars towed, we need to calculate the number of cars towed in the first three days and the remaining days separately and then add them together.

In the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day. So, the total number of cars towed in the first three days is 3 * 10 = 30.

In the remaining days, there are 4 days (7 - 3 = 4). The tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars each day, so it pulled 10 - 4 = 6 cars per day. The total number of cars towed in the remaining days is 4 * 6 = 24.

Now, we add the total number of cars towed in the first three days and the remaining days: 30 + 24 = 54.

The final answer is: 54"
"To find out how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to calculate the difference between the required height (4 feet) and Adam's current height (40 inches), and then divide that by his growth rate (2 inches per year).

First, let's convert the required height from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, 4 feet is equal to 4 x 12 = 48 inches.

Now, let's calculate the difference between the required height and Adam's current height: 48 inches - 40 inches = 8 inches.

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we can divide the difference by his growth rate to find out how many years it will take for him to reach the required height: 8 inches / 2 inches/year = 4 years.

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how much James made, we need to calculate the profit from selling the cars, then apply his commission to that profit.

First, let's find the total revenue from selling the cars. Since James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each, the total revenue is:
10 * $25,000 = $250,000

Next, we need to find the cost of acquiring the cars. The company paid 30% of the price to acquire the cars, so the cost is:
30% of $25,000 = 0.3 * $25,000 = $7,500

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the cost from the revenue:
Profit = Revenue - Cost
Profit = $250,000 - $7,500
Profit = $242,500

Finally, James gets a 10% commission on the profit. To find his commission, we multiply the profit by 10%:
Commission = 10% of $242,500
Commission = 0.1 * $242,500
Commission = $24,250

So, James made $24,250. 

$24,250"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that 25% of the 100 riders can stay upright on the wave. To find the number of riders who can stay upright, we multiply 100 by 0.25 (which is 25% expressed as a decimal).

100 * 0.25 = 25

So, 25 riders can stay upright on the wave.

Next, we are told that 60% of these 25 riders are women. To find the number of women who can stay upright, we multiply 25 by 0.6 (which is 60% expressed as a decimal).

25 * 0.6 = 15

Since the remaining riders who can stay upright are men, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright.

25 - 15 = 10

Therefore, 10 men can stay upright on the wave.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total price for all three jewels, we need to first find the prices of the gold and silver jewels.

Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, we know that the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of a diamond jewel. 

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * Price of diamond jewel
Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * $2000
Price of gold jewel = $1600

The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold. 

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
Price of silver jewel = $1600 - $400
Price of silver jewel = $1200

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels.

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
Total price = $2000 + $1600 + $1200
Total price = $4800

The final answer is: $4800"
"To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to calculate the number of each type of stamp and add them together.

Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.

He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

To find the total number of stamps, we add the number of each type of stamp together: 16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45.

The final answer is: 45"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the relative speed between Bob and Tom. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract Tom's speed from Bob's speed to get the relative speed.

Relative speed = Bob's speed - Tom's speed
Relative speed = 55 mph - 70 mph
Relative speed = -15 mph

However, since speed cannot be negative, we need to take the absolute value of the relative speed.

Relative speed = | -15 mph | = 15 mph

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed to find the time it will take for Tom to catch up with Bob.

Time = Distance / Relative speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many fish Darren caught first, and then add 3 to that number to find out how many fish Tommy caught.

We know that Naomi caught 17 fish. Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, so we subtract 6 from 17 to find out how many fish Darren caught:

17 (Naomi's fish) - 6 = 11

Now that we know Darren caught 11 fish, we add 3 to find out how many fish Tommy caught:

11 (Darren's fish) + 3 = 14

So, Tommy caught 14 fish.

The final answer is: 14"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many classes Manny can miss before the average cost per class exceeds $10. 

Let's assume Manny misses 'x' classes. Since there are 10 total classes, he will attend 10 - x classes. 

The total cost of the classes is $60. Since the cost per class is the same for all classes, we can set up the equation:

(10 - x) * cost per class = 60

We know that the cost per class should not exceed $10. So, we can set up the inequality:

(10 - x) * cost per class ≤ 60

Since the cost per class is the same for all classes, we can divide both sides of the inequality by (10 - x):

cost per class ≤ 60 / (10 - x)

We know that the cost per class should not exceed $10. So, we can set up the inequality:

60 / (10 - x) ≤ 10

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the inequality by (10 - x):

60 ≤ 10(10 - x)

Expanding the right-hand side of the inequality:

60 ≤ 100 - 10x

Subtracting 60 from both sides of the inequality:

0 ≤ 40 - 10x

Subtracting 40 from both sides of the inequality:

-40 ≤ -10x

Dividing both sides of the inequality by -10:

4 ≥ x

Since x represents the number of classes Manny can miss, it cannot be greater than 4. Therefore, Manny can miss at most 3 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we first need to determine their individual daily production and then multiply it by 7 (the number of days in a week).

Jewel processes 50 customers per day. Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, Julie's daily production is 2 * 50 = 100 customers.

The total daily production for both Julie and Jewel is 50 + 100 = 150 customers.

To find the total weekly production, we multiply the daily production by 7: 150 * 7 = 1050.

The final answer is: 1050"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Paisley ran 4 miles.
2. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so Reggie ran 5 * 4 = 20 miles.
3. Reggie also ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, so Lynn ran 20 - 3 = 17 miles.

"To find the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges, we first need to find the cost of one apple and one orange. 

The cost of 4 apples is $5.20, so the cost of one apple is $5.20 / 4 = $1.30. 

The cost of 3 oranges is $3.30, so the cost of one orange is $3.30 / 3 = $1.10.

Now, we can find the cost of 5 apples: 5 apples * $1.30/apple = $6.50.

Next, we can find the cost of 5 oranges: 5 oranges * $1.10/orange = $5.50.

Finally, we can add the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges to find the total cost: $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To find the volume of the hole, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth. 

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Since it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we can multiply the volume by the time it takes to shovel one cubic foot.

Time = Volume * time per cubic foot
Time = 72 * 3
Time = 216 seconds

Therefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add them to the base price.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade costs $7,500.

The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of the leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of the running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the features and the base price:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

"To find out how much Tim will make in a year, we first need to calculate his new monthly salary and the bonus.

The 5% raise on his $20,000 monthly salary is 0.05 * $20,000 = $1,000. So, his new monthly salary is $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000.

The bonus is half a month's salary, which is $20,000 / 2 = $10,000.

Now, let's calculate his total monthly income: $21,000 (new salary) + $10,000 (bonus) = $31,000.

To find out how much he will make in a year, we multiply his total monthly income by 12: $31,000 * 12 = $372,000.

"To find the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley, we need to calculate the distance each of them biked and then add them together.

Alisa biked at 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours. To find the distance she biked, we multiply her speed by the time:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 12 miles/hour x 4.5 hours
Distance = 54 miles

Stanley biked at 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours. To find the distance he biked, we multiply his speed by the time:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour x 2.5 hours
Distance = 25 miles

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay separately, and then add those times together.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil. Bill can dig 4 feet/hour through soil, and he needs to dig 24 feet of soil. 

Time to dig through soil = Total soil depth / Rate of digging through soil
Time to dig through soil = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour
Time to dig through soil = 6 hours

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the clay. Bill can dig half as fast through clay as he can through soil, so his rate of digging through clay is 4 / 2 = 2 feet/hour. He needs to dig 8 feet of clay.

Time to dig through clay = Total clay depth / Rate of digging through clay
Time to dig through clay = 8 feet / 2 feet/hour
Time to dig through clay = 4 hours

Now, we add the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay to get the total time.

Total time = Time to dig through soil + Time to dig through clay
Total time = 6 hours + 4 hours
Total time = 10 hours

"To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost for each day and then subtract the two amounts.

On the first day, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, but she got a $2 discount. So, the total cost for the first day is:

20 pomegranates * $20 = $400
Discount: $2
Total cost for the first day = $400 - $2 = $398

On the second day, the price per pomegranate is $30, and there's a 10% discount on the total cost. So, the total cost for the second day is:

20 pomegranates * $30 = $600
Discount: 10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
Total cost for the second day = $600 - $60 = $540

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find the total sales from green hats in the first month. Since the sales from red hats were half the total amount she earned from selling green hats, let's denote the total sales from green hats as 'x'. Then, the sales from red hats would be 'x/2'.

We know that the sales from red hats were $400, so we can set up the equation:

x/2 = 400

To find 'x', we multiply both sides by 2:

x = 400 * 2
x = 800

So, the total sales from green hats in the first month were $800.

Now, let's find the total sales from both red and green hats in the first month:

Total sales in the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
= 400 + 800
= 1200

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. To find the total sales in the second month, we multiply the total sales in the first month by 3/4:

Total sales in the second month = (3/4) * 1200
= 900

Now, let's find the total sales in two months:

Total sales in two months = Total sales in the first month + Total sales in the second month

"To determine the number of eggs Lori needs, we first need to find out how many deviled egg halves each guest will eat. Since each guest eats 3 deviled egg halves, and Lori is inviting 16 guests, the total number of deviled egg halves needed is 3 * 16 = 48.

Since Lori needs 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves, we need to find out how many deviled egg halves 1 egg can make. This is 2 deviled egg halves per egg. 

Now, we divide the total number of deviled egg halves needed by the number of deviled egg halves per egg to find the total number of eggs needed. 48 / 2 = 24 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens of eggs needed. 24 / 12 = 2.

"To find the total cost of the plane for the first year, we need to calculate the cost of the plane itself, the hanger rental, and the fuel costs.

The cost of the plane is $150,000.

The hanger rental is $5000 per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total hanger rental cost for the first year is $5000 * 12 = $60,000.

The fuel cost is twice the hanger rental, which is $5000 * 2 = $10,000 per month. The total fuel cost for the first year is $10,000 * 12 = $120,000.

Now, we add up the costs: $150,000 (plane) + $60,000 (hanger rental) + $120,000 (fuel) = $330,000.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture and then find the difference.

For the first mixture, we have 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts. The cost of almonds is $10 per pound, and the cost of walnuts is $15 per pound. 

The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is (1/2) * $10 = $5.
The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is (1/3) * $15 = $5.

The total cost of the first mixture is $5 + $5 = $10.

For the second mixture, we have 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.

The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is (1/5) * $10 = $2.
The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is (1/3) * $15 = $5.

The total cost of the second mixture is $2 + $5 = $7.

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between the two mixtures. The difference is $10 - $7 = $3.

"Let's denote the number of sheep as S and the number of geese as G. We know that sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs. We also know that the total number of animal heads is 20, which means S + G = 20.

We are also given that the total number of animal legs is 70. Since sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs, we can write the equation 4S + 2G = 70.

Now we have a system of two equations:

1) S + G = 20
2) 4S + 2G = 70

We can solve this system of equations by multiplying the first equation by 2 to get 2S + 2G = 40, and then subtracting it from the second equation to eliminate G.

(4S + 2G) - (2S + 2G) = 70 - 40
2S = 30

Dividing both sides by 2, we get S = 15.

"To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the cost of the coffee. 

Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day, and he wants a week's worth, which is 7 days. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, but his favorite brand is sold out, so he buys the more expensive brand. The more expensive brand costs 20% more than the normal brand. 

20% of $5 is 0.2 * $5 = $1. So, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

The total cost of the coffee is 7 pounds * $6 per pound = $42.

He also buys a donut for $2. 

The total cost is $42 (coffee) + $2 (donut) = $44.

The final numerical answer is: $44"
"To find the cost of the apple pie, we need to subtract the total cost of the items Gus bought from the $20.00 he spent. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Gus bought:

2 bags of chips for $2.00 each = 2 x $2.00 = $4.00
Adding the cost of the bucket of fried chicken: $4.00 + $8.00 = $12.00
Adding the cost of the bottle of soda: $12.00 + $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's subtract the total cost of the items from the $20.00 Gus spent:

$20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

The apple pie cost $7.00.

Total newspapers delivered = 600
Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers delivered - (Newspapers delivered to District A + Newspapers delivered to District C)

"To find out how many recipes John learns, we need to calculate the total class time and then divide it by the time it takes to learn a new recipe.

The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time, so the total class time per week is 4 * 2 = 8 hours.

Since the class lasts for 6 weeks, the total class time is 8 hours/week * 6 weeks = 48 hours.

John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time. To find out how many recipes he learns, we need to divide the total class time by 1.5 hours.

Number of recipes learned = Total class time / Time to learn a new recipe

"To find the number of math teachers, we first need to find the number of history teachers and then subtract that from the total number of teachers. 

60% of 150 is 0.6 * 150 = 90 history teachers. 

Since the rest of the teachers are math teachers, the number of math teachers is 150 - 90 = 60.

Each math teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. To find the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day, we multiply the number of math teachers by the number of hours they sleep per day: 60 * 6 = 360.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the amount of money Kassidy and Rayna have. 

First, we know Aurelia has $120. Since Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, we can calculate Kassidy's money as follows:
Kassidy's money = 3/4 * Aurelia's money
Kassidy's money = 3/4 * 120
Kassidy's money = 90

Now, we know Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy. So, we can calculate Rayna's money as follows:
Rayna's money = Kassidy's money + 60
Rayna's money = 90 + 60
Rayna's money = 150

Now that we have the money of all three, we can find the total amount of money they have together:
Total money = Aurelia's money + Kassidy's money + Rayna's money
Total money = 120 + 90 + 150
Total money = 360

To find out how much each would have if they decided to add together their money and share equally among them, we need to divide the total money by 3:
Money per person = Total money / 3
Money per person = 360 / 3
Money per person = 120

"To find the total amount of dry ingredients needed, we need to calculate the total amount of flour, sugar, and salt required for 16 muffins.

For flour, Svetlana needs 5 tablespoons per muffin, so for 16 muffins, she needs 5 * 16 = 80 tablespoons of flour.

For sugar, Svetlana needs 3 tablespoons per muffin, so for 16 muffins, she needs 3 * 16 = 48 tablespoons of sugar.

For salt, Svetlana needs 0.25 tablespoons per muffin, so for 16 muffins, she needs 0.25 * 16 = 4 tablespoons of salt.

Now, we add up the total amount of dry ingredients: 80 (flour) + 48 (sugar) + 4 (salt) = 132 tablespoons.

The total amount of dry ingredients Svetlana needs to make 16 muffins is 132.

"To find the number of good days left in the month, we need to first determine the total number of good days recorded by Christina. We know that she had 12 good days in the first 30 days. However, we also know that her first 8 days were good, her second 8 days were bad, and her third 8 days were neutral. 

Since we know the first 8 days were good, we can subtract those from the total number of good days. However, we also need to consider the additional good days in the first 30 days. The next 8 days were bad, so they don't contribute to the good days. The third 8 days were neutral, so they also don't contribute to the good days. 

However, we know that the next three days were good, neutral, and good. We can add these to the total number of good days. 

So, the total number of good days in the first 30 days is 12. The first 8 days were good, so we subtract those: 12 - 8 = 4. The next 8 days were bad, so we don't need to subtract anything. The next 8 days were neutral, so we don't need to subtract anything. The next 3 days were good, neutral, and good, so we add 2 to the total number of good days: 4 + 2 = 6.

However, we are asked to find the number of good days left in the month. Since we are only considering the first 30 days, we need to find the number of good days in the remaining days of the month. The month has 30 days, and we have already considered the first 30 days. Therefore, there are no days left in the month.

"To find out how many books Sally has, we need to work backwards from the information given about Janey. We know that Janey has 21 books and that this is 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has.

Let's represent the number of books Sally has as 'x'. We can then write an equation based on the given information:

Janey's books = 2 * Sally's books + 3
21 = 2x + 3

Now, we need to solve for 'x'. To do this, we'll first subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

21 - 3 = 2x + 3 - 3
18 = 2x

Next, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 2 to isolate 'x':

18 / 2 = 2x / 2
9 = x

So, Sally has 9 books.

"To find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches, we need to first convert the initial height from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so we multiply 20 feet by 12 inches per foot.

20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now, we know the bamboo grows 30 inches a day and its current height is 240 inches. To find out how many days it will take to reach 600 inches, we subtract the current height from the target height and divide by the daily growth rate.

600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Now, we divide the remaining height by the daily growth rate.

360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs. This means each dog has 1 toy. When 8 more dogs arrive, James needs 8 more toys to bring the total to 12 dogs with 1 toy each. So, he buys 8 more toys.

Now, there are 12 dogs, and James goes back to find that there are twice as many more dogs, which means there are 2 * 8 = 16 more dogs. This makes a total of 12 + 16 = 28 dogs. Since each dog needs 1 toy, James needs 16 more toys to bring the total to 28 dogs with 1 toy each.

However, when James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs those toys. This means he needs 16 - 3 = 13 toys for the remaining 25 dogs.

To find the total number of toys James needs, we add the initial 4 toys, the 8 toys he bought first, and the 13 toys he bought later. 

4 (initial toys) + 8 (first purchase) + 13 (second purchase) = 25

Total signatures collected so far = 64

The sisters want to reach a total of 100 signatures by the end of the summer. Since they have already collected 64 signatures, we need to find out how many more signatures they need to collect.

Signatures needed to reach the goal = Total signatures needed - Total signatures collected so far
Signatures needed to reach the goal = 100 - 64
Signatures needed to reach the goal = 36

They have three more weeks of summer vacation, and they need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal.

Given that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, we can calculate the ratio as follows: 

36 hash browns / 6 potatoes = 6 hash browns per potato

Now, we can multiply this ratio by the total number of potatoes to find the total number of hash browns that can be made:

6 hash browns per potato * 96 potatoes = 576 hash browns

Therefore, 96 potatoes can make 576 hash browns.

"To find the total weight of the 9 adults, we need to multiply the average weight of an adult by the number of adults. 

Average weight of an adult = 80 kg
Number of adults = 9

Total weight of adults = Average weight of an adult * Number of adults
Total weight of adults = 80 kg * 9
Total weight of adults = 720 kg

Since the elevator supports a maximum load of 700 kg, we need to find the excess weight.

Excess weight = Total weight of adults - Maximum load of the elevator
Excess weight = 720 kg - 700 kg
Excess weight = 20 kg

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of cookies each person has and then add them up.

We know that Katarina has 68 cookies. 

Since Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, Max must have 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.

Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so the Cookie Monster has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.

Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Now, let's add up the total number of cookies: 68 (Katarina) + 73 (Max) + 61 (Cookie Monster) + 96 (Summer) = 298.

"To find the original length of the dress, we need to work backwards from the final design length. 

First, we know that the final design length is 140cm, and 20cm of that is the lace trim. So, the original length of the dress before adding the lace trim is 140cm - 20cm = 120cm.

Since the dress was extended by 50% of its original length, let's call the original length 'x'. The extension is 50% of 'x', which is 0.5x. The total length after the extension is x + 0.5x = 1.5x.

We know that 1.5x = 120cm (the length before adding the lace trim). To find 'x', we divide both sides by 1.5:

x = 120cm / 1.5
x = 80cm

So, the original length of the dress was 80cm.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes to mow half the lawn in each mode and then add those times together.

First, let's find the time it takes to mow half the lawn in turtle mode. Since it takes 1 hour to mow the entire lawn in turtle mode, it will take 0.5 hours to mow half the lawn. We need to convert this to minutes, so we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

0.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 30 minutes

Next, let's find the time it takes to mow half the lawn in rabbit mode. Since it takes 40 minutes to mow the entire lawn in rabbit mode, it will take 20 minutes to mow half the lawn.

Now, we add the times together to find the total time it took to mow the lawn:

30 minutes (turtle mode) + 20 minutes (rabbit mode) = 50 minutes

"Let's denote the age of the younger twin as T, the age of the older twin as T+7, and the age of the triplet as t. We know that there are two twins and one triplet, so we can write the equation: 2T + t = 44.

We also know that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so we can write another equation: T = t + 7.

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first one: 2(t + 7) + t = 44.

Expanding the equation, we get: 2t + 14 + t = 44.

Combine like terms: 3t + 14 = 44.

Subtract 14 from both sides: 3t = 30.

Divide both sides by 3: t = 10.

Now that we know the age of the triplet, we can find the age of the older twin: T = t + 7 = 10 + 7 = 17.

Now, subtract the cost of the lollipops from the total cost to find the cost of the candies: $3.20 - $2 = $1.20. 

Since there are 4 candies, the cost of one candy is $1.20 / 4 = $0.30.

Now, we can find the total cost of 10 lollipops: 10 lollipops * $0.40 = $4.

The total cost of 10 candies is 10 candies * $0.30 = $3.

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $4 + $3 = $7.

"To find the total bill, we first need to calculate the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check. The cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40. 

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, which we don't know yet. Let's call the total bill 'x'. The cost of the heartworm check is 0.6x.

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check: x = $40 + 0.6x.

To find the value of x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Subtract 0.6x from both sides: 0.4x = $40.

Now, divide both sides by 0.4: x = $100.

So, the total bill is $100. The heartworm check is 60% of $100, which is 0.6 * $100 = $60.

The total amount John paid is $100. He brought $125 with him, so he leaves with $125 - $100 = $25.

"To find out how many chairs Mia needs, we first need to determine the total number of chairs she has. Since there are 8 high chairs and the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs, we can calculate the number of regular chairs by multiplying 8 by 5.

8 high chairs * 5 = 40 regular chairs

Now, we add the number of high chairs and regular chairs to find the total number of chairs.

8 high chairs + 40 regular chairs = 48 chairs

Since there will be 42 adults and 15 babies attending, we need to find the total number of chairs required. Babies will use high chairs, so we'll add the number of adults and babies.

42 adults + 15 babies = 57 people

Since each person needs a chair, we need 57 chairs in total. To find out how many more chairs Mia needs, we subtract the number of chairs she has from the total number of chairs required.

57 total chairs - 48 available chairs = 9 more chairs

"To solve this problem, we need to find the total points collected by Adam, Betty, Martha, and Tom, and then subtract that from the minimum threshold of 400 points.

First, let's find Betty's points. Since Betty collected 30% more points than Adam, we can calculate it as follows:
Betty's points = Adam's points + (30% of Adam's points)
Betty's points = 50 + (0.3 * 50)
Betty's points = 50 + 15
Betty's points = 65

Now, let's find Tom's points. We know that Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom, and Tom has 30 points less than Betty. So, we can find Tom's points as follows:
Tom's points = Betty's points - 30
Tom's points = 65 - 30
Tom's points = 35

Now, we know that Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom. So, we can find Martha's points as follows:
Martha's points = 3 * Tom's points
Martha's points = 3 * 35
Martha's points = 105

Now, let's find the total points collected by the class:
Total points = Adam's points + Betty's points + Martha's points + Tom's points
Total points = 50 + 65 + 105 + 35
Total points = 255

Now, let's find the points the class is missing to go on the trip:
Points missing = Minimum threshold - Total points
Points missing = 400 - 255
Points missing = 145

The final answer is: 145"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of great-grandchildren and then multiply it by 3, since each of them has 3 babies of their own.

First, let's find the number of Great Grandma Jones' children: 3

Each of her children has 3 children of their own, so the total number of grandchildren is 3 * 3 = 9

Each of these grandchildren has 3 babies of their own, so the total number of great-grandchildren is 9 * 3 = 27

Since each of these great-grandchildren has 3 babies of their own, the total number of great-grandbabies is 27 * 3 = 81

The final answer is: 81"
"To find out how much money Greta has left to spend, we need to calculate the amount she puts into her retirement account and her car payment, then subtract those amounts from her total paycheck.

First, let's calculate the amount she puts into her retirement account: 50% of $2400.00 is 0.5 x $2400.00 = $1200.00.

Next, let's calculate the amount she uses for her car payment: 20% of $2400.00 is 0.2 x $2400.00 = $480.00.

Now, let's subtract the amounts from her total paycheck: $2400.00 - $1200.00 - $480.00 = $720.00.

So, Greta has $720.00 left to spend.

The final answer is: $720.00"
"To find the number of pairs of pencils in the box, we first need to determine the total number of pencils in the box. Since there are 4 pencils missing, we subtract 4 from the total capacity of the box, which is 20.

20 (total capacity) - 4 (missing pencils) = 16 pencils

Now, we need to find the number of pairs of pencils. A pair consists of 2 pencils. To find the number of pairs, we divide the total number of pencils by 2.

16 (total pencils) / 2 = 8 pairs

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we first need to calculate the number of fireworks set off in the city and then find 40% of that number. 

The city is setting off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks set off in the city is 15 * 20 = 300.

40% of 300 is 0.4 * 300 = 120.

Hannah will also set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each in her backyard, which is 3 * 5 = 15 fireworks.

So, the total number of fireworks Hannah will see is 120 (from the city) + 15 (from her backyard) = 135.

The final answer is: 135"
"To find the total amount spent on snacks and drinks, we first need to determine the total number of people and the total number of items (drinks and snacks) they buy.

Aiden and his 12 friends make 13 people. When they meet up with 7 more friends, the total number of people becomes 13 + 7 = 20.

Each person buys enough drinks and snacks to fill the seats, which means each person buys 2 drinks and 3 snacks. So, the total number of drinks and snacks bought is 20 * 2 (drinks) + 20 * 3 (snacks) = 40 drinks + 60 snacks = 100 items.

Since each item costs $2, the total amount spent on snacks and drinks is 100 items * $2 = $200.

The final numerical answer is: $200"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much Gordy's truck can carry. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, and Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds, Gordy's truck can carry 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.

Now, we know that the combined capacity of all three trucks is 11,600 pounds. We already know that Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds and Gordy's truck can carry 4,800 pounds. To find out how much Gary's truck can carry, we need to subtract the combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity of all three trucks.

Combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks = 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds
Capacity of Gary's truck = Total capacity of all three trucks - Combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks
= 11,600 - 8,800
= 2,800 pounds

The final answer is: 2800"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of dumplings each male ate. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, and each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

There are 8 males in the group, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32.

There are 6 females in the group, and each female ate 3 dumplings, so the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.

The total number of dumplings eaten by the group is 32 (by males) + 18 (by females) = 50.

Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is equal to the total number of dumplings eaten by the group, which is 50.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how much money Gerald had initially, we need to determine the total parts in the ratio and Gerald's share. The ratio is 3:2, so the total parts are 3 + 2 = 5.

Gerald's share is 3 out of 5 parts, so we can find his initial amount by multiplying his share by the total amount: (3/5) * 100 = 60.

Now, we know Gerald spent $10 on a book. To find out how much he has left, we subtract the amount spent from his initial amount: 60 - 10 = 50.

The final answer is: $50"
"To find the speed of the turtle, we need to divide the speed of the cat by 5, since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle. 

Speed of the cat = 15 feet/second
Speed of the turtle = Speed of the cat / 5
Speed of the turtle = 15 / 5
Speed of the turtle = 3 feet/second

Now, we can find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds by multiplying its speed by the time.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 3 feet/second * 40 seconds
Distance = 120 feet

The final answer is: 120"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much money they need to raise per hour to reach their goal. 

First, let's find out how much they still need to raise: 
$6300 (goal) - $2100 (raised so far) = $4200

Since they have been fundraising for 3 hours and raised $2100, we can find out their hourly rate by dividing the amount raised by the number of hours:
$2100 / 3 hours = $700 per hour

Now, we need to find out how many hours they need to raise the remaining amount:
$4200 / $700 per hour = 6 hours

So, they need to fundraise for 6 more hours to reach their goal. 

Total hours = 3 (already raised) + 6 (remaining) = 9 hours"
"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes, we first need to find the percentage used for industrial purposes and then subtract that from 100%.

First, we find the percentage of the river's water used by Colorado City: 40%.

Then, we find the percentage of that used for industrial purposes: 80% of 40% is 0.8 * 0.4 = 0.32 or 32%.

Now, we subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes from 100% to find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes: 100% - 32% = 68%.

"To find out how much Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring, we first need to determine the total number of days in 2 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply 7 by 2 to get the total number of days.

7 days/week * 2 weeks = 14 days

Next, we need to find out how much Alex charges for 14 days of tutoring. Since she charges $12 per day, we multiply the number of days by her daily rate.

14 days * $12/day = $168

So, Alex charges $168 for 2 weeks of tutoring.

The final answer is: $168"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the rate at which the factory makes chocolate and vanilla ice cream per hour.

For chocolate ice cream, the factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours. To find the rate per hour, we divide the total quarts by the number of hours: 100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts per hour.

For vanilla ice cream, the factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours. To find the rate per hour, we divide the total quarts by the number of hours: 50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now, we need to find the total quarts made in 48 hours. We multiply the rate per hour for each flavor by the total number of hours and add the results together: (50 quarts/hour * 48 hours) + (12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours) = 2400 + 600 = 3000 quarts.

"To find Marcus' total bill, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he ordered and then apply the 10% discount.

First, let's calculate the total cost of each type of item:

- 5 croissants at $3.00 apiece: 5 x $3.00 = $15.00
- 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each: 4 x $2.50 = $10.00
- 3 mini quiches at $4.00 apiece: 3 x $4.00 = $12.00
- 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 apiece: 13 x $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
$15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Since Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him 10% off his purchase, we need to calculate the discount amount:
10% of $50.00 = 0.10 x $50.00 = $5.00

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total cost:
$50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

The final answer is: $45.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many scoops Erin can buy with her $6.00. Since each scoop costs $1.50, we can divide the total amount of money Erin has by the cost of each scoop.

$6.00 ÷ $1.50 = 4

This means Erin can buy 4 scoops of ice cream. However, the deal is buy 2 scoops get 1 free, so we need to consider the free scoop as well. 

Since Erin can buy 4 scoops, and the deal is buy 2 get 1 free, she can buy 2 sets of 3 scoops (2 paid scoops + 1 free scoop). 

2 sets of 3 scoops = 6 scoops

So, Erin should buy 6 scoops of ice cream.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how much more candy Amy has after two weeks, we need to calculate the total amount of candy each of them eats in two weeks and subtract that from their initial amount.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces.

Ginger starts with 100 pieces and eats 56, so she has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces left.

Amy starts with 100 pieces and eats 42, so she has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces left.

To find out how much more candy Amy has, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's remaining candy: 58 - 44 = 14.

"To find the total number of tiles needed, we first need to calculate the area of two-thirds of the bathroom. 

The area of the entire bathroom is 36 sq ft. To find two-thirds of this area, we multiply 36 by 2/3.

36 * (2/3) = 36 * 2 / 3 = 72 / 3 = 24

So, two-thirds of the bathroom is 24 sq ft. 

Since Mr. Boarden needs 24 tiles per square foot, we multiply the area of two-thirds of the bathroom by 24.

24 * 24 = 576

Therefore, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two-thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom.

576"
"To find out how much James saved, we need to calculate the cost of buying the blueberries at the store and compare it to the cost of picking them.

First, let's calculate the cost of picking the blueberries. The cost to go picking is $20, and then there's an additional $1.5 per pound. Since James picked 30 pounds, the total cost of picking is:

Cost of picking = $20 + (1.5 * 30)
Cost of picking = $20 + $45
Cost of picking = $65

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying the blueberries at the store. The cost is $2.5 per pound, and James picked 30 pounds:

Cost at store = 2.5 * 30
Cost at store = $75

To find out how much James saved, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost at the store:

Savings = Cost at store - Cost of picking
Savings = $75 - $65
Savings = $10

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many slices were eaten by Bryce and his friends, and then subtract that from the total number of slices.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 5 people in total, including Bryce, and 2/3 of them ate 2/3 of their pizzas, we can calculate the number of slices eaten by this group. 

First, let's find out how many slices Bryce and his two friends ate in total. Since each pizza has 12 slices, and there are 5 people, there are 5 pizzas in total. 2/3 of 5 is 10/3, which is approximately 3.33. Since each pizza has 12 slices, 3.33 pizzas have 3.33 * 12 = 40 slices. 

However, since 2/3 of the people ate 2/3 of their pizzas, we need to multiply the number of slices by 2. So, 40 * 2 = 80 slices were eaten by Bryce and his two friends.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 5 people in total, and 2 have already eaten, there are 3 people left. 3/4 of 3 is 9/4, which is 2.25. Since each pizza has 12 slices, 2.25 pizzas have 2.25 * 12 = 27 slices. 

However, since 3/4 of the people ate 3/4 of their pizzas, we need to multiply the number of slices by 3/4. So, 27 * 3/4 = 20.25 slices were eaten by the two remaining friends.

Now, we need to add the number of slices eaten by both groups. 80 + 20.25 = 100.25 slices were eaten in total.

Since there are 5 pizzas in total, and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is 5 * 12 = 60. 

Now, we can subtract the number of slices eaten from the total number of slices to find the number of slices left. 60 - 100.25 = -40.25. However, since we can't have a negative number of slices, we need to re-evaluate our calculation.

Let's re-evaluate the number of slices eaten by the two remaining friends. 3/4 of 3 is 9/4, which is 2.25. Since each pizza has 12 slices, 2.25 pizzas have 2.25 * 12 = 27 slices. However, since 3/4 of the people ate 3/4 of their pizzas, we need to multiply the number of slices by 3/4. So, 27 * 3/4 = 20.25 slices were eaten by the two remaining friends.

However, since we can't have a fraction of a slice, we can round down to 20 slices eaten by the two remaining friends.

"To find the average time the cat and dog take to eat the sausages, we first need to determine the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages. 

The cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes. Since the dog eats the same number of sausages in 2/3 the amount of time the cat takes, we can calculate the dog's time as follows:

Dog's time = (2/3) * Cat's time
Dog's time = (2/3) * 30 minutes
Dog's time = 20 minutes

Now, we have the time taken by both the cat and the dog. To find the average time, we add their times and divide by 2:

Average time = (Cat's time + Dog's time) / 2
Average time = (30 minutes + 20 minutes) / 2
Average time = 50 minutes / 2
Average time = 25 minutes

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to first convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so we multiply 8 feet by 12 and add 4 inches.

8 feet * 12 inches/foot = 96 inches
96 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 100 inches, and it's 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's represent the length of one of Bobby's shoes as 'x'. We can write an equation based on this information:

100 = 9x + 10

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x' on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 10 from both sides:

100 - 10 = 9x + 10 - 10
90 = 9x

Next, we divide both sides by 9 to find the value of 'x':

90 / 9 = x
10 = x

The length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

"To find the total number of windows smashed, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed from students' cars and teachers' cars separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of windows smashed from students' cars. There are 64 students' cars with 4 windows each. A quarter of the students' cars' windows are smashed, which is 1/4 * 64 = 16 cars. Since each car has 4 windows, the total number of windows smashed from students' cars is 16 * 4 = 64.

Next, let's find the number of windows smashed from teachers' cars. There are 32 teachers' cars with 2 windows each. Three-fourths of the teachers' cars' windows are smashed, which is 3/4 * 32 = 24 cars. Since each car has 2 windows, the total number of windows smashed from teachers' cars is 24 * 2 = 48.

Now, let's add the number of windows smashed from students' cars and teachers' cars to find the total number of windows smashed. 64 + 48 = 112.

"To find the total number of blue spools, we need to add the number of light blue and dark blue spools. 

Total blue spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60

Next, we need to find the total number of spools. 

Total spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 150

Now, we can find the percentage of blue spools by dividing the total number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of blue spools = (60 / 150) * 100 = 40%

The final answer is: 40"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Initially, 5000 people were in line at 8:00. By midday, 2/5 of them had voted. 

2/5 of 5000 is (2/5) * 5000 = 2000 people who voted by midday.

So, the number of people remaining by midday is 5000 - 2000 = 3000.

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. 

2/3 of 3000 is (2/3) * 3000 = 2000 people who voted by 16:00.

The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 3000 - 2000 = 1000.

"To find out how many packs of gum Parker will need, we need to calculate the total number of pieces of gum he will chew in 30 days and then divide that by the number of pieces in a pack.

Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day. To find the total number of pieces he will chew in 30 days, we multiply the number of pieces he chews per day by 30:

4 pieces/day * 30 days = 120 pieces

Now, we need to divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces in a pack to find out how many packs he will need:

120 pieces / 15 pieces/pack = 8 packs

So, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days.

"To determine the total number of s'mores needed, we first calculate the number of s'mores the kids and adults want. 

9 kids want 2 s'mores each, so 9 * 2 = 18 s'mores. 
6 adults want 1 s'more each, so 6 * 1 = 6 s'mores. 
Total s'mores needed = 18 + 6 = 24 s'mores.

Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes 8 s'mores, we divide the total s'mores needed by 8 to find out how many sleeves are required. 
24 s'mores / 8 s'mores per sleeve = 3 sleeves.

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we divide the total sleeves needed by 3 to find out how many boxes are required. 
3 sleeves / 3 sleeves per box = 1 box.

However, we need to consider if this is enough for everyone. Since 9 kids and 6 adults are eating, and 24 s'mores are needed, we should check if 1 box is sufficient. 

If we calculate the number of s'mores in 1 box, we get 3 sleeves * 8 s'mores per sleeve = 24 s'mores. This is exactly what we need, so 1 box is sufficient.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the ages of Dora's father and mother.

Given that Dora is 15 years old, we can find her father's age by using the information that her father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. 

Let's denote Dora's father's age as F and Dora's age as D. We have the equation: F = 2D + 8. Since Dora is 15, we can substitute D = 15 into the equation to find F.

F = 2(15) + 8
F = 30 + 8
F = 38

Now that we know Dora's father is 38 years old, we can find her mother's age. We are given that Dora's mother is four years younger than her father. 

Let's denote Dora's mother's age as M. We have the equation: M = F - 4. Since F = 38, we can substitute F into the equation to find M.

M = 38 - 4
M = 34

Now that we know Dora's age (15), her father's age (38), and her mother's age (34), we can find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother.

Total combined age = D + F + M
Total combined age = 15 + 38 + 34
Total combined age = 87

"To find the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying, we need to calculate the weight of each book and then add them together.

Cindy has 3 math and science books, so the total weight of these books is 3 x 2 = 6 pounds.

Her French book weighs 4 pounds and her English book weighs 3 pounds.

Her history book weighs twice as much as her English book, so it weighs 2 x 3 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add up the weights of all the books: 6 (math and science) + 4 (French) + 3 (English) + 6 (history) = 19 pounds.

The total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is 19 pounds.

"To find the number of votes candidate C received, we first need to determine the number of votes candidate B received. 

Candidate A received 20% of the votes, which is 0.2 * 100 = 20 votes.

Candidate B received 50% more than candidate A's votes, so we need to calculate 50% of 20 and add it to 20. 
50% of 20 is 0.5 * 20 = 10. 
So, candidate B received 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

Since there are 100 voters in total, the total number of votes is 100. 
Candidate A and B together received 20 + 30 = 50 votes. 
Therefore, candidate C received 100 - 50 = 50 votes.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many apples Beck has initially. Since Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, and Boris has 100 apples, we can calculate Beck's initial number of apples as follows:

Beck's initial apples = Boris's apples - 23
Beck's initial apples = 100 - 23
Beck's initial apples = 77

Now, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. So, Beck's new number of apples is:

Beck's new apples = Beck's initial apples + 10
Beck's new apples = 77 + 10
Beck's new apples = 87

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris. Boris still has 100 apples, and Beck has 87 apples. So, the difference is:

Difference = Boris's apples - Beck's new apples
Difference = 100 - 87
Difference = 13

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the cost of a half-gallon jar. Since a gallon jar costs $5 and it's $2 more than a half-gallon jar, we can set up the equation:

Gallon jar = Half-gallon jar + $2
5 = Half-gallon jar + 2
Half-gallon jar = 5 - 2
Half-gallon jar = 3

Now that we know the cost of a half-gallon jar, we can find the cost of 16 half-gallon jars:
16 * 3 = 48

Next, we need to find the cost of 10-gallon jars. Since a gallon jar costs $5, we can multiply this by 10:
10 * 5 = 50

Now, we add the cost of 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars to find the total amount of money Cecelia spent:
Total cost = 50 + 48

"To find the number of boys in each class, we first need to determine the total number of girls in both classes. Since 40% of the students in each class are girls, and there are 80 students in total, we can set up an equation to find the number of students in each class.

Let x be the number of students in each class. Then, 2x = 80 (since there are two classes with the same number of students). Solving for x, we get x = 80 / 2 = 40.

Now that we know there are 40 students in each class, we can find the number of girls in each class. 40% of 40 is 0.4 * 40 = 16 girls in each class.

Since there are 40 students in each class and 16 are girls, the number of boys in each class is 40 - 16 = 24.

"To find out how much money the tomato vendor saves a week, we need to first calculate the daily savings and then multiply it by 7.

The vendor used to buy 500 tomatoes a day at $.5 each, so his daily cost was 500 * $.5 = $250.

With the new vendor, he buys the same 500 tomatoes at $.4 each, so his new daily cost is 500 * $.4 = $200.

The daily savings is the difference between the old cost and the new cost, which is $250 - $200 = $50.

To find the weekly savings, we multiply the daily savings by 7: $50 * 7 = $350.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, Lorraine has 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

First, she trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers. 
Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons.

Now, she has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

Next, she trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers. 
Since each large sticker is worth a large button, she gets 20 large buttons.

Now, she has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

She trades the rest of her large stickers (20) for small buttons. 
Since each large sticker is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

Now, let's count the total number of buttons she has: 
- 27 small buttons from trading small stickers
- 20 large buttons from trading large stickers
- 60 small buttons from trading large stickers

Total buttons = 27 + 20 + 60 = 107 buttons.

The final answer is: 107"
"To find the total number of matches Joey played in one week, we need to add up the matches he played on each day.

On Monday, Joey played 2 matches.
On Friday, Joey played 1 match.
On Saturday, Joey played double the number of matches he played on Monday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 matches.

Now, let's add up the total number of matches: 2 (Monday) + 1 (Friday) + 4 (Saturday) = 7 matches.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as 'x'. Since the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, the number of votes in favor can be represented as 2x.

We know that the total number of council members is 33. The total number of votes in favor and against the new regulation must add up to 33. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:

3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 11

Now that we know the number of votes against the new regulation is 11, we can find the number of votes in favor by multiplying x by 2:

Votes in favor = 2x = 2 * 11 = 22

The final answer is: 22"
"To find the total number of shirts ordered, we need to calculate the number of students for each size and add them up.

- Extra-small: 11 students
- Small: 2 * 11 = 22 students
- Medium: 22 - 4 = 18 students
- Large: 18 / 2 = 9 students
- Extra-large: 9 + 6 = 15 students

Now, let's add up the number of students for each size:
11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75

The final answer is: 75"
"To find the discount amount, we need to calculate 5% of the original price. 

5% of $140 = 0.05 * $140 = $7

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the final amount.

$140 - $7 = $133

So, you will pay $133 after the discount.

The final answer is: $133"
"To find the total number of hours the 20 playlists will last, we need to first find the total number of songs across all playlists and then multiply that by the length of each song.

The total number of songs across all playlists is the number of songs in one playlist multiplied by the number of playlists: 300 songs/playlist * 20 playlists = 6000 songs.

Since each song is 10 hours long, the total number of hours the playlists will last is the total number of songs multiplied by the length of each song: 6000 songs * 10 hours/song = 60,000 hours.

The final answer is: 60000"
"To find the number of people who think horse #12 will win, we first need to find the number of people who think horse #2 will win and then the number of people who think horse #7 will win.

20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win. To find 20% of 50, we multiply 50 by 0.2.

50 * 0.2 = 10

So, 10 people think horse #2 will win.

Now, we need to find the number of people who think horse #7 will win. 60% of the remaining people think horse #7 will win. The remaining people are 50 - 10 = 40.

60% of 40 is 0.6 * 40 = 24.

So, 24 people think horse #7 will win.

Now, we need to find the number of people who think horse #12 will win. The total number of people who think either horse #2 or horse #7 will win is 10 + 24 = 34.

The number of people who think horse #12 will win is 50 - 34 = 16.

The final answer is: 16"
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given. We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. 

Let's denote the total number of Pomeranians as P. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we can set up the equation:

1/3 * P = 6

To find the total number of Pomeranians, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3:

P = 6 * 3
P = 18

Now that we know there are 18 Pomeranians, and two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can denote the total number of puppies as J. We can set up the equation:

2/3 * J = 18

To find the total number of puppies, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3/2:

J = 18 * (3/2)
J = 27

So, Jana has 27 puppies. 

The final answer is: 27"
"To find out how much more Jayden needs to buy the camera, we first need to calculate how much money he has after receiving the money from his sister. 

Jayden initially had $70. His sister gave him half of her $90 allowance, which is $45. 

So, Jayden now has $70 + $45 = $115.

The camera costs $200. To find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the amount he has from the cost of the camera: $200 - $115 = $85.

Therefore, Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera.

The final answer is: $85"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. 

Let's denote the number of cases of shingles the second house needs as 'x'. Since the first house needs 1/2 of what the second house needs, the first house needs x/2 cases of shingles.

We are given that the third house needs double the first house, so the third house needs 2 * (x/2) = x cases of shingles.

We know that the total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. We can set up an equation to represent this:

x + x/2 + x = 250

To simplify the equation, we can multiply all terms by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + x + 2x = 500

Combine like terms:

5x = 500

Now, divide both sides by 5:

x = 100

Since the third house needs x cases of shingles, and we found that x = 100, the third house needs 100 cases of shingles.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of each person's purchase and then add them together.

Leila buys 3 cucumbers at $2 each, so her total cost is 3 * $2 = $6.

Jack buys 5 tomatoes at $1 each, so his total cost is 5 * $1 = $5.

Chase buys 1 head of lettuce at $3, so his total cost is $3.

Now, let's add their costs together: $6 (Leila) + $5 (Jack) + $3 (Chase) = $14.

The final numerical answer is: $14"
"To find the number of pears George has, we need to calculate 45% of the number of bananas and add it to the number of bananas. 

First, let's find 45% of 200 bananas:
45% of 200 = 0.45 * 200 = 90

Now, let's add the result to the number of bananas:
200 (bananas) + 90 (additional pears) = 290

Since George has both bananas and pears, we need to add the number of bananas and pears to find the total number of fruits:
290 (bananas and pears) + 200 (bananas) = 490

The total number of fruits George has is 490."
"To find out how many candy bars Marissa bought for Jimmy, we need to subtract the cost of the ball from the amount of money Marissa had initially. 

Marissa had $80 initially and spent $20 on the ball. 

$80 (initial money) - $20 (cost of the ball) = $60

Now, we need to find out how many candy bars Marissa can buy with $60, given that each candy bar costs $5.

$60 (remaining money) / $5 (cost of each candy bar) = 12

So, Marissa bought 12 candy bars for Jimmy.

12"
"To find out how much money Sam needs to spend, we first need to determine how many kilograms of oranges are required to make 4 liters of juice. Since Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges to make 1 liter of juice, we can multiply this by 4 to find the total amount needed for 4 liters.

5 kilograms/orange * 4 liters/orange = 20 kilograms/orange

Now, we know that each kilogram of oranges costs $3. To find the total cost, we multiply the total kilograms of oranges needed by the cost per kilogram.

20 kilograms/orange * $3/kilogram = $60

So, Sam would have to spend $60 to make 4 liters of juice.

The final answer is: $60"
"To find out how many books Ahmed read, we need to divide the number of books Ezra read by 2, since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed. 

Ezra read 300 books, so Ahmed read 300 / 2 = 150 books.

Now, we need to add the number of books Ezra decided to read to the number of books he has already read. Ezra decided to read 150 more books, so he will have read 300 + 150 = 450 books in total.

To find the total number of books they have read altogether, we need to add the number of books Ezra will have read to the number of books Ahmed has read. 

Total books read = 450 (Ezra) + 150 (Ahmed) = 600

The final answer is: 600"
"To find out how much Tanya earned, we need to calculate her earnings for each day separately and then add them together.

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Since she earns $15 per hour, her total earnings for the hours worked would be 5 hours * $15/hour = $75. Additionally, she earns $5 per day for teaching more than 3 classes, so she earns an extra $5 for Monday. Therefore, her total earnings for Monday are $75 + $5 = $80.

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Her earnings for the hours worked would be 2 hours * $15/hour = $30. Since she teaches less than 3 classes, she doesn't earn the extra $5 per day. Therefore, her total earnings for Wednesday are $30.

Now, let's add her earnings for both days: $80 (Monday) + $30 (Wednesday) = $110.

The final answer is: $110"
"To find the difference in the number of vanilla scents sold compared to the fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of each type of scent sold.

The company sold 5 vanilla scents and there are 4 vanilla scents available, so the total number of vanilla scents sold is 5 * 4 = 20.

The company sold 2 fruity scents and there are 8 fruity scents available, so the total number of fruity scents sold is 2 * 8 = 16.

Now, we need to find the difference between the total number of vanilla scents sold and the total number of fruity scents sold. 

Difference = Total vanilla scents sold - Total fruity scents sold
Difference = 20 - 16
Difference = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate how much money Bennet will make from selling the eggplants. 

He sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total amount he will make from eggplants is 20 * 3 = $60.

Since Bennet wants to make a total of $135, and he will make $60 from the eggplants, he needs to make $135 - $60 = $75 from selling the corn.

He has 25 ears of corn, and he needs to make $75 from them. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the total amount he needs to make from corn ($75) by the number of ears of corn (25).

$75 / 25 = $3

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To find the percentage of Tatiana's weekend spent playing soccer, we first need to determine the total time she has available and the time she spends on other activities.

Tatiana has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, for a total of 12 hours.

She reads for 3 hours, leaving 12 - 3 = 9 hours for soccer and video games.

She plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time, which is 1/3 * 9 = 3 hours.

This leaves 9 - 3 = 6 hours for soccer.

To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we divide the time spent playing soccer by the total time available and multiply by 100.

(6 / 12) * 100 = 50%

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how many pencils Anthony kept, we need to follow the steps of the problem.

Anthony started with 50 pencils. He gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon. 

1/2 of 50 is 50 * 0.5 = 25 pencils given to Brandon. 
So, Anthony has 50 - 25 = 25 pencils left.

Then, he gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. 

3/5 of 25 is 25 * 0.6 = 15 pencils given to Charlie. 
So, Anthony has 25 - 15 = 10 pencils left.

Therefore, Anthony kept 10 pencils.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time it takes for him to drive to the museum, the time he spends at the museum, and the time it takes for him to drive back home.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Jack to drive to the museum. Since the distance is 150 miles and his speed is 75 mph, we can use the formula time = distance / speed.

Time to drive to the museum = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

Since he spends 6 hours at the museum, we need to add this to the time it takes to drive to the museum.

Total time so far = 2 hours (to drive to the museum) + 6 hours (at the museum) = 8 hours

Now, we need to calculate the time it takes for Jack to drive back home. Since the distance is the same (150 miles) and his speed is the same (75 mph), we can use the same formula.

Time to drive back home = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

Now, we add the time it takes to drive back home to the total time so far.

Total time = 8 hours (to drive to the museum and spend time at the museum) + 2 hours (to drive back home) = 10 hours

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many wheels Henry will need in total, we need to calculate the number of wheels required for the cars and the motorcycles separately and then add them together.

For the cars, Henry needs 4 wheels for each of the 57 cars. So, the total number of wheels required for the cars is 57 * 4 = 228.

For the motorcycles, Henry needs 2 wheels for each of the 73 motorcycles. So, the total number of wheels required for the motorcycles is 73 * 2 = 146.

Now, we add the total number of wheels required for the cars and the motorcycles: 228 + 146 = 374.

Since Henry has a box with 650 wheels, we subtract the total number of wheels required from the total number of wheels available: 650 - 374 = 276.

The final answer is: 276"
"To find the amount you have to pay after a 20% discount, we need to calculate 20% of the original price and subtract it from the original price.

20% of $1000 is calculated as 0.20 * 1000 = $200.

Now, subtract the discount from the original price: $1000 - $200 = $800.

So, you have to pay $800 after the discount.

The final answer is: $800"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how many movies are in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of movies in series = Total movies / 3
= 600 / 3
= 200

Now, we know that the cost of buying the series is $6 per movie, but we need to find the total cost of the series. Since we don't know the number of movies in each series, we'll assume that the cost of the series is $6 times the number of movies in series. However, we can't calculate the total cost of the series yet because we don't know the number of series. We'll come back to this later.

Next, let's find out how many movies are not in series. We can do this by subtracting the number of movies in series from the total number of movies:

Number of movies not in series = Total movies - Number of movies in series
= 600 - 200
= 400

Now, let's find out how many of these movies are older movies. Since 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of older movies = Number of movies not in series * 0.4
= 400 * 0.4
= 160

The remaining movies are not older movies, so they are normal movies. We can find the number of normal movies as follows:

Number of normal movies = Number of movies not in series - Number of older movies
= 400 - 160
= 240

Now, we know that the cost of a normal movie is $10, and the cost of an older movie is $5. We can calculate the total cost of the normal movies as follows:

Total cost of normal movies = Number of normal movies * Cost of a normal movie
= 240 * 10
= 2400

We still need to calculate the total cost of the series. Since we don't know the number of series, we'll assume that the number of series is 'x'. Then, the total cost of the series is $6 times the number of movies in series, which is $6 times 'x' times 200 (the number of movies in series). However, we can't calculate the total cost of the series yet because we don't know the number of series. We'll come back to this later.

However, we can calculate the total cost of the older movies as follows:

Total cost of older movies = Number of older movies * Cost of an older movie
= 160 * 5
= 800

Now, let's go back to the total cost of the series. We know that the total cost of the series is $6 times the number of movies in series, which is $6 times 'x' times 200. However, we also know that the total cost of the series is equal to the total cost of the movies minus the total cost of the normal movies and the total cost of the older movies. We can set up an equation to represent this:

Total cost of series = Total cost of movies - Total cost of normal movies - Total cost of older movies
6 * x * 200 = 600 * 10 - 2400 - 800
1200x = 6000 - 3200
1200x = 2800
x = 2800 / 1200
x = 2.33

Since we can't buy a fraction of a series, we'll round down to 2 series. Now, we can calculate the total cost of the series as follows:

Total cost of series = 2 * 6 * 200
= 2400

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the movies as follows:

Total cost of movies = Total cost of normal movies + Total cost of older movies + Total cost of series
= 2400 + 800 + 2400
= 5600

The final answer is: $5600"
"To find the total amount Winston spent on fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then add them together.

The cost of peaches is 6 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $12.00
The cost of plums is 8 pounds * $1.00 per pound = $8.00
The cost of apricots is 6 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $18.00

Now, let's add the costs together: $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00

The final answer is: $38.00"
"To find the distance to their vacation spot, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by both driving and hiking. 

First, let's find the speed at which they hiked. They drove at 50 miles per hour, and they hiked at 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Half of 50 is 25, and 5 miles per hour less than that is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

The time they spent driving is 6 hours - 1.5 hours = 4.5 hours. The distance they drove is speed multiplied by time, which is 50 * 4.5 = 225 miles.

The time they spent hiking is 1.5 hours, and their hiking speed is 20 miles per hour. The distance they hiked is speed multiplied by time, which is 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

The total distance to their vacation spot is the sum of the distance driven and the distance hiked, which is 225 + 30 = 255 miles.

The final answer is: 255"
"To find the difference in their scores, we need to calculate the points each of them earns from enemies, berries, and the timer.

Let's assume Emma's score from enemies is x. Since Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, Ava's score from enemies will be x + 8.

Emma's score from berries is 3 (since she collects 3 berries), and Ava collects 3 + 3 = 6 berries.

Now, let's consider the timer. The longer Ava takes, the lower her score will be. Since Ava finishes 4 seconds slower than Emma, let's assume Emma finishes the level in t seconds. Then, Ava finishes in t + 4 seconds.

Emma's score from the timer is 30t, and Ava's score from the timer is 30(t + 4).

The total score for Emma is x + 3 + 30t, and the total score for Ava is x + 8 + 6 + 30(t + 4).

Simplifying Ava's total score, we get x + 8 + 6 + 30t + 120 = x + 134 + 30t.

The difference in their scores is (x + 134 + 30t) - (x + 3 + 30t) = 131.

"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we first need to determine the total cost of the two pizzas that are already known. Since two pizzas cost 30 dollars each, the total cost for these two pizzas is 2 * 30 = 60 dollars.

Now, we subtract the cost of these two pizzas from the total cost of all four pizzas to find the total cost of the other two pizzas. The total cost of all four pizzas is 64 dollars, so the total cost of the other two pizzas is 64 - 60 = 4 dollars.

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we can find the cost of each pizza by dividing the total cost of the other two pizzas by 2. The cost of each of the other two pizzas is 4 / 2 = 2 dollars.

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of times they ride their bikes on usual days and the number of times they ride on the two extra days.

On usual days, they ride their bikes 3 times a day for 5 days. So, the total number of times they ride on usual days is 3 * 5 = 15.

On the two extra days, they ride twice the number of times they do on usual days, which is 2 * 3 = 6 times a day. Since there are two extra days, the total number of times they ride on these days is 6 * 2 = 12.

Now, we add the total number of times they ride on usual days and the extra days to get the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week. 15 + 12 = 27.

"Let's break down the information given:

Initially, Bob had 7 fish in his pond: 3 orange and 4 white.

After buying more fish, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Let's denote the number of white fish he bought as 'x'. The number of orange fish he bought would then be 2x.

The total number of fish in the pond after buying more fish is 7 (initial fish) + 17 (new fish) = 24.

The total number of orange fish in the pond is 3 (initial orange fish) + 2x (new orange fish) = 3 + 2x.

The total number of white fish in the pond is 4 (initial white fish) + x (new white fish) = 4 + x.

Since the total number of fish in the pond is 24, we can set up the equation: 3 + 2x + 4 + x = 24.

Combine like terms: 7 + 3x = 24.

Subtract 7 from both sides: 3x = 17.

Divide both sides by 3: x = 17/3.

However, since x must be a whole number (you can't buy a fraction of a fish), this solution doesn't make sense. Let's re-examine the problem.

The total number of fish in the pond after buying more fish is 24, and the total number of orange fish is 3 + 2x. The total number of white fish is 4 + x.

We also know that the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish, so we can set up the equation: 3 + 2x = 2(4 + x).

Simplify the equation: 3 + 2x = 8 + 2x.

Subtract 2x from both sides: 3 = 8.

This equation doesn't make sense, so let's re-examine the problem again.

The total number of fish in the pond after buying more fish is 24, and the total number of orange fish is 3 + 2x. The total number of white fish is 4 + x.

We also know that the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish, so we can set up the equation: 3 + 2x = 2(4 + x).

"To calculate the weekly fuel consumption, we need to determine the total miles driven per week and then divide it by the car's fuel efficiency.

The one-way distance between home and office is 5 miles, and Andy drives to and from work, so the total daily distance is 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles.

Since Andy drives to work from Monday to Friday, the total weekly distance is 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.

Now, we can calculate the weekly fuel consumption by dividing the total weekly distance by the car's fuel efficiency: 50 miles/week / 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week.

The price of regular gas is $3/gallon, so the weekly fuel cost is 5 gallons/week * $3/gallon = $15/week.

The final numerical answer is: $15"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Carrie was given and then subtract the amount she spent.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie was given. She was given 10 twenties and 140 quarters. 

The value of 10 twenties is 10 * $20 = $200.
The value of 140 quarters is 140 * $0.25 = $35.

So, the total amount of money Carrie was given is $200 + $35 = $235.

Carrie spent all the quarters, which is $35, and 3/5 of the twenties. 3/5 of $200 is (3/5) * $200 = $120.

The total amount of money Carrie spent is $35 + $120 = $155.

Therefore, the total amount of money she paid for lunch is $155.

The final answer is: $155"
"To find the total number of fruits, we need to calculate the total number of tomatoes and eggplants separately and then add them together.

"To find out how much money John is missing, we need to first determine how much the school will cover and then subtract that from the total cost of the trip.

The school will cover half the cost of the trip, which is $300 / 2 = $150.

Since John already has $50, we need to subtract the amount the school will cover from the total cost of the trip and then subtract John's contribution from that result.

First, subtract the school's contribution from the total cost: $300 - $150 = $150.

Then, subtract John's contribution from that result: $150 - $50 = $100.

John is missing $100."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the temperature at night and then calculate how many logs Carson needs to burn to reach the minimum temperature of 32 degrees.

First, let's find the temperature at night. It's 33 degrees colder during the night compared to the day, and the day temperature is 45 degrees. 

Night temperature = Day temperature - 33
Night temperature = 45 - 33
Night temperature = 12 degrees

Since the pipes will freeze at 32 degrees, Carson needs to heat the house from 12 degrees to 32 degrees. 

Temperature increase needed = 32 - 12
Temperature increase needed = 20 degrees

Each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we divide the temperature increase needed by the heat per log.

Number of logs = Temperature increase needed / Heat per log
Number of logs = 20 / 5
Number of logs = 4

"To find the total number of seashells brought back, we first need to determine the number of groups formed and the number of groups that brought back seashells.

Since 90 people were split into 9-person groups, we can find the total number of groups by dividing 90 by 9:

90 / 9 = 10 groups

Since 3/5 of the groups brought back seashells, we can find the number of groups that brought back seashells by multiplying the total number of groups by 3/5:

10 * (3/5) = 6 groups

Now, we know that each group that brought back seashells had 2 seashells. To find the total number of seashells brought back, we can multiply the number of groups that brought back seashells by 2:

6 * 2 = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the number of people on the train after the two stops, we need to subtract the number of people who got off and add the number of people who got on.

Initially, there were 172 people on the train.

At the first stop, 47 people got off, so we subtract 47 from 172:
172 - 47 = 125

Then, 13 people got on, so we add 13 to 125:
125 + 13 = 138

At the next stop, 38 people got off, so we subtract 38 from 138:
138 - 38 = 100

Therefore, there are 100 people on the train.

"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to first determine the total number of employees after three months and then multiply it by the monthly salary of each employee.

The company initially has 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. So, after one month, the total number of employees will be 200 + 20 = 220. After two months, it will be 220 + 20 = 240, and after three months, it will be 240 + 20 = 260.

Now, we multiply the total number of employees after three months (260) by the monthly salary of each employee ($4000).

Total amount = 260 * 4000
Total amount = 1,040,000

"To find out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we need to calculate their total earnings after working 20 hours.

Billy's initial hourly wage was $10. After 2 months, he got a raise of $0.50 per hour, making his new hourly wage $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. On his first anniversary, he got another raise of $1.00 per hour, making his final hourly wage $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50.

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary, which was $10. So, Sally's starting salary is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. 

Now, let's calculate their total earnings after working 20 hours:

Billy's total earnings = 20 hours * $11.50 per hour = $230
Sally's total earnings = 20 hours * $10.50 per hour = $210

The difference in their earnings is $230 - $210 = $20.

"To find the total number of trees planted by the students, we first need to find the total number of students. 

There are 40 classes with an average of 25 students per class. So, the total number of students is 40 * 25 = 1000.

Each student plants 1 tree, so the total number of trees planted by the students is 1000.

Next, we need to find the total number of trees planted by the teachers. There are 40 classes with an average of 3 teachers per class. So, the total number of teachers is 40 * 3 = 120.

Each teacher plants 2 trees, so the total number of trees planted by the teachers is 120 * 2 = 240.

Now, we add the total number of trees planted by the students and the teachers to find the total number of trees planted at the end of the campaign.

Total trees = 1000 (students) + 240 (teachers) = 1240

"To find out how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we first need to calculate the total number of stuffed animals she currently has. 

She has 3 puppies, 5 koalas, 2 zebras, and 4 frogs. 

Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Now, we need to find 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. 

30% of 14 = 0.3 * 14 = 4.2

Since we can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, we'll round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we'll consider the context of the problem. If Bubbles buys 5 stuffed goats, the percentage of stuffed goats will be 5/19, which is approximately 26.32%. This is less than 30%. If she buys 6 stuffed goats, the percentage of stuffed goats will be 6/19, which is approximately 31.58%. This is more than 30%. Therefore, Bubbles should buy 5 stuffed goats to get as close to 30% as possible.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total hours Kris has played and subtract that from the target of 30 hours.

First, let's calculate the hours Kris played in the first 2 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, 2 weeks is 2 * 7 = 14 days. If Kris plays for half an hour every day, she plays 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours in the first 2 weeks.

Next, let's calculate the hours Kris played in the next week. Since she plays for 2 hours every day, she plays 7 * 2 = 14 hours in the next week.

Now, let's add the hours Kris played in both periods: 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours.

To find out how many hours Kris still needs to play, we subtract the total hours played from the target of 30 hours: 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

"To find the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time.

The first car travels at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel:
Distance = Speed x Time = 60 miles/hour x 2 hours = 120 miles

The second car travels at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel:
Distance = Speed x Time = 70 miles/hour x 2 hours = 140 miles

Since the second car was initially passing the first car, we need to find the distance between them after 2 hours. The second car has traveled 140 miles, and the first car has traveled 120 miles. The distance between them is the difference between the two distances:
Distance = 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school.

First, let's find the number of students who passed in each grade level:

- Third grade: 340 students passed
- Fourth grade: 40 students passed
- Fifth grade: Since the pass rate for the fifth graders is twice the pass rate of the fourth graders, and the fourth graders had a 40/100 = 0.4 pass rate, the fifth graders had a 2 * 0.4 = 0.8 pass rate. The number of fifth graders who passed is 0.8 * 400 = 320 students.

Now, let's find the total number of students in the school:

- Third grade: 500 students
- Fourth grade: 100 students
- Fifth grade: 400 students
Total students = 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000 students

Next, let's find the total number of students who passed:

- Third grade: 340 students
- Fourth grade: 40 students
- Fifth grade: 320 students
Total students who passed = 340 + 40 + 320 = 700 students

Finally, we can find the overall pass rate by dividing the total number of students who passed by the total number of students in the school:

Overall pass rate = (Total students who passed) / (Total students) = 700 / 1000 = 0.7

The overall pass rate is 70%.

"To find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we first need to determine how many square inches of mosaic he can make with the glass chips he has. 

Since it takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic, and each bag holds 72 chips, we can calculate the total number of chips Milo has: 2 bags * 72 chips per bag = 144 chips.

Now, we need to find out how many square inches of mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make 1 square inch, we divide the total number of chips by 12: 144 chips / 12 chips per square inch = 12 square inches.

Since the mosaic is three inches tall, and we know the area of the mosaic (12 square inches), we can find the length by dividing the area by the height: 12 square inches / 3 inches = 4 inches.

Therefore, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long.

16 students drank 2 quarts each, so the total amount they drank is 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

The total amount of tea consumed is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we need to divide the total amount of tea consumed by 4 to find the total gallons consumed. However, the question asks for the amount at the beginning of the party, so we need to add the remaining tea to the total gallons consumed.

First, let's find the total gallons consumed: 38 quarts / 4 quarts per gallon = 9.5 gallons.

Now, we add the remaining tea to the total gallons consumed: 9.5 gallons + (10 quarts / 4 quarts per gallon) = 9.5 gallons + 2.5 gallons = 12 gallons.

The total amount of tea at the beginning of the party was 12 gallons."
"To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to first determine how many candies he has in total. 

Dale initially ordered 100 candies and then ordered 100 more. So, the total number of candies he has is 100 + 100 = 200.

However, he has already sold 150 candies. To find out how many he still needs to sell, we subtract the number of candies sold from the total number of candies he has. 

200 (total candies) - 150 (candies sold) = 50

So, Dale still needs to sell 50 candies to sell all of his candy.

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students at the end of each month and then subtract the initial number of students from it.

At the beginning of the year, there are 10 students.

- At the end of January, the number of students doubles, so there are 10 * 2 = 20 students.
- At the end of February, the number of students doubles again, so there are 20 * 2 = 40 students.
- At the end of March, the number of students doubles again, so there are 40 * 2 = 80 students.
- At the end of April, the number of students doubles again, so there are 80 * 2 = 160 students.
- At the end of May, the number of students doubles again, so there are 160 * 2 = 320 students.

Now, let's subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May to find the additional students: 320 - 10 = 310.

The final answer is: 310"
"To find the total number of branches Felix climbed, we need to divide the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch. 

Total money made: $105
Cost per branch: $0.25

Total branches climbed = Total money made / Cost per branch
Total branches climbed = $105 / $0.25
Total branches climbed = 420

Since Felix worked during the week (7 days), we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day.

Average branches per day = Total branches climbed / Number of days
Average branches per day = 420 / 7
Average branches per day = 60

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the total number of petals, we need to calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers and then subtract the petals that were lost.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers:

- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 * 5 = 15 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 * 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 * 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 * 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add up the total number of petals: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

However, Rose dropped 1 petal from each set of flowers, so we need to subtract the total number of petals lost: 1 * 4 = 4 petals

Now, let's subtract the petals lost from the total number of petals: 101 - 4 = 97 petals

The final answer is: 97"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many marshmallows are left in the bag after John and DeSean make their S'mores and drop some on the ground.

First, let's calculate the total number of marshmallows used by John and DeSean. Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, and they each made 9 S'mores, the total number of marshmallows used is 9 + 9 = 18.

However, they also dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground, so we need to subtract those from the total number of marshmallows used. But since we are trying to find out how many marshmallows are left, we should subtract the total number of marshmallows used from the initial number of marshmallows in the bag. 

So, the total number of marshmallows left is 35 - (18 + 3) = 35 - 21 = 14.

Since there are 14 marshmallows left, and there are two kids, we need to divide the remaining marshmallows by 2 to find out how many each kid can have.

14 / 2 = 7

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time each person plays and then determine how many quarters are used.

Jack can play for 20 minutes. His two friends who are worse can play for half as long, which is 20 / 2 = 10 minutes. The friend who is better can play for 1.5 times as long, which is 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes.

Since they play for 4 hours, we need to convert this to minutes: 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the total time each person plays:

- Jack: 240 minutes
- Two worse friends: 2 * 10 minutes = 20 minutes each, so 2 * 20 minutes = 40 minutes total
- Better friend: 240 minutes

Now, let's calculate the total time played by all friends: 240 (Jack) + 40 (worse friends) + 240 (better friend) = 520 minutes.

Since Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter, we need to calculate how many 20-minute intervals are in 520 minutes: 520 / 20 = 26.

However, we need to account for the fact that the better friend plays for 30 minutes, which is 1.5 times 20 minutes. So, we need to calculate how many 30-minute intervals are in 240 minutes: 240 / 30 = 8.

Since the better friend plays for 30 minutes, we need to add 8 quarters for the better friend, but we need to subtract 2 quarters because the better friend plays for 30 minutes instead of 20 minutes in 2 of the 8 intervals. So, we add 8 - 2 = 6 quarters for the better friend.

Now, let's calculate the total quarters used: 26 (for Jack and worse friends) + 6 (for the better friend) = 32 quarters.

The cost of 1 quarter is $0.25, so the total cost is 32 * $0.25 = $8.

The final answer is: $8"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. 

Let's denote the amount of citrus zest as Z, the amount of fragrance as F, the amount of salt as S, the amount of sugar as Su, and the amount of oil as O.

We are given that Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, so F = Z.

We are also given that she uses the same amount of salt as sugar, so S = Su.

Additionally, she uses twice as much oil as salt, so O = 2S.

And she uses twice as much salt as zest, so S = 2Z.

Since F = Z, we can substitute F with Z in the equation S = 2Z, which gives us S = 2Z and also F = 2Z.

Now we have O = 2S and S = 2Z. We can substitute S with 2Z in the equation O = 2S, which gives us O = 2(2Z) = 4Z.

We are also given that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces. The total amount of the mixture is the sum of the amounts of all the ingredients, so Z + F + S + Su + O = 10.

Since F = Z and S = Su = 2Z, we can substitute these values in the equation, which gives us Z + Z + 2Z + 2Z + 4Z = 10.

Combine like terms to get 10Z = 10.

Divide both sides by 10 to get Z = 1.

Now that we know Z = 1, we can find the amount of oil. Since O = 4Z, we can substitute Z = 1 in the equation, which gives us O = 4(1) = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total amount of money John spent, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows separately and then add them together.

The cost of the goats is 3 * $500 = $1500.
The cost of the cows is 2 * $1500 = $3000.

Now, we add the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows together: $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

The final answer is: $4500"
"To find out how many more cupcakes Paul needs to buy, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs.

Paul needs 63 cupcakes in total. He already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes, so the total number of cupcakes he has is 8 + 40 = 48.

Now, let's subtract the number of cupcakes he has from the total number of cupcakes he needs: 63 - 48 = 15.

So, Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes.

The final answer is: 15"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

2. Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find 20% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.2: 40 * 0.2 = 8. So, Joe sells 8 cars.

3. Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars to his mother.

4. Now, let's find out how many cars Joe has left. Initially, he had 40 cars. He sold 8 and gave away 16. So, the total number of cars he gave away or sold is 8 + 16 = 24.

5. To find out how many cars Joe has left, we subtract the total number of cars he gave away or sold from the initial number of cars: 40 - 24 = 16.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to first determine the total amount raised by the students. Since the charity raised a total of $175,000 and $50,000 came from organizations, the amount raised by the students is $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000.

Now, we know that there are 20 students and they all raised the same amount. To find the amount each student raised, we divide the total amount raised by the number of students: $125,000 / 20 = $6,250.

The final answer is: $6,250"
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the first day and the second day, and then add them together.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. 

On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she walked on the first day. Since she walked 8 hours on the first day, she walked 8 / 2 = 4 hours on the second day.

To find the total time in hours, we add the time from both days: 8 hours + 4 hours = 12 hours.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time from hours to minutes by multiplying by 60: 12 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 720 minutes.

The final numerical answer is: 720"
"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to first determine the total number of cars in the parking lot when he got out of class for lunch.

Initially, Hunter counted 50 cars. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, making the total 50 + 20 = 70 cars.

When he got out of class for lunch, 1/2 of the cars had left. This means that 1/2 of 70 cars had left, which is 70 / 2 = 35 cars.

So, the number of cars that remained in the parking lot when Hunter got out of class for lunch is 70 - 35 = 35 cars.

However, the question asks for the total number of cars he counted during the lunch break. Since 1/2 of the cars had left, the other half remained. Therefore, the total number of cars he counted during the lunch break is also 35.

The final answer is: 35"
"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of tasks he completes in a day and then multiply it by the number of days he works in a week.

John does 30 cycles of work a day, and each cycle has 5 different tasks. So, the total number of tasks he completes in a day is:
30 cycles/day * 5 tasks/cycle = 150 tasks/day

Since each task pays $1.20, the total amount John makes in a day is:
150 tasks/day * $1.20/task = $180/day

John works a full 7-day week, so the total amount he makes in a week is:
$180/day * 7 days = $1260

"To find the total points scored by Sasha, we need to calculate her points in both games. 

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. 

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points in the first game. 

So, in the second game, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points.

To find the total points scored by Sasha, we add her points from both games: 14 + 4 = 18.

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as 'x'. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is 341, which is the sum of the cards Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have. We can write the equation as x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341.

Combine like terms: 7x + 12 = 341.

Subtract 12 from both sides: 7x = 329.

Divide both sides by 7: x = 47.

Since PJ has x cards, PJ has 47 cards. Smendrick has 3x cards, so Smendrick has 3 * 47 = 141 cards. Becca has 3x + 12 cards, so Becca has 3 * 47 + 12 = 147 cards.

"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color of eggs and then add them together.

Cindy had 5 green eggs. 
She had twice as many blue eggs as green ones, so she had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.
She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.
She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add the number of eggs of each color together: 5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27.

"To calculate the total cost of shipping, we need to calculate the cost per pound and the cost per mile, then multiply them by their respective weights and distances. 

The cost per pound is $0.35, and the book weighs 4 pounds, so the cost for the weight is 4 * $0.35 = $1.40. 

The cost per mile is $0.08, and the book needs to be returned 20 miles away, so the cost for the distance is 20 * $0.08 = $1.60.

The total shipping cost is $1.40 + $1.60 = $2.00.

The book's purchase price is $32, and Amazon will only refund 75% of it, so the refund amount is 0.75 * $32 = $24.

The total amount Milly will lose is the shipping cost minus the refund amount, which is $2.00 - $24 = -$22.00. However, since we can't lose a negative amount of money, we need to recalculate the total loss by considering the refund as a positive value. 

The total loss is the shipping cost plus the difference between the purchase price and the refund amount, which is $2.00 + ($32 - $24) = $2.00 + $8.00 = $10.00.

"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the production for the first three weeks and then determine the pattern.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.
In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.
In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Now, let's add up the production for the first three weeks: 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in total each month, we can find out how much he produces in the fourth week by subtracting the production of the first three weeks from the total production: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

"To find the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends on TikTok in a week and then multiply it by 4.

First, let's calculate the time Britany spends on TikTok in a week:

- She records 18 videos, each taking 4 minutes. So, the total time spent recording videos is 18 * 4 = 72 minutes.
- She spends 2 hours writing songs, which is 2 * 60 = 120 minutes.
- She spends 15 minutes each day for 6 days on makeup, so the total time spent on makeup is 15 * 6 = 90 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time spent on TikTok in a week: 72 + 120 + 90 = 282 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 282 minutes to hours: 282 / 60 = 4.7 hours.

Now, let's multiply the time spent on TikTok in a week by 4 to get the time spent in a month: 4.7 * 4 = 18.8 hours.

The final numerical answer is: 18.8"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to first determine the cost of the initial installation and then add the cost of the additional items.

The initial installation includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. However, Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures that she needs installed. Since the initial installation already includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, and 1 chandelier, we only need to consider the additional items.

Angela has 2 extra mirrors (6 - 4 = 2), 1 extra chandelier (2 - 1 = 1), and 10 extra pictures (20 - 10 = 10). The cost of the additional items is $15.00 per item.

The total number of additional items is 2 (mirrors) + 1 (chandelier) + 10 (pictures) = 13 items.

The cost of the additional items is 13 items * $15.00 per item = $195.00.

The initial installation cost is $129.00.

The total cost is $129.00 (initial installation) + $195.00 (additional items) = $324.00.

The final answer is: $324.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much money Anthony has saved, and then calculate 40% more than that amount.

First, we know that Eva has saved $20.00. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, so Anthony has saved $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.

Since Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony, we need to find 40% of $30.00 and add it to $30.00. 

40% of $30.00 is 0.4 x $30.00 = $12.00. 

So, Roy has saved $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

The final answer is: $42.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain in relation to Pompei's lifting capacity. 

First, we know that Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, and Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch. So, Saskay can lift a mountain 12 * 1 = 12 inches.

Next, Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Finally, Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 since there are 12 inches in a foot. 

480 / 12 = 40 feet.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the speed of the kangaroos. Since it takes 3 kangaroos 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can assume that the total distance is the same for all animals. Let's denote the speed of a kangaroo as 'k'. 

The total distance traveled by 3 kangaroos in 18 hours is 3 * k * 18. 

Now, we need to find the speed of the turtles, which is half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of a turtle is k/2.

Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of the kangaroos, it will take them twice as long to cover the same distance. 

Let's denote the time it takes for the turtles to travel the distance as 't'. Then, the distance traveled by the turtles is (k/2) * t.

Since the distance is the same for both the kangaroos and the turtles, we can set up the equation:

3 * k * 18 = (k/2) * t

To solve for 't', we can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

6 * k * 18 = k * t

Now, we can divide both sides by k to get:

6 * 18 = t

t = 108

So, it will take the four turtles 108 hours to travel across the highway.

The final answer is: 108"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. We know that Kora made 20 dishes. Since Rory makes 20 more clay dishes than Kora, Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes. 

Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

To find the total number of clay dishes they all made together, we need to add the number of dishes made by each of them: 20 (Kora) + 40 (Rory) + 80 (Jada) = 140.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. The laptop costs $600.
2. The price is reduced by $200 if she trades in her old laptop, so the new price is $600 - $200 = $400.
3. Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job.
4. Her mom gives her $80 to help.
5. After all these, she only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop.

We know that after receiving the $150 and $80, Erika has a total of $50 left to buy the laptop. So, the total amount she has is $50 (remaining amount) + $400 (new price of the laptop) = $450.

Now, let's find out how much she had before receiving the $150 and $80. We can subtract these amounts from the total: $450 - $150 (part-time job) - $80 (mom's help) = $220.

So, Erika had $220 in her purse initially.

The final answer is: $220"
"To find out how many slices Adam has left, we first need to calculate the total number of slices he has. 

First, let's calculate the number of slices from the large apples. Since a large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces, and Adam has 3 large apples, the total number of slices from large apples is 3 * 5 = 15.

Next, let's calculate the number of slices from the small apples. Since a small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces, and Adam has 5 small apples, the total number of slices from small apples is 5 * 3 = 15.

Now, we add the total number of slices from large and small apples to get the total number of slices Adam has. 15 (large) + 15 (small) = 30.

Since Adam eats 15 slices, we subtract the number of slices he ate from the total number of slices to find out how many are left. 30 - 15 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how many cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to calculate the total amount of milk the farmer currently produces. 

The farmer extracts 5 liters of milk a day from each cow, and he has 3 cows. So, the total amount of milk he currently produces is 5 liters/cow * 3 cows = 15 liters/day.

To find out how many more cows he needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we subtract the current production from the target production: 25 liters/day - 15 liters/day = 10 liters/day.

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, we need to find out how many cows are needed to produce 10 liters of milk a day. We can do this by dividing the target production by the amount of milk each cow produces: 10 liters/day / 5 liters/cow = 2 cows.

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the length of each used portion and subtract it from the original length of the glue stick.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so the used portion is 1 - 1/6 = 5/6. The length of the used portion is 5/6 * 12 mm = 10 mm.

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so the used portion is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3. The length of the used portion is 1/3 * 12 mm = 4 mm.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so the used portion is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2. The length of the used portion is 1/2 * 12 mm = 6 mm.

Now, let's calculate the total length of the used portions: 10 mm + 4 mm + 6 mm = 20 mm.

The total length of the glue sticks is 3 * 12 mm = 36 mm.

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 36 mm - 20 mm = 16 mm.

He also buys 3 packs of water balloons for $3 each, so the total cost of the water balloons is 3 * $3 = $9.

The total amount Craig spent is $12 + $9 = $21.

To find out how much money he has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $40 - $21 = $19.

The final answer is: $19"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so the number of socks Jack has is 60 / 2 = 30 socks.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has 2 * 30 = 60 socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:
Total socks = Jack's socks + Peter's socks = 30 + 60 = 90 socks
Total dishes = Jack's dishes + Peter's dishes = 60 + 30 = 90 dishes

The total number of socks and dishes they have together is 90 + 90 = 180."
"To find the number of students good at math, we need to consider the total number of students and the number of students good at both subjects. 

Let's denote the number of students good at both math and English as x. We know that the total number of students is 20, and the number of students good at math only is 5, and the number of students good at English only is 8.

We can set up an equation based on the total number of students:

Total students = Students good at math only + Students good at English only + Students good at both

20 = 5 + 8 + x

Simplifying the equation:

20 = 13 + x

Subtract 13 from both sides:

7 = x

This means that 7 students are good at both math and English. To find the total number of students good at math, we need to add the number of students good at math only (5) and the number of students good at both (7):

Students good at math = Students good at math only + Students good at both
= 5 + 7
= 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find out how many groups can perform, we need to calculate the total available time for performances. The concert is 2 hours long, which is 120 minutes. Subtracting the 10-minute intermission, we have 120 - 10 = 110 minutes left for performances.

Each group takes 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit the stage, for a total of 10 minutes per group. 

Now, we can divide the total available time for performances (110 minutes) by the time each group takes (10 minutes) to find the number of groups that can perform: 110 / 10 = 11.

The final answer is: 11"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand that it's a simple interest scenario. The interest rate is 3/4 of the original amount per year, which can be expressed as 0.75 or 75% of the principal amount.

The formula for simple interest is: A = P(1 + rt), where A is the total amount, P is the principal amount, r is the interest rate, and t is the time period in years.

Given that the principal amount (P) is $300, the interest rate (r) is 0.75, and the time period (t) is 3 years, we can plug these values into the formula:

A = 300(1 + 0.75*3)
A = 300(1 + 2.25)
A = 300(3.25)
A = 975

The total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is $975.

The final answer is: $975"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of white shirts with no collars and the number of floral shirts with no buttons.

First, let's find the number of white shirts with collars. Since half of the white shirts have collars, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of white shirts with collars = Total number of white shirts / 2
= 40 / 2
= 20

Now, let's find the number of white shirts with no collars:

Number of white shirts with no collars = Total number of white shirts - Number of white shirts with collars
= 40 - 20
= 20

Next, let's find the number of floral shirts with buttons. We are given that 20 of the floral shirts have buttons.

Now, let's find the number of floral shirts with no buttons:

Number of floral shirts with no buttons = Total number of floral shirts - Number of floral shirts with buttons
= 50 - 20
= 30

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars:

Difference = Number of floral shirts with no buttons - Number of white shirts with no collars
= 30 - 20
= 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how much the farmer will earn, we need to determine how many trays he can fill with 900 eggs. 

Since each tray holds 30 eggs, we can divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs per tray to find the number of trays.

Number of trays = Total eggs / Eggs per tray
= 900 / 30
= 30 trays

Now, we know the farmer has 30 trays. To find out how much he will earn, we multiply the number of trays by the price per tray.

Earnings = Number of trays * Price per tray
= 30 * $2.5
= $75

The final answer is: $75"
"To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we first need to determine the number of goats sold from each farm. 

From Farm X, Mr. Smith sold 10 goats. 
From Farm Y, he sold twice as many goats as from Farm X, which is 2 * 10 = 20 goats.

Now, let's calculate the number of goats left in each farm:
- Farm X: 55 - 10 = 45 goats
- Farm Y: 45 - 20 = 25 goats

To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the number of goats in Farm X and Farm Y:
45 (Farm X) + 25 (Farm Y) = 70 goats

The final answer is: 70"
"To find the average cost of each pair of shoes, we need to divide the total amount spent on shoes per year by the number of pairs bought per year.

First, let's calculate the number of pairs James buys per year. Since he buys 2 pairs of shoes a month, and there are 12 months in a year, he buys 2 * 12 = 24 pairs of shoes per year.

Now, let's divide the total amount spent on shoes per year ($2640) by the number of pairs bought per year (24):

$2640 ÷ 24 = $110

So, James pays an average of $110 per pair of shoes."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food, then subtract the discount for the red food baskets.

The cost of 3 baskets of green food is 3 * $25 = $75.

The cost of 3 baskets of red food is 3 * $18 = $54.

Since you get $2 off for each basket of red food, the total discount is 3 * $2 = $6.

The total cost is $75 + $54 - $6 = $123.

The final answer is: $123"
"To find the time it takes to clean one-half of the rooms, we first need to determine the number of rooms that is half of 90. 

90 / 2 = 45 rooms

Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, we multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room.

45 rooms * 20 minutes/room = 900 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours

The final numerical answer is: 15"
"To find the total number of homes built over the next three years, we need to calculate the number of homes built each year and then sum them up.

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will count the total number of homes built in the first two years and double it. The total number of homes built in the first two years is 12 + 36 = 48. Doubling this amount gives 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

Now, let's add up the number of homes built each year: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144.

The final answer is: 144"
"Let's denote my age as 'A', my brother's age as 'B', and my sister's age as 'C'. 

Since I am three years younger than my brother, A = B - 3. 
I am 2 years older than my sister, so A = C + 2. 
My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so my mom's age = 3B - 1. 

The sum of all our ages is 87, so A + B + C + (3B - 1) = 87. 

Substituting A = B - 3 and A = C + 2 into the equation, we get (B - 3) + B + C + (3B - 1) = 87. 
Combine like terms: 5B + C - 4 = 87. 

Now, substitute A = C + 2 into A = B - 3: C + 2 = B - 3. 
Rearrange the equation to get C = B - 5. 

Substitute C = B - 5 into 5B + C - 4 = 87: 5B + (B - 5) - 4 = 87. 
Combine like terms: 6B - 9 = 87. 
Add 9 to both sides: 6B = 96. 
Divide by 6: B = 16. 

Now that we know B = 16, we can find C: C = B - 5 = 16 - 5 = 11. 
And we can find A: A = C + 2 = 11 + 2 = 13. 

The final answer is: 13"
"To find out how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we first need to determine the total number of glue sticks required. Since each student needs 2 glue sticks and there are 27 students, the total number of glue sticks needed is 27 * 2 = 54.

Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks required by the number of glue sticks per pack to find out how many packs are needed. However, since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs and expects to have some extra glue sticks left over, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.

To do this, we can divide 54 by 8, which gives us 6.75. Since we can't buy a fraction of a pack, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 7.

Therefore, Mr. Jackson will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water passing through the river at the given point over the three days.

On the first day, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

On the second day, the amount of water passing through the river doubles, so it becomes 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.

On the third day, the amount of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons, so it becomes 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

To find the total amount of water passing through the river at that point over the three days, we need to add the amounts of water passing through the river each day.

Total amount of water = 4000 + 8000 + 14000 = 24000 gallons.

The final answer is: 24000"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of exponential growth. Since each infected person infects six others, we can model the growth of the infected population using a geometric progression.

Let's denote the initial number of infected people as P0 = 10. The number of new infections each day can be calculated as 6 times the number of infected people from the previous day.

Day 1: P1 = P0 + 6P0 = 10 + 6(10) = 10 + 60 = 70
Day 2: P2 = P1 + 6P1 = 70 + 6(70) = 70 + 420 = 490
Day 3: P3 = P2 + 6P2 = 490 + 6(490) = 490 + 2940 = 3430

Therefore, the total number of people infected after three days is 3430.

The final answer is: 3430"
"To find out how much money Julieta received, we need to calculate 10% of Rafaela's total tips and subtract it from Rafaela's total tips. 

Rafaela received $20 from each of the 40 customers, so her total tips are 40 * $20 = $800.

10% of $800 is 0.1 * $800 = $80. 

Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela, so she received $800 - $80 = $720.

To find the total amount of money they received altogether, we add their tips together: $800 + $720 = $1520.

The final answer is: $1520"
"To find out how many oranges Jennifer remained with, we need to calculate the total number of oranges she gave away and subtract that from the initial number of oranges she bought.

First, let's calculate the total number of oranges given to her daughters: 3 daughters * 2 oranges per daughter = 6 oranges.

Then, add the number of oranges given to her son: 6 oranges + 3 oranges = 9 oranges.

Now, subtract the total number of oranges given away from the initial number of oranges: 12 oranges - 9 oranges = 3 oranges.

The final answer is: 3"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Claire earns 1 badge per month.
- Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge than Claire, so Amber earns 1/2 badge per month.
- Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so Wendy earns 3 badges per month.

In a 1-year time frame (12 months), the number of badges earned by each girl is as follows:

- Claire: 1 badge/month * 12 months = 12 badges
- Amber: 1/2 badge/month * 12 months = 6 badges
- Wendy: 3 badges/month * 12 months = 36 badges

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a 1-year time frame, we subtract the number of badges earned by Amber from the number of badges earned by Wendy:

36 badges (Wendy) - 6 badges (Amber) = 30 badges

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how much Paige raised, we need to calculate the total number of slices she baked and sold. 

First, let's find out how many hours she baked. She baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is 5 hours.

Since she can bake 2 loaves per hour, and each hour she baked for 5 hours, she baked a total of 2 * 5 = 10 loaves.

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices is 10 * 8 = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, and she sold all 80 slices. To find the total amount raised, we need to convert the total number of slices to dollars. 

Since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents, we can convert 50 cents to dollars by dividing by 100. So, 50 cents is equal to 0.5 dollars.

Now, we multiply the number of slices by the price per slice: 80 * 0.5 = 40 dollars.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find the total number of coins Gretchen has, we need to determine the number of silver coins first. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, and Gretchen has 70 gold coins, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship.

Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. Then, the number of gold coins can be represented as 'x + 30'. We know that the number of gold coins is 70, so we can set up the equation:

x + 30 = 70

To solve for 'x', we subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:

x = 70 - 30
x = 40

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins. To find the total number of coins, we add the number of silver coins to the number of gold coins:

Total coins = Number of silver coins + Number of gold coins
Total coins = 40 + 70
Total coins = 110

The final answer is: 110"
"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we first need to determine the total number of burritos consumed. 

There were 50 students at the picnic, and each student was given 10 burritos. So, the total number of burritos given to the students is 50 * 10 = 500.

Mr. George also ate 20 burritos. Therefore, the total number of burritos consumed is 500 (by students) + 20 (by Mr. George) = 520.

Since there were 600 burritos ordered initially, the total number of leftover burritos is 600 - 520 = 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the number of yellow cars, we first need to determine the number of green and blue cars. 

We know there are 12 red cars. The rink has 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so the number of green cars is 12 - 2 = 10.

The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars, so the number of blue cars is 3 * 10 = 30.

Now, we know the total number of red, green, and blue cars: 12 (red) + 10 (green) + 30 (blue) = 52.

Since the rink has 75 cars in total, the number of yellow cars is 75 - 52 = 23.

The final answer is: 23"
"Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as F, the number of books Anne has as A, and the number of books Sofie has as S.

We are given that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so we can write an equation: S = A + 25.

We are also given that Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so we can write another equation: A = F - 12.

We are also given that together, Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have 85 books, so we can write a third equation: S + A + F = 85.

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the third equation to get: (A + 25) + A + F = 85.

Combine like terms: 2A + 25 + F = 85.

Subtract 25 from both sides: 2A + F = 60.

Now, substitute the second equation into this one: 2(F - 12) + F = 60.

Distribute the 2: 2F - 24 + F = 60.

Combine like terms: 3F - 24 = 60.

Add 24 to both sides: 3F = 84.

Divide both sides by 3: F = 28.

"To find out how much Greg will spend on Jello, we first need to determine how many Jello cups he needs to buy. Since there will be 30 kids and each kid will have 4 Jello cups, we multiply the number of kids by the number of cups per kid: 30 kids * 4 cups/kid = 120 cups.

Since one 3-ounce box of Jello makes 10 small Jello cups, we need to find out how many boxes Greg needs to buy. We divide the total number of cups needed by the number of cups per box: 120 cups / 10 cups/box = 12 boxes.

Now, we need to find out how much Greg will spend on Jello. Each box costs $1.25, so we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box: 12 boxes * $1.25/box = $15.

The final answer is: $15"

"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we first need to determine how much Keenan spends in a month. Since Madeline pays 60% of the total cost, Keenan pays the remaining 40%. 

First, let's calculate Keenan's monthly expenditure: 
Total monthly expenditure = $400
Madeline's monthly expenditure = 60% of $400 = 0.6 * $400 = $240
Keenan's monthly expenditure = Total monthly expenditure - Madeline's monthly expenditure
Keenan's monthly expenditure = $400 - $240 = $160

Now, we need to find out how much Keenan spends per week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we can divide Keenan's monthly expenditure by 4:
Keenan's weekly expenditure = Keenan's monthly expenditure / 4
Keenan's weekly expenditure = $160 / 4
Keenan's weekly expenditure = $40

The final answer is: $40"
"To find out how many pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he ate on each day and add them up.

On the first day, he ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces. To find 2/5 of 60, we multiply 60 by 2 and divide by 5:
60 * 2 = 120
120 / 5 = 24

So, on the first day, he ate 24 pieces.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces. To find the remaining pieces after the first two days, we subtract the pieces eaten on the first two days from the total:
60 - 24 - 10 = 26

Now, we need to find 7/13 of 26:
26 * 7 = 182
182 / 13 = 14.15 (round to 14, since you can't eat a fraction of a piece)

So, on the third day, he ate 14 pieces.

Now, let's add up the pieces eaten on each day:
24 (first day) + 10 (second day) + 14 (third day) = 48

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water, we first need to determine the cost per bottle of soda and the cost per bottle of water.

The cost of 7 bottles of soda is $21.00, so the cost per bottle of soda is $21.00 / 7 = $3.00 per bottle.

The cost of 4 bottles of water is $8.00, so the cost per bottle of water is $8.00 / 4 = $2.00 per bottle.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:

Cost of 3 bottles of soda = 3 * $3.00 = $9.00
Cost of 2 bottles of water = 2 * $2.00 = $4.00
Total cost = $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00

The cost of each bolt is $0.03, and David wants to buy 16 bolts. 

Total cost = Number of bolts * Cost per bolt
Total cost = 16 * $0.03
Total cost = $0.48

Now, we subtract the total cost from the initial amount of money David has:

Initial amount = $12.48
Total cost = $0.48
Amount left = Initial amount - Total cost
Amount left = $12.48 - $0.48
Amount left = $12.00

"To find out how much Ella would earn after 12 hours of dog walking at the same rate, we need to first determine her hourly rate. 

We know that Ella earned $33 for 3 hours of dog walking. To find her hourly rate, we can divide the total amount earned by the number of hours worked.

Hourly rate = Total amount earned / Number of hours worked
Hourly rate = $33 / 3 hours
Hourly rate = $11 per hour

Now that we know her hourly rate, we can calculate her earnings for 12 hours of dog walking.

Earnings for 12 hours = Hourly rate * Number of hours worked
Earnings for 12 hours = $11 per hour * 12 hours
Earnings for 12 hours = $132

"To find out how many marbles Paul has left, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, Paul has 52 marbles. His friend gave him 28 marbles, so now he has 52 + 28 = 80 marbles.

Then, he lost 1/4 of his marbles. To find 1/4 of 80, we multiply 80 by 1/4, which is the same as dividing 80 by 4. 

80 / 4 = 20

So, Paul lost 20 marbles. To find out how many marbles he has left, we subtract 20 from the total number of marbles he had after receiving the gift from his friend.

80 - 20 = 60

Therefore, Paul has 60 marbles left.

"To find Amy's total score, we need to calculate the points she earns from each type of question and add them together.

First, let's calculate the points from the multiple-choice questions. Amy correctly answers 80% of the 10 multiple-choice questions, so she answers 0.8 * 10 = 8 questions correctly. Since each multiple-choice question is worth 1 point, she earns 8 points from the multiple-choice questions.

Next, let's calculate the points from the true/false questions. Amy correctly answers 90% of the 20 true/false questions, so she answers 0.9 * 20 = 18 questions correctly. Since each true/false question is worth 1 point, she earns 18 points from the true/false questions.

Finally, let's calculate the points from the long-answer questions. Amy correctly answers 60% of the 5 long-answer questions, so she answers 0.6 * 5 = 3 questions correctly. Since each long-answer question is worth 5 points, she earns 3 * 5 = 15 points from the long-answer questions.

"To find out how much money Isaias bought the chickens for, we first need to determine how many chickens he plans to sell. Since he has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them, we can calculate the number of chickens he plans to sell as follows:

Number of chickens to sell = 300 * (3/5)
= 300 * 0.6
= 180 chickens

Next, we know that he plans to sell these chickens at $50 per chicken. To find the total revenue from selling these chickens, we multiply the number of chickens by the price per chicken:

Total revenue = Number of chickens to sell * Price per chicken
= 180 * $50
= $9000

Since Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000, we can set up an equation to find the total cost of the chickens:

Total revenue - Total cost = Profit
$9000 - Total cost = $2000

To find the total cost, we subtract the profit from the total revenue:

Total cost = Total revenue - Profit
= $9000 - $2000
= $7000

Therefore, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for sale for $7000.

The final answer is: $7000"
"To find out how many glasses Micah and Mitchell sold, we need to divide the total number of glasses sold by 2, since they sold an equal number. 

Total glasses sold = 32
Number of people who sold an equal number of glasses = 2 (Micah and Mitchell)
Glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell = Total glasses sold / 2 = 32 / 2 = 16

Since Julie sold 14 glasses, we can find out how many more glasses she sold than Micah by subtracting the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold.

Glasses sold by Julie = 14
Glasses sold by Micah = 16
Difference = Glasses sold by Julie - Glasses sold by Micah = 14 - 16 = -2

The rope is 20 meters long, and her friend wants to buy it for $2 a meter. So, the total amount of money Sarah will get is 20 * $2 = $40.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 a meter, and Sarah wants to buy a rope of the same length, which is 20 meters. So, the total cost of the new rope is 20 * $1.5 = $30.

Now, we need to find out how much money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope. To do this, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the total amount of money Sarah will get from selling the old rope: $40 - $30 = $10.

The final answer is: $10"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Melanie's current age. Since in 10 years, she will be 18 years old, we can subtract 10 from 18 to find her current age.

Current age = 18 - 10 = 8 years

Now, we need to find the number of years it will take for her age to be thrice her current age. Let's call this number 'x'. We can set up the equation:

Age in x years = 3 * Current age
8 + x = 3 * 8

Simplifying the equation, we get:
8 + x = 24

Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get:
x = 16

So, it will take 16 years for Melanie's age to be thrice her current age.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's find the cost of the chicken. Since each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, and the 5 packs of bacon cost $10, the cost of each pack of chicken is $10 / 5 = $2. Since Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, the total cost of the chicken is 6 * $2 = $12.

Next, let's find the cost of the strawberries. Each pack of strawberries costs $4, and Kelly has 3 packs, so the total cost of the strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.

Now, let's find the cost of the apples. Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is $4 / 2 = $2. Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost of the apples is 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items in Kelly's cart: $10 (bacon) + $12 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $48.

Finally, let's subtract the total cost of the items from Kelly's budget: $65 - $48 = $17.

The final answer is: $17"
"Let's break down the information given. Elaina's final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, and the total runtime of the final concert, including the encore, is 65 minutes. 

Let's denote the runtime of her usual concerts as 'x'. Since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, its runtime is 2x. The encore adds 15 minutes to the total runtime. So, the equation becomes:

2x + 15 = 65

To find the value of 'x', we need to isolate it. Subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 65 - 15
2x = 50

Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for 'x':

x = 50 / 2
x = 25

So, her usual concerts run for 25 minutes.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how many toys Argo has now, we need to subtract the number of toys he gave away from the total number of toys he initially had.

Argo initially had 200 toys. He gave away 40 toys to Alyssa, 80 toys to Bonnie, and 30 toys to Nicky. 

First, let's add up the number of toys he gave away: 40 + 80 + 30 = 150 toys.

Now, let's subtract the number of toys he gave away from the initial number of toys: 200 - 150 = 50.

So, Argo has 50 toys now.

The final answer is: 50"

On Tuesday, they make 125 chimichangas. 
On Wednesday, they also make 125 chimichangas. 
On Friday, they make twice as many as on Tuesday and Wednesday, which is 2 * 125 = 250 chimichangas.

Now, let's add the number of chimichangas made on each day: 
125 (Tuesday) + 125 (Wednesday) + 250 (Friday) = 500

"To find the number of pairs of microphones that can be arranged, we first need to find the total number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs. 

Let's assume the total number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs is 'x'. Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the total number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs is 2x.

However, we know that the singer has 50 microphones in total. Since 20% of the microphones won't find any space to fit in, the number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs is 80% of 50, which is 0.8 * 50 = 40.

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs of microphones that can be arranged is 40 / 2 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total number of birds, we need to calculate the number of birds in each group and add them together.

First, let's find the number of birds nesting in the bushes: 6.

Next, we need to find 2/3 of the number of birds nesting in the bushes. To do this, we multiply 6 by 2/3, which is the same as multiplying 6 by 2 and then dividing by 3. 

6 * 2 = 12
12 / 3 = 4

So, 2/3 of the number of birds nesting in the bushes is 4. Since Jerry also sees 4 birds flying overhead, we add these to the number of birds nesting in the bushes: 6 + 4 = 10.

Now, let's find the number of birds feeding. Jerry sees 3 groups of 8 birds each, so we multiply 3 by 8 to find the total number of birds feeding: 3 * 8 = 24.

Finally, we add the number of birds nesting, flying, and feeding to find the total number of birds: 6 + 10 + 24 = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find out how many cookies were in each jar, we need to first determine how many cookies Lani had left after eating 5. 

Lani started with 55 cookies and ate 5, so she had 55 - 5 = 50 cookies left.

Since she placed the remaining cookies equally into 5 jars, we need to divide the remaining cookies by 5.

50 cookies / 5 jars = 10 cookies per jar.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of petals on the orchids, we multiply the number of orchids by the number of petals per orchid: 5 orchids * 5 petals/orchid = 25 petals.

To find the total number of petals on the daisies, we multiply the number of daisies by the number of petals per daisy: 4 daisies * 10 petals/daisy = 40 petals.

Now, we subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies to find the difference: 40 petals - 25 petals = 15 petals.

The daisies have 15 more petals compared to the orchids.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the percentage of flowering plants, we first need to determine the number of flowering plants. 

There are 100 plants in total. One-fourth of them are indoor plants, which is 100 * (1/4) = 25 plants. 

The remaining plants are 100 - 25 = 75 plants. Two-thirds of these remaining plants are outdoor plants, which is 75 * (2/3) = 50 plants. 

The rest of the remaining plants are flowering plants, which is 75 - 50 = 25 plants.

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100: (25/100) * 100 = 25%.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to determine the speed of the thingamabob first. Since the whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob, and the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, we can find the speed of the thingamabob by dividing the speed of the whatchamacallit by 11.

Speed of thingamabob = Speed of whatchamacallit / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 121 / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 11 meters per second

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig by multiplying the speed of the thingamabob by 5.

Speed of whirligig = Speed of thingamabob * 5
Speed of whirligig = 11 * 5
Speed of whirligig = 55 meters per second

The final answer is: 55"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the price of one carrot as 'c'. Since the yogurt is half the price of the salad, the price of the yogurt is $6 / 2 = $3.

Ellen pays a total of $11 for her daily goods, which include two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt. We can write an equation to represent this:

2c + 6 + 3 = 11

Combine the constants on the left side of the equation:

2c + 9 = 11

Subtract 9 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with the variable:

2c = 2

Divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for 'c':

c = 1

So, Ellen pays $1 for one carrot every day.

The final answer is: $1"
"To find out how much Mark makes a week, we need to calculate his new hourly wage and then multiply it by the number of hours he works in a week.

Mark's new hourly wage is $10 (old wage) + $2 (raise) = $12 per hour.

Mark works 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, so the total number of hours he works in a week is 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week.

Now, we multiply his new hourly wage by the total number of hours he works in a week: $12/hour * 40 hours/week = $480/week.

The final answer is: $480"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn. Let's denote the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. 

Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times. 

The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.

The total number of lawns she mowed is 3x + x + 5x = 9x. 

We know that she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn, and since she mowed Joe's lawn 'x' times, she made a total of $6x from mowing lawns.

We are given that she made a total of $80 from both lemonade sales and mowing lawns. So, we can set up the equation:

6x + lemonade sales = 80

We also know that she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn, so we can set up another equation:

6x = 6

Dividing both sides by 6, we get:

x = 1

Now that we know x = 1, we can substitute this value into the first equation:

6(1) + lemonade sales = 80

6 + lemonade sales = 80

Subtracting 6 from both sides:

lemonade sales = 74

The final answer is: $74"
"To find Harry's weight, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. Martin's weight is 55 kg.
2. Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so Carl's weight = 55 + 16 = 71 kg.
3. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight = 71 + 8 = 79 kg.
4. Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight = 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

The final answer is: 74"
"To find John's total monthly income from renting out his car, we need to calculate the total number of hours he rents his car and multiply it by his hourly rate.

He rents his car 10 times a month for 3 hours each time, so the total number of hours is:
10 rentals/month * 3 hours/rental = 30 hours/month

His hourly rate is $25, so his total monthly income is:
30 hours/month * $25/hour = $750/month

To find his profit, we need to subtract his car payment from his total monthly income:
$750/month - $500/month = $250/month

So, John makes a profit of $250 on his car each month.

The final answer is: $250"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Martha initially had some notebooks, but we don't know the exact number. However, we do know that after buying 5 more, she had a total of 7 notebooks. This means she initially had 7 - 5 = 2 notebooks.

Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, and Martha initially had 2 notebooks, Joseph had 3 * 2 = 6 notebooks.

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph. To do this, we subtract the number of notebooks Joseph has from the number of notebooks Martha has. Martha has 7 notebooks, and Joseph has 6 notebooks, so Martha has 7 - 6 = 1 more notebook than Joseph.

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we first need to determine the distance rowed by Anis. 

Dijana rowed 50 miles. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. To find 1/5 of Dijana's distance, we multiply 50 by 1/5, which is 10 miles. 

So, Anis rowed 50 + 10 = 60 miles. 

Now, to find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we add their individual distances: 50 (Dijana) + 60 (Anis) = 110 miles.

"To find out how many cookies each of Susan's nephews will get, we first need to determine the total number of cookies available after her husband took some. 

Initially, Susan had 100 cookies. Her husband took 4 cookies, so we subtract 4 from 100 to get the remaining number of cookies: 100 - 4 = 96.

Now, we need to divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews, which is 6. To do this, we'll divide 96 by 6.

96 ÷ 6 = 16

So, each of Susan's nephews will get 16 cookies."
"To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we need to calculate the total number of pages each of them read.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. 

Today, Denise read 5 more than as many pages as Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read 5 + 13 = 18 pages today.

So, Denise's total pages read is 10 (yesterday) + 18 (today) = 28 pages.

Daniel's total pages read is 13 (yesterday) + 0 (today) = 13 pages.

The difference in the number of pages read by Denise and Daniel is 28 - 13 = 15.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many bowls of soup will be used for dinner and then calculate how many times the leftover soup can fill the children's bowls.

For dinner, there are 3 adults (Calvin, his wife, and himself) and 2 children. Each person eats one bowl, so the total number of bowls used for dinner is 3 (adults) + 2 (children) = 5 bowls.

Since the pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls, we'll use the child bowls for this calculation. We know that 5 bowls (used for dinner) can be filled by 5/8 of the total capacity of the pot (since 5 is 5/8 of 8). 

Now, we need to find out how many child bowls can be filled with the remaining 3/8 of the pot. Since 8 child bowls can be filled with the full pot, 3/8 of the pot can fill (3/8) * 8 = 3 child bowls.

The children will have 3 child bowls left over from dinner. The leftover soup can fill 3 child bowls. Since there are 2 children, each child can have 3/2 = 1.5 bowls of soup for lunch. However, since you can't have half a bowl, we'll round down to 1 bowl per child."

"To find out how much material Jo needs, we need to calculate the total amount of material required for the small and large masks separately and then add them together.

For small masks, Jo needs 2 yards of material to make 4 masks. To find out how much material is needed for 20 small masks, we can set up a proportion:

2 yards / 4 masks = x yards / 20 masks

Cross-multiplying, we get:
2 * 20 = 4x
40 = 4x
x = 40 / 4
x = 10 yards

So, Jo needs 10 yards of material to make 20 small masks.

For large masks, Jo needs 2.25 yards of material to make 3 masks. To find out how much material is needed for 8 large masks, we can set up a proportion:

2.25 yards / 3 masks = x yards / 8 masks

Cross-multiplying, we get:
2.25 * 8 = 3x
18 = 3x
x = 18 / 3
x = 6 yards

So, Jo needs 6 yards of material to make 8 large masks.

Now, we add the material needed for small and large masks together:
10 yards (small) + 6 yards (large) = 16 yards

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Adam's age four years ago as 'x'. Since Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, we can write an equation:

Duncan's age eight years ago = 2 * Adam's age four years ago
Duncan's age eight years ago = 2x

We know that Duncan's current age is 60. To find his age eight years ago, we subtract 8 from his current age:

Duncan's age eight years ago = 60 - 8
Duncan's age eight years ago = 52

Now we can equate this to 2x:

52 = 2x

To find x, we divide both sides by 2:

x = 52 / 2
x = 26

This means Adam's age four years ago was 26. To find Adam's current age, we add 4 to x:

Adam's current age = 26 + 4
Adam's current age = 30

Finally, to find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8
Adam's age in 8 years = 38

"To find out how much Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday, we need to calculate the total number of packages he completes in that time and then multiply it by his hourly wage.

First, let's find out how many packages Colby completes in an hour. He completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, so we can write this as an expression: 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

Now, let's calculate the total number of packages Colby completes in an eight-hour workday: 40 packages/hour * 8 hours = 320 packages.

Since Colby gets paid $0.20 for every package he completes, we can multiply the total number of packages by his hourly wage to find his total earnings: 320 packages * $0.20/package = $64.

The total cost of the cake and the balloons is $11 + $3 = $14.

The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is $7 * 2 = $14.

The total cost of the cake, balloons, and ice cream is $14 + $14 = $28.

Since Julia and Nadine used all the money they had to buy these items, the total amount of money they had is $28.

Since they had the same amount of allowance, each of them received $28 / 2 = $14.

Josh eats twice as much as Abby, so Josh eats 2 * 2 = 4 slices a day.

Together, they eat 2 + 4 = 6 slices a day.

The loaf of bread has 24 slices. To find out how many days it will last, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices they eat per day: 24 / 6 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total number of shells Martha has collected by her 10th birthday, we need to calculate the number of months she has been collecting shells. Since Martha started collecting shells at 5 years old and we want to know the total by her 10th birthday, we need to consider the months from her 5th birthday to her 10th birthday.

There are 12 months in a year. From her 5th birthday to her 10th birthday, Martha would have been 5 years old for 1 year, 6 years old for 1 year, 7 years old for 1 year, 8 years old for 1 year, and 9 years old for 1 year. 

So, the total number of months is 5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months.

Since Martha collects one shell every month, the total number of shells she has collected by her 10th birthday is 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many cups of tea are in each row. Since Lana divides the 27 cups into 3 rows, we can divide 27 by 3 to get the number of cups in each row.

27 cups / 3 rows = 9 cups per row

Since Lana creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, the number of mint tea cups in each row will be half of the total cups in each row.

9 cups per row / 2 = 4.5 cups of mint tea per row

However, since we can't have a fraction of a cup, we can assume that Lana will make whole cups of tea. This means that she will make 4 cups of mint tea in each row and 5 cups of chamomile tea in each row, as the total number of cups in each row is 9.

4 cups of mint tea per row"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip. 

Let's break down the information given:

- The sloth takes 4 hours to make a round trip (down and back up) to collect berries.
- The sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

Since the sloth takes 4 hours for a round trip, in 8 hours, he can make 8 / 4 = 2 round trips.

If he makes 2 round trips, he will collect a total of 2 * x berries, where x is the number of berries he picks up per trip.

We want to find the minimum value of x such that 2 * x = 24.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 12.

So, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip is 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the amount of water in the tank. Since Anthony and his father fill the tank with half the amount of water in the pool, we can calculate this as follows:

10000 gallons (pool) / 2 = 5000 gallons (tank)

Next, we need to find out how much water is used from the tank over 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so we can multiply this rate by the number of days:

500 gallons/day * 6 days = 3000 gallons

Now, we subtract the amount of water used from the initial amount in the tank to find the remaining water:

5000 gallons (initial) - 3000 gallons (used) = 2000 gallons

The final answer is: 2000"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much money Colby has left and then determine how many movies he can see with the remaining money.

Colby's initial budget is $150. He has already spent money on:

- 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays: 5 * $10 = $50
- 8 movies on other days: 8 * $7 = $56
- 2 tubs of popcorn: 2 * $8 = $16
- 4 boxes of candy: 4 * $2 = $8

Total money spent: $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130

Colby has $150 - $130 = $20 left.

Each movie costs $10, and he wants to buy a popcorn ($8) and a box of candy ($2) for the last movie. So, the cost for the last movie will be $10 + $8 + $2 = $20.

Colby can see 1 more movie with the remaining money.

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the total calories of the pastries, we first need to calculate the calories of each type of mini pastry. 

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, so the calories of a mini cinnamon roll are 600 * 1/3 = 200 calories.

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, so the calories of a mini blueberry muffin are 450 * 1/3 = 150 calories.

Now, we can calculate the total calories of each type of pastry. There are 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories from cinnamon rolls are 200 * 200 = 40,000 calories. There are 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories from blueberry muffins are 300 * 150 = 45,000 calories.

The total calories of all the pastries are the sum of the calories from cinnamon rolls and blueberry muffins, which is 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories.

The final answer is: 85000"
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed and then divide it by the number of days.

On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday, she removed twice as many as Monday, so 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs.
On Wednesday, she removed twice as many as Tuesday, so 2 * 78 = 156 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 78 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 378

There are 5 days in total. 

Average number of Junebugs removed per day = Total Junebugs removed / Number of days
= 378 / 5

"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to calculate the total distance each vehicle traveled.

The bus travels at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours. To find the distance traveled by the bus, we multiply the speed by the time: 60 miles/hour * 5 hours = 300 miles.

The car travels at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours. To find the distance traveled by the car, we multiply the speed by the time: 30 miles/hour * 8 hours = 240 miles.

Now, we need to find the difference in distance between the bus and the car. To do this, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus: 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles.

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car.

"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to subtract the total number of toys Sophie had before buying the bouncy balls from the total number of toys she has now.

The total number of toys before buying the bouncy balls is the sum of the blocks, stuffed animals, and stacking rings: 31 + 8 + 9 = 48.

Now, we subtract this total from the current number of toys: 62 - 48 = 14.

So, there are 14 bouncy balls in the tube.

The final answer is: 14"
"Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as p, and John's age as j. We are given the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old. This can be written as P + p + j = 100.
2. Paul is 10 years older than John, which can be written as p = j + 10.
3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age, which can be written as P = p + j.

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to get P = (j + 10) + j, which simplifies to P = 2j + 10.

Now, we can substitute the expression for P into the first equation: (2j + 10) + p + j = 100.

We can substitute the second equation into this expression to get (2j + 10) + (j + 10) + j = 100.

This simplifies to 4j + 20 = 100.

Subtracting 20 from both sides gives us 4j = 80.

Dividing both sides by 4 gives us j = 20.

Now that we know John's age, we can find Paul's age by substituting j into the second equation: p = j + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30.

Finally, we can find Peter's age by substituting p into the third equation: P = p + j = 30 + 20 = 50.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total number of balloons, we need to calculate the initial number of balloons and then add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, Maria had 1 water balloon, and each of her 4 friends had 2 water balloons. So, the total number of balloons initially is:
1 (Maria's balloon) + (4 friends * 2 balloons per friend) = 1 + 8 = 9 balloons

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional balloons is:
5 people * 3 balloons per person = 15 balloons

Now, we add the initial number of balloons to the additional balloons:
9 (initial balloons) + 15 (additional balloons) = 24 balloons

The final answer is: 24"
"To find out how many tables they need, we first need to calculate the total number of boxes of stuff they have. 

10 people donate 5 boxes each, so they have 10 * 5 = 50 boxes from donations. 
They already have 10 boxes, so the total number of boxes is 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

Since they can fit 2 boxes per table, they will need 60 / 2 = 30 tables.

However, they already own 15 tables. To find out how many more tables they need, we subtract the number of tables they have from the total number of tables needed: 30 - 15 = 15.

Therefore, they need 15 new tables.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the average total distance spat, we need to calculate the total distance spat by each person and then divide it by the total number of seeds spat.

Zoey spits 40 seeds, each 10 feet, so the total distance spat by Zoey is 40 * 10 = 400 feet.

Sydney spits 35 seeds, each 12 feet, so the total distance spat by Sydney is 35 * 12 = 420 feet.

The total distance spat by both Zoey and Sydney is 400 + 420 = 820 feet.

The total number of seeds spat is 40 + 35 = 75.

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the total distance spat by the total number of seeds spat: 820 / 75 = 10.93 (rounded to two decimal places).

The final answer is: 10.93"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine in a month and then find the difference in revenue.

First, let's calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine in a month:

"To find out how much Cameron would save, we first need to calculate the cost of his stay with the option of adding 70 pesos for every hour after the 12-hour mark, and then compare it to the cost of paying for a 24-hour stay.

Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours. Since the first 12 hours are already included in the initial charge, he will have to pay for the additional 5 hours.

The cost for the additional 5 hours is 5 * 70 = 350 pesos.

The total cost for Cameron's stay would be 1000 (initial 12-hour charge) + 350 (additional 5 hours) = 1350 pesos.

Now, let's compare this to the cost of paying for a 24-hour stay, which is 1600 pesos.

The amount Cameron would save is 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

The final numerical answer is: 250"
"To find the total amount of hay needed, we first need to determine the amount each sheep needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds, and each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, we can calculate the amount each sheep needs as follows:

Twice the amount each goat needs: 2 * 5 = 10 pounds
3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs: 10 - 3 = 7 pounds

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep separately:

For the goats: 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds
For the sheep: 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds

To find the total amount of hay needed, we add the amount needed for the goats and the sheep:

Total hay needed = 75 pounds (goats) + 84 pounds (sheep) = 159 pounds

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate John's total earnings, subtract his expenses, and then determine how much money he has left to spend on pens and pencils.

First, let's calculate John's total earnings: 
50 dollars/hour * 6 hours = 300 dollars

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the pencils: 
5 pencils * 10 dollars/pencil = 50 dollars

Now, let's subtract John's gas expenses and the cost of the pencils from his total earnings: 
300 dollars - 50 dollars - 50 dollars = 200 dollars

John wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so we subtract that from his remaining money:

"To find the total amount Patty charged, we need to calculate the labor cost and add it to the cost of parts. 

First, let's calculate the labor cost. The job took 2.25 hours, and the labor rate is $35 per hour. Since the labor is charged per hour or part thereof, we need to round up to the nearest hour. However, in this case, we can simply multiply 2.25 hours by the labor rate.

Labor cost = 2.25 hours * $35/hour = $78.75

Next, we add the cost of parts, which is $60.

Total cost = Labor cost + Cost of parts
Total cost = $78.75 + $60
Total cost = $138.75

"To find out how much James spent on the CDs, we first need to calculate the original price of the CDs and then subtract the discount. 

The original price of 10 CDs is 10 * $15 = $150. 

Since James gets a 40% discount, we need to find 40% of $150. 
40% of $150 = 0.4 * $150 = $60.

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price: $150 - $60 = $90.

James spent $90 on the CDs.

Next, we need to find out how much he got back from selling 5 CDs. 
He sold them for $40 each, so 5 * $40 = $200.

Now, we subtract the amount he got back from the amount he spent: $90 - $200 = -$110.

However, since James can't be out by a negative amount, this means he actually lost money. He spent more than he got back.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's calculate the time James took to swim 60% of the distance. The total distance is 20 miles, and 60% of that is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles. 

Since James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time taken to swim 12 miles is 12 / 2 = 6 hours.

After swimming, James rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

Now, let's calculate the remaining distance. The total distance is 20 miles, and James has already swum 12 miles, so the remaining distance is 20 - 12 = 8 miles.

James then swims the remaining distance at half his original speed, which is 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour. The time taken to swim 8 miles at this speed is 8 / 1 = 8 hours.

The total time taken is the sum of the swimming time, resting time, and the time taken to swim the remaining distance: 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.

"To find out how many points Azibo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Bahati and Dinar. 

Let's denote the points scored by Dinar as 'x'. Since Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, Bahati's points can be represented as 'x + 10'. 

We know that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so Azibo's points can be represented as '(x + 10) - 20' or 'x - 10'.

The total points scored by the team is 45, which is the sum of the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar. We can write this as an equation:

x + (x + 10) + (x - 10) = 45

Combine like terms:

3x = 45

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 15

Now that we know Dinar scored 15 points, we can find Azibo's points by subtracting 10 from Bahati's points. However, we first need to find Bahati's points. Since Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, and we know Dinar scored 15 points, we can represent Bahati's points as '15 + 20' or '35'. 

Azibo's points can be found by subtracting 20 from Bahati's points: 35 - 20 = 15.

However, we know that Azibo's points can also be represented as 'x - 10'. Since we found that x = 15, we can confirm that Azibo's points are indeed 15 - 10 = 5.

"To find the total number of reports Vince stapled, we need to calculate the total time he spent stapling reports and then multiply it by the number of reports he staples per minute.

First, let's find the total time Vince spent stapling reports. He stapled from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is a total of 15 hours.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so the total minutes in 15 hours is 15 * 60 = 900 minutes.

Now, we know Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find the number of reports he staples per minute, we divide 30 by 15, which is 2 reports per minute.

Now, we multiply the total minutes by the number of reports per minute: 900 minutes * 2 reports/minute = 1800 reports.

"To find out how many minutes Kim slept on her bed, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m. This is a total of 8 hours, which is 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 5:55 a.m. instead of 6 a.m. We need to subtract the time from 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m. from the total sleep time.

10 p.m. to 12 a.m. is 2 hours, which is 2 * 60 = 120 minutes.
12 a.m. to 5:55 a.m. is 5 hours and 55 minutes, which is (5 * 60) + 55 = 355 minutes.
So, the total time she was supposed to sleep is 120 + 355 = 475 minutes.

Now, we need to subtract the time she was sleepwalking, which is from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. This is 23 minutes.

So, the total time she slept on her bed is 475 - 23 = 452 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many measuring spoons Jonathan has initially. Since he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, and he has two dozen cups, we can calculate the number of measuring spoons.

Two dozen cups is equal to 2 x 12 = 24 cups.

Since Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, we can multiply the number of cups by 2/3 to find the number of measuring spoons:

24 cups * (2/3) = 16 measuring spoons

Now, Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons. To find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we subtract the number of spoons he gave away from the initial number of spoons:

16 measuring spoons - 6 measuring spoons = 10 measuring spoons

Jonathan still has 24 measuring cups, and he has 10 measuring spoons remaining.

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is 24 + 10 = 34."
"To find the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we first need to calculate the number of occupied beds and then subtract that from the total capacity.

The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 of them are occupied. 

1/5 of 1000 is 100. So, the number of occupied beds is 100.

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, we need to calculate the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks is 14 days.

The total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks is 50 * 14 = 700.

Now, we add the initial number of occupied beds (100) to the number of patients admitted in 2 weeks (700) to get the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks.

Total occupied beds = 100 + 700 = 800

Now, we subtract the total number of occupied beds from the total capacity to get the number of unoccupied beds.

Total unoccupied beds = 1000 - 800 = 200

Now that we know Shawna's age, we can find her father's age. Her father is five times as old as Shawna.

Father's age = 5 * Shawna's age
Father's age = 5 * 9
Father's age = 45

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number Courtney reported and subtract it from the reported number.

Let's denote the reported number as R = 48.

20% of R is 0.20 * R = 0.20 * 48 = 9.6

Now, subtract 9.6 from the reported number to find the actual number of people who attended the concert:

Actual number = R - 9.6 = 48 - 9.6 = 38.4

Since we can't have a fraction of a person, we'll round down to the nearest whole number.

The final answer is: 38"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. We know that Jason carried 2 balls, and Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey. This means Jeffrey carried half the number of balls Jason carried, which is 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried 2 balls, Jordan carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls carried by each of them: 1 (Jeffrey) + 2 (Jason) + 4 (Jordan) = 7 balls.

However, this is the number of balls the boys carried, not the total number of balls the coach brought to practice. Since the boys carried all the balls in one trip, the total number of balls the coach brought to practice is equal to the number of balls the boys carried.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day and then determine how many holes were dug on the fourth day.

The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day, 13 holes on the second day, and 8 holes on the third day. However, they filled in 2 holes on the third day. So, the total number of holes at the end of the third day is:

10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29

The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is:

4 * 10 = 40

Since there were 29 holes at the end of the third day, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:

40 - 29 = 11

So, the pirates dug 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.

The final answer is: 11"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and the third person got 15 more than each of them. 

Let's denote the number of corn chips the third person got as x. Since the third person got 15 more than Amora and Lainey, we can write an equation:

x = 70 + 15
x = 85

So, the third person got 85 corn chips. 

Now, we know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and the third person got 85 corn chips. To find the total number of corn chips, we add the number of corn chips each person got:

Total corn chips = 70 + 70 + 85
Total corn chips = 225

The final answer is: 225"
"To find the cost of travel, we need to calculate 50% more than the cost of supplies. 

First, let's find 50% of the cost of supplies. 50% of $400 is 0.5 * 400 = $200.

Now, we add this to the cost of supplies to find the total cost of travel. $400 (supplies) + $200 (50% of supplies) = $600.

The cost of travel is $600.

The final answer is: $600"
"Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, Stan as S, and Alex as X. We are given the following information:

1. X = S + 5
2. S = 4A - 13
3. A + S + X = 339

We can substitute the first equation into the third equation to get:
A + S + (S + 5) = 339
Combine like terms:
2S + A + 5 = 339

Now, substitute the second equation into the above equation:
2(4A - 13) + A + 5 = 339
Expand the equation:
8A - 26 + A + 5 = 339
Combine like terms:
9A - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:
9A = 360

Divide both sides by 9:
A = 40

Now that we know A, we can find S:
S = 4A - 13
S = 4(40) - 13
S = 160 - 13
S = 147

The final answer is: 147"
"To find the total number of episodes, we need to determine how many episodes there are in total. Since there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, and each episode is 20 minutes long, we can set up an equation.

Let's denote the number of episodes as 'e'. Since there are half as many episodes as minutes per episode, we can write the equation as e = 20 / 2. 

Solving for 'e', we get e = 10. 

Now that we know there are 10 episodes, we can find the total time John will spend watching the show by multiplying the number of episodes by the length of each episode: 10 * 20 = 200 minutes.

The final answer is: 200"
"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in the southerly direction and then add it to the distance traveled in the northerly direction.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled in the southerly direction for the first 10 hours:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 10 hours
Distance = 300 miles

Then, the bird flies towards the north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 36 miles

Since the bird is flying north, this distance is subtracted from the total distance traveled in the southerly direction:
Total southerly distance = 300 miles - 36 miles
Total southerly distance = 264 miles

Finally, the bird flies towards the south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours
Distance = 110 miles

Since the bird is flying south, this distance is added to the total southerly distance:
Total distance = 264 miles + 110 miles
Total distance = 374 miles

The final answer is: 374"
"To find the total number of brownies Greta had left over, we need to calculate the total number of brownies she received and subtract the number of brownies eaten.

Greta made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies for herself, which is 12 brownies. 

At her office, she received 1/2 a dozen brownies, which is 6 brownies. 

Her friends brought 4 dozen brownies, which is 48 brownies.

So, the total number of brownies Greta received is 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies.

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies.

To find the number of brownies left over, we subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies received: 66 - 18 = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the total age of all three family members, we need to calculate the age of Nani's brother and sister first.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 2 * 8 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means her age is 75% of Nani's age. To find 75% of Nani's age, we multiply his age by 0.75: 8 * 0.75 = 6 years.

Now, we add up the ages of all three family members: Nani's age (8 years) + his brother's age (16 years) + his sister's age (6 years) = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time it takes for each type of stringing and then add them together.

For synthetic gut, it takes 15 minutes per racquet, and there are 3 racquets. So, the total time for synthetic gut is 3 * 15 = 45 minutes.

For polyester string, it takes 22 minutes per racquet, and there are 5 racquets. So, the total time for polyester string is 5 * 22 = 110 minutes.

For hybrid sets, it takes 18 minutes per racquet, and there are 4 racquets. So, the total time for hybrid sets is 4 * 18 = 72 minutes.

Now, we add the total time for each type of stringing together: 45 + 110 + 72 = 227 minutes.

The final answer is: 227"
"To find the total cost of the phones, we need to calculate the cost of the first two phones and the cost of the remaining phones.

The first two phones cost the full price of $600 each, so the total cost for the first two phones is 2 * $600 = $1200.

The remaining phones are 2 (for the kids and the wife), and each of these phones is half price, which is $600 / 2 = $300.

The total cost of the remaining phones is 2 * $300 = $600.

The total cost of all the phones is the sum of the cost of the first two phones and the cost of the remaining phones: $1200 + $600 = $1800.

The final answer is: $1800"
"To find the total number of players in both teams, we first need to determine the number of players on Zeke's team. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, and Carlton's team has 13 players, we can calculate the number of players on Zeke's team by adding 7 to 13.

Zeke's team = Carlton's team + 7
Zeke's team = 13 + 7
Zeke's team = 20

Now that we know the number of players on both teams, we can find the total number of players by adding the number of players on Zeke's team and Carlton's team.

Total players = Zeke's team + Carlton's team
Total players = 20 + 13
Total players = 33

The final answer is: 33"
"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2l + 2w, where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the length (l) is 15 feet and the width (w) is 10 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

P = 2(15) + 2(10)
P = 30 + 20
P = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

50 feet * 2 slats/foot = 100 slats

Therefore, Robert will need 100 wooden slats for his fence.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we first need to determine how many boxes she had left after giving some to her mom and sister. 

Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges. She gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes each, so she gave away a total of 2 + 2 = 4 boxes. 

Now, we subtract the boxes she gave away from the total number of boxes she bought: 12 - 4 = 8 boxes.

Each box contains 20 oranges, so the total number of oranges in 8 boxes is 8 * 20 = 160 oranges.

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges, which is 1/4 * 160 = 40 oranges. 

To find out how many oranges she sold, we subtract the number of oranges she kept from the total number of oranges: 160 - 40 = 120 oranges.

The final answer is: 120"
"To solve this problem, we need to know the number of states in the USA and India. The USA has 50 states. 

First, let's find half the number of states in the USA: 50 / 2 = 25.

Since India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, we add 4 to 25: 25 + 4 = 29.

Now, we know India has 29 states. To find the total number of states in both countries together, we add the number of states in the USA and India: 50 + 29 = 79.

The final numerical answer is: 79"
"To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books. 

The total cost of the books is the sum of the cost of the dictionary, the dinosaur book, and the children's cookbook. 

Total cost = $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39

Since Tyler has already saved $14 from his allowance, we need to subtract this from the total cost to find out how much more he needs to earn.

Amount needed to earn = Total cost - Amount saved = $39 - $14 = $25

Now, we can find out how many hours Tyler needs to work by dividing the amount he needs to earn by his hourly wage.

Hours needed to work = Amount needed to earn / Hourly wage = $25 / $5 = 5 hours

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many cherries Richard and Jerry have. 

Since Robert has 30 cherries and has 10 more than Richard, we can find out how many cherries Richard has by subtracting 10 from Robert's total. 

Richard's cherries = Robert's cherries - 10
Richard's cherries = 30 - 10
Richard's cherries = 20

Now, we know that the total number of cherries is 60. We can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting the total number of cherries that Robert and Richard have from the total.

Total cherries = Robert's cherries + Richard's cherries + Jerry's cherries
60 = 30 + 20 + Jerry's cherries
Jerry's cherries = 60 - 50
Jerry's cherries = 10

Now that we know how many cherries each person has, we can find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry.

Robert's cherries - Jerry's cherries = 30 - 10
Robert's cherries - Jerry's cherries = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many boxes of gingerbread and apple pie Sunny sold on both Saturday and Sunday, and then calculate the total earnings.

Let's denote the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday as G and the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday as A.

We know that on Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread. So, G = 10.

We also know that on Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. Let's denote the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday as B. Then, A = B - 4.

On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday. So, the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday is G + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15.

We also know that on Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie. So, B = 15.

Now, we can find the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday: A = B - 4 = 15 - 4 = 11.

Now that we know the number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie sold on both days, we can calculate the total earnings.

The total number of boxes of gingerbread sold is G + (G + 5) = 10 + 15 = 25.
The total number of boxes of apple pie sold is A + B = 11 + 15 = 26.

The total earnings from gingerbread is 25 * $6 = $150.
The total earnings from apple pie is 26 * $15 = $390.

The total earnings for two days is $150 + $390 = $540.

The final answer is: $540"
"To determine the total amount of sunscreen needed, we need to calculate the total number of ounces Pamela will use over the 8 days. 

Since she reapplies sunscreen every hour and will be outside 4 hours a day, she will reapply sunscreen 4 times a day. 

Over 8 days, she will reapply sunscreen 4 times/day * 8 days = 32 times.

Since each application is 1 ounce, she will need 32 ounces of sunscreen.

Each bottle contains 8 ounces, so to find out how many bottles she needs, we divide the total ounces needed by the ounces per bottle: 32 ounces / 8 ounces per bottle = 4 bottles.

Therefore, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the price of the red car, we need to calculate 40% of the price of the blue car and subtract it from the price of the blue car.

First, let's find 40% of the price of the blue car. 
40% of $100 = 0.4 * $100 = $40

Now, subtract $40 from the price of the blue car to find the price of the red car.
Price of the red car = Price of the blue car - 40% of the price of the blue car
Price of the red car = $100 - $40
Price of the red car = $60

Since we know the price of the red car, we can find the price of the blue car, which is already given as $100.

The final answer is $60."
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Let's denote Emil's current age as E, his dad's age as D, and his brother's age as B. 

We know that Emil is 19 years old now, so E = 19.

When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad, so 24 = 0.5D. 

We can solve for D by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2, which gives us D = 48.

We also know that when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother, so 24 = 2B.

We can solve for B by dividing both sides of the equation by 2, which gives us B = 12.

Now that we have the ages of Emil's dad and brother, we can find the sum of their ages. 

D + B = 48 + 12 = 60.

Adrianne's mother gave her 20 beads.
Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the beads together: 20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the total amount of crawfish Joe caught, we need to calculate the amount he caught each day and add them together.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.

On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the total amount of crawfish Joe caught: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can find the total number of servings by dividing the total amount of crawfish by the serving size: 21 / 3 = 7.

"To find the number of students leaving early, we first need to find the number of football players and then add the number of cheerleaders or band members.

First, let's find the number of football players. 20% of 30 students are football players. 

20% of 30 = 0.20 * 30 = 6

So, there are 6 football players.

Now, let's find the number of remaining students. Since 6 students are football players, the remaining students are 30 - 6 = 24.

Out of the remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band.

25% of 24 = 0.25 * 24 = 6

So, there are 6 cheerleaders or band members.

Now, let's add the number of football players and cheerleaders or band members to find the total number of students leaving early.

6 (football players) + 6 (cheerleaders or band members) = 12

"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we first need to determine the size of Charlie's boots. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie's boots are size five, we can calculate Charlie's boot size as follows:

Charlie's boot size = 5 * Sophie's boot size
Charlie's boot size = 5 * 5
Charlie's boot size = 25

Now, we can find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie by adding their sizes and dividing by 2:

Average size = (Sophie's size + Charlie's size) / 2
Average size = (5 + 25) / 2
Average size = 30 / 2
Average size = 15

"To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to calculate the total space available for plants. 

First, we need to convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches since the width of the plants is given in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so the length of the flower bed in inches is 111 * 12 = 1332 inches.

Next, we need to subtract the space between the plants. Since there are 17 plants, there will be 16 spaces between them. The total space between the plants is 16 * 1.5 = 24 feet, which is 24 * 12 = 288 inches.

Now, we subtract the total space between the plants from the total length of the flower bed to get the total space available for the plants: 1332 - 288 = 1044 inches.

Since each plant is 12 inches wide, we can divide the total space available for the plants by the width of each plant to find out how many plants can fit: 1044 / 12 = 87.

However, Pat already owns 17 flowers, so we need to subtract these from the total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed: 87 - 17 = 70.

Now, we can find out how much money Pat will spend at the store by multiplying the number of plants she needs to buy by the cost of each plant: 70 * 6 = 420.

First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations. 

4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds
Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations = 12 + 15 = 27 pounds

Now, let's subtract the amount of soil used from the total amount of soil they bought. 

30 pounds (total soil) - 27 pounds (used soil) = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, we can plant 3 roses with the remaining soil.

"To find out how many shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we first need to calculate how much she saves each month. 

Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month and sets 25% of her paycheck aside for shoes. To find 25% of $2,000.00, we multiply $2,000.00 by 0.25.

$2,000.00 * 0.25 = $500.00

So, Jessica saves $500.00 each month for shoes.

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the monthly savings by 12 to find the yearly savings.

$500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00

Now, we need to find out how many pairs of shoes Jessica can buy with her yearly savings. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00.

$6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6

Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two separate tasks: peeling and cooking. 

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp. Emily can peel 6 shrimp a minute, so to find the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp, we divide 90 by 6. 

90 / 6 = 15 minutes to peel the shrimp.

Next, we need to calculate the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp. Emily can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, so to find the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp, we divide 90 by 30 and then multiply by 10.

90 / 30 = 3, then 3 * 10 = 30 minutes to cook the shrimp.

However, since peeling and cooking are done sequentially, we need to add the time it takes for both tasks. 

15 minutes (peeling) + 30 minutes (cooking) = 45 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

The final answer is: 45"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net change in temperature after the air conditioner has been running and turned off.

First, let's calculate the temperature change when the air conditioner is running on low for 3 hours:

Temperature change on low = -2 degrees/hour * 3 hours = -6 degrees

Then, let's calculate the temperature change when the air conditioner is running on high for 4 hours:

Temperature change on high = -3 degrees/hour * 4 hours = -12 degrees

The total temperature change when the air conditioner is running is the sum of the temperature changes on low and high:

Total temperature change while running = -6 degrees - 12 degrees = -18 degrees

Now, let's calculate the temperature change when the air conditioner is turned off for 2 hours:

Temperature change when off = 2 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 4 degrees

The net temperature change is the sum of the total temperature change while running and the temperature change when the air conditioner is turned off:

Net temperature change = -18 degrees + 4 degrees = -14 degrees

Since the air conditioner cools the room, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how old Bill's dad was when Bill saw the comet for the second time. 

Since Bill saw the comet when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet, let's denote the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet as 'x'. Then, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time would be 3x.

We know that the time between the two sightings is 75 years. So, the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet plus 75 years is equal to Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time. 

We can write this as an equation: x + 75 = 3x.

Now, let's solve for x. Subtracting x from both sides of the equation, we get 75 = 2x. 

Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 37.5. 

This is the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet. 

Now, we need to find out how old Bill was when his dad saw the comet. We know that Bill's dad was 30 years old when he saw the comet. 

Since the time between the two sightings is 75 years, we can find Bill's age when his dad saw the comet by subtracting 75 from Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time. 

However, we don't know Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time. We know that Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time is 3x, and x is 37.5. 

So, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time is 3 * 37.5 = 112.5.

Now, we can find Bill's age when his dad saw the comet by subtracting 75 from 112.5. 

Bill's age when his dad saw the comet = 112.5 - 75 = 37.5.

However, this is the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet. We need to find Bill's age when his dad saw the comet. Since Bill's dad was 30 years old when he saw the comet, we can find Bill's age by subtracting 30 from 37.5.

Bill's age when his dad saw the comet = 37.5 - 30 = 7.5.

However, this is the age of Bill when his dad saw the comet. We need to find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time. Since the time between the two sightings is 75 years, we can find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time by adding 75 to 7.5.

Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time = 7.5 + 75 = 82.5.

The final answer is: 82.5"
"To find the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks for each category and then add them together.

1. Checks for the electric bill: Since Buford writes a check once per month, and there are 12 months in a year, he writes 12 checks for the electric bill per year.
2. Checks for the gas bill: Similarly, Buford writes a check once per month for the gas bill, so he also writes 12 checks for the gas bill per year.
3. Checks to the church: Buford writes a check twice per month to the church, so in a year, he writes 2 * 12 = 24 checks to the church.
4. Checks to the pest and lawn service: Buford writes a check quarterly, which means 4 times a year. So, he writes 4 checks to the pest and lawn service per year.

Now, let's add up the total number of checks:

12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn service) = 52

The final answer is: 52"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the total number of flights made by the first plane as 'x'. Since the second plane makes half the number of trips as the first plane, it makes x/2 trips.

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, which is (3/4)x. The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of flights to France is (1/4)x.

We are given that the second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. So, we can set up the equation:

x/2 = 44

To find the total number of flights made by the first plane, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 88

Now that we know the total number of flights made by the first plane, we can find the number of flights to France:

Flights to France = (1/4)x
= (1/4)(88)
= 22

The final answer is: 22"
"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the individual howling times and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. 
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, let's add the individual howling times together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents and subtract that from the cost of the trousers.

Adam's mother gave him $6. 
His father gave him twice as much as his mother, so his father gave him 2 * $6 = $12.

The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Since the trousers cost $30, we subtract the amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers to find out how much he had to contribute from his savings: $30 - $18 = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the average age of the group. We know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. Let's denote the average age as 'x'. 

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age, Helene's age is 2x. 

We also know that the total age of the children is 20. We can set up an equation to represent this:

Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age + Wilfred's age = Total age
3 + 4 + 2x + Wilfred's age = 20

We can simplify the equation by combining the constants:
7 + 2x + Wilfred's age = 20

Now, we need to find the value of 'x'. We know that the average age is the total age divided by the number of children. There are 4 children, so the average age is 20 / 4 = 5.

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age, Helene's age is 2 * 5 = 10.

Now we can substitute Helene's age into the equation:
7 + 2x + Wilfred's age = 20
7 + 2(5) + Wilfred's age = 20
7 + 10 + Wilfred's age = 20
17 + Wilfred's age = 20

Now, we can solve for Wilfred's age:
Wilfred's age = 20 - 17
Wilfred's age = 3

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how much Walter's lawyer will contribute, we need to calculate the total amount collected from Walter's neighbors and the online fund, and then multiply it by 3.

Walter collects $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. 

Total amount collected so far = $500 + $1500 = $2000

Walter's friend donates $200, but this is not included in the amount that the lawyer will base his donation on. The lawyer will donate three times the amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund, which is $2000.

So, the lawyer will donate 3 * $2000 = $6000.

The final answer is: $6000"
"To find the total number of cookies, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies brought by the guests. Since each guest brought 15 cookies and there were 100 guests, the total number of cookies is 100 * 15 = 1500.

The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door. So, the number of cookies given to the church is 1/2 * 1500 = 750.

Since each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, we can find the number of people in the church by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received. 

Number of people in the church = Total cookies given to the church / Cookies per person
= 750 / 15
= 50

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, let's assume the total number of slices the watermelon is divided into is 'x'. Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices is 6. 

Let's denote the number of slices each kid gets as 'k'. Since each adult gets twice as many slices as each kid, the number of slices each adult gets is '2k'. 

We know that the total number of slices is 6, so we can write the equation: 2k + 2k + 4k = 6. Combining like terms, we get 8k = 6. 

To find the value of 'k', we divide both sides of the equation by 8, which gives us k = 6/8 = 0.75. 

Since each adult gets 2k slices, the number of slices each adult gets is 2 * 0.75 = 1.5. 

The total number of slices is 6, so the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets is (1.5/6) * 100 = 25%."
"To determine how many hours Doctor Jones has left to update his records, we first need to calculate the total time spent on rounds and appointments.

Time spent on rounds: 
- Number of inpatients: 9
- Time per inpatient: 20 minutes
- Total time spent on rounds: 9 * 20 = 180 minutes

Time spent on appointments: 
- Number of appointments: 10
- Time per appointment: 30 minutes
- Total time spent on appointments: 10 * 30 = 300 minutes

Total time spent on rounds and appointments: 180 + 300 = 480 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we need to convert the total time spent to hours:
- Total time spent in hours: 480 / 60 = 8 hours

Doctor Jones spends 9 hours at the clinic, so we subtract the time spent on rounds and appointments from his total time:
- Time left to update records: 9 - 8 = 1 hour

The final numerical answer is: 1"
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake. 

First, let's add the time it takes to make the cake batter (20 minutes) and bake the cake (30 minutes): 20 + 30 = 50 minutes.

Next, we add the time it takes to cool the cake (2 hours or 120 minutes) and the time it takes to frost the cake (10 minutes): 120 + 10 = 130 minutes. 

Now, we add the time it takes to make the cake batter and bake the cake to the time it takes to cool and frost the cake: 50 + 130 = 180 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 180 minutes to hours by dividing by 60: 180 / 60 = 3 hours.

Now, we need to add the 3 hours to the time at which Jordan wants to serve the cake, which is 5:00 pm. 

5:00 pm + 3 hours = 8:00 pm.

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 8:00 pm - 180 minutes = 5:20 pm.

The final answer is 5:20."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we need to first determine the total number of boxes sold by both Lisa and Peter. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so together they sold 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

Since they sold 64 chocolate bars together and they sold 8 boxes, we can divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes to find out how many chocolate bars are in a box.

64 / 8 = 8

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

The final answer is: 8"
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to first calculate the daily earnings and then multiply it by the number of days in a month.

The cost to rent the studio per session is $25, and there are 3 sessions per week. The cost per student per session is $1.50. 

First, let's calculate the weekly earnings from the students:
10 students * $1.50 per student = $15 per session
Since there are 3 sessions per week, the weekly earnings from students are:
$15 per session * 3 sessions = $45 per week

The weekly cost to rent the studio is:
$25 per session * 3 sessions = $75 per week

The weekly profit is the difference between the weekly earnings from students and the weekly cost to rent the studio:
$45 per week - $75 per week = -$30 per week

However, this is a loss. To find the weekly earnings, we need to add the weekly cost to the weekly profit:
$75 per week (cost) - $30 per week (profit) = $45 per week (loss) 
But since we are calculating the weekly earnings, we should add the weekly cost to the weekly profit:

"To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box for both Peter and Martha, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes.

For Peter: 64 chocolate bars / 4 boxes = 16 chocolate bars per box
For Martha: 56 chocolate bars / 7 boxes = 8 chocolate bars per box

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter and Martha. 

16 (Peter's chocolate bars per box) - 8 (Martha's chocolate bars per box) = 8

"To find the number of female porcupines, we multiply the total population by 3/5. 

Number of female porcupines = 50 * (3/5) = 30

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, the total number of babies born in a month is 30 * 4 = 120.

In a year, there are 12 months, so the total number of babies born in a year is 120 * 12 = 1440.

The total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be the sum of the initial population and the number of babies born in a year.

Total porcupines after a year = 50 + 1440 = 1490

The final answer is: 1490"
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth of the pool. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (such as a swimming pool) is V = l * w * h, where l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height (or depth).

Given the dimensions of the pool: 
- Length (l) = 25 feet
- Width (w) = 14 feet
- Depth (h) = 4 feet

We can calculate the volume as follows:
V = l * w * h
V = 25 * 14 * 4
V = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company instructed them to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the number of gallons of water needed, we do this next:
Gallons = V * 5.9
Gallons = 1400 * 5.9
Gallons = 8260 gallons

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon, so we multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon:
Cost = Gallons * $0.10
Cost = 8260 * $0.10
Cost = $826

The final answer is: $826"
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to determine the number of blue and yellow sticks first. 

We know there are 9 red sticks and 5 more blue sticks than red. So, the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14.

The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is 14 - 3 = 11.

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks: 9 (red) + 14 (blue) + 11 (yellow) = 34.

Shandy's distance = speed * time = 45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles

To find the difference in distance, we subtract Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance:

Difference = Shandy's distance - Matteo's distance = 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

The final answer is: 230"
"To find the number of female students, we first need to determine the number of students over 16 and under 16, and then find the number of female students in each group.

Half of the students are over 16 years old: 3000 / 2 = 1500 students.
One-fourth of the students over 16 are male: 1500 / 4 = 375 male students over 16. 
So, the number of female students over 16 is 1500 - 375 = 1125.

The remaining half of the students are under 16 years old: 3000 / 2 = 1500 students.
One-half of the students under 16 are male: 1500 / 2 = 750 male students under 16.
So, the number of female students under 16 is 1500 - 750 = 750.

Now, we add the number of female students over 16 and under 16 to find the total number of female students: 1125 + 750 = 1875.

The final answer is: 1875"
"To find out how many laps each person can run, we need to calculate their individual lap counts.

Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.

Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.

Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.

Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract Quinn's lap count from Bethany's lap count: 10 - 5 = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank and subtract it from the tank's capacity.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped into the tank is 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 12000 gallons. 

The remaining amount of water needed to fill the tank is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is: 6000"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as 'x'. 

In the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining will be 100% - (9% * 5) = 100% - 45% = 55%.

In the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining will be 55% - (7% * 3) = 55% - 21% = 34%.

However, we are given that the final charge remaining is 28%. This means that the 34% charge remaining after 8 hours is reduced to 28% in the last hour. 

Let's denote the charge lost in the last hour as 'y'. So, we can set up the equation: 34% - y = 28%.

To find 'y', we can solve the equation: y = 34% - 28% = 6%.

Now, we know that the power bank loses 7% of its capacity in the last hour. So, the charge lost in the last hour is 6% of the total capacity. 

Let's set up an equation to find the initial charge 'x': 7% of x = 6%. 

To solve for 'x', we can convert the percentages to decimals and set up the equation: 0.07x = 0.06.

Now, we can solve for 'x': x = 0.06 / 0.07 = 0.8571 (approximately).

To convert the decimal to a percentage, we can multiply by 100: x = 85.71%.

The charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 85.71%.

The final answer is: 85.71"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate Janet's total weekly earnings and then determine how many weeks she needs to work to save 20% of the car's cost.

First, let's calculate Janet's total weekly earnings. She makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, so her total hourly earnings are $10 + $15 = $25 per hour.

Since she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are $25/hour * 40 hours/week = $1000/week.

Next, we need to calculate 20% of the car's cost. 20% of $10,000 is 0.20 * $10,000 = $2000.

Now, we can determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save $2000. We can do this by dividing the amount she needs to save ($2000) by her weekly earnings ($1000). 

$2000 / $1000 = 2

So, Janet needs to work 2 weeks to save the down payment for the car.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of money he has spent so far. 

3 peaches at $0.5 each will be 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
4 pears at $0.5 each will be 4 * $0.5 = $2
2 kiwis at $1 each will be 2 * $1 = $2
5 apples at $0.75 each will be 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Adding these amounts together, Jamaar has spent $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9 so far.

Since Jamaar has $10, he has $10 - $9 = $1 left.

Plums cost $0.25 each, so we can divide the remaining amount by the cost of a plum to find out how many plums he can buy: $1 / $0.25 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many pieces of sweets each of her friends received, we first need to determine the total number of packs Anne gave away. Since she kept 2 packs for herself, she gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs.

Next, we need to find out how many packs each friend received. Since she gave the packs to 10 friends equally, we divide the total number of packs given away (13) by the number of friends (10). 

13 packs / 10 friends = 1.3 packs per friend. However, since each pack contains 60 pieces, we need to multiply the number of packs each friend received by the number of pieces in each pack.

1.3 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 78 pieces per friend.

The final answer is: 78"
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the increase in price each year and add it to the original price.

Year 1: 
Original price = $120
Increase in price = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Original price = $126
Increase in price = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Original price = $132.30
Increase in price = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many pictures Olivia put into each album. Since she put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide the total number of pictures by 8.

Total pictures = 72
Pictures per album = Total pictures / 8
Pictures per album = 72 / 8
Pictures per album = 9

Now, we know that 3 albums were selfies only and 2 albums were portraits. Since the number of pictures per album is 9, we can multiply this by the number of albums for each category to find the total number of selfies and portraits.

Selfies = Pictures per album * Number of selfie albums
Selfies = 9 * 3
Selfies = 27

Portraits = Pictures per album * Number of portrait albums
Portraits = 9 * 2
Portraits = 18

The final answer is: 
Selfies: 27
Portraits: 18"
"To find out how long James spends reading, we need to determine how many sets of 3 pages he reads and then multiply that by the time it takes him to read one set of 3 pages.

Since James reads 18 pages, we can divide 18 by 3 to find out how many sets of 3 pages he reads: 18 / 3 = 6.

Now, we know it takes James 10 minutes to read one set of 3 pages. Since he reads 6 sets, we multiply 10 minutes by 6: 10 * 6 = 60.

James spends 60 minutes reading his book."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, the hotel had 100 guests.

24 guests checked out early, so the number of guests remaining is 100 - 24 = 76.

15 guests opted for a late checkout, so the number of guests remaining is still 76.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout, which is 2 * 15 = 30. So, the number of guests now is 76 + 30 = 106.

After dinner, 7 more people checked in, so the final number of guests is 106 + 7 = 113.

"To find the number of points Aries is sure to get, we first need to determine the number of easy, average, and difficult questions in the quiz.

There are 60 questions in total. 40% of the questions are easy, so the number of easy questions is 0.4 * 60 = 24.

The rest of the questions are equally divided between average and difficult, so the number of average questions is (60 - 24) / 2 = 18, and the number of difficult questions is also 18.

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, which is 0.75 * 24 = 18. She is also sure to get half of the average and difficult questions, which is 0.5 * 18 = 9 for each.

So, the total number of points Aries is sure to get is 18 + 9 + 9 = 36.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote the number of small stuffed animals as 's' and the number of large stuffed animals as 'l'. We know that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so we can write an equation:

s = 2l

We also know that the price of a small stuffed animal is $4. Since Teresa sold 's' small stuffed animals, the total amount of money she earned from small stuffed animals is 4s.

The price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal, which is 3 * 4 = $12. Since Teresa sold 'l' large stuffed animals, the total amount of money she earned from large stuffed animals is 12l.

We are given that Teresa earned a total of $120 from the sales. So, we can write another equation:

4s + 12l = 120

Now we can substitute the expression for 's' from the first equation into the second equation:

4(2l) + 12l = 120

Expanding the equation, we get:

8l + 12l = 120

Combine like terms:

20l = 120

Divide both sides by 20:

l = 6

Now that we know the number of large stuffed animals, we can find the number of small stuffed animals:

s = 2l
s = 2(6)
s = 12

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe and then multiply it by 40 dwarves and 30 days.

First, let's find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with an iron pickaxe. Since he can mine twice as much with an iron pickaxe as with his bare hands, he can mine 2 * 12 = 24 pounds of ore per day with an iron pickaxe.

Next, let's find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe. Since he can mine 50% more with a steel pickaxe than with an iron pickaxe, he can mine 24 + (24 * 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe.

Now, let's find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day with steel pickaxes. Since one dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe, 40 dwarves can mine 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds of ore per day.

Finally, let's find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in 30 days with steel pickaxes. Since they can mine 1440 pounds of ore per day, they can mine 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds of ore in 30 days.

"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to determine the ratio of the price to the number of sandwiches for the first two packages. 

The ratio for the first package is $3 / 2 sandwiches. 
The ratio for the second package is $6 / 4 sandwiches.

To find the common ratio, we can divide the ratio of the second package by the ratio of the first package: ($6 / 4) / ($3 / 2) = (6 * 2) / (4 * 3) = 12 / 12 = 1.

This means that the price increases by the same factor for each additional sandwich. Since the first package has 2 sandwiches and the second package has 4 sandwiches, the price increases by a factor of 2 (4 / 2 = 2).

Now, we can use this factor to find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches. The price of the first package is $3, and the number of sandwiches is 2. The price of the package with 8 sandwiches will be $3 * 2^3 = $24.

The final answer is: $24"

"To find the number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons after each event.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

First, 40% of the red balloons burst. 40% of 25 is 0.4 * 25 = 10. So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

Next, Sally released half of the yellow balloons. Half of 12 is 12 / 2 = 6. So, 6 yellow balloons were released, leaving 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.

Then, Sally found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch. 75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6. So, she added 6 blue balloons to her clutch.

Now, let's calculate the total number of balloons Sally had before adding the blue balloons: 15 red balloons + 7 green balloons + 6 yellow balloons = 28 balloons.

Adding the 6 blue balloons, Sally had 28 + 6 = 34 balloons in total.

"To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to consider the scenarios where he won't get an extension. 

First, let's consider the case where the substitute teacher is present. In this case, there's a 50% chance of the substitute teacher being present, and since the homework won't be collected in this scenario, the probability of having to turn in the homework is 0%.

Next, let's consider the case where the normal teacher is present. In this case, there's a 60% chance (100% - 40% extension chance). Within this 60%, there's a 80% chance (100% - 20% chance of getting a personal extension) that Marcus won't get an extension.

Now, we can calculate the overall probability of having to turn in the homework:

- Probability of substitute teacher: 50% * 0% = 0%
- Probability of normal teacher and no extension: 60% * 80% = 48%

The total probability of having to turn in the homework is the sum of these two probabilities: 0% + 48% = 48%.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the relationship between the number of small, medium, and large jelly beans. 

Let's start by using the information that eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. This means that the number of small beans is 3 times the number of medium beans.

Let's denote the number of medium beans as M. Then, the number of small beans is 3M.

We are also given that Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans. Let's denote the number of large beans as L. Then, the number of medium beans is 2L, and the number of small beans is 3(2L) = 6L.

We know that it takes 75 large beans to fill Grandpa up. Since the number of large beans is L, we can set up the equation:

L = 75

Now, we can find the number of medium beans by substituting L = 75 into the equation 2L:

M = 2L
M = 2(75)
M = 150

Now, we can find the number of small beans by substituting M = 150 into the equation 3M:

Small beans = 3M
Small beans = 3(150)
Small beans = 450

"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to first determine how many soda bottles he will place along the driveway. 

Since the driveway is 24 feet wide and he wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet, we can find the total number of bottles by dividing the width of the driveway by the spacing between the bottles:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Since it takes Richard 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, we can multiply the number of bottles by the time it takes to set off each one:

8 bottles * 5 seconds per bottle = 40 seconds

Therefore, it will take Richard 40 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim lost due to loans and not working while in college. 

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim borrowed: 
$50,000/year * 4 years = $200,000

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim lost by not working while in college. 
His pre-college income was $25,000/year. 
His post-college income is $25,000/year * 3 = $75,000/year. 
The difference in income is $75,000/year - $25,000/year = $50,000/year. 
The total amount of money Jim lost by not working while in college is $50,000/year * 4 years = $200,000.

The total amount of money Jim needs to earn is the sum of the money he borrowed and the money he lost: 
$200,000 (loans) + $200,000 (lost income) = $400,000.

Now, let's calculate how long it would take Jim to earn this amount at his post-college income:

Total people in one country = 5 cities * 1000 people per city = 5000 people

Since there are 26 countries in South America, we multiply the total number of people in one country by the number of countries.

Total people in South America = 5000 people per country * 26 countries = 130,000 people

The final answer is: 130000"
"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we first need to calculate their current heights. 

Xavier's initial height was 4 feet, which is equivalent to 48 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches). He grew 3 inches over the summer, so his current height is 48 + 3 = 51 inches.

Cole's initial height was 50 inches, and he grew 2 inches over the summer, so his current height is 50 + 2 = 52 inches.

The difference in height between Cole and Xavier is 52 - 51 = 1 inch.

The final answer is: 1"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the share of the first person as x. 

Since the second person took $80 more than the first, the second person's share is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second took, so the third person's share is 2(x + 80).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920.

Combine like terms: x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920.

Combine like terms again: 4x + 240 = 1920.

Subtract 240 from both sides: 4x = 1680.

Divide both sides by 4: x = 420.

The final answer is: $420"
"To find the total hours worked by each painter, we first need to calculate the total hours worked in 3 weeks. 

There are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks have 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Since the painters worked 3/8ths of a day every day, we need to convert 3/8ths to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3/8 * 24 = 9 hours.

Now, we multiply the hours worked per day by the number of days: 9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours.

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4 to find the hours worked by each painter: 189 hours / 4 = 47.25 hours.

The final numerical answer is: 47.25"
"Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as 'x'. 

Since Rory retrieved four more balls in the first set than in the second, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set, which is given as 19. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for x, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Expanding the equation:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

Number of balls in the first set = x + 4
= 6 + 4
= 10

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation of the car from 2007 to 2010.

The car was bought in 2007 for $20,000. 

The price of the car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year. 

First, we'll calculate the depreciation for 3 years (from 2007 to 2010).

Year 1 (2008): 
Depreciation = 21% of $20,000 = 0.21 * $20,000 = $4,200
Price in 2008 = $20,000 - $4,200 = $15,800

Year 2 (2009):
Depreciation = 21% of $15,800 = 0.21 * $15,800 = $3,318
Price in 2009 = $15,800 - $3,318 = $12,482

Year 3 (2010):
Depreciation = 21% of $12,482 = 0.21 * $12,482 = $2,623.62
Price in 2010 = $12,482 - $2,623.62 = $9,858.38

The price of the car in 2010 is $9,858.38."
"To find the number of Spanish books, we first need to determine the total number of books that are not written in English or German. 

Since half of the books are written in English, that's 50 / 2 = 25 books in English.

10% of the books are written in German, which is 0.1 * 50 = 5 books in German.

Now, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total to find the number of Spanish books: 50 - 25 - 5 = 20 books.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we need to subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance. 

First, let's calculate the total distance Bernice has driven: 
Distance driven = Speed * Time
However, the speed is not given, but we know the distance driven and the time taken. We can rearrange the formula to find the speed: 
Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 325 km / 4 days
Speed = 81.25 km/day

Now, we can use the speed to find the total distance driven: 
Distance driven = Speed * Time
Distance driven = 81.25 km/day * 4 days
Distance driven = 325 km

However, we are given the total distance from San Diego to New York City, which is 1955 km. To find the remaining distance, we subtract the distance driven from the total distance:
Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance driven
Remaining distance = 1955 km - 325 km
Remaining distance = 1630 km

The final answer is: 1630"
"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to first calculate how many cups she drinks in 30 days and then convert that to gallons.

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. To find out how many cups she drinks in 30 days, we multiply the number of cups she drinks per day by 30:

8 cups/day * 30 days = 240 cups

Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we can convert the total cups to gallons by dividing the total cups by 16:

240 cups / 16 cups/gallon = 15 gallons

So, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days.

The final answer is: 15"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Romeo boards the train with 120 people.

At the first stop, 20 more people board the train. So, the total number of people on the train becomes:
120 (initial people) + 20 (new people) = 140

At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, and twice that number (100 people) board the train. So, the total number of people on the train becomes:
140 (people after the first stop) - 50 (people who descended) = 90
90 + 100 (new people) = 190

At the third stop, 80 more people descend from the train. So, the total number of people on the train becomes:
190 (people after the second stop) - 80 (people who descended) = 110

The final answer is: 110"
"To find the total amount Alison spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

1. The tank top costs $10.
2. The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $10 + $5 = $15.
3. The tennis shoes were originally $48, but they were on sale for half price. Half of $48 is $48 / 2 = $24.
4. The athletic socks cost $8, and she had a coupon for $2 off, so the socks cost $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items: $10 (tank top) + $15 (shorts) + $24 (shoes) + $6 (socks) = $55.

The final answer is: $55"
"To determine the total cost of renovating your kitchen floor, we need to calculate the total number of tiles required and then multiply it by the cost of each tile.

First, let's find the area of a single tile. Since each tile is a square with a side length of 1 ft, the area of a single tile is 1 ft * 1 ft = 1 SqFt.

Next, we need to find the total number of tiles required to cover the kitchen floor. To do this, we divide the total area of the kitchen floor (200 SqFt) by the area of a single tile (1 SqFt).

Total number of tiles = Total area of kitchen floor / Area of a single tile
Total number of tiles = 200 SqFt / 1 SqFt
Total number of tiles = 200

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the total number of tiles by the cost of each tile ($12).

Total cost = Total number of tiles * Cost of each tile
Total cost = 200 * $12
Total cost = $2400

The final answer is: $2400"
"To find the increased cost of the insurance, we need to calculate 60% of the normal cost and add it to the normal cost. 

60% of $120 is 0.6 x $120 = $72. 

The increased cost is $120 + $72 = $192 per month.

To find the yearly cost, we multiply the monthly cost by 12. 

$192 x 12 = $2,304 per year.

The final answer is: $2,304"
"To find out how many loads of laundry Greg does in a week, we need to calculate the total number of twin and king size sheets he puts on the beds and divide that by the number of sheets he can wash at a time.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. Since each twin bed requires 1 set of sheets and the king size bed requires 1 set, the total number of sets of sheets he puts on the beds is 4 (twin) + 1 (king) = 5 sets.

Since the laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time, we need to calculate how many twin sets he needs to wash in a week. 4 twin sets are needed, so he will need to wash 4 / 2 = 2 loads of twin sheets. 

The king size bed requires 1 set of sheets per week, so he will need to wash 1 load of king size sheets.

In total, Greg needs to wash 2 loads of twin sheets and 1 load of king size sheets, which is 2 + 1 = 3 loads of laundry per week.

To find out how many loads of laundry he does in a year, we multiply the number of loads per week by the number of weeks in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so Greg does 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year.

"To find the total number of movies Jill and her friends watch in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the number of movies they watch in one weekend and then multiply it by 4.

They watch 4 movies on Saturday. On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies they watch on Saturday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies.

So, in one weekend, they watch 4 + 2 = 6 movies.

To find the total number of movies they watch in 4 weeks, we multiply the number of movies they watch in one weekend by 4: 6 * 4 = 24.

Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers. 
Last year, he collected 50 stickers, so he had 100 + 50 = 150 stickers.
This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which is 2 * 50 = 100 stickers.

Now, we add the number of stickers he had last year to the number of stickers he collected this year: 150 + 100 = 250 stickers.

The total number of stickers Leo has in his collection is 250.

"To find out how many days the cat food will last, we need to divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the amount of cat food each cat eats per day (60 grams).

First, we need to calculate the total amount of cat food Imma's 3 cats eat per day. Since each cat eats 60 grams of food twice a day, we multiply 60 grams by 2 to get the daily consumption per cat, which is 120 grams. Then, we multiply this by the number of cats (3) to get the total daily consumption: 120 grams * 3 = 360 grams.

Now, we divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the total daily consumption (360 grams) to find out how many days it will last: 720 grams / 360 grams = 2.

The final answer is: 2"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

We know that Becky ate 10 slices. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake did, Jake must have eaten 10 - 3 = 7 slices.

We also know that Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake did. Since Jake ate 7 slices, Silvia must have eaten 2 * 7 = 14 slices.

To find the total number of slices eaten, we need to add up the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia. 

Total slices eaten = Becky's slices + Jake's slices + Silvia's slices
Total slices eaten = 10 + 7 + 14
Total slices eaten = 31

"Let's denote the time Donovan took to make his part as 'x'. Since Betsy took 18 minutes longer than Donovan, the time Betsy took can be represented as 'x + 18'. 

The total time taken to make the meal is the sum of the time taken by both Betsy and Donovan, which is given as 98 minutes. So, we can write the equation as:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:
2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Since x represents the time Donovan took, and Betsy took 18 minutes longer, Betsy's time is x + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

"To calculate the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to calculate the costs of the cast, the visit, the painkillers, and the parking.

The cost of the cast is $200.

The cost of the visit is $300/hour for 0.5 hours (30 minutes). So, the cost of the visit is $300 * 0.5 = $150.

The cost of the painkillers is $4/pill for 30 pills. So, the cost of the painkillers is $4 * 30 = $120.

The cost of parking is $6/hour for 2 hours. So, the cost of parking is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, let's add up the costs: $200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482.

"To find out how many emails James responds to, we first need to find out how many emails he doesn't respond to. 

20% of 80 emails is 0.2 * 80 = 16 emails. 

Since James doesn't respond to these 16 emails, he responds to the rest. The rest of the emails are 80 - 16 = 64 emails.

Now, we need to find out how many emails James responds to in a 5-day work week. Since he responds to 64 emails per day, in a 5-day work week, he responds to 64 * 5 = 320 emails.

"To find the total number of pizzas left, we first need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club and the football team.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. To find 70% of 20, we multiply 20 by 0.7:
20 * 0.7 = 14 pizzas eaten by the glee club.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. They ate 80% of them. To find 80% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.8:
40 * 0.8 = 32 pizzas eaten by the football team.

Now, we add the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club and the football team to find the total number of pizzas eaten:
14 + 32 = 46 pizzas eaten in total.

Since the total number of pizzas ordered was 20 (glee club) + 40 (football team) = 60 pizzas, we subtract the total number of pizzas eaten from the total number of pizzas ordered to find the number of pizzas left:
60 - 46 = 14 pizzas left.

"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of big coupons. Since Anthony wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, and he's sending out 700 small coupons, he'll send out 2 * 700 = 1400 big coupons.

The cost of mailing the small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents.

The cost of mailing the big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

Now, let's add the cost of mailing the small and big coupons together: 3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100: 24500 / 100 = 245 dollars.

"To find the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we first need to determine the number of trucks that did not experience mechanical failures. 

Since a quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures, we can calculate the number of trucks that failed as follows:

Number of trucks dispatched = 20
Number of trucks with mechanical failures = 20 * (1/4) = 5

Now, we subtract the number of trucks with mechanical failures from the total number of trucks dispatched to find the number of trucks that reached the farmers:

Number of trucks that reached the farmers = 20 - 5 = 15

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. To find the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we multiply the number of trucks that reached the farmers by the tons of fertiliser each truck carried:

Total tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers = 15 * 20 = 300

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the butter Dennis needs to buy. 

First, let's determine how many pounds of butter Dennis needs. Since he needs to make 6 dozen croissants and he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants, he needs 6 pounds of butter.

Now, let's consider the promotion. For every pound of butter he buys, he gets one half off the second pound. This means that for every two pounds of butter, he pays the full price for one pound and half price for the other pound.

To calculate the cost, we can break it down as follows:

- For the first 3 pounds of butter, he pays full price ($4.00 per pound): 3 * $4.00 = $12.00
- For the next 3 pounds of butter, he pays half price ($2.00 per pound): 3 * $2.00 = $6.00

The total cost of the butter is the sum of these two amounts: $12.00 + $6.00 = $18.00

"To find the total cost of the party, we need to calculate the number of guests and then apply the given fee structure.

First, let's find the total number of guests. Kayla invited 25 classmates, 7 dance class girls, and 13 family members, but 4 people said they couldn't come. So, the total number of guests is:
25 (classmates) + 7 (dance class girls) + 13 (family members) - 4 (those who couldn't come) = 41

Since the theater can accommodate 20 guests for $125, and there are 41 guests, we need to calculate the additional guests:
41 (total guests) - 20 (base capacity) = 21 (additional guests)

The fee for the additional guests is $6 per person, so the cost for the additional guests is:
21 (additional guests) * $6 (per guest) = $126

Now, we add the base fee and the cost for the additional guests:
$125 (base fee) + $126 (additional guests) = $251

The final cost of the party is $251.

The final answer is: $251"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money Maggie and Riza had initially. Since they each had $60 after spending a portion of their money, we can set up an equation to represent the situation.

Let's say Maggie had x dollars initially. Since she spent a quarter of her money, she has 3/4x dollars left. Similarly, let's say Riza had y dollars initially. Since she spent one-third of her money, she has 2/3y dollars left.

We know that both of them have $60 left, so we can set up the following equations:

3/4x = 60
2/3y = 60

To solve for x and y, we can multiply both sides of each equation by the reciprocal of the fraction:

x = 60 * 4/3 = 80
y = 60 * 3/2 = 90

Now that we know Maggie had $80 initially and Riza had $90 initially, we can find the total amount of money they had:

Total money = x + y = 80 + 90 = 170

Since they spent a portion of their money, we need to add back the amount they spent to find the total amount of money they had initially. Maggie spent 1/4 of her money, which is 20 dollars, and Riza spent 1/3 of her money, which is 30 dollars. The total amount they spent is 20 + 30 = 50 dollars.

Total initial money = Total money + Total spent = 170 + 50 = 220

Now, we can find the total amount of money they have left:

Total money left = Total initial money - Total money = 220 - 120 = 100

However, this is not the answer we are looking for. We need to find the total amount of money they have left after they spent their portions. 

Maggie has 3/4 of her initial money left, which is 3/4 * 80 = 60. Riza has 2/3 of her initial money left, which is 2/3 * 90 = 60. 

Total money left = 60 + 60 = 120

"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we first need to determine how many bananas the first and second monkeys eat each day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. 

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day.

Since there are three monkeys in total, the total number of bananas they eat each day is 10 + 14 + x, where x is the number of bananas the third monkey eats. However, we know that the total number of bananas is 315, and they eat this amount for a week, which is 7 days. 

So, the total number of bananas eaten in a week is 315 * 7 = 2205 bananas.

Since they eat 10 + 14 = 24 bananas in a day, the number of bananas eaten in a week is 24 * 7 = 168 bananas.

Now, we can find the number of bananas the third monkey eats in a week by subtracting the total bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total bananas eaten in a week: 2205 - 168 = 2037. However, this is incorrect because we are trying to find the number of bananas the third monkey eats in a day, not in a week.

To find the number of bananas the third monkey eats in a day, we need to divide the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a week by 7: 168 / 7 = 24. 

However, this is the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a week, not the third monkey. To find the number of bananas the third monkey eats in a week, we need to subtract the total bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total bananas eaten in a week: 2205 - 168 = 2037. However, this is incorrect because we are trying to find the number of bananas the third monkey eats in a day, not in a week.

To find the number of bananas the third monkey eats in a day, we need to divide the total number of bananas eaten by the third monkey in a week by 7. However, we don't know the total number of bananas eaten by the third monkey in a week. 

Let's go back to the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a day: 24. Since the total number of bananas is 315, the number of bananas eaten by the third monkey in a day is 315 - 24 = 291."

Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, which is 500 / 2 = 250 pieces. 

Then, he finished another 500 piece puzzle. 

So, in total, he placed 250 + 500 = 750 pieces. 

Since he had already placed 250 pieces before the hour, we subtract those from the total to find out how many pieces he placed during the hour: 750 - 250 = 500.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the roses and then find out how much change Jenny will get.

First, let's calculate the cost of the roses. Jenny bought 15 roses, but since a dozen roses cost $15, we can't buy a fraction of a dozen. So, we'll calculate the cost of 12 roses and the cost of 3 additional roses separately.

The cost of 12 roses is $15. 
The cost of 3 additional roses is 3 * $2 = $6.

The total cost of the roses is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny arrived with five $5 bills, which is a total of 5 * $5 = $25.

To find out how much change she will get, we subtract the total cost of the roses from the amount she arrived with: $25 - $21 = $4.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the $4 into quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so there are 4 * 4 = 16 quarters in $4.

The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the first train leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. The third train leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it also leaves at 125 minutes.

The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes. This is the time Paul will board his train.

Since Paul is waiting for the fourth train, we need to find the time from the moment he arrives at the station to the moment the fourth train arrives. We don't know the exact time Paul arrives at the station, but we can assume it's 0 minutes for simplicity. 

The time Paul will wait for his train is 145 minutes.

The final answer is: 145"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many toothpicks Melanie has saved so far and then determine how many more weeks it will take her to reach 200 toothpicks.

Melanie saved 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. To find the total number of toothpicks she has saved, we multiply the number of toothpicks saved per week by the number of weeks:

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Since Melanie needs 200 toothpicks for the sculpture, we subtract the number of toothpicks she has saved from the total required:

200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Now, we need to find out how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 80 toothpicks at a rate of 10 toothpicks per week:

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

So, Melanie will need 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we first need to determine the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch and the price at which he sold it.

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of the original price, so the price he paid is 75% of $2000, which is 0.75 * $2000 = $1500.

Then, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, which is 1.2 * $1500 = $1800.

To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend, we need to find the difference between the original price and the price he paid, and then divide it by the original price and multiply by 100.

The difference between the original price and the price Mr. Rogers' friend paid is $2000 - $1800 = $200.

The percentage discount is ($200 / $2000) * 100 = 10%.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours and then multiply it by the rate at which the springs create jellyfish.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, and 60 seconds in a minute. So, the total number of seconds in 4 hours is:

60 minutes/hour * 60 seconds/minute * 4 hours = 14400 seconds

Since each spring creates a new jellyfish every second, the total number of jellyfish created by one spring in 14400 seconds is 14400.

Now, if we have 5 springs working at the same rate, the total number of jellyfish created in 14400 seconds is:

14400 * 5 = 72000

So, 5 springs working at the same rate would create 72000 jellyfish in 4 hours.

The final answer is: 72000"
"To find Frankie's score, we need to first calculate twice Binkie's score and then add 15 to it. 

Binkie's score is 90. Twice Binkie's score is 2 * 90 = 180. 

Now, we add 15 to this result: 180 + 15 = 195.

Frankie's score is 195."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance James walked and then divide it by his speed.

First, James walked to the store, which is 4 miles. Then, he walked back home, which is another 4 miles. So, the total distance he walked is 4 + 4 = 8 miles.

Since James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour, we can calculate the time it took him to walk the total distance by dividing the total distance by his speed: 8 miles / 4 miles per hour = 2 hours.

However, this is the total time it took him to walk to the store and back home. Since he only asked how long it took him to reach the store, we need to consider only the time it took him to walk to the store, which is half of the total time. 

The time it took him to walk to the store is 2 hours / 2 = 1 hour.

The final answer is: 1"
"To find out how much money Jenny saved, we first need to calculate the total cost of buying the bananas individually and then compare it to the cost of buying them in bunches.

If Jenny buys 10 bunches with 4 bananas per bunch, she buys a total of 10 * 4 = 40 bananas.

The cost of buying 40 bananas individually would be 40 * $0.80 = $32.00.

The cost of buying 10 bunches is $3.00 per bunch, so the total cost is 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

To find the savings, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

So, Jenny saved $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Sam gets x feet of fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets x + 60 feet.

We know that the total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence. To find out how much is left over, we need to subtract the total amount of fence Sam and Harry have from the total length of the fence:

100 - (20 + (20 + 60)) = 100 - 100 = 0

However, this is not the correct interpretation of the question. The question asks how much is left over for Sam, implying that the leftover is the amount of fence that is not assigned to either Sam or Harry. Since Sam and Harry together have 100 feet, and they have 100 feet in total, there is no leftover fence.

However, if we interpret the question as asking how much is left over after Sam and Harry take their respective portions, we can calculate the leftover as follows:

Sam gets 20 feet, and Harry gets 20 + 60 = 80 feet. The total length of fence they have is 20 + 80 = 100 feet. Since they have the entire 100 feet, there is no leftover fence.

But if we are looking for the leftover in the context of the total length of the fence being 100 feet and the fact that they are splitting it, we can say that the leftover is 0 since they have used the entire 100 feet.

However, if we are looking for the leftover in the context of the total length of the fence being 100 feet and the fact that they are splitting it, and we are looking for the leftover in the context

"To find the rate of growth per year, we need to divide the growth in inches by the number of years. 

Growth per year = 8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches/year

Now, we can multiply the growth per year by the total number of years to find the total growth in 13 years.

Total growth = 2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches

The final answer is: 26"
"To find out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply it by its price.

First, let's find the number of each type of bike sold:

- Total bikes sold: 300
- Trekking bikes: 300 / 2 = 150
- BMX bikes: 300 * 0.15 = 45
- MTB bikes: 300 - (150 + 45) = 105

Now, let's calculate the total earnings from each type of bike:
- Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500
- BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250 (since BMX is half the price of MTB, which is $500, so BMX is $500 / 2 = $250)
- MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500

Now, let's add up the total earnings from all types of bikes:
$67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250

The final answer is: $131,250"
"To find out how many bales of hay are left in the field, we need to calculate the total number of bales made by the farmer and the total number of bales picked up by the truck, and then subtract the latter from the former.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the farmer will make 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck will pick up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

Now, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the total number of bales made by the farmer: 30 - 18 = 12.

So, there are 12 bales of hay left in the field.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total time John spends learning, we need to calculate the time spent in classes, and the extra time spent on Saturday and Sunday.

First, let's calculate the time spent in classes. John takes 2 extra classes, each 40 minutes long, 5 days a week. 

Time spent in classes per day = 2 * 40 minutes = 80 minutes
Time spent in classes per week = 80 minutes * 5 days = 400 minutes

Now, let's calculate the extra time spent on Saturday and Sunday. John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on extra learning time. 

First, we need to find the total minutes in a week. There are 24 hours in a day, and 7 days in a week. 

Total minutes in a day = 24 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 1440 minutes
Total minutes in a week = 1440 minutes/day * 7 days = 10080 minutes

Now, we can find the extra time spent on Saturday and Sunday.

Extra time per week = 1/16 * 10080 minutes = 630 minutes

Now, we can find the total time spent learning per week.

Total time spent learning per week = Time spent in classes per week + Extra time per week
Total time spent learning per week = 400 minutes + 630 minutes = 1030 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60.

Total time spent learning per week in hours = 1030 minutes / 60 = 17.17 hours

"To find the height of the ball on its second bounce, we need to calculate the height of the ball after the first bounce and then multiply it by 2/3.

The initial height of the ball is the height of the third floor, which is 24 feet. 

On the first bounce, the ball reaches 2/3 of its initial height, so the height after the first bounce is 24 * (2/3) = 16 feet.

On the second bounce, the ball reaches 2/3 of the height it had after the first bounce, so the height after the second bounce is 16 * (2/3) = 10.67 feet.

The final answer is: 10.67"
"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the height of each child in inches. 

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 6 feet to inches by multiplying 6 by 12. 
6 feet * 12 inches/foot = 72 inches

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so we add 2 inches to the height of the first child.
72 inches + 2 inches = 74 inches

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so we subtract 5 inches from the height of the second child.
74 inches - 5 inches = 69 inches

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so we add 3 inches to the height of the third child.
69 inches + 3 inches = 72 inches

The final answer is: 72"
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to determine the number of bags sold and then multiply that by the price per bag.

Since the orchard sold a total of 2000 apples and each bag contains 10 apples, we can divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag to find the number of bags sold.

Number of bags sold = Total apples / Apples per bag
= 2000 / 10
= 200

Now, we can multiply the number of bags sold by the price per bag to find the total earnings.

Total earnings = Number of bags sold * Price per bag
= 200 * $5
= $1000

The final answer is: $1000"
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the amount of meat left after the Allosaurus ate. 

The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat, which was half of what was left after the velociraptors scavenged. 

Let's call the amount of meat left after the velociraptors scavenged 'x'. Since the Allosaurus ate half of this, we can set up the equation: x / 2 = 270. 

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2: x = 270 * 2 = 540 kilograms.

Now, we know that the velociraptors scavenged half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. Let's call the amount of meat left after the T-Rex ate 'y'. Since the velociraptors scavenged half of this, we can set up the equation: y / 2 = 540.

To solve for y, we multiply both sides by 2: y = 540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms.

Finally, we know that the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops. Let's call the original amount of meat on the triceratops 'z'. Since the T-Rex ate half of this, we can set up the equation: z / 2 = 1080.

To solve for z, we multiply both sides by 2: z = 1080 * 2 = 2160 kilograms.

The final answer is: 2160"

- North wall: 10 x 8 = 80 square feet
- South wall: 10 x 8 = 80 square feet
- East wall: 5 x 8 = 40 square feet
- West wall: 5 x 8 = 40 square feet

Now, let's add up the areas of all the walls:
80 + 80 + 40 + 40 = 240 square feet

Since a gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, we need to divide the total area by 20 to find out how many gallons are needed:
240 / 20 = 12 gallons

Now, let's multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon to find the total cost:
12 gallons * $12/gallon = $144

The final answer is: $144"
"To find the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to determine the probability of her choosing a shaken can out of the remaining cans.

Initially, there were 12 sodas. Ellen shook 3 of them, so 3 were shaken and 9 were unshaken. She took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 11 sodas. Her brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 2 shaken and 7 unshaken sodas.

The total number of sodas left is 2 + 7 = 9. The number of shaken sodas left is 2. 

The probability of Ellen's friend choosing a shaken can is the number of shaken cans divided by the total number of cans: 2/9.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (2/9) * 100 = 22.22%."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the distance each train travels in 3 hours and then add those distances together.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. To find the distance it travels in 3 hours, we multiply its speed by the time:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour x 3 hours
Distance = 180 miles

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. To find the distance it travels in 3 hours, we multiply its speed by the time:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour x 3 hours
Distance = 90 miles

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, we add the distances they traveled to find the total distance between them:

Total Distance = Distance of first train + Distance of second train
Total Distance = 180 miles + 90 miles
Total Distance = 270 miles

The final answer is: 270"
"To find the total number of people Billy can help, we first need to determine the number of days he works. 

March has 31 days, and April has 19 days (since April 19th is the last day). So, the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th is 31 + 19 = 50 days.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, we need to find 20% of 50. To do this, we multiply 50 by 0.2: 50 * 0.2 = 10.

This means Billy takes 10 days off. So, the number of days he works is 50 - 10 = 40 days.

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, which means he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

To find the total number of people he can help, we multiply the number of days he works by the number of people he can help per day: 40 * 6 = 240.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the total number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people who were transported by the buses and the cars, and then subtract that from the total number of people who attended the wedding.

First, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the buses: 
12 buses * 35 people per bus = 420 people

Next, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the cars: 
20 cars * 3 people per car = 60 people

Now, let's add the number of people transported by the buses and the cars: 
420 people + 60 people = 480 people

Since the total number of people who attended the wedding is the sum of the people inside the church and the people outside, we can assume that the number of people outside the church is the sum of the number of private cars and buses, which is 20 + 12 = 32 people.

Now, let's calculate the total number of people who attended the wedding: 
32 people (outside the church) + 480 people (transported) = 512 people

To find the number of people inside the church, we subtract the number of people outside the church from the total number of people who attended the wedding: 
512 people - 32 people = 480 people

The final answer is: 480"
"To find Jeff's age, we need to determine Martha's age first. Since Mike is 24 years old and Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, we can calculate Martha's age by subtracting 4 from Mike's age.

Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
Martha's age = 24 - 4
Martha's age = 20

Now that we know Martha's age, we can find Jeff's age since he is 10 years older than Martha.

Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
Jeff's age = 20 + 10
Jeff's age = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the time it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of each slide by the speed at which people slide down.

For the biggest slide: 
Time = Length / Speed
Time = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute
Time = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide:
Time = Length / Speed
Time = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute
Time = 3 minutes

Now, we need to find the difference in time between the two slides:
Difference in time = Time for the biggest slide - Time for the second biggest slide
Difference in time = 5 minutes - 3 minutes
Difference in time = 2 minutes

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks, we need to calculate the total time spent per day and then multiply it by 5.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 x 15-minute breaks per day. The total time spent on breaks is 2 x 15 = 30 minutes. 

So, the total time spent per day is 30 (lunch) + 30 (breaks) = 60 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60. 

60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour.

Since Bobby works for 5 days, we multiply the daily time by 5.

1 hour/day * 5 days = 5 hours.

The total time spent on lunch and breaks after 5 days is 5 hours.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we first need to determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can multiply 8 by 3.5 to find Micah's total.

8 miles * 3.5 = 28 miles

Now that we know Micah ran 28 miles, we can subtract the total miles run by Amber and Micah from the total miles run by all three to find out how many miles Ahito ran.

Total miles run by all three = 52 miles
Miles run by Amber = 8 miles
Miles run by Micah = 28 miles
Miles run by Ahito = Total miles - (Miles run by Amber + Miles run by Micah)
Miles run by Ahito = 52 - (8 + 28)
Miles run by Ahito = 52 - 36
Miles run by Ahito = 16

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total amount she spent after returning the item and then add that to the initial charge minus the returned item.

First, let's calculate the amount Sheila got back after returning the item:
$85.00 (initial charge) - $15.00 (returned item) = $70.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of the frying pan:
The frying pan was on sale for 20% off $20.00. To find the discount, we multiply $20.00 by 0.20:
$20.00 * 0.20 = $4.00
Now, subtract the discount from the original price:
$20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

The cost of the frying pan is $16.00.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the set of towels:
The set of towels was 10% off $30.00. To find the discount, we multiply $30.00 by 0.10:
$30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00
Now, subtract the discount from the original price:
$30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

The cost of the set of towels is $27.00.

Now, let's add the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels to the amount Sheila got back after returning the item:
$70.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $113.00

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. 

A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is x/5. 

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (x/5) * (1/3) = x/15.

The problem states that 6 jellyfish changed color, so we can set up the equation x/15 = 6.

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 15, which gives us x = 6 * 15 = 90.

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find Caroline's age, we need to determine Ben's age first, and then multiply it by 3.

Since Chris is 4 years old, and Ben is two times older than Chris, we can calculate Ben's age as follows:
Ben's age = 2 * Chris's age
Ben's age = 2 * 4
Ben's age = 8

Now that we know Ben's age, we can find Caroline's age by multiplying Ben's age by 3:
Caroline's age = 3 * Ben's age
Caroline's age = 3 * 8
Caroline's age = 24

The final answer is: 24"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate Lauren's total savings needed for retirement and then determine how many years she needs to work to achieve this goal.

First, let's calculate Lauren's annual expenses in retirement. Since she plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary, her annual expenses will be:

40% of $100,000 = 0.4 x $100,000 = $40,000

Since Lauren plans to live for 20 years in retirement, her total expenses will be:

$40,000 x 20 = $800,000

Next, we need to calculate Lauren's annual savings. Since she saves 20% of her salary, her annual savings will be:

20% of $100,000 = 0.2 x $100,000 = $20,000

Now, we need to calculate how many years Lauren needs to work to save $800,000 at a rate of $20,000 per year:

Number of years = Total savings / Annual savings
= $800,000 / $20,000
= 40 years

However, this is the total number of years she needs to work to save for retirement, but we need to subtract the 20 years she plans to live in retirement. Therefore, the number of years she needs to work is:

40 - 20 = 20 years

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the length of each final cut, we need to first divide the total length of the ribbon by 4 to get the length of each of the initial cuts. 

100 cm / 4 = 25 cm

"To find the total population of the school, we can use the information given about the boys. Since 40% of the school population is 240 boys, we can set up the equation:

0.4x = 240

where x is the total population of the school.

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.4:

x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

Now that we know the total population of the school is 600, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total population:

Number of girls = Total population - Number of boys
= 600 - 240
= 360

The final answer is: 360"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items before applying the coupon. 

The cost of the set of pots is $19, and the cost of the sack of garden soil is $26. 

Total cost before coupon = cost of pots + cost of soil
Total cost before coupon = $19 + $26
Total cost before coupon = $45

Now, we need to subtract the coupon value from the total cost before coupon to get the final amount spent.

Final amount spent = Total cost before coupon - coupon value
Final amount spent = $45 - $7
Final amount spent = $38

"To find the average height of heels at the party, we need to calculate the total height of all the heels and then divide it by the total number of women.

The total number of women is 6 (3 wearing 4 inch heels and 3 wearing 2 inch heels).

The total height of the heels for the women wearing 4 inch heels is 3 * 4 = 12 inches.
The total height of the heels for the women wearing 2 inch heels is 3 * 2 = 6 inches.

The total height of all the heels is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.

The average height of heels is the total height of all the heels divided by the total number of women, which is 18 / 6 = 3 inches.

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad needs to hike, we first need to calculate the total number of days in June. June has 30 days.

Since Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in 30 days, we can calculate her daily target by dividing the total miles by the number of days:

9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

Soledad is planning to hike 125 miles twice a day, which is a total of 250 miles per day. To find out how many more miles per day she needs to hike, we subtract her planned daily miles from her target daily miles:

310 miles per day - 250 miles per day = 60 miles per day

So, Soledad needs to hike 60 more miles per day to complete her journey on time.

"To find the total amount the store will receive after selling all the balls, we need to calculate the total revenue from each color of ball and add them together.

The store has 3 red balls, and each red ball costs $9. So, the total revenue from red balls is 3 * $9 = $27.

The store has 11 blue balls, and each blue ball costs $5. So, the total revenue from blue balls is 11 * $5 = $55.

The store has 25 green balls, and each green ball costs $3. So, the total revenue from green balls is 25 * $3 = $75.

Now, let's add the revenue from all the balls together: $27 + $55 + $75 = $157.

"To find out how much money Raymond has left, we need to subtract the amount he spent from the total amount he had initially, including the money he saved.

Raymond initially had $21. He saved $11, so now he has $21 + $11 = $32.

Then, he spent $5 on a comic book and $19 on a puzzle, so the total amount he spent is $5 + $19 = $24.

Now, we subtract the amount he spent from the total amount he had: $32 - $24 = $8.

So, Raymond has $8 left.

The final answer is: $8"
"To find out how much each book cost, we need to first determine how much Anna spent on books in total. We know she had a budget of $16 and had $2 left, so she spent $16 - $2 = $14 on books.

Since she bought 2 books and they cost the same amount, we can set up an equation to represent this situation. Let x be the cost of each book. The total cost of the books is 2x, and we know this is equal to $14.

2x = 14

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2.

x = 14 / 2
x = 7

So each book cost $7.

"To find the total distance John drives in a round trip, we need to calculate the distance of a single trip and then multiply it by 2.

The distance of a single trip is calculated using the formula: distance = speed * time. 

Given that the speed is 70 mph and the time is 2 hours, we can plug in the values: distance = 70 * 2 = 140 miles.

Since John makes two trips a month, we need to multiply the distance of a single trip by 2: 140 * 2 = 280 miles.

However, this is the distance for two trips in a month. To find the total distance for a month, we need to consider that there are approximately 4 weeks in a month. Since John visits his parents twice a week, we can multiply the distance for two trips by 2: 280 * 2 = 560 miles.

The final answer is: 560"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how far Sofie will walk in 7 days. Since Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, we can multiply the number of miles she walks per day by the number of days:

10 miles/day * 7 days = 70 miles

Since Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship:

Sofie's distance = 2 * Brian's distance

We know that Sofie's distance is 70 miles, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

70 miles = 2 * Brian's distance

To find Brian's distance, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

Brian's distance = 70 miles / 2
Brian's distance = 35 miles

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

The final answer is: 35"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers and then find out how many toys the fifth worker must produce to meet the remaining demand.

First, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the 2 workers who produce 6 toys an hour. Since they work for 10 hours, they produce a total of 2 * 6 * 10 = 120 toys.

Next, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the other 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour. Since they work for 10 hours, they produce a total of 2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys.

The total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to meet the order, the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers must be 400 - 20 = 380 toys.

Now, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers. Since the first 4 workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must produce 380 - 200 = 180 toys.

Since the fifth worker works for 10 hours, the number of toys the fifth worker produces per hour is 180 / 10 = 18 toys per hour.

"To find the total weight of Elijah's dogs, we first need to find the weight of each of his dogs. 

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so we multiply 60 by 1/4 to find the weight of Elijah's first dog: 60 * (1/4) = 15 pounds.

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so we multiply 60 by 1/2 to find the weight of Elijah's second dog: 60 * (1/2) = 30 pounds.

Now, we add the weights of Elijah's two dogs to find the total weight of his dogs: 15 + 30 = 45 pounds.

To find the total weight of all three dogs, we add the weight of Kory's dog to the total weight of Elijah's dogs: 60 + 45 = 105 pounds.

"To solve this problem, let's work backwards from the information given.

Kris had 7 stickers left after giving some to Rob. Before that, Kris had 7 + 9 = 16 stickers.

Luis gave the rest of the stickers to Kris, so Kris had 16 stickers that were given to him by Luis. Since Kris kept 9 stickers, Luis must have given him 16 - 9 = 7 stickers.

Luis used half of the stickers that he received from Seth, so he must have had 7 * 2 = 14 stickers that Seth gave him.

Since Luis received half of Seth's stickers, Seth must have had 14 * 2 = 28 stickers in the beginning.

"To find the total number of M&M's John has, we need to calculate the total weight of the M&M's and then multiply it by the number of M&M's per ounce. 

First, let's find the total weight of the M&M's: 3 large bags * 10 ounces per bag = 30 ounces.

Since an ounce of M&M's has 30 M&M's, the total number of M&M's is 30 ounces * 30 M&M's per ounce = 900 M&M's.

Now, we need to find out how many small bags John can make. Each small bag contains 10 M&M's, so we divide the total number of M&M's by 10: 900 M&M's / 10 M&M's per small bag = 90 small bags.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the speed of the 2nd fastest car first, and then use that to find the speed of the fastest car.

Given that the average car can go 120 miles per hour, and the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, we can calculate the speed of the 2nd fastest car as follows:

Speed of 2nd fastest car = 5 * Speed of average car
= 5 * 120
= 600 miles per hour

Now, we know that the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. So, we can calculate the speed of the fastest car as follows:

Speed of fastest car = 1.25 * Speed of 2nd fastest car
= 1.25 * 600

Liam's current age is 16 years. Two years ago, Liam's age would be 16 - 2 = 14 years.

Two years ago, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince. So, Vince's age two years ago would be 14 / 2 = 7 years.

To find Vince's current age, we need to add 2 years to his age two years ago. Vince's current age is 7 + 2 = 9 years.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold as A, Madeline as M, Camden as C, and Sarah as S.

We know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so A = M.

We also know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. This can be expressed as C + S = 30 and C = S + 12.

We can rewrite the second equation as C = S + 12 and substitute it into the first equation: (S + 12) + S = 30.

Combine like terms: 2S + 12 = 30.

Subtract 12 from both sides: 2S = 18.

Divide both sides by 2: S = 9.

Now that we know S, we can find C by substituting S into the equation C = S + 12: C = 9 + 12 = 21.

Since A = M, and the total number of eggs is 56, we can write the equation A + M + C + S = 56.

Substitute the values of A, M, C, and S: A + A + 21 + 9 = 56.

Combine like terms: 2A + 30 = 56.

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2A = 26.

Divide both sides by 2: A = 13.

Now that we know A and C, we can find the difference between the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold: C - A = 21 - 13 = 8.

"To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we first need to find the total number of boxes and the total weight of the crayons and boxes.

Since Nik wants to put the crayons into groups of 8, we can divide the total number of crayons by 8 to find the number of boxes: 200 / 8 = 25 boxes.

Since each box weighs 8 ounces and there are 16 ounces in a pound, we can find the weight of one box in pounds: 8 / 16 = 0.5 pounds.

Now, we can find the total weight of the boxes: 25 boxes * 0.5 pounds/box = 12.5 pounds.

Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the total weight of the crayons is equal to the total number of crayons: 200 ounces.

To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes in pounds, we need to convert the total weight of the crayons from ounces to pounds: 200 / 16 = 12.5 pounds.

Now, we can add the total weight of the boxes and the total weight of the crayons: 12.5 pounds + 12.5 pounds = 25 pounds.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how much John makes, we first need to determine how many logs he can make from the tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, we calculate 80% of 80 feet.

80% of 80 feet = 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet

Since each log is 4 feet long, we divide the total length of the usable tree by the length of each log to find the number of logs.

64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs

From each log, he cuts 5 planks. So, we multiply the number of logs by the number of planks per log.

16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks

He sells each plank for $1.2. To find the total amount he makes, we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank.

80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96

The final answer is: $96"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the combined salary of Valerie and her brother, and then add her mother's salary to it.

Valerie earns $5000 per month, and her brother earns twice as much as her, so he earns 2 * $5000 = $10,000 per month.

The combined salary of Valerie and her brother is $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000 per month.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so she earns 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

The total amount of money they all have together is $15,000 + $30,000 = $45,000.

The final answer is: $45,000."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Grandma's speed on the beach and on the sidewalk. 

Let's denote Grandma's speed on the beach as 'x' miles per minute. Since she walks at twice the rate on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.

We know that she walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. The time taken to walk 2 miles on the beach is 2/x, and the time taken to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk is 1/(2x).

We are given that 40 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach. This means that 2/x = 40/60 (converting 40 minutes to hours for uniformity). 

Solving for x, we get x = 2/40 * 60 = 3 miles per minute.

Now, we know that her speed on the sidewalk is 2x = 2 * 3 = 6 miles per minute.

The time taken to walk 2 miles on the beach is 2/3 = 40/60 minutes, which is given. The time taken to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk is 1/6 minutes.

The total time taken to complete the entire 3-mile walk is 40/60 + 1/6. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 60. 

40/60 + 10/60 = 50/60 = 5/6 hours. 

To convert 5/6 hours to minutes, we multiply by 60: 5/6 * 60 = 50 minutes.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how many more weeks it will take Jane to save a total of $60, we first need to calculate how much she has saved so far. 

She has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so the total amount saved is 4 * 8 = $32.

To find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract the amount she has saved from the target amount: 60 - 32 = $28.

Since she saves $4 per week, we can find out how many weeks it will take her to save the remaining amount by dividing the remaining amount by her weekly savings: 28 / 4 = 7.

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total number of blue birds, we need to calculate the number of blue birds in each group of trees and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of blue birds in the 3 trees with 7 blue birds each:
3 trees * 7 blue birds/tree = 21 blue birds

Next, let's find the number of blue birds in the 2 trees with 4 blue birds each:
2 trees * 4 blue birds/tree = 8 blue birds

Then, we have 1 tree with 3 blue birds.

Now, let's add the number of blue birds in each group together:
21 blue birds + 8 blue birds + 3 blue birds = 32 blue birds

The final answer is: 32"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many marbles Bob originally had. We know that if he receives 2 dozen (24) more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. 

Let's denote the original number of marbles as 'x'. Then, the equation can be set up as follows:

x + 24 = 60

To find 'x', we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 24 from both sides:

x = 60 - 24
x = 36

So, Bob originally had 36 marbles. Now, if he loses 10 marbles, we need to subtract 10 from 36 to find out how many marbles he will have left:

36 - 10 = 26

The final answer is: 26"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum temperature of the second bottle of water. 

Let's denote the temperature of the second bottle as x degrees. 

When Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle into his water bottle, the total volume of water in the bottle is 5 ounces. 

Since the temperature of the mixture is at least 40 degrees, we can set up the following equation:

(33 * 4 + x * 1) / 5 >= 40

Simplifying the equation:

132 + x >= 200

Subtracting 132 from both sides:

x >= 68

So, the second bottle must be at least 68 degrees.

The final answer is: 68"
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of cows. Melanie's father starts with 50 cows. Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, there are 21 days in three weeks. 

Number of cows added in three weeks = 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
Total number of cows = Initial number of cows + Number of cows added
Total number of cows = 50 + 420
Total number of cows = 470

Next, let's calculate the number of chickens. Melanie's father starts with 20 chickens. Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. 

Number of chickens added in three weeks = 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens
Total number of chickens = Initial number of chickens + Number of chickens added
Total number of chickens = 20 + 210
Total number of chickens = 230

Now, let's add the total number of cows and chickens to find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks.

Total number of animals = Total number of cows + Total number of chickens
Total number of animals = 470 + 230
Total number of animals = 700

The final answer is: 700"
"To find the cost of each single bagel, we first need to calculate the total cost of the 4 packs of bagels with the 10% discount. 

The original cost of 4 packs of bagels is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00. 

Since Russell receives a 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of $40.00. 
10% of $40.00 = 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00

Now, we subtract the discount from the original cost to get the discounted cost: 
$40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

Since each pack has 9 bagels, the total number of bagels is 4 * 9 = 36 bagels.

To find the cost of each single bagel, we divide the discounted cost by the total number of bagels: 
$36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00 per bagel

The final answer is: $1.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. We know that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops, so we can write this as an equation:

Gomer's scoops = 23 - 5
Gomer's scoops = 18

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes it takes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. We know that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops, so we can write this as an equation:

Potatoes per scoop = 6 - 3
Potatoes per scoop = 3

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes it takes to make 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. We can multiply the number of scoops by the number of potatoes per scoop:

Total potatoes = Gomer's scoops * Potatoes per scoop
Total potatoes = 18 * 3
Total potatoes = 54

So, Gomer ate 54 potatoes.

The final answer is: 54"
"To find the total number of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we need to calculate the number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately, and then add them together.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days is 3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs.

In the next 30 days, Chester increases his egg consumption to 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in the next 30 days is 5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs.

Now, we add the total number of eggs from both periods: 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens: 240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozen eggs.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we first need to determine the total number of red and green jellybeans. We know there are 17 green jellybeans and twice as many red jellybeans, so the number of red jellybeans is 2 * 17 = 34.

The total number of green and red jellybeans is 17 + 34 = 51. Since there are a total of 60 jellybeans, the number of blue jellybeans can be found by subtracting the total number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans: 60 - 51 = 9.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade, we need to calculate the total number of lemons he collects in one year and then multiply it by 10.

First, let's find the total number of lemons he collects in one year. He has 5 trees, and each tree gives him 6 lemons per year. 

Total lemons per year = Number of trees * Lemons per tree per year
Total lemons per year = 5 * 6
Total lemons per year = 30

Now, we multiply the total lemons per year by 10 to find the total lemons in a decade.

Total lemons in a decade = Total lemons per year * 10
Total lemons in a decade = 30 * 10
Total lemons in a decade = 300

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the number of women who remained on the bus, we first need to find the total number of women on the bus initially. 

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, we can let the number of men be 5x and the number of women be 9x. 

Since the total number of passengers is 84, we can set up the equation: 5x + 9x = 84

Combine like terms: 14x = 84

Divide both sides by 14: x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of women on the bus initially: 9x = 9 * 6 = 54

After 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining is: 54 - 20 = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold per day. 

Faraday earned $26 from the sunflowers per day. Since each sunflower costs $2, we can find the number of sunflowers sold per day by dividing the total earnings from sunflowers by the cost of each sunflower.

Number of sunflowers sold per day = Total earnings from sunflowers / Cost of each sunflower
= $26 / $2
= 13

Next, we need to find out how many bouquets Faraday sold per day. Faraday earned $56 from the bouquets per day. Since each bouquet costs $8, we can find the number of bouquets sold per day by dividing the total earnings from bouquets by the cost of each bouquet.

Number of bouquets sold per day = Total earnings from bouquets / Cost of each bouquet
= $56 / $8
= 7

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the total number of sunflowers in each bouquet is 12. Therefore, the number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold per day is 7 * 12 = 84.

Now, we need to find the total number of sunflowers sold per day. This is the sum of the number of sunflowers sold individually and the number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold.

Total sunflowers sold per day = Number of sunflowers sold individually + Number of sunflowers in bouquets sold
= 13 + 84
= 97

Finally, we need to find the total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days. This is the product of the total sunflowers sold per day and the number of days.

Total sunflowers sold in 3 days = Total sunflowers sold per day * Number of days
= 97 * 3
= 291

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the inventory, the revenue from selling 60% of the inventory, and then find the difference between the revenue and the cost.

First, let's find out how many rocks Adam can buy with $100. Since each rock costs $5, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of each rock:

100 / 5 = 20 rocks

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling 60% of the inventory. Since Adam sells 60% of 20 rocks, we can multiply 20 by 0.6:

20 * 0.6 = 12 rocks

Since each rock is sold for $7, we can multiply the number of rocks sold by the selling price:

12 * 7 = $84

Now, let's calculate the cost of the inventory. Since Adam bought 20 rocks at $5 each, we can multiply the number of rocks by the cost per rock:

20 * 5 = $100

However, Adam only sells 60% of the inventory, so he still has 40% of the rocks left. To find the cost of the unsold rocks, we need to calculate 40% of the total cost:

40% of $100 = 0.4 * 100 = $40

The total cost of the unsold rocks is $40, but since Adam already spent $100, we can subtract the revenue from the total cost to find the total loss:

Total loss = Total cost - Revenue
Total loss = $100 - $84
Total loss = $16

However, this is not the final answer because we need to add the cost of the unsold rocks to the loss. The total loss is the sum of the loss from selling 60% of the inventory and the cost of the remaining 40% of the inventory:

Total loss = $16 + $40
Total loss = $56

The final answer is: $56"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of days it takes Lauren to complete each type of picture scene. 

First, let's find the number of days it takes Lauren to complete each type of picture scene:

- Large-sized picture scenes: 45 / 5 = 9 days
- Medium-sized picture scenes: 36 / 6 = 6 days
- Small-sized picture scenes: 49 / 7 = 7 days

Now, we need to find the LCM of 9, 6, and 7. 

The prime factorization of 6 is 2 * 3.
The prime factorization of 7 is 7.
The prime factorization of 9 is 3^2.

To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the numbers:
- The highest power of 2 is 2^1 (from 6).
- The highest power of 3 is 3^2 (from 9).
- The highest power of 7 is 7^1 (from 7).

The LCM is 2^1 * 3^2 * 7^1 = 2 * 9 * 7 = 126.

Therefore, it will take Lauren 126 days to complete all the picture scenes.

"To find out how much Jen spends on food for her fish in May, we need to calculate the total cost of food for a month. 

First, we need to determine the number of days in May. May has 31 days. 

Since each fish needs $1 worth of food a day, and Jen has 3 fish, the daily cost of food for all her fish is 3 * $1 = $3.

To find the total cost for the month, we multiply the daily cost by the number of days in May: $3 * 31 = $93.

So, Jen spends $93 on food for her fish in May.

"To find out how many roses Patricia has now, we need to first determine how many roses she had after giving some to her mother. 

Initially, Patricia had 30 roses. She gave 24 roses to her mother, so we subtract 24 from 30 to find out how many roses she had left: 30 - 24 = 6.

Then, Patricia bought 15 more roses. To find the total number of roses she has now, we add the 15 new roses to the 6 she had left: 6 + 15 = 21.

So, Patricia now has 21 roses.

The final answer is: 21"
"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken. 

The total distance traveled is the sum of the two distances: 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles.

The total time taken is the sum of the two times: 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours.

Now, we can calculate the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time: 

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
Average speed = 250 miles / 5 hours
Average speed = 50 miles per hour

"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning. 

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which is 0.2 in decimal form. 

The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability is 3 times 0.2, which is 0.6.

To find the probability of both tickets winning, we multiply the probabilities: 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many seashells Carrey collected. Let's denote the number of seashells Carrey collected as 'x'. Since Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, Carlos collected 2x seashells. We are given that Jim collected 5 more than Carlos, so Jim collected 2x + 5 seashells.

We know that the total number of seashells collected is the sum of the seashells collected by each person: x + 2x + (2x + 5) = 5x + 5.

Since they divided the seashells equally among themselves, the total number of seashells is also equal to 3 times the number of seashells each person got: (5x + 5) = 3y, where y is the number of seashells each person got.

Now, we can solve for y: 
(5x + 5) = 3y
5x + 5 = 3y
5x = 3y - 5
x = (3y - 5) / 5

We also know that the total number of seashells collected by Jim is 27, which is 2x + 5. So, we can set up the equation:
2x + 5 = 27
2x = 22
x = 11

Now that we know x, we can find y:
x = (3y - 5) / 5
11 = (3y - 5) / 5
55 = 3y - 5
60 = 3y
20 = y

So, each person got 20 seashells.

The final answer is: 20"

"To find the length of Carl's cane, we need to determine Carl's height first. We know that Isabel is 7 feet tall and Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel. 

Isabel's height = 7 feet
Ned's height = Isabel's height - 2 feet
Ned's height = 7 - 2
Ned's height = 5 feet

Since Carl is one foot taller than Ned, we can calculate Carl's height as follows:
Carl's height = Ned's height + 1 foot
Carl's height = 5 + 1
Carl's height = 6 feet

We are given that Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. To find the length of the cane, we can divide Carl's height by 2:
Cane's length = Carl's height / 2
Cane's length = 6 / 2
Cane's length = 3 feet

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of bottles required to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, and then subtract the number of bottles Hortex can currently produce.

First, let's find out how many bottles are needed to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people. Since each bottle covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand, we need to find out how many bottles are needed for 2300 people.

Since 20% of one person's energy demand is covered by one bottle, 100% of one person's energy demand is covered by 100/20 = 5 bottles.

For 2300 people, we need 5 * 2300 = 11500 bottles.

Hortex can currently produce 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many more bottles they need to produce, we subtract the number of bottles they can currently produce from the total number of bottles needed:

11500 - 4200 = 7300

So, Hortex would need to produce 7300 more bottles to be able to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how many babies are wearing purple and blue. Since Carla has 8 babies and 3/4 of them are wearing purple, we can calculate the number of purple-wearers as follows:

Number of purple-wearers = 3/4 * 8 = 6

Since 1/4 of the babies are wearing blue, we can calculate the number of blue-wearers as follows:

Number of blue-wearers = 1/4 * 8 = 2

Now, let's find out how many babies are wearing bows. We know that all the blue-wearers are wearing bows, which is 2 babies. Additionally, 1/3 of the purple-wearers are also wearing bows. We can calculate the number of purple-wearers wearing bows as follows:

Number of purple-wearers wearing bows = 1/3 * 6 = 2

Now, we need to find the total number of babies wearing bows. This is the sum of the blue-wearers and the purple-wearers wearing bows:

Total number of babies wearing bows = 2 (blue-wearers) + 2 (purple-wearers wearing bows) = 4

To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to divide the number of purple-wearers wearing bows by the total number of babies wearing bows and multiply by 100:

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how much land Abraham sold in the first two transactions. He initially had 80 square meters of land. He sold half of it for $50, which means he sold 80 / 2 = 40 square meters. Then, he sold 1/4 of the remaining land, which is 80 - 40 = 40 square meters. 1/4 of 40 is 10 square meters. So, in total, he sold 40 + 10 = 50 square meters in the first two transactions.

Now, let's find out how much land is left. He initially had 80 square meters and sold 50 square meters, so he has 80 - 50 = 30 square meters left.

He sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, the total amount he earned from the remaining land is 30 * 3 = $90.

Now, let's calculate the total amount he earned from the first two transactions. He sold 40 square meters for $50, and 10 square meters for $30. So, the total amount he earned from the first two transactions is $50 + $30 = $80.

13 - 10 = 3

Geb is 3 years old."
"To find out how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to first determine how many face masks he uses in a day. 

Since Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out and he goes out three times a day, the total number of face masks he uses in a day is 2 * 3 = 6.

Now, to find out how many face masks he uses in 2 days, we multiply the number of face masks he uses in a day by 2. 

6 * 2 = 12

So, Tyrion uses 12 face masks every 2 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many eggs each person found and then subtract that from the total number of eggs hidden.

Lamar finds 5 eggs. 
Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 5 * 2 = 10 eggs.
Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up the number of eggs found by each person: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

There were 3 dozen eggs hidden initially, which is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

To find out how many eggs are still hidden, we subtract the number of eggs found from the total number of eggs: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the total amount John makes in a week, we first need to determine the number of apartments in each complex and the total number of collections he makes in a week.

The first two apartment complexes have 200 apartments each, so the total number of apartments in these two complexes is 2 * 200 = 400.

The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, which means it is 160% of the other two combined (100% + 60% = 160%). To find the number of apartments in the last complex, we multiply the total number of apartments in the first two complexes by 1.6 (which is the same as 160% or 160/100).

Number of apartments in the last complex = 400 * 1.6 = 640

Total number of apartments = 400 + 640 = 1040

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so the total number of collections he makes in a week is 3 * 1040 = 3120.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection for each apartment, so the total amount he makes in a week is 3120 * $0.40 = $1248.

The final answer is: $1248"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of fruits produced by the tree in each year and then sum them up.

In the first year, the tree produces 0 fruits (since it's a 5-year-old tree, but we're considering the year it was planted).

In the second year, the tree is 6 years old and produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits, which is 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.

In the third year, the tree is 7 years old and produces 7 times the initial amount of fruits, which is 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.

In the fourth year, the tree is 8 years old and produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits. So, an 8-year-old tree produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

In the fifth year, the tree is 9 years old and doesn't produce any fruits.

In the sixth year, the tree is 10 years old and produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

In the seventh year, the tree is 11 years old, but we're not given any information about its production, so we'll assume it produces 0 fruits.

In the eighth year, the tree is 12 years old, but we're not given any information about its production, so we'll assume it produces 0 fruits.

In the ninth year, the tree is 13 years old, but we're not given any information about its production, so we'll assume it produces 0 fruits.

In the tenth year, the tree is 14 years old, but we're not given any information about its production, so we'll assume it produces 0 fruits.

Now, let's sum up the total number of fruits produced by the tree in each year:

Year 1: 0
Year 2: 150
Year 3: 350
Year 4: 800
Year 5: 0
Year 6: 1000
Year 7: 0
Year 8: 0
Year 9: 0
Year 10: 0

Total fruits = 0 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 2200

"To find out how much money Jack has now, we need to calculate the amount Sophia gave him and add it to his initial amount.

Sophia gave Jack 1/5 of her $100. To find 1/5 of $100, we multiply $100 by 1/5, which is the same as dividing $100 by 5.

$100 / 5 = $20

So, Sophia gave Jack $20. Now, we add this to Jack's initial $100.

$100 + $20 = $120

Jack now has $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as B, the length of the red rope as R, and the length of the yellow rope as Y. We are given that R = 4B and B = Y - 7.

We can express Y in terms of B as Y = B + 7.

We are also given that the combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so R + B + Y = 37.

Substituting R = 4B and Y = B + 7 into the equation R + B + Y = 37, we get 4B + B + B + 7 = 37.

Combine like terms to get 6B + 7 = 37.

Subtract 7 from both sides to get 6B = 30.

Divide both sides by 6 to get B = 5.

Now that we know B = 5, we can find R by substituting B into R = 4B, which gives R = 4 * 5 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's assume Ronnie was given x dollars. Since Rissa was given thrice as much, Rissa was given 3x dollars.

After giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, Ronnie is left with x - y dollars and Rissa is left with 3x - y dollars, where y is the amount they each gave to their little sister.

We are given that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, so we can set up the equation:

3x - y = (4/5)(3x)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3x - y = 12x/5

Multiplying both sides by 5 to eliminate the fraction, we get:

15x - 5y = 12x

Subtracting 12x from both sides, we get:

3x - 5y = 0

Now, we need to find the amount of money Ronnie has left. We know that Ronnie gave y dollars to their little sister, so Ronnie is left with x - y dollars.

We can express y in terms of x from the equation 3x - 5y = 0:

3x - 5y = 0
-5y = -3x
y = 3x/5

Now, substitute y = 3x/5 into the expression for Ronnie's remaining money:

Ronnie's remaining money = x - y
= x - 3x/5
= (5x - 3x)/5
= 2x/5

We are given that Ronnie was given $5 initially, so x = 5. Substitute x = 5 into the expression for Ronnie's remaining money:

Ronnie's remaining money = 2x/5
= 2(5)/5
= 10/5
= 2

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the amount of red, white, and purple paint as 'r'. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, the total amount of these three colors is 3r.

We know that half the mural is yellow, so the amount of yellow paint is 12 / 2 = 6 pints.

The total amount of paint used in the mural is 12 pints, which is the sum of the red, white, purple, and yellow paint. We can write this as an equation:

3r + 6 = 12

To solve for 'r', we need to isolate 'r' on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 6 from both sides:

3r = 12 - 6
3r = 6

Now, we can divide both sides by 3 to find the value of 'r':

r = 6 / 3
r = 2

Since 'r' represents the amount of red, white, and purple paint, and we know that there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple, the amount of red paint is also 2 pints.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house, then add them together.

First, let's find the area of one bedroom: 
Area of one bedroom = length * width = 20 * 12 = 240 square feet.

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms = 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area = 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is given as 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas together: 
Total area = area of bedrooms + area of living room + area of the rest of the house
Total area = 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.

The final answer is: 3160"

On Wednesday, she saw double the number of clouds as Tuesday, which is 6 * 2 = 12 clouds.
On Thursday, she saw double the number of clouds as Wednesday, which is 12 * 2 = 24 clouds.
On Friday, she saw double the number of clouds as Thursday, which is 24 * 2 = 48 clouds.

Now, let's add up the number of clouds she saw each day: 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93.

"To find out how many dishwashing cycles you can run with the new box for $1, we first need to determine how many pods are in the new box. 

The new box has 20% more pods than the regular box. To find 20% of 100, we multiply 100 by 0.2, which is 20. So, the new box has 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Now, we know that the new box costs $12 and has 120 pods. To find out how many pods you can buy for $1, we divide the total number of pods by the cost: 120 pods / $12 = 10 pods per dollar.

Since you use 1 pod per cycle, you can run 10 dishwashing cycles for $1 with the new box. 

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. This means he has 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he has 50 - 10 = 40 bills left.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill, which means he uses 40 / 2 = 20 bills. This leaves him with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

4. Thomas then triples his money. Since each bill is worth $20, tripling his money means each bill is now worth $60. So, he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills, but each is worth $60.

5. To find the total amount of money he has, we multiply the number of bills by the value of each bill: 60 * $60 = $3600.

6. He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. To find out how many 5 dollar bills he has, we divide the total amount of money by the value of each 5 dollar bill: $3600 / $5 = 720.

The final answer is: 720"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals in the first half.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B in the second half, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

Now, let's calculate the total number of goals scored by each team in the match. In the first half, team A scored 4 goals and team B scored 2 goals. In the second half, team A scored 2 goals and team B scored 8 goals.

Total goals scored by team A = 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals
Total goals scored by team B = 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

The total number of goals scored in the match is the sum of the goals scored by both teams, which is 6 + 10 = 16.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much chalk the teacher has left after Monday and then determine how many days it will last.

The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk. He uses 45% of it on Monday, so we need to find 45% of 5 inches.

45% of 5 inches = 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches

This means the teacher has 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches of chalk left after Monday.

Now, we need to find out how many days the remaining chalk will last when the teacher uses 20% of it each day.

Let's assume the number of days the chalk will last is 'x'. Then, 20% of 2.75 inches will be used each day.

20% of 2.75 inches = 0.20 * 2.75 = 0.55 inches

Since the teacher uses 0.55 inches each day, the total amount of chalk used in 'x' days will be 0.55x.

The total amount of chalk left after 'x' days will be 2.75 - 0.55x.

Since the teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches, we need to find the number of days 'x' when 2.75 - 0.55x < 2.

Solving the inequality, we get:
2.75 - 0.55x < 2
0.55x > 2.75 - 2
0.55x > 0.75
x > 0.75 / 0.55
x > 1.36

Since 'x' represents the number of days, it must be a whole number. Therefore, the teacher will have to recycle the chalk after 2 days.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Colin's current age as C and Wendy's current age as W.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:
W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:
C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:
C + 25 = (5/3)(C + 7)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:
75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:
40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2:
20 = C

"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we first need to determine the total number of books he can buy with $27000. 

Since he can buy 100 books for $500, we can find the total number of books by dividing the total amount spent ($27000) by the cost per 100 books ($500).

Total number of books = Total amount spent / Cost per 100 books
Total number of books = $27000 / $500
Total number of books = 54

Now that we know Bob can buy a total of 54 books, we can find out how many books he can buy per school by dividing the total number of books by the number of schools (3).

Books per school = Total number of books / Number of schools
Books per school = 54 / 3
Books per school = 18

3. He put all but one of the new apples in his pocket, leaving 1 apple on the ground. So, he now has 6 (in his pocket) + 1 (on the ground) = 7 apples.
4. He threw the remaining apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out. Now, he has 7 apples (in his pocket) + 6 new apples = 13 apples.
5. He picked up all the remaining apples, which is 13 apples.

Therefore, Newton brought home 13 apples.

6 friends * 6 slices per friend = 36 slices

Next, let's calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten by Kate's friends: 
6 friends * 4 slices per friend = 24 slices

Since the cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices and the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, we need to find out how many whole pizzas are needed for each type. 

For the cheese pizza: 
36 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas

For the pepperoni pizza: 
24 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas

Since Kate needs to buy whole pizzas, she needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas. 

To find the total number of pizzas Kate needs to buy, we add the number of cheese pizzas and pepperoni pizzas: 
3 cheese pizzas + 3 pepperoni pizzas = 6 pizzas

"To solve this problem, we need to find the net rate at which Jay is building snowballs. 

Jay builds 20 snowballs in 1 hour, which is equivalent to 60 minutes. So, his rate of building snowballs is 20/60 = 1/3 snowballs per minute.

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. To find the rate at which snowballs melt, we divide the number of snowballs that melt by the time it takes for them to melt: 2/15 snowballs per minute.

Now, we need to find the net rate at which Jay is building snowballs. This is the rate at which he builds snowballs minus the rate at which they melt: (1/3) - (2/15) = (5/15) - (2/15) = 3/15 = 1/5 snowballs per minute.

Since Jay wants to have 60 snowballs, and he is building snowballs at a net rate of 1/5 per minute, we can find the time it will take him to build 60 snowballs by dividing the total number of snowballs by the net rate: 60 / (1/5) = 60 * 5 = 300 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how old Jim was 20 years ago, when Digimon first came out. Since John is 28 now, we can subtract 20 from his current age to find his age at that time.

John's age 20 years ago = 28 - 20 = 8

Since John was twice as old as Jim 20 years ago, we can set up an equation to find Jim's age at that time:

John's age 20 years ago = 2 * Jim's age 20 years ago
8 = 2 * Jim's age 20 years ago

To find Jim's age 20 years ago, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

Jim's age 20 years ago = 8 / 2
Jim's age 20 years ago = 4

Now, to find Jim's current age, we add 20 to his age 20 years ago:

Jim's current age = Jim's age 20 years ago + 20
Jim's current age = 4 + 20
Jim's current age = 24

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given. 

Let's start with the third day. They used half a pack of bandages, which is 25 bandages (since a pack has 50 bandages). They had 78 bandages left, so they must have had 78 + 25 = 103 bandages before using half a pack.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which means they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. They ordered one pack of bandages on the first day, so they had 50 bandages after using 38. On the second day, they had 50 + 50 = 100 bandages before using 28. 

Now, we know they had 103 bandages before the second day and 100 bandages before the second day. Since they didn't order any bandages on the second day, the difference in the number of bandages must be due to the usage on the first day. So, they used 103 - 100 = 3 more bandages on the first day than the second day.

We already know they used 38 bandages on the first day. Since they used 3 more bandages on the first day than the second day, they used 38 - 3 = 35 bandages on the second day. 

Now, we know they used 28 bandages on the second day, which is 7 less than 35. This confirms our previous calculation.

To find the initial number of bandages, we need to add the bandages used on the first day to the bandages ordered on the first day. They used 38 bandages and ordered 50, so they had 38 + 50 = 88 bandages at the start of the first day.

Since Alain's mom bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens, the number of black pens is 2 * 25 = 50.

The total number of pens Alain has is the sum of red and black pens, which is 25 + 50 = 75.

The final answer is: 75"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the cost of the scotch and the cognac separately, and then add them together.

The cost of the scotch is $600 for 10 bottles, so the cost per bottle is $600 / 10 = $60.

Since John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The cost of the cognac is 50% more than the scotch, so the cost per bottle of cognac is $60 + ($60 * 0.5) = $90.

The total cost of the cognac is 20 * $90 = $1800.

The total amount John spends on everything is the cost of the scotch plus the cost of the cognac: $600 + $1800 = $2400.

The final answer is: $2400"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees. He also planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which means he planted 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, making it a total of 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than he planted on the first day. Since he planted 40 Lodgepole Pine trees on the first day, 1/4 of that is 40 * 1/4 = 10. So, he planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day.

To find the total number of trees planted in the two days, we need to add the number of White Oak and Lodgepole Pine trees planted on both days. 

Total White Oak trees = 20 (first day) + 10 (second day) = 30
Total Lodgepole Pine trees = 40 (first day) + 50 (second day) = 90

Total number of trees = Total White Oak trees + Total Lodgepole Pine trees = 30 + 90 = 120

The final answer is: 120"
"To find out how much root beer was available for each person to drink, we need to calculate the total amount of root beer remaining after all the incidents.

Initially, Fred made 24 gallons of root beer.

On the first day, 4 gallons were consumed by his children, so the remaining amount is:
24 - 4 = 20 gallons

On the second day, 7 gallons were spilled, so the remaining amount is:
20 - 7 = 13 gallons

On the third day, 5 gallons were consumed by Ronnie, so the remaining amount is:
13 - 5 = 8 gallons

On the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party, and they shared the remaining root beer equally. To find out how much each person got, we need to divide the remaining amount by 3:
8 / 3 = 2.67 gallons

So, each person got approximately 2.67 gallons of root beer to drink during the party.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2.67}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge as 'x'. 

The problem states that eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be translated into the equation: 4x + 8 = 40.

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate the variable. First, we'll subtract 8 from both sides of the equation: 4x = 40 - 8.

This simplifies to: 4x = 32.

Next, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for 'x': x = 32 / 4.

x = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the number of fish with red stripes, we first need to calculate one-third of the total number of fish. 

One-third of 66 is 66 / 3 = 22. 

So, 22 fish have red stripes. 

Now, we need to find the number of fish that do not have red stripes. 

The number of fish without red stripes is 66 - 22 = 44.

Now, we need to find 5/11 of the remaining fish that have blue stripes. 

5/11 of 44 is (5/11) * 44 = 20.

So, 20 fish have blue stripes.

Now, we need to find the total number of fish with red and blue stripes. 

The total number of fish with red and blue stripes is 22 + 20 = 42.

The final answer is: 42"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Amy had 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each, so she had 2 * 4 = 8 eyeshadow colors from the palettes.

She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 eyeshadow colors each, so she had 3 * 6 = 18 eyeshadow colors from the makeup sets.

In total, Amy had 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors.

Her sister stole one of the palettes, which means Amy lost 4 eyeshadow colors (since each palette has 4 colors).

Now, Amy has 26 - 4 = 22 eyeshadow colors left.

Amy then used up half of the colors from one makeup set. Since each makeup set has 6 eyeshadow colors, half of that is 6 / 2 = 3 eyeshadow colors.

So, Amy used up 3 eyeshadow colors from the makeup set.

Now, Amy has 22 - 3 = 19 eyeshadow colors left.

The final answer is: 19"
"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to break down the information given.

First, we know Mattison's height is 60 inches. His two-story house is 7 times as high as he is, so the total height of the house is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.

The first floor's floor to ceiling height is thrice as high as Mattison, which is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

Since the total height of the house is 420 inches and the first floor's height is 180 inches, the height of the second floor is 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

The height of the roof from the second floor's floor is the same as the height of the second floor, which is 240 inches.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the number of shells found by team Alphas, we need to calculate 40% of 700. 

40% of 700 = 0.4 * 700 = 280 shells.

Now, we need to find the number of shells remaining after team Alphas found their share. 

Remaining shells = Total shells - Shells found by Alphas
= 700 - 280
= 420 shells.

Next, we need to find the number of shells found by team The finders, which is 60% of the remaining shells.

60% of 420 = 0.6 * 420 = 252 shells.

Now, we need to find the number of shells found by team Gogetters. This is the remaining shells after team The finders found their share.

Shells found by Gogetters = Remaining shells - Shells found by The finders
= 420 - 252
= 168 shells.

"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we first need to calculate the total miles all the dogs need to walk in a day. Since there are 4 dogs and they need to walk an average of 3 miles per day, the total miles they need to walk is 4 * 3 = 12 miles.

Now, let's add up the miles the first three dogs need to walk: 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles.

To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the miles the first three dogs need to walk from the total miles: 12 - 8 = 4 miles.

The last dog needs to walk 4 miles."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount John borrowed and then the amount he used to pay off his debts.

First, let's calculate the amount John borrowed. He borrowed 40% of his house's worth, which is $250,000. 

40% of $250,000 = 0.4 * $250,000 = $100,000

Next, John used 60% of the borrowed amount to pay off his debts. 

60% of $100,000 = 0.6 * $100,000 = $60,000

Now, we need to find out how much money John had leftover after paying off his debts. To do this, we subtract the amount he used to pay off his debts from the amount he borrowed.

Amount leftover = Amount borrowed - Amount used to pay off debts
Amount leftover = $100,000 - $60,000
Amount leftover = $40,000

The final answer is: $40,000"
"To find the total earnings, we need to calculate the total weight of the tunas first. 

The total weight of the tunas is the sum of their individual weights: 
56 kg + 46 kg + 26 kg = 128 kg

Since a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, we multiply the total weight by the cost per kilogram to find the total earnings:
128 kg * $0.50/kg = $64

The final answer is: $64"
"To find Trinity's profit, we need to first find the selling price of the magazines. 

The cost price of the magazines is $72. Trinity sells the magazines at 11/8 of the cost price. 

To find the selling price, we multiply the cost price by 11/8:
Selling price = (11/8) * 72
Selling price = (11 * 72) / 8
Selling price = 792 / 8
Selling price = 99

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the cost price from the selling price:
Profit = Selling price - Cost price
Profit = 99 - 72
Profit = 27

The final answer is: $27"
"To find the total amount of water removed, we need to calculate the amount of water removed by each setting and then add them together.

The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed by the low setting is 1 * 3 = 3 liters.

The medium setting removes twice as much water as the low setting, which is 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed by the medium setting is 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

The high setting removes twice as much water as the medium setting, which is 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 5 days, the total amount of water removed by the high setting is 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

Now, we add the total amount of water removed by each setting: 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

"To find out how many balloons were thrown, we need to first calculate the total number of balloons Jolene and her friends had initially. Since they filled up 10 packs of balloons with 30 balloons per pack, the total number of balloons is 10 * 30 = 300.

Since 12 balloons were left by the end of the afternoon, we can subtract this from the total number of balloons to find out how many were thrown. 

300 - 12 = 288

So, Jolene and her friends threw 288 balloons.

"To find the total amount of the second medicine, we need to calculate 3 times the amount of the first medicine. 

The first medicine is 14 mL, so 3 times that amount is 3 * 14 = 42 mL.

Now, we need to find the total amount of both medicines in one dose. The first medicine is 14 mL, and the second medicine is 42 mL, so the total amount in one dose is 14 + 42 = 56 mL.

To find the total amount in 8 doses, we multiply the amount in one dose by 8. 

56 mL * 8 = 448 mL.

The final answer is: 448"
"To find the combined capacity of both schools, we first need to determine the capacity of John's school. 

Since each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, and Ali's class has 120 students, we can find the capacity of one of John's classes by multiplying 120 by 1/8.

Capacity of one of John's classes = 120 * (1/8) = 15 students

Since John has two classes, we multiply the capacity of one class by 2 to find the total capacity of John's school.

Capacity of John's school = 15 * 2 = 30 students

Now, we add the capacity of Ali's school (which is 120 students) to the capacity of John's school to find the combined capacity of both schools.

Combined capacity = 120 + 30 = 150

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total interest Stephen owes his sister and then subtract the total amount he paid in the 11 months from the total amount he borrowed plus the interest.

First, let's calculate the total interest Stephen owes his sister. The interest is 2% of the $300 he borrowed, which is 0.02 * 300 = $6.

Now, let's calculate the total amount Stephen will pay in the 11 months. He will pay $25 per month for 11 months, so the total amount he will pay in the 11 months is 25 * 11 = $275.

The total amount Stephen owes his sister, including the interest, is $300 + $6 = $306.

Now, let's calculate the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month. This is the total amount he owes, minus the total amount he paid in the 11 months: $306 - $275 = $31.

"To find the total number of jelly beans in the jar, we first need to calculate the volume of the jar. The jar has a square base with a side length of 6 inches and a height of 15 inches. The volume of a rectangular prism (such as the jar) is given by the formula V = lwh, where l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height.

Given that the base is square, the length and width are the same, so we can use the formula V = s^2h, where s is the side length of the square base.

V = s^2h
V = 6^2 * 15
V = 36 * 15
V = 540 cubic inches

Since the jelly beans are packed with 80% efficiency, we need to divide the volume of the jar by 0.8 to get the total volume that can be occupied by the jelly beans.

Total volume for jelly beans = 540 / 0.8
Total volume for jelly beans = 675 cubic inches

Since each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, we can divide the total volume for jelly beans by the volume of a single jelly bean to get the total number of jelly beans.

Total number of jelly beans = 675 / 0.15
Total number of jelly beans = 4500

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we can multiply the total number of jelly beans by 0.3 to get the number of red jelly beans.

Number of red jelly beans = 4500 * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 1350

However, we are given that the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find out how far off Tim's guess was, we need to know what his guess was. Since we don't have that information, we can't calculate the exact difference. 

However, we can calculate the ratio of the true number of red jelly beans to the estimated number of red jelly beans. 

Ratio = True number of red jelly beans / Estimated number of red jelly beans
Ratio = 900 / 1350
Ratio = 0.6667

This means that Tim's guess was 1 / 0.6667 = 1.5 times the true number of red jelly beans."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, the bus had 20 people. 

At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus became 20 + 40 = 60.

At the second stop, 3/4 of the people who entered at the first stop entered the bus. Since 40 people entered at the first stop, 3/4 * 40 = 30 people entered at the second stop. So, the total number of people on the bus became 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus became 2 * 90 = 180.

The bus has a capacity of 200 people. To find the remaining spaces, we subtract the current number of people from the capacity: 200 - 180 = 20.

The total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is 20."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of Pauline's visits over the 8 years.

First, let's calculate the cost of the visits for the first 5 years. Since the cost of one visit is $2, the total cost for 5 years is:
5 years * 3 visits/year * $2/visit = $30

Now, let's calculate the new cost of one visit after the 150% increase. The new cost is:
$2 + ($2 * 150%) = $2 + $3 = $5

The cost of one visit for the next 3 years is $5. The total cost for the next 3 years is:
3 years * 3 visits/year * $5/visit = $45

The total cost for all 8 years is the sum of the cost for the first 5 years and the cost for the next 3 years:
$30 + $45 = $75

"To find out how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to determine the total number of groups required and then multiply that by the time it takes for each group to try the escape room.

There are 4 grades (4-7) with 10 students in each grade, so the total number of students is 4 * 10 = 40.

Since only the top 10 students in each grade get to try the escape room, we need to find the total number of students who will try the escape room. Since there are 4 grades, we need to find the total number of students who will try the escape room in each grade, which is 10 students per grade. So, the total number of students who will try the escape room is 4 * 10 = 40.

However, only 8 students can try the escape room at a time. To find the total number of groups, we divide the total number of students who will try the escape room by 8: 40 / 8 = 5.

Since each group uses their full 45 minutes, the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room is the number of groups multiplied by the time per group: 5 * 45 = 225 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length can be represented as 4x.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, and it is divided into two pieces. Therefore, the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is equal to 40 feet. We can write this as an equation:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Now, divide both sides by 5 to solve for x:

x = 40 / 5
x = 8

Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, we can find its length by multiplying x by 4:

Longer piece = 4x
Longer piece = 4 * 8
Longer piece = 32

"To determine how much seasoning Aiden will need, we first need to find out how many pounds of ground beef he will use. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat and he wants to make 80 meatballs, we can divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound to find the total pounds of meat needed.

Total meatballs needed = 80
Meatballs per pound = 16

Total pounds of meat = Total meatballs needed / Meatballs per pound
Total pounds of meat = 80 / 16
Total pounds of meat = 5

Now that we know Aiden needs 5 pounds of ground beef, we can find out how much seasoning he will need. He uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat.

Total pounds of meat = 5
Seasoning per pound = 2 tablespoons

Total seasoning needed = Total pounds of meat * Seasoning per pound
Total seasoning needed = 5 * 2
Total seasoning needed = 10

Total width of windows = 175 inches

Since Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, we need to multiply the total width by 2.

Fabric needed = 2 * Total width of windows
Fabric needed = 2 * 175
Fabric needed = 350 inches

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of treats Carly made. Since each person gets two treats and there are five people in the class, the total number of treats is 2 * 5 = 10.

Let's denote the number of cupcakes as C and the number of brownies as B. We are given that Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, so we can write an equation: B = 3C - 2.

We also know that the total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, so we can write another equation: C + B = 10.

Substituting the expression for B from the first equation into the second equation, we get: C + (3C - 2) = 10.

Combine like terms: 4C - 2 = 10.

Add 2 to both sides: 4C = 12.

Divide both sides by 4: C = 3.

"To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the 20% discount. 

The original cost of both manicure and pedicure is $35 + $40 = $75. 

The 20% discount on $75 is 0.20 * $75 = $15. 

So, the discounted cost of both manicure and pedicure is $75 - $15 = $60.

Since Karen wants to add nail art on each of her fingers, and there are 10 fingers in total (5 on each hand), the cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost for Karen would be the discounted cost of manicure and pedicure plus the cost of nail art, which is $60 + $30 = $90.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given. We know that Samantha has 27 paintings and that she has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley. 

Let's denote the number of paintings Shelley has as S. Since Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, we can write an equation: S - 12 = 27. 

To find the number of paintings Shelley has, we need to solve for S. Adding 12 to both sides of the equation gives us S = 27 + 12 = 39.

Now that we know Shelley has 39 paintings, we can find out how many paintings Kim has. We know that Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as K. We can write an equation: K + 8 = 39.

To find the number of paintings Kim has, we need to solve for K. Subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation gives us K = 39 - 8 = 31.

"To find the price of the toy after the discount in January, we need to calculate the price after the increase in December and then apply the decrease in January.

The initial price of the toy in November is $40.

In December, the price increased by 80%. To find the new price, we multiply the initial price by 1.8 (100% + 80% = 180%, or 1 + 0.8 = 1.8).

Price in December = $40 * 1.8 = $72

In January, the price decreased by 50%. To find the new price, we multiply the price in December by 0.5 (100% - 50% = 50%, or 1 - 0.5 = 0.5).

Price in January = $72 * 0.5 = $36

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many pomelos Eve gave away. Let's start by identifying the information given:

- Eve originally had 20 pieces of pomelos.
- After giving some away, she is left with 1/4 of the pomelos she originally had.

Since Eve is left with 1/4 of the original amount, we can set up an equation to find out how many pomelos she gave away. Let's denote the number of pomelos she gave away as 'x'. 

The equation can be set up as follows: 
Original amount - x = 1/4 * Original amount

We know the original amount is 20, so we can plug that in:
20 - x = 1/4 * 20

Simplifying the equation:
20 - x = 5

To find 'x', we need to isolate it:
x = 20 - 5
x = 15

So, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

60 * 2 = 120
120 / 5 = 24

So, Walter ate 24 apples. Now, we subtract 24 from the total number of apples to find the remaining number:

60 - 24 = 36

Walter then gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples. To find 25% of 36, we multiply 36 by 0.25:

36 * 0.25 = 9

So, Walter gave his sister 9 apples. Now, we subtract 9 from the remaining number to find the number of apples he had left:

36 - 9 = 27

Walter sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. To find the total amount of money he received, we multiply the number of apples by the price per apple:

27 * 3 = 81

The final answer is: $81"
"To find the total number of novels Regina wrote this year, we need to determine the total number of novels she wrote last year and then multiply it by 4 (since 3 quarters is equivalent to 3/4, and to find the whole, we multiply by 4/3).

Let's start by using the information given: Regina wrote 9 novels last year, which is 3 quarters of the number of novels she wrote this year. 

Let x be the total number of novels Regina wrote this year. 

We can set up the equation: 9 = (3/4)x

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 4/3 to isolate x:

x = 9 * (4/3)
x = 12

So, Regina wrote 12 novels this year.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total distance covered by Michael in 3 days, we need to calculate the distance he travels in one day and then multiply it by 3.

First, let's convert the speed from km/hr to km/day. Since there are 24 hours in a day, we multiply 50 km/hr by 24 hours to get the distance covered in a day:

50 km/hr * 24 hr/day = 1200 km/day

Now, we multiply the daily distance by 3 to get the total distance covered in 3 days:

1200 km/day * 3 days = 3600 km

Now, we need to find the percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered. To do this, we divide the distance covered by Michael by the total distance between Alaska and Texas and multiply by 100:

(3600 km / 6000 km) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is: 60"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many grapes were used by Madeline's brother and her mother, and then subtract that from the total number of grapes Madeline ate.

Madeline ate 6 grapes. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, so he used 6 * 5 = 30 grapes.

The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie requires 12 grapes. So, the total number of grapes used by her mother is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.

The total number of grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and her mother is 36 + 48 = 84 grapes.

To find the initial number of grapes, we need to add the grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and her mother to the grapes used by her mother to make the pies. However, since the grapes used by her mother are already included in the total, we only need to add the grapes used by Madeline and her brother. The initial number of grapes is 84 + 6 = 90.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the total number of teachers at school that day, we need to add the number of teachers who were sick and the number of substitute teachers. 

First, let's find the number of teachers who were not sick. There were 82 teachers in total, and 13 were sick. So, the number of teachers who were not sick is 82 - 13 = 69.

However, this includes the 9 substitute teachers. To find the total number of teachers at school that day, we need to add the 9 substitute teachers to the 69 teachers who were not sick. 

So, the total number of teachers at school that day is 69 + 9 = 78.

The final answer is: 78"
"To find out how much Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we need to calculate the total cost per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

The cost of pasta per week is $1.00.
The cost of cheddar cheese per week is $3.00.
The cost of gruyere cheese per week is $3.00 * 2 = $6.00.

The total cost per week is $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00 = $10.00.

There are 52 weeks in a year. 

The total cost per year is $10.00 * 52 = $520.00.

The final numerical answer is: $520.00"
"To find the total number of classrooms the custodian needs to clean, we already know that number is 80. 

The custodian has 5 days to clean the classrooms. We need to find out how many minutes they have to clean in total. Since they work 8 hours a day, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, they work 8 * 60 = 480 minutes per day.

In 5 days, they work a total of 5 * 480 = 2400 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how many minutes they spend cleaning per classroom. We already know that it takes them 15 minutes per classroom.

To find the total time spent cleaning, we multiply the number of classrooms by the time spent per classroom: 80 * 15 = 1200 minutes.

Now, we need to find the percentage of their day spent cleaning. To do this, we divide the total time spent cleaning by the total time available and multiply by 100: (1200 / 2400) * 100 = 50%.

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total capacity of each bookcase and then divide the total number of books by the capacity of each bookcase.

Let's start by finding the capacity of each shelf. 

The middle shelves can hold 10 books each. 
The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.
The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of a bookcase with 3 shelves:
Middle shelf 1: 10 books
Middle shelf 2: 10 books
Bottom shelf: 20 books
Top shelf: 15 books
Total capacity of a bookcase = 10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55 books

Since Elly has 110 books, we need to divide the total number of books by the capacity of each bookcase to find out how many bookcases she needs:
110 books / 55 books per bookcase = 2 bookcases

However, this is not the final answer because we need to consider the possibility of having a partial bookcase. If Elly has 110 books and each bookcase can hold 55 books, she will need 2 bookcases to hold 110 books, but she will have 10 books left over. 

To find the minimum number of bookcases needed, we can round up to the nearest whole number. In this case, we need 2 bookcases to hold 110 books.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find Rose's profit, we first need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

The cost of 5 dozens of eggs is 5 * $2.40 = $12.

Since 1 dozen has 12 eggs, 5 dozens will have 5 * 12 = 60 eggs.

Rose will sell each egg for $1, so the total revenue will be 60 * $1 = $60.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $60 - $12 = $48.

The final answer is: $48"
"To find the number of white hats, we first need to determine the number of red and blue hats. 

Half of the hats are red, so the number of red hats is 100 * 0.5 = 50.

The remaining hats are 100 - 50 = 50. 

3/5 of the remaining hats are blue, so the number of blue hats is 50 * (3/5) = 30.

The rest of the hats are white, so the number of white hats is 50 - 30 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the cost of each stick of jerky, we need to first calculate the total cost of the bag after the discount. 

The original price of the bag is $18.00, and there's a $3.00 discount. So, the discounted price is $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00.

Since there are 30 sticks in a bag, we can find the cost of each stick by dividing the total cost by the number of sticks: $15.00 ÷ 30 = $0.50.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.50 * 100 = 50 cents.

The final answer is: 50"
"To determine the total number of questions Audrey needs to answer correctly to move on to 7th grade, we first need to find the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly out of the total questions in both tests. 

The total number of questions in both tests is 70 + 40 = 110. To pass, she needs to answer 70% of 110 questions correctly. 

70% of 110 is calculated as 0.7 * 110 = 77. 

Now, let's find out how many questions she got right in the first test. She got 60% of 70 questions correct, which is 0.6 * 70 = 42.

To find out how many questions she needs to get right on the second test, we subtract the number of questions she got right in the first test from the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly. 

77 - 42 = 35.

So, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move onto 7th grade.

The final answer is: 35"
"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the number of strawberry cubes as 's' and the number of blueberry cubes as 'b'. We know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so we can write the equation:

s + b = 116

We also know that the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, so we can write another equation:

b = 5s - 4

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for 's':

s + (5s - 4) = 116

Combine like terms:

6s - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides:

6s = 120

Divide both sides by 6:

s = 20

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting 's' into the second equation:

b = 5(20) - 4
b = 100 - 4
b = 96

The final answer is: 96"
"To find the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years, we need to calculate the total number of games she has played and then multiply it by her score per game.

Ara has been playing 40 games every year for 4 years. So, the total number of games she has played is:
40 games/year * 4 years = 160 games

Since her score for every game is 21 points, we can multiply the total number of games by her score per game to find the total points:
160 games * 21 points/game = 3360 points

The final answer is: 3360"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Brendan had 10 marbles.

He dropped half of them, so he lost 10 / 2 = 5 marbles.

He found 3 marbles, but one of them was a bead, so he got rid of it. This means he was left with 3 - 1 = 2 marbles from the ones he found.

Now, let's add the marbles he found to the marbles he didn't lose. He didn't lose 5 marbles, so he still has 5 marbles left from the initial 10. 

So, the total number of marbles he has is 5 (the ones he didn't lose) + 2 (the ones he found) = 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. 

First, we know that for every 2 customers who come into the dealership, 1 will buy a car. So, to sell 15 cars, Jason needs 15 * 2 = 30 customers to come into the dealership.

Next, we know that for every 25 telephone calls, 1 customer comes into the dealership. So, to get 30 customers, Jason needs 30 * 25 = 750 telephone calls.

"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of flashlights and the number of candles separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of flashlights. There are 4 people in the family, and each person has a flashlight. So, the total number of flashlights is 4.

Next, let's calculate the number of candles. There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. 

Half of 8 rooms is 4 rooms. So, 4 rooms have 4 small candles each, which is 4 * 4 = 16 small candles. The other 4 rooms have 5 medium candles each, which is 4 * 5 = 20 medium candles. 

The total number of candles is 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles.

Now, we add the number of flashlights and the number of candles together. 4 flashlights + 36 candles = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find out how many chips each person gets, we need to first calculate the total number of chips Mitchell has. Since he buys two bags with 55 chips each, we multiply the number of bags by the number of chips per bag: 2 * 55 = 110 chips.

Next, we need to divide the total number of chips by the number of family members to find out how many chips each person gets: 110 chips / 5 family members = 22 chips per person.

"To find the total time it takes to solve the Rubik's cube, we need to calculate the time taken for each side and add them up.

The first side takes 5 minutes. 
The second and third sides each take twice that long, so 2 * 5 = 10 minutes each. 
The last two sides each take half as long as the first, so 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes each.

Now, let's add up the time for all sides: 
5 (first side) + 10 (second side) + 10 (third side) + 2.5 (fourth side) + 2.5 (fifth side) = 30 minutes.

"To find out how many calls Tim deals with in a day, we need to divide the total hours he spends at work by the time it takes to deal with a call. 

First, we convert the time it takes to deal with a call from minutes to hours: 15 minutes = 15/60 = 0.25 hours.

Now, we divide the total hours Tim spends at work by the time it takes to deal with a call: 6 hours / 0.25 hours = 24 calls per day.

To find out how many calls he deals with in a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of calls he deals with in a day by 5: 24 calls/day * 5 days = 120 calls.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time it takes for Phineas to cover the distance on land and in water separately, and then add them together.

Since Phineas needs to cover 200 yards, and half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, we can calculate the distance for each as follows:

Distance on land = 200 yards / 2 = 100 yards
Distance in water = 200 yards / 2 = 100 yards

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for Phineas to cover each distance:

Time on land = Distance on land / Speed on land = 100 yards / 20 yards/minute = 5 minutes
Time in water = Distance in water / Speed in water = 100 yards / 10 yards/minute = 10 minutes

Total time = Time on land + Time in water = 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes

"To find the total cost of the phone plan, we need to determine the cost of the additional phones and add it to the cost of the main phone.

Let's assume the cost of each additional phone is x. Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of the main phone is 2x.

We know that the main phone costs $20, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 20

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 20 / 2
x = 10

Now that we know the cost of each additional phone is $10, we can find the total cost of the additional phones. There are 4 additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is:

4x = 4 * 10
4x = 40

The total cost of the phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones:

Total cost = 20 + 40
Total cost = 60

"To find out how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to calculate the total number of doughnuts he sells in a day and then multiply it by the number of days in June.

Since Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day, and 1 dozen is equal to 12, we can calculate the total number of doughnuts he makes in a day as follows:

10 dozen * 12 doughnuts/dozen = 120 doughnuts/day

Since Derrick sells all the doughnuts, we can assume he sells 120 doughnuts every day.

June has 30 days. So, the total number of doughnuts Derrick sells in June is:

120 doughnuts/day * 30 days = 3600 doughnuts

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Derrick makes in June by multiplying the total number of doughnuts sold by the price per doughnut:

"To find the total cost of dry-cleaning, we need to calculate the cost for each type of item and then multiply it by the number of weeks.

The cost for blouses is $5.00 per blouse, and Alicia has 5 blouses. So, the weekly cost for blouses is 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

The cost for the skirt is $6.00 per skirt, and Alicia has 1 skirt. So, the weekly cost for the skirt is 1 * $6.00 = $6.00.

The cost for pants is $8.00 per pair, and Alicia has 2 pants. So, the weekly cost for pants is 2 * $8.00 = $16.00.

Now, we add the weekly costs for blouses, skirt, and pants to find the total weekly cost: $25.00 + $6.00 + $16.00 = $47.00.

Since Alicia needs to send her clothes to the dry cleaners for 5 weeks, we multiply the total weekly cost by 5: $47.00 * 5 = $235.00.

"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the total number of people he saw on the first three days and add it to the total number of people he saw on the remaining days.

On the first day, Conor saw 50 people.

On the second day, there were 20 more people than on the first day, so the number of people on the second day is 50 + 20 = 70.

On the third day, the number of people was twice the number on the second day, so the number of people on the third day is 2 * 70 = 140.

The total number of people on the first three days is 50 + 70 + 140 = 260.

Since there are 7 days in a week, and Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the remaining 4 days, the total number of people he saw on the remaining days is 60 * 4 = 240.

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 260 + 240 = 500.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of kernels that popped during each 30-second interval and then add the additional kernels that popped from residual heat.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped.

In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount popped, so 3 * 20 = 60 kernels popped.

In the next 30 seconds, four times the initial popping rate popped, so 4 * 20 = 80 kernels popped.

In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slowed down to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, so 0.5 * 80 = 40 kernels popped.

Now, we need to calculate the additional kernels that popped from residual heat. A quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds popped from residual heat, so 0.25 * 40 = 10 kernels.

To find the total number of kernels that popped, we add the kernels from each 30-second interval: 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210 kernels.

The final answer is: 210"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of lemonade Tim needs to make, including the extra gallon for Allen. Since Tim needs to make 4 gallons of regular lemonade and 1 extra gallon that is twice as tart, we can consider the extra gallon as 2 gallons of regular lemonade. 

So, in total, Tim needs to make 4 + 2 = 6 gallons of lemonade. 

Since each gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice, and 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the total number of lemons needed. 

6 gallons * 1 cup/gallon = 6 cups of lemon juice needed

Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the total number of lemons needed by multiplying the total cups of juice needed by 6.

6 cups * 6 lemons/cup = 36 lemons

Therefore, Tim will need 36 lemons.

"To find the total amount of dog food needed in a week, we need to calculate the daily consumption of both breeds and then multiply it by 7.

The German Shepherds consume 5 kilograms each per day, and there are 3 of them. So, their total daily consumption is 5 * 3 = 15 kilograms.

The Bulldogs consume 3 kilograms each per day, and there are 2 of them. So, their total daily consumption is 3 * 2 = 6 kilograms.

The total daily consumption of both breeds is 15 + 6 = 21 kilograms.

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7: 21 * 7 = 147 kilograms.

Therefore, the Kennel house will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week.

The final answer is: 147"
"To find the total number of animal legs on the farm, we need to calculate the total number of legs from both the 2-legged and 4-legged animals.

The 2-legged animals contribute 2 legs each, so the total number of legs from 2-legged animals is 10 * 2 = 20.

The 4-legged animals contribute 4 legs each, so the total number of legs from 4-legged animals is 15 * 4 = 60.

Now, we add the total number of legs from both types of animals to get the overall total: 20 + 60 = 80.

The total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm is 80 / 2 = 40.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance Elvis traveled in both directions and then find the difference between the two distances.

First, let's calculate the distance Elvis traveled west. Since he traveled for 5 hours at a speed of 18mph, we can use the formula: distance = speed * time. 

Distance traveled west = 18mph * 5 hours = 90 miles

Now, let's calculate the distance Elvis traveled east. He traveled for 8 hours at the same speed of 18mph.

Distance traveled east = 18mph * 8 hours = 144 miles

Since Elvis turned around and traveled back to his original position, the distance he is now from his house is the difference between the distance traveled east and the distance traveled west.

Distance from his house = Distance traveled east - Distance traveled west
= 144 miles - 90 miles
= 54 miles

The final answer is: 54"
"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year and subtract it from the initial value.

Initial value of the boat = $9000

First year depreciation: 30% of $9000 = 0.3 * $9000 = $2700
Value after first year = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Second year depreciation: 30% of $6300 = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890
Value after second year = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Third year depreciation: 20% of $4410 = 0.2 * $4410 = $882
Value after third year = $4410 - $882 = $3528

The final value of the boat after three years is $3528.

The final answer is: $3528"
"To find the number of pink candies, we first need to determine the number of orange and yellow candies. 

We are given that there are 54 red candies. Since there are twice as many orange candies as red candies, the number of orange candies is 2 * 54 = 108.

We are also given that there are half as many yellow candies as red candies. So, the number of yellow candies is 54 / 2 = 27.

Now, we know the total number of candies is 232. We can find the total number of non-pink candies by adding the number of red, orange, and yellow candies: 54 + 108 + 27 = 189.

To find the number of pink candies, we subtract the total number of non-pink candies from the total number of candies: 232 - 189 = 43.

The final answer is: 43"
"To find the total cost of the hotel and bus travels, we need to calculate the cost of the hotel and the cost of the bus trips separately and then add them together.

The cost of the hotel for 3 nights is 3 * $80 = $240.

The cost of one bus trip is 10% of the cost of one night at the hotel, which is 0.1 * $80 = $8.

Since Helen rode the bus 7 times, the total cost of the bus trips is 7 * $8 = $56.

The total cost of the hotel and bus travels is $240 + $56 = $296.

The final answer is: $296"
"To find out how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we first need to determine how many marbles Dallas received. We know that Dallas has 21 marbles after dropping 4, so he must have had 21 + 4 = 25 marbles initially.

Since Mazie gave the twins a total of 52 marbles, and Dallas received 25, we can find out how many marbles Darla received by subtracting 25 from 52.

52 (total marbles) - 25 (marbles given to Dallas) = 27

So, Mazie gave 27 marbles to Darla.

"To find the total weight of the car, luggage, and children, we need to add the individual weights together. 

Total weight = weight of the car + weight of luggage + weight of children
Total weight = 1200 pounds + 250 pounds + (2 * 75 pounds)
Total weight = 1200 pounds + 250 pounds + 150 pounds
Total weight = 1600 pounds

Since the force needed to move the car is 1% of the total weight, we need to calculate 1% of 1600 pounds.

Force needed = 1% * 1600 pounds
Force needed = 0.01 * 1600 pounds
Force needed = 16 pounds

"To determine the amount of crepe paper James needs, we need to calculate the perimeter of the backyard fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides. 

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2l + 2w, where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the length (l) is 20 feet and the width (w) is 15 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

P = 2(20) + 2(15)
P = 40 + 30
P = 70

So, James needs 70 feet of crepe paper to go around the entire fence.

The final answer is: 70"
"To find the average age of Mia and Emma, we first need to determine Emma's age. Since Mia is 40 years old and they are 16 years apart in age, we can calculate Emma's age by adding 16 to Mia's age.

Emma's age = Mia's age + 16
Emma's age = 40 + 16
Emma's age = 56

Now that we know both Mia's and Emma's ages, we can find the average of their ages by adding their ages and dividing by 2.

Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2
Average age = (40 + 56) / 2
Average age = 96 / 2
Average age = 48

"To find out how much feed is left after a week, we need to calculate the total amount of feed consumed by the pigs in a week and subtract that from the total amount of feed ordered.

First, let's calculate the daily feed consumption of the pigs. Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, so the total daily consumption per pig is 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.

Since Dexter has 5 pigs, the total daily consumption is 8 * 5 = 40 pounds.

In a week, there are 7 days, so the total weekly consumption is 40 * 7 = 280 pounds.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, so the amount left after a week is 300 - 280 = 20 pounds.

"To find out how many hot dogs John needs to buy, we first need to determine the total number of hot dogs required for the party. 

Since each guest will eat 2 hot dogs and there are 20 guests, the total number of hot dogs needed is 20 * 2 = 40 hot dogs.

However, John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party. So, the total number of hot dogs he needs to buy is 40 - 4 = 36 hot dogs.

Since a pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs and costs $2, we need to find out how many packs John needs to buy. 

To do this, we divide the total number of hot dogs needed by the number of hot dogs in a pack: 36 / 6 = 6.

Since each pack costs $2, the total amount John needs to spend on hot dogs is 6 * $2 = $12.

Initially, there are 5 children following the truck.

On the second street, each of the 5 children is joined by another child, so the total number of children becomes 5 + 5 = 10.

On the third street, each of the 10 children is joined by another 2 children, so the total number of children becomes 10 + (10 * 2) = 10 + 20 = 30.

The original 5 children then give up and leave the group, so we subtract 5 from the total number of children: 30 - 5 = 25.

Therefore, there are 25 children now following the truck.

"To find the total time spent on meditation and yoga, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity separately and then add them together.

Meditation time per day: 15 minutes (morning) + 15 minutes (night) = 30 minutes
Since Charisma practices meditation every day, we multiply the daily meditation time by 7 (days in a week) and then by 4 (weeks):
30 minutes/day * 7 days/week = 210 minutes/week
210 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 840 minutes

Yoga time per week: 1 hour (60 minutes) * 5 days/week = 300 minutes/week
Since we want to know the time spent in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly yoga time by 4:
300 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 1200 minutes

Total time spent on meditation and yoga: 840 minutes (meditation) + 1200 minutes (yoga) = 2040 minutes

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

We know that Aaron was able to run each mile twice as fast as Vanessa. This means if Vanessa runs at a speed of V miles per minute, Aaron runs at a speed of 2V miles per minute.

We also know that Vanessa ran 4 miles and Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, he would have run the same distance in half the time. 

Let's denote the time Vanessa took to run 4 miles as Vt. Since Aaron runs twice as fast, he would have run the same distance in Vt/2 minutes. However, we know that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. Therefore, Vt/2 = 16.

To find the time Vanessa took to run 4 miles, we need to solve for Vt. Multiplying both sides of the equation by 2, we get Vt = 32.

However, we also know that Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron did. Since Aaron ran for 16 minutes, Vanessa ran for twice that time, which is 32 minutes. But we already know that Vt = 32, which is the time Vanessa took to run 4 miles. 

So, the time Vanessa took to complete her part of the race is 32 minutes.

Cost price of 50 watermelons = $80
Cost price of 1 watermelon = $80 / 50
Cost price of 1 watermelon = $1.60

Now, we need to find the selling price of each watermelon. The vendor sold the watermelons at a profit of 25%. To find the selling price, we need to add 25% of the cost price to the cost price.

Profit percentage = 25%
Profit = 25% of $1.60
Profit = 0.25 * $1.60
Profit = $0.40
Selling price of 1 watermelon = Cost price + Profit
Selling price of 1 watermelon = $1.60 + $0.40
Selling price of 1 watermelon = $2

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the current age of James and then determine the age of John's youngest son.

First, let's find James' current age. We know that James is twice as old as Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years. This means that James is twice as old as 12 - 3 = 9 years old. So, James is 9 * 2 = 18 years old.

Since James is 18 years old and John had him when he was 19, John is currently 19 + 18 = 37 years old.

Now, we need to find the age of John's youngest son. We know that John's youngest son was born when John was 32. Since John is currently 37, his youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years old.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

The final numerical answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many oranges each person can peel in an hour and then compare their rates.

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges.

Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

To find out how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane, we subtract Jane's total from Ana's total: 20 - 15 = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total cost Mark paid, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator and the labor cost.

First, let's find the cost of the radiator. The original price is $400, but Mark gets it for 80% off. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by 0.8 (which is the same as 80%).
 
$400 * 0.8 = $320

So, Mark pays $320 for the radiator.

Next, we need to find the labor cost. The mechanic works for 3 hours at $50 an hour. To find the total labor cost, we multiply the number of hours by the hourly rate.

3 hours * $50/hour = $150

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the labor cost to find the total amount Mark paid.

$320 (radiator) + $150 (labor) = $470

The final answer is: $470"
"Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as W. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write the equation:

C + W = 20

We also know that the total number of legs is 70. Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, so we can write another equation:

2C + 4W = 70

We can solve this system of equations by multiplying the first equation by 2 to get:

2C + 2W = 40

Now, we can subtract this equation from the second equation to eliminate C:

(2C + 4W) - (2C + 2W) = 70 - 40
2W = 30

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

W = 15

Now that we know the number of cows, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find the number of chickens:

C + 15 = 20
C = 5

So, there are 5 chickens on Farmer Brown's farm.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

First, let's find the total number of slices. There are 7 pizzas, and each pizza is cut into 8 slices. 

Total number of slices = 7 pizzas * 8 slices/pizza = 56 slices

Now, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. There are 4 people in total, including Henry and his 3 friends.

Number of slices per person = Total number of slices / Number of people
= 56 slices / 4 people
= 14 slices per person

So, each person can have 14 slices.

The final answer is: 14"
