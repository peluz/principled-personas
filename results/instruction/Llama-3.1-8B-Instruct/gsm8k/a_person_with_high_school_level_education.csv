"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to first calculate how many eggs she has left after eating and baking. 

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast and bakes 4 for muffins. So, she uses 3 + 4 = 7 eggs for these purposes. 

Now, let's subtract the number of eggs she uses from the total number of eggs she lays: 16 - 7 = 9 eggs left.

Janet sells these 9 eggs at $2 each. To find out how much she makes, we multiply the number of eggs she sells by the price per egg: 9 * 2 = 18.

So, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.

"To find the total number of bolts needed, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber first. Since it's half the amount of blue fiber, and there are 2 bolts of blue fiber, we need half of 2, which is 1 bolt of white fiber.

So, the total number of bolts needed is 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts.

"To find the profit Josh made, we need to first find the total value of the house after the repairs. 

The original value of the house was $80,000. Josh put in $50,000 in repairs, which increased the value of the house by 150%. 

To find the new value of the house, we need to calculate 150% of the original value and add it to the original value. 

150% of $80,000 is 1.5 x $80,000 = $120,000. 

Now, we add the $50,000 in repairs to the original value of the house: $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.

However, we need to find 150% of the original value, not add it to the original value. 150% of $80,000 is $120,000. 

The new value of the house is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

Now, we need to find the profit Josh made. To do this, we subtract the original cost of the house from the new value of the house: $200,000 - $80,000 = $120,000.

However, Josh also put in $50,000 in repairs. To find the actual profit, we need to subtract the cost of repairs from the profit: $120,000 - $50,000 = $70,000.

The profit Josh made is $70,000.

The final answer is: $70,000."
"To find the total meters James runs in a week, we need to first find out how many meters he runs in one week of sprints. 

Since James runs 3 sprints 3 times a week, we multiply the number of sprints by the number of times he runs them in a week. 

3 sprints * 3 times a week = 9 sprints a week

Now, we multiply the number of sprints he runs in a week by the distance of each sprint.

9 sprints a week * 60 meters per sprint = 540 meters a week

The final answer is: 540"
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to find out the total number of cups of feed she gives her chickens in a day. 

In the morning, she gives her chickens 15 cups of feed. In the afternoon, she gives her chickens 25 cups of feed. So, the total number of cups of feed she gives her chickens in the morning and afternoon is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

Since Wendi gives each of her chickens 3 cups of feed per day, and she has 20 chickens, the total number of cups of feed she needs to give her chickens in a day is 3 * 20 = 60 cups.

Now, we know that Wendi gives her chickens 40 cups of feed in the morning and afternoon. To find out how many cups of feed she needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we subtract the number of cups of feed she gives in the morning and afternoon from the total number of cups of feed she needs to give her chickens in a day. 

So, 60 - 40 = 20 cups.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining glasses. 

The first glass costs $5. 
The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * 5 = $3. 
The third glass costs 60% of $3, which is 0.6 * 3 = $1.8. 
We can see that the cost of each glass decreases by 40% (1 - 0.6) of the previous glass's cost. 

So, the cost of the glasses can be calculated as follows:
- The first glass costs $5.
- The second glass costs $3.
- The third glass costs $1.8.
- The fourth glass costs $1.8 * 0.6 = $1.08.
- The fifth glass costs $1.08 * 0.6 = $0.648.
- The sixth glass costs $0.648 * 0.6 = $0.3888.
- The seventh glass costs $0.3888 * 0.6 = $0.23328.
- The eighth glass costs $0.23328 * 0.6 = $0.139968.
- The ninth glass costs $0.139968 * 0.6 = $0.083981.
- The tenth glass costs $0.083981 * 0.6 = $0.0503886.
- The eleventh glass costs $0.0503886 * 0.6 = $0.03023316.
- The twelfth glass costs $0.03023316 * 0.6 = $0.018139896.
- The thirteenth glass costs $0.018139896 * 0.6 = $0.0108839376.
- The fourteenth glass costs $0.0108839376 * 0.6 = $0.00653036256.
- The fifteenth glass costs $0.00653036256 * 0.6 = $0.00391821736.
- The sixteenth glass costs $0.00391821736 * 0.6 = $0.002360930416.

Now, we add up the costs of all the glasses:
$5 + $3 + $1.8 + $1.08 + $0.648 + $0.3888 + $0.23328 + $0.139968 + $0.083981 + $0.0503886 + $0.03023316 + $0.018139896 + $0.0108839376 + $0.00653036256 + $0.00391821736 + $0.002360930416 = $17.016

The total cost is $17.016."
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Seattle has 20 sheep. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep. 

Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, let's add up the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle: 160 + 80 + 20 = 260.

"To find the total time it takes to download the file, we need to calculate the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file, the time it takes to install the updates, and the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file.

First, let's find the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file. 40% of 200 GB is 0.4 x 200 = 80 GB. Since Carla can download 2 GB/minute, the time it takes to download 80 GB is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

Next, we need to add the time it takes to install the updates, which is 20 minutes.

Now, we need to find the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file. 60% of 200 GB is 0.6 x 200 = 120 GB. The time it takes to download 120 GB is 120 / 2 = 60 minutes.

The total time it takes to download the file is the sum of the time it takes to download the first 40%, the time it takes to install the updates, and the time it takes to download the remaining 60%. 

Total time = 40 + 20 + 60 = 120 minutes

"To find the distance John is from home at the end of those 4 hours, we need to calculate the total distance he traveled and subtract it from the initial distance.

First, let's find the distance John traveled on his way to the point where he turned around. 

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 mph * 3 hours
Distance = 180 miles

Now, let's find the distance John traveled on his way back home.

John spent the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he didn't move. 
He then drove for half an hour at 30 mph.
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 mph * 0.5 hours
Distance = 15 miles

He then drove the remaining 2 hours at 80 mph.
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 80 mph * 2 hours
Distance = 160 miles

Total distance traveled on the way back home = 15 miles + 160 miles = 175 miles

Now, let's find the total distance John traveled.
Total distance = Distance on the way to the point where he turned around + Distance on the way back home
Total distance = 180 miles + 175 miles
Total distance = 355 miles

Since John was initially 180 miles away from home, we subtract the total distance he traveled from the initial distance to find the distance he is from home at the end of those 4 hours.
Distance from home = Initial distance - Total distance traveled
Distance from home = 180 miles - 355 miles
Distance from home = -175 miles

However, since distance cannot be negative, we need to find the distance from home in the opposite direction. 
Distance from home = 355 miles"
"To find Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours. 

For the first 40 hours, her earnings are 40 hours * $10/hour = $400.

For the overtime hours, she worked 45 hours - 40 hours = 5 hours. Her overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, so it's $10 * 1.2 = $12/hour. Her overtime earnings are 5 hours * $12/hour = $60.

Her total earnings for the week are $400 + $60 = $460.

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total number of downloads, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and add them up.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it's 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the downloads were reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which is 54. Then, we subtract 54 from 180 to get 126 downloads in the third month.

Now, we add up the downloads for all three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The final answer is: 366"

"To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the total cost of the tree and the total income from the lemons each year.

The total cost of the tree is $90. The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3. So, the net cost each year is $90 - $3 = $87.

Each year, the tree will grow 7 lemons, which can be sold for $1.5 each. So, the total income from the lemons each year is 7 x $1.5 = $10.5.

To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money, we need to find the point where the total income from the lemons is greater than the net cost of the tree.

Let's calculate the total income and net cost for each year:

Year 1: Net cost = $87, Total income = $10.5, Net loss = $76.5
Year 2: Net cost = $87, Total income = $21, Net loss = $66
Year 3: Net cost = $87, Total income = $31.5, Net loss = $55.5
Year 4: Net cost = $87, Total income = $42, Net loss = $45
Year 5: Net cost = $87, Total income = $52.5, Net gain = $34.5

It will take 5 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say Melanie started with x vacuum cleaners.

At the green house, she sold a third of her vacuum cleaners, which is x/3.

She had x - x/3 = 2x/3 vacuum cleaners left after selling at the green house.

Then, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. So, she had 2x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, which is (2x/3 - 2)/2 = x/3 - 1 vacuum cleaners.

Now, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the equation: 2x/3 - 2 - (x/3 - 1) = 5

Simplifying the equation, we get: 2x/3 - 2 - x/3 + 1 = 5
Combine like terms: x/3 - 1 = 5
Add 1 to both sides: x/3 = 6
Multiply both sides by 3: x = 18

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we need to first find out how many students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance, and then subtract that from the total number of students.

20% of 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance:
20% of 20 = 0.2 x 20 = 4 students

The remaining students after contemporary dance = 20 - 4 = 16 students

25% of the remaining students enrolled in jazz dance:
25% of 16 = 0.25 x 16 = 4 students

The remaining students after jazz dance = 16 - 4 = 12 students

These 12 students enrolled in hip-hop dance.

To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance:
(12 / 20) x 100 = 60%

"To maximize profit, we need to calculate the future value of both options. 

The future value of the jewelry is $5,000 + (2.5% of $5,000) = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125.

The future value of the electronic gadgets is $8,000 + (1.2% of $8,000) = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096.

Since the merchant will be buying the items now, the cost of the items will be subtracted from their future value to get the profit.

Profit from jewelry = $5,125 - $5,000 = $125.

Profit from electronic gadgets = $8,096 - $8,000 = $96.

The merchant should choose the jewelry to maximize profit, which is $125."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance covered on the first day and the distance covered on the second day.

On the first day, both trains travel 80 miles westward. Since they are traveling in the same direction, they cover the same distance. So, each train covers 80 miles on the first day.

On the second day, they travel northward, covering 150 miles. Again, since they are traveling in the same direction, they cover the same distance. So, each train covers 150 miles on the second day.

To find the total distance covered by each train in the two days, we add the distances covered on the first and second days:

Total distance covered by each train = 80 miles (first day) + 150 miles (second day) = 230 miles

The final answer is: 230"
"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:

She works 35 hours a week as a teacher and gets paid $20 per hour. So, her weekly earnings from teaching are:
35 hours/week * $20/hour = $700/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from teaching are:
$700/week * 50 weeks/year = $35,000/year

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:

She works 15 hours a week as a coach and gets paid $30 per hour. So, her weekly earnings from coaching are:
15 hours/week * $30/hour = $450/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from coaching are:
$450/week * 50 weeks/year = $22,500/year

Now, let's add her earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary:
$35,000/year (teaching) + $22,500/year (coaching) = $57,500/year

The final answer is: $57,500"
"To find out how many eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to first find out how many eggs she eats in a day and then multiply it by the number of days in 4 weeks.

Claire eats 3 eggs every morning for breakfast. Since there are 7 days in a week, there are 7 x 4 = 28 days in 4 weeks.

Now, we multiply the number of eggs she eats in a day by the number of days in 4 weeks: 3 eggs/day * 28 days = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks: 84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozen eggs.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance, we first need to find the total time she has to complete the remaining distance. 

She has already walked 4 miles in 1 hour and 2 miles in another hour, so she has walked a total of 6 miles in 2 hours. 

The total distance of the trail is 12 miles, and she has already walked 6 miles, so she has 12 - 6 = 6 miles left to walk.

Since she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail, and she has already walked 6 miles in 2 hours, she has 10 hours left to walk the remaining 6 miles.

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance, we divide the remaining distance (6 miles) by the remaining time (10 hours).

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 6 miles / 10 hours
Speed = 0.6 miles per hour

The final answer is: 0.6"
"To find the amount of water in the orange drink, we need to calculate two-thirds of 10 liters. 

Two-thirds of 10 liters is (2/3) * 10 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters. 

Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the amount of water in the orange drink is 6.67 liters. 

Now, to find the amount of water in the pineapple drink, we need to calculate three-fifths of 15 liters.

Three-fifths of 15 liters is (3/5) * 15 = 45/5 = 9 liters.

Since the pineapple drink is three-fifths water, the amount of water in the pineapple drink is 9 liters.

Now, we have 6.67 liters of water from the orange drink and 9 liters of water from the pineapple drink. However, we spilled 1 liter of the orange drink, so we need to subtract 1/3 of 6.67 liters from the total water in the orange drink.

1/3 of 6.67 liters is 6.67/3 = 2.22 liters.

So, the amount of water in the remaining orange drink is 6.67 - 2.22 = 4.45 liters.

Now, we add the water from the orange drink and the pineapple drink: 4.45 + 9 = 13.45 liters.

The total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 13.45 liters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{13.45}$"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha.
2. Samantha is now 31 years old.
3. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, Raymond is 31 - 6 = 25 years old.
4. Raymond had a son at the age of 23.
5. To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to subtract the age at which Raymond had a son from his current age. 
   Raymond's current age is 25, and he had a son at 23, so the son was born 25 - 23 = 2 years ago.

"To find out how many DVDs Billy sold, we need to calculate the total number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers.

The first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each, so they bought a total of 3 DVDs. 

The next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so they bought a total of 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs.

Now, let's add the total number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers: 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs.

So, Billy sold 7 DVDs to the first 5 customers. The last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs, so we don't need to add anything to the total.

"To find out how many centimeters shorter the candle will be, we need to calculate the total number of hours it burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM. 

From 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM is 4 hours. 

Since the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, we multiply the number of hours by the rate of melting: 4 hours * 2 centimeters/hour = 8 centimeters.

The candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

"To find the original price of the book, we need to figure out what the original price was before the 25% discount. 

Let's call the original price ""x"". Since Kyle got a 25% discount, that means he paid 75% of the original price (100% - 25% = 75%). 

We know that 75% of the original price is $19.50. To find the original price, we can set up the equation: 0.75x = 19.50.

To solve for x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 0.75. 

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book was $26.

The final answer is: $26"
"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items she ordered other than pizza. 

The cost of the chicken meal is $12. 
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 x $3 = $15. 
The cost of 4 apples is 4 x $1.50 = $6. 

Now, let's add up the cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples: $12 + $15 + $6 = $33. 

Since Marie paid a total of $50, we can subtract the cost of the items other than pizza from the total amount she paid to find the cost of the pizza: $50 - $33 = $17. 

Now, we need to find out how many boxes of pizza cost $17. Since each box costs $8.50, we can divide the total cost of the pizza by the cost of one box: $17 / $8.50 = 2. 

The final answer is: 2"

Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, and there are 15 servings in a carton. So, she will need 1 carton every 15 days.

In 60 days, she will need 60 / 15 = 4 cartons.

Each carton costs $4.00, so 4 cartons will cost 4 x $4.00 = $16.00.

"To find out how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to know the distance between the two stops. 

Henry's first stop was after 20 miles, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total trip was 60 miles, we can find the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip by subtracting 15 miles from 60 miles. 

60 miles - 15 miles = 45 miles

Now, we know that the distance from the first stop to the second stop is the difference between the distance of the first stop and the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip. 

20 miles + 45 miles = 65 miles, but this is the total distance from the first stop to the end of the trip. To find the distance between the two stops, we need to subtract the distance of the first stop from the total distance from the first stop to the end of the trip. However, we can also subtract the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip from the total distance of the trip and then subtract the distance of the first stop from that result.

60 miles - 45 miles = 15 miles
15 miles - 20 miles = -5 miles, but this is incorrect because distance can't be negative. We need to rethink our approach.

Let's try another way. We know the first stop was 20 miles into the trip, and the second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. So, the second stop was at 60 - 15 = 45 miles. 

Now, we can find the distance between the two stops by subtracting the distance of the first stop from the distance of the second stop.

45 miles - 20 miles = 25 miles

"Let's break down the information given. 

One pair of heels costs $33, and the other costs twice as much, so the second pair costs 2 * 33 = $66.

The two pairs of heels together cost $33 + $66 = $99.

It's given that the two pairs of heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. So, the boots cost $99 + $5 = $104.

The final answer is: $104"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let Darrell's age be 7x and Allen's age be 11x, where x is a constant. 

Since their total age is 162, we can write the equation: 
7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms: 
18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18: 
x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Darrell's and Allen's current ages: 
Darrell's age = 7x = 7(9) = 63
Allen's age = 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age: 
Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

"To find the average guess, we need to find the total number of guesses and divide it by the number of people.

The first person guesses 80 jelly beans.
The second person guesses 20 more than half of the first one, which is (80 / 2) + 20 = 60.
The third person guesses 25% more than the first one, which is 80 + (80 * 0.25) = 100.

Now, let's add up all the guesses: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

There are 3 people, so we divide the total by 3 to find the average: 240 / 3 = 80.

The final answer is: 80"

First, let's calculate the number of hours John spends per day on all the dogs: 
10 dogs * 0.5 hours per dog = 5 hours per day

Next, we multiply the daily hours by the number of days in a week (7 days):
5 hours per day * 7 days per week = 35 hours per week

So, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of dogs.

"Let's say the number of silver coins is x. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is x + 30.

We know that the total number of coins is 110, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 30) = 110

Combine like terms: 2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2: x = 40

So, the number of silver coins is 40. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is 40 + 30 = 70.

The final answer is: 70"
"To find out how many jewels Siobhan has, we need to first find out how many jewels Aaron has. 

Since Raymond has 40 jewels, half of Raymond's jewels would be 40 / 2 = 20. 

Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, so Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.

Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, so Siobhan has 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points he scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes. 

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points. 

In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% of 4, we multiply 4 by 0.25, which is 1. Then, we add this to the original 4 points to get the total points scored in the second 20 minutes: 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Now, we add the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes to get the total points: 4 + 5 = 9 points.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to first find out how much he spends on yogurt per day. 

Since Terry eats 2 yogurts a day and they are on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00, we need to find out the cost of 2 yogurts. 

To do this, we can divide the total cost of 4 yogurts ($5.00) by 4 to get the cost of 1 yogurt, and then multiply that by 2 to get the cost of 2 yogurts.

Cost of 1 yogurt = $5.00 / 4 = $1.25
Cost of 2 yogurts = $1.25 * 2 = $2.50

Now that we know Terry spends $2.50 on yogurt per day, we can multiply this by 30 to find out how much he spends over 30 days.

Total cost over 30 days = $2.50 * 30 = $75.00

The final answer is: $75.00"
"To find out how many Lego sets John has left, we need to first calculate how much money he made from selling the Lego sets and then subtract the money he spent on video games and the remaining money he has.

John sells 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so the total money he made is 13 x $15 = $195.

He buys 8 video games for $20 each, so the total money he spent on video games is 8 x $20 = $160.

He has $5 left after buying the video games.

To find out how much money he spent in total, we add the money he spent on video games to the remaining money: $160 + $5 = $165.

Now, we subtract the total money he spent from the total money he made to find out how much he spent on other things: $195 - $165 = $30.

Since we know he spent $30 on other things, and we want to find out how many Lego sets he sold for this amount, we divide $30 by $15 (the price of each Lego set): $30 / $15 = 2.

This means John sold 2 Lego sets for $30. 

Since John originally had 13 Lego sets and he sold 2, we subtract 2 from 13 to find out how many Lego sets he has left: 13 - 2 = 11.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find out how fast John runs, we need to first find out how many hours he runs in a week. 

He runs 3 hours the first day, and half as much on the other two days. Half of 3 hours is 1.5 hours. So, he runs 1.5 hours on each of the other two days. 

Total hours run in a week = 3 hours (first day) + 1.5 hours (second day) + 1.5 hours (third day) = 6 hours.

Now, we know John runs 60 miles in 6 hours. To find out his speed, we need to divide the total miles by the total hours.

Speed = Total miles / Total hours = 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how fast Dana can run and walk. 

Since Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour and she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run, we can find her running speed by multiplying her skipping speed by 2. 

Dana's running speed = 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

We also know that Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk. So, we can find her walking speed by dividing her running speed by 4.

Dana's walking speed = 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, we need to find out how much time Dana spends running and walking in six hours. Since she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, we can calculate the time spent running and walking as follows:

Time spent running = 6 * (1/3) = 2 hours
Time spent walking = 6 * (2/3) = 4 hours

Now, we can find the distance traveled while running and walking by multiplying the speed and time.

Distance traveled while running = 6 * 2 = 12 miles
Distance traveled while walking = 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles

The total distance traveled is the sum of the distance traveled while running and walking.

Total distance traveled = 12 + 6 = 18 miles

The final answer is: 18"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old.
- Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, so Ben's iPhone is 2 * 1 = 2 years old.
- Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, so Brandon's iPhone is 4 * 2 = 8 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how far Polly can throw the javelin when holding the gemstone. Since she can throw it three times farther than when not holding the gemstone, and she can throw it 400 feet without the gemstone, we multiply 400 by 3.

400 * 3 = 1200 feet

Now, we need to find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon. The dragon's reach is 1000 feet, so Polly needs to be at least 1000 feet away from the dragon to be outside its reach. Since she can throw the javelin 1200 feet, she can stand 200 feet outside the dragon's reach and still hit it.

The final answer is: 200"
"To find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we need to subtract the number of pieces remaining from the total number of pieces. 

First, let's find the total number of pieces. Grandma Jones baked 5 pies and cut each pie into 8 pieces. 

Total number of pieces = 5 pies * 8 pieces per pie = 40 pieces

Now, we subtract the number of pieces remaining from the total number of pieces to find out how many pieces were taken by the guests.

Number of pieces taken by the guests = Total number of pieces - Number of pieces remaining
= 40 - 14
= 26

The final answer is: 26"
"To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we first need to find out how many calories you have left for the day. 

Your daily calorie target is 2000, and you have already consumed 1800 calories. 

2000 (daily target) - 1800 (already consumed) = 200 calories left for the day.

Since each serving of chips has 250 calories, we need to find out how many servings you can have with the remaining calories.

200 (calories left) / 250 (calories per serving) = 0.8 servings

Since a 300g bag has 5 servings, we need to find out how many grams are in one serving.

300g (total weight) / 5 (servings) = 60g per serving

Now, we multiply the number of servings you can have by the weight of one serving.

0.8 (servings) * 60g (per serving) = 48g

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the net profit, we need to first find the total cost and total revenue. 

The cost of supplies for 20 candles is the cost of 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks, since 20 candles require 2 pounds of beeswax. The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks is 2 * $10.00 = $20.00.

The total revenue from selling 20 candles is 20 * $2.00 = $40.00.

The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. So, the net profit is $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.

The final answer is: $20.00"
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to find out how many articles she wrote each day and multiply that by the time it takes to write one article (4 hours).

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles. 

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. To find 2/5 of 5, we multiply 5 by 2/5, which is 2. So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 2 * 7 = 14 articles.

Now, let's add up the total number of articles she wrote: 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles.

Since it takes 4 hours to write one article, the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles is 26 * 4 = 104 hours.

The final answer is: 104"
"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we need to know how many Post-it notes she had at the end and subtract the initial amount from it. 

Candice started with 80 Post-it notes. At the end, she had 23 Post-it notes. So, the number of Post-it notes she used is 80 - 23 = 57.

Since she used 57 Post-it notes at work, and she placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 cups of coffee, we can say that the 57 Post-it notes were used for 220 cups of coffee. 

Now, to find out how many Post-it notes were in the package, we need to add the Post-it notes she used at work to the Post-it notes she had at the end. 

The total number of Post-it notes in the package is 57 (used at work) + 23 (remaining) = 80.

However, this is the same as the initial amount of Post-it notes she had. This means that the package she purchased must have had 0 Post-it notes, because she used all the Post-it notes she had initially and then had 23 remaining.

The final answer is: 0"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. To find out how many blue ties he bought, we can divide the total amount spent on blue ties by the cost of each blue tie.

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost of each blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is twice the number of blue ties.

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
= 2 * 5
= 10

Now, we know that the red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. This means the cost of each red tie is 1.5 times the cost of each blue tie.

Cost of each red tie = 1.5 * Cost of each blue tie
= 1.5 * $40
= $60

To find the total amount spent on red ties, we multiply the number of red ties by the cost of each red tie.

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of each red tie
= 10 * $60
= $600

The total amount spent on ties is the sum of the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties.

Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
= $200 + $600
= $800

The final answer is: $800"
"To find out how many pieces Tracy obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in 1 foot, so we multiply 4 feet by 12 inches per foot.

4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Now, we need to divide the total length of the wire in inches by the length of each piece to find out how many pieces Tracy obtained.

48 inches / 6 inches/piece = 8 pieces

"To find the total number of units in the building, we need to multiply the number of floors by the number of units per floor. 

Number of floors: 15
Number of units per floor: 8

Total units = Number of floors * Number of units per floor
Total units = 15 * 8
Total units = 120

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we need to find 1/4 of the total units to find the number of unoccupied units.

1/4 of the total units = (1/4) * Total units
1/4 of the total units = (1/4) * 120
1/4 of the total units = 30

So, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to first find out how much he makes per day and then multiply it by 7.

First, let's find out how many eggs Lloyd sells per day. Since he sells eggs by the dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12. 

Total eggs per day: 252
Eggs per dozen: 12
Eggs sold per day: 252 / 12 = 21 dozen

Now, let's find out how much Lloyd makes per day. He sells eggs for $2 per dozen.

Eggs sold per day: 21 dozen
Price per dozen: $2
Daily income: 21 * $2 = $42

Now, let's find out how much Lloyd makes per week. We multiply his daily income by 7.

Daily income: $42
Weekly income: $42 * 7 = $294

The final answer is: $294"
"To find the total time it takes for Tom to travel back, we need to first find the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM. 

Since we don't know the distance, let's assume the distance is 'd' miles. The time it took for Tom to travel from 1 to 4 PM is d/10 hours.

The time it took for Tom to travel back is d/6 hours.

The total time is the sum of these two times: d/10 + d/6.

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 30. 

So, the total time is (3d + 5d)/30 = 8d/30 = 4d/15 hours.

However, we still don't know the distance 'd'. To find 'd', we need to know the time Tom traveled from 1 to 4 PM. Since he traveled from 1 to 4 PM, the time is 3 hours. 

Now we can find 'd': d = 10 * 3 = 30 miles.

Now that we know 'd', we can find the total time it took for Tom to travel back: 4d/15 = 4 * 30 / 15 = 8 hours.

"To find the revenue earned on Thursday, we need to multiply the number of truck tires repaired by the cost per truck tire and add the number of car tires repaired by the cost per car tire. 

Revenue on Thursday = (6 * $60) + (4 * $40) 
Revenue on Thursday = $360 + $160 
Revenue on Thursday = $520

To find the revenue earned on Friday, we need to multiply the number of car tires repaired by the cost per car tire.

Revenue on Friday = (12 * $40) 
Revenue on Friday = $480

Since we are asked to find the difference in revenue between the two days, we need to subtract the revenue on the day with lower revenue from the revenue on the day with higher revenue. 

Revenue on Thursday is higher than revenue on Friday, so we subtract the revenue on Friday from the revenue on Thursday.

Difference in revenue = Revenue on Thursday - Revenue on Friday 
Difference in revenue = $520 - $480 
Difference in revenue = $40

"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to follow the order of operations. 

First, we need to find the total cost of the groceries before the delivery fee and tip. Let's call this 'x'. 

The delivery vendor added a 25% fee to the total cost of the groceries, so the new total is x + 0.25x = 1.25x. 

Then, they charged a $3.00 delivery fee, so the new total is 1.25x + 3. 

Finally, Stephen added a $4.00 tip, so the final total is 1.25x + 3 + 4 = 1.25x + 7.

We know that the final bill came to $40.00, so we can set up the equation 1.25x + 7 = 40.

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. We can do this by subtracting 7 from both sides of the equation: 1.25x = 40 - 7, which simplifies to 1.25x = 33.

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 1.25 to solve for x: x = 33 / 1.25, which simplifies to x = 26.40.

So, the total cost of the groceries before the delivery fee and tip was $26.40.

The final price of Stephen's groceries is $40.00."

There is 1 bad orange, 20% of 25 oranges are unripe, and 2 are sour. 

First, let's find 20% of 25. 
20% of 25 = (20/100) * 25 = 0.2 * 25 = 5

So, there are 5 unripe oranges. 

Now, let's add the number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges to find the total number of oranges that are not good. 
1 (bad) + 5 (unripe) + 2 (sour) = 8

Now, we subtract the total number of oranges that are not good from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges. 
25 (total oranges) - 8 (not good oranges) = 17

The number of good oranges is 17.

"To find Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to calculate the value of the pension after 30 years and then add 5% of that value.

Marcy works for 30 years, but she only gets the full pension for 10 years (30 - 20 = 10). For the first 10 years, she gets $50,000/year. 

For the next 20 years, she gets 5% of the value of the pension per year. To find the value of the pension after 10 years, we multiply the annual pension by the number of years: $50,000 * 10 = $500,000.

Now, we need to find 5% of $500,000. To do this, we multiply $500,000 by 0.05: $500,000 * 0.05 = $25,000.

So, for the next 20 years, Marcy gets $25,000/year.

To find her total annual pension after 30 years, we add the annual pension for the first 10 years and the annual pension for the next 20 years: $50,000 + $25,000 = $75,000.

"To find the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to calculate the amount she paid for the first half of the year and the second half of the year separately and then add them together.

The streaming service charges $140 per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the first half of the year has 6 months. 

The amount Aleena paid for the first half of the year is 6 * $140 = $840.

For the second half of the year, the company charged her 10% less money. To find 10% of $140, we multiply $140 by 0.1, which is $14. 

So, the amount Aleena paid for the second half of the year is $140 - $14 = $126 per month. 

The second half of the year has 6 months, so the total amount Aleena paid for the second half of the year is 6 * $126 = $756.

Now, we add the amount she paid for the first half of the year and the second half of the year to find the total amount she paid for the streaming service by the end of the year.

$840 + $756 = $1596

"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to find out how many miles she can drive per gallon. 

We know that she put in 4 gallons of gas to fill up her tank, and she traveled 100 miles since the last fill-up. To find the miles per gallon, we can divide the miles she traveled by the gallons of gas she used. 

Miles per gallon = Total miles / Total gallons used
Miles per gallon = 100 miles / 4 gallons
Miles per gallon = 25 miles per gallon

Now that we know the miles per gallon, we can find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a full tank. We know that her tank holds 12 gallons of gas.

"To find the total number of people sent by the schools, we need to calculate the number of players and coaches for both girls' and boys' teams.

Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys'), and each team has 5 players. So, the total number of players from each school is 2 teams * 5 players/team = 10 players.

Each school also has 2 coaches, one for each team. So, the total number of coaches from each school is 2 coaches.

Now, we multiply the number of players and coaches from each school by the total number of schools to get the total number of people sent by all schools.

Total players = 10 players/school * 4 schools = 40 players
Total coaches = 2 coaches/school * 4 schools = 8 coaches

Total people = Total players + Total coaches = 40 + 8 = 48

"To find out how much Shiela will pay each month, we need to calculate the total cost of the cell phones first, then divide it by 3 months.

The total cost of the cell phones is 5 units * $150 per unit = $750.

A 2% interest will be charged for each unit, so the total interest is 5 units * 2% = 0.02 * 5 = $1.

The total amount Shiela needs to pay is the cost of the cell phones plus the interest, which is $750 + $1 = $751.

To find out how much Shiela will pay each month, we divide the total amount by 3 months: $751 / 3 = $250.33.

"To find the average square footage of a level, we need to find the total square footage of all levels and then divide it by the number of levels.

The top level has a square footage of 16. Since each level below it has half the square footage, the second level will have 16 / 2 = 8 square footage. The third level will have 8 / 2 = 4 square footage, and the fourth level will have 4 / 2 = 2 square footage.

Now, let's add up the square footage of all levels: 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30.

There are 4 levels in total. To find the average square footage, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels: 30 / 4 = 7.5.

The final answer is: 7.5"
"To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food the puppy will eat in the first year. 

First, let's find out how many days are in a year. There are 365 days in a year.

The puppy eats 1 cup of dog food for the first 180 days. So, the amount of dog food eaten in the first 180 days is 1 cup/day * 180 days = 180 cups.

The puppy eats 2 cups of dog food for the rest of its life, which is 365 - 180 = 185 days. So, the amount of dog food eaten in the rest of the year is 2 cups/day * 185 days = 370 cups.

The total amount of dog food eaten in the first year is 180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the total number of bags of dog food used in the first year is 550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags.

- Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
- Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, so David does 400 / 4 = 100 pounds of laundry.
- Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so Raymond does 400 / 2 = 200 pounds of laundry.

To find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do, we subtract the amount David does from the amount Raymond does: 200 - 100 = 100.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the better price, we need to compare the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 and packages of 2.

If Vincent buys 18 flowers in packages of 3, he will need 6 packages (18 / 3 = 6). The total cost will be 6 * $2.50 = $15.

If Vincent buys 18 flowers in packages of 2, he will need 9 packages (18 / 2 = 9). The total cost will be 9 * $1 = $9.

The better price is $9. To find the amount of money Vincent saves, we subtract the cost of the better price from the cost of the more expensive option: $15 - $9 = $6.

"Let's say the number of games they lost is x. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games they won is x + 8.

We know that the total number of games played is 22, which is the sum of the games won and lost. So, we can write an equation:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:

2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 7

So, the number of games they lost is 7. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games they won is 7 + 8 = 15.

"To find Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to first calculate her salary after 5 years of service, and then calculate her salary after 8 years of service.

Sylvie's initial salary is $600. After 5 years, her salary will be increased by 10% of $600, which is 0.1 * 600 = $60. So, her salary after 5 years will be $600 + $60 = $660.

Now, we need to calculate her salary after 8 years. For the next 3 years, her salary will be increased by 10% of $660 each year. 

The first increase will be 0.1 * 660 = $66. So, her salary after 6 years will be $660 + $66 = $726.

The second increase will be 0.1 * 726 = $72.6. So, her salary after 7 years will be $726 + $72.6 = $798.6.

The third increase will be 0.1 * 798.6 = $79.86. So, her salary after 8 years will be $798.6 + $79.86 = $878.46.

The final answer is: $878.46"

"To find out how fast Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles, we need to first find out how fast he used to run. Since Lee runs 2 seconds faster than Gerald, we can subtract 2 seconds from Lee's time to find Gerald's original time.

Lee's time is 38 seconds, so Gerald's original time is 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.

Gerald's speed improved by 10%, so we need to find 10% of 40 and add it to 40 to find his new time.

10% of 40 is 0.1 x 40 = 4 seconds.

Gerald's new time is 40 + 4 = 44 seconds.

We know that the number of dogs is 60. Since there are two cats for every dog, the number of cats can be calculated by multiplying the number of dogs by 2. 

Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
Number of cats = 2 * 60
Number of cats = 120

We are also given that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. 

Let's first find the combined number of dogs and cats:
Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
Combined number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120
Combined number of dogs and cats = 180

Now, we can find the number of rabbits by subtracting 12 from the combined number of dogs and cats:
Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
Number of rabbits = 180 - 12
Number of rabbits = 168

To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we need to add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:

"To find out how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we need to know the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam. 

We know that 20 cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. 

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as x. 

Since 5 cars took an exit, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the original number of cars minus the cars that took an exit: 30 - 5 = 25.

We also know that the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the sum of the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes: x + 20 = 25.

Now, we can solve for x: x = 25 - 20
x = 5

On Thursday, he watched 1 hour and 30 minutes of TV. 

On Friday, he watched 2 episodes of a 1-hour show, so that's 2 * 1 = 2 hours. 

So, the total hours of TV watched on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday is 2 + 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 7.5 hours. 

Since Frankie watched 7 hours of TV in all, the remaining hours must have been watched on Wednesday. 

7 - 7.5 = -0.5 hours. However, we can't have a negative number of hours, so let's re-examine the information. 

The total hours of TV watched on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday is 2 + 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 7.5 hours. 

Since Frankie watched 7 hours of TV in all, the remaining hours must have been watched on Wednesday.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let's say Henry baked x cookies last year. This year, he wants to bake twice as many, so he bakes 2x cookies. However, he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so he actually baked 2x + 15 cookies.

After baking, he drops 5 cookies, so he has 2x + 15 - 5 cookies left. This simplifies to 2x + 10 cookies.

We know that he has 110 cookies left, so we can set up the equation 2x + 10 = 110.

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. We can do this by subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 100.

Next, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for x: x = 50.

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to find out how many times Julia rows 10 feet in 64 seconds. 

Since it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can find out how long it takes her to row 10 feet by dividing 16 seconds by 2. 

16 seconds / 2 = 8 seconds to row 10 feet.

Now, we can divide the total time it takes to reach the shore by the time it takes to row 10 feet to find out how many times she rows 10 feet.

64 seconds / 8 seconds = 8 times.

Since the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, and she rows 10 feet 8 times, we can multiply the number of times she rows 10 feet by the amount of water taken on each time.

8 times * 2 liters = 16 liters.

We are given that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs. So, Brittany's phone can hold 1800/6 = 300 photographs.

The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. This means the number of birds in Jamal's photograph is 300/50.

To find the number of birds in Jamal's photograph, we divide 300 by 50. 

300 / 50 = 6

So, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the profit, we need to first find the total cost and the total selling price of the lumber. 

The total cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $10 = $100. 
The total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $16 = $80. 
The total cost of all the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the new price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each. 
The new price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 each.

The total selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $15 = $150. 
The total selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $24 = $120. 
The total selling price of all the lumber is $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit is the total selling price minus the total cost, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, we need to first find the total parts in the ratio, which is 7 + 13 = 20. 

Then, we can find the fraction of the total mixture that is sugar by dividing the number of parts of sugar by the total number of parts: 7/20. 

Now, we can multiply this fraction by the total amount of the mixture (120 teaspoons) to find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar: (7/20) * 120 = 42.

The final answer is: 42"
"To find out how much John paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the shoes. 

First, we find out how many pairs of shoes John bought in total. He bought 2 pairs for each of his 3 children, so that's 2 * 3 = 6 pairs of shoes.

Since each pair costs $60, we multiply the number of pairs by the cost per pair: 6 * 60 = 360.

So, John paid $360. 

360"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles was 2 x 5 = 10.

The next day, more containers were brought in, and the total number of vehicles became 30. To find the number of new containers, we need to subtract the initial number of vehicles from the total number of vehicles.

New containers = Total vehicles - Initial vehicles
New containers = 30 - 10
New containers = 20

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can find the number of new containers by dividing the total number of new vehicles by 5.

Number of new containers = New vehicles / 5
Number of new containers = 20 / 5
Number of new containers = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. If we let Lylah's salary be x, then Adrien's salary is 1.3x (since 30% more is the same as multiplying by 1.3).

We also know that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000. Since his salary increased by 40% over those four years, we can set up the equation:

1.3x = 40000

To find Lylah's salary, we can divide both sides by 1.3:

x = 40000 / 1.3
x = 30769.23

Now that we know Lylah's salary, we can find Adrien's salary four years later. We know that Adrien's salary increased by 40% over those four years, so we can multiply his original salary by 1.4:

Adrien's salary four years later = 40000 * 1.4
= 56000

We also know that Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage over the same time period, so we can multiply her original salary by 1.4:

Lylah's salary four years later = 30769.23 * 1.4
= 43056.5222

Now that we have both salaries, we can add them together to find the total salary:

Total salary four years later = Adrien's salary four years later + Lylah's salary four years later
= 56000 + 43056.5222
= 99056.5222

The final answer is: $99057"
"To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we need to first find out how many sheets he uses in a week and then multiply that by the number of weeks in a month.

Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad has 30 sheets. So, the total number of sheets he uses in a week is 2 * 30 = 60 sheets.

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we can multiply the number of sheets Miguel uses in a week by 4 to find out how many sheets he uses in a month. 

60 sheets/week * 4 weeks/month = 240 sheets/month

"To find the total number of fruits, we need to calculate the number of fruits each person brought and then add them together.

Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges. 

Kael brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette, so Kael brought 2 * 5 = 10 apples. 
Kael brought half the number of oranges as Morisette, so Kael brought 8 / 2 = 4 oranges.

Now, let's add the total number of fruits each person brought: 
Morisette brought 5 + 8 = 13 fruits.
Kael brought 10 + 4 = 14 fruits.

The total number of fruits they have is 13 + 14 = 27. 

The final answer is: 27"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday. 

For the next two days, she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours each day. 

The rest of the week is 5 days (Tuesday to Saturday), and she slept 1 hour more than the previous two days, so she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours each day.

Now, let's calculate the total hours she slept for the first two days: 6 + 6 = 12 hours.

And the total hours she slept for the rest of the week: 7 * 5 = 35 hours.

The total hours she slept throughout the week is the sum of the hours she slept in the first two days and the rest of the week: 12 + 35 = 47 hours.

"To find out how many miles Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 3 hours and the remaining 4 hours.

In the first 3 hours, Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour. To find out how many miles she runs in 3 hours, we multiply 10 miles per hour by 3 hours.

10 miles/hour * 3 hours = 30 miles

Now, we have 4 hours left. In these 4 hours, Rosie runs at 5 miles per hour. To find out how many miles she runs in 4 hours, we multiply 5 miles per hour by 4 hours.

5 miles/hour * 4 hours = 20 miles

Now, we add the miles Rosie ran in the first 3 hours to the miles she ran in the remaining 4 hours.

30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles

So, Rosie can run 50 miles in 7 hours.

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Jennie has a pile of 60 letters needing stamps. She puts stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps. This means she stamps 60 / 3 = 20 letters.

Now, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. This means that the 20 letters Jennie stamped were added to the pile of already-stamped letters. 

So, the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters before Jennie started stamping is 30 - 20 = 10.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Julia bought a package of spoons, and then her husband gave her 5 more spoons. So, the total number of spoons she had before using any is the sum of the spoons she bought and the spoons her husband gave her. 

Let's call the number of spoons Julia bought 'x'. Then, the total number of spoons she had before using any is x + 5.

Julia used 3 spoons while making the stew. So, the total number of spoons she had after using 3 spoons is (x + 5) - 3 = x + 2.

After using 3 spoons, Julia had a total of 12 spoons. So, we can set up the equation x + 2 = 12.

To find the value of x, we need to solve the equation x + 2 = 12. 

Subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation, we get x = 10.

"To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to find the cost of each item and multiply it by the quantity.

First, let's find the cost of a watermelon. Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, and each pepper costs $15, a watermelon costs 3 x $15 = $45.

Next, we find the cost of an orange. An orange costs 5 dollars less than a watermelon, so an orange costs $45 - $5 = $40.

Now, we can find the total cost of each item:

- 4 watermelons: 4 x $45 = $180
- 20 peppers: 20 x $15 = $300
- 10 oranges: 10 x $40 = $400

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

"To find the profit, we need to first find the total time spent by doctors and the total amount charged by the hospital and subtract the cost of the doctors.

First, let's find the total time spent by doctors. There are 500 patients a day, and each patient is seen for 24 minutes. 

Total time spent by doctors = 500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12000 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we need to convert the total time from minutes to hours.

Total time spent by doctors = 12000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

The doctors charge $150 an hour, so the total cost of the doctors is:

Total cost of doctors = 200 hours * $150/hour = $30000

Now, let's find the total amount charged by the hospital. Each patient is seen for 24 minutes, which is 0.4 hours. 

Total amount charged by the hospital = 500 patients * 0.4 hours/patient * $200/hour = $80000

The profit is the total amount charged by the hospital minus the total cost of the doctors.

Profit = Total amount charged by the hospital - Total cost of doctors
Profit = $80000 - $30000
Profit = $50000

1. A third of the elves quit after kids vomit on them. Since there are 60 elves, a third of them is 60 / 3 = 20. So, 20 elves quit.

Now, we have 60 - 20 = 40 elves left.

2. Then, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. So, we subtract 10 from the remaining elves: 40 - 10 = 30.

Therefore, there are 30 elves left.

Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, so he rode a total of 4 + 2 = 6 rides.

The total number of rides is 4 (Pam's rides) + 6 (Fred's rides) = 10 rides.

Each ride costs 6 tickets, so the total number of tickets used is 10 rides * 6 tickets per ride = 60 tickets.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we need to first find out how many miles he walked on Tuesday. 

On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. 
On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, so he walked 4 * 6 = 24 miles on Tuesday.

Now, we know that his total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. We already know that he walked 4 miles on Monday and 24 miles on Tuesday. 

So, the total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday is 4 + 24 = 28 miles. 

To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we subtract the total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage from Monday through Wednesday. 

41 - 28 = 13 miles.

So, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday.

"To find the number of female Scottish unicorns, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we find the number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands. Since one third of the 27 unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, we can calculate this by dividing 27 by 3.

27 / 3 = 9

So, there are 9 unicorns in the Scottish Highlands.

2. Next, we need to find the number of female unicorns in the Scottish Highlands. Since two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female, we can calculate this by multiplying the number of Scottish unicorns by 2/3.

Number of female Scottish unicorns = (2/3) * 9
= 2 * 3
= 6

Therefore, there are 6 female Scottish unicorns.

For the first test, Mark had 8 hours to complete 75 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour. 

First, let's find out how many questions Mark completed in 8 hours: 
8 hours * 5 questions per hour = 40 questions

Since Mark completed 40 questions in 8 hours, he left 75 - 40 = 35 questions incomplete in the first test.

For the second test, Mark had 6 hours to complete 100 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour.

Now, let's find out how many questions Mark completed in 6 hours: 
6 hours * 5 questions per hour = 30 questions

"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we need to first find out how many semi-automatic cars there are. We know that there are 20 cars in total, 12 are automatic, and 4 are manual. 

Total number of cars = 20
Number of automatic cars = 12
Number of manual cars = 4

To find the number of semi-automatic cars, we subtract the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars.
Number of semi-automatic cars = Total number of cars - (Number of automatic cars + Number of manual cars)
= 20 - (12 + 4)
= 20 - 16
= 4

Now, we can find the percentage of semi-automatic cars by dividing the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiplying by 100.
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100

"Let's break down the information given. 

Let's say the number of baby bees is x. Since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, the number of worker bees is 2x. 

Also, there are twice as many babies as queens, so the number of queens is x/2.

We know that the total number of bees in the hive is 700. So, the sum of worker bees, baby bees, and queens is 700. 

We can write the equation: x + 2x + x/2 = 700

To solve for x, we need to get rid of the fraction. Multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 2x + 4x + x = 1400

Combine like terms: 7x = 1400

Now, divide both sides by 7: x = 200

Now that we know the number of baby bees is 200, we can find the number of worker bees, which is 2x: 2 * 200 = 400

"To find out who will win the race, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school.

First, let's convert the distance to feet for both Steve and Tim. Since 1 mile is equal to 5280 feet, we can convert their distances as follows:

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15,840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10,560 feet

Now, let's calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school:

Steve's time: distance / speed = 15,840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: distance / speed = 10,560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 36 minutes to get home and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve will win the race. To find out how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to subtract the winner's time from the loser's time:

Waiting time = Tim's time - Steve's time = 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

"To find out how much Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total cost of inflating all the tires. 

First, let's calculate the cost of inflating the bicycle tires. Each bicycle has 2 tires, and there were 5 bicycles. So, the total number of bicycle tires is 5 * 2 = 10. The cost of inflating each tire is 25 cents, so the total cost for the bicycle tires is 10 * 25 cents = 250 cents. 

Next, let's calculate the cost of inflating the tricycle tires. Each tricycle has 3 tires, and there were 3 tricycles. So, the total number of tricycle tires is 3 * 3 = 9. The cost of inflating each tire is 25 cents, so the total cost for the tricycle tires is 9 * 25 cents = 225 cents.

Now, let's calculate the cost of inflating the unicycle tire. A unicycle has 1 tire, and there was 1 unicycle. So, the total number of unicycle tires is 1 * 1 = 1. The cost of inflating each tire is 25 cents, so the total cost for the unicycle tire is 1 * 25 cents = 25 cents.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the tires: 250 cents + 225 cents + 25 cents = 500 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100. So, 500 cents is equal to 500 / 100 = 5 dollars.

Now, let's subtract the total cost from the $10 bill: $10 - $6 = $4.

So, Carl receives $4 in change.

The final answer is: $4"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Dave ate 14 french fries initially. 

The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 french fries. 

Now, there are 14 - 7 = 7 french fries left. 

Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate a total of 3 * 3 = 9 french fries. 

Now, there are 7 - 9 = -2 french fries left, but since you can't have a negative number of fries, this means that there were not enough fries for the pigeons to eat 9. This is a contradiction, but we can continue with the problem as if the pigeons ate all the remaining fries.

So, there are 0 french fries left after the pigeons ate. 

A raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries, but since there are 0 fries left, the raccoon stole 0 fries. 

Finally, ants carried off 1 french fry, leaving 0 - 1 = -1 french fry, but again, this is a contradiction. 

However, if we go back to the point where the pigeons ate, we can assume that they ate all the remaining fries, which is 7. 

Now, the raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries, which is 2/3 * 7 = 4.66 (round down to 4 since you can't have a fraction of a french fry). 

Now, there are 7 - 4 = 3 french fries left. 

The ants carried off 1 french fry, leaving 3 - 1 = 2 french fries. 

So, the pack had 2 + 14 = 16 french fries when Dave bought it.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how many hours Kimo spends attending classes in a week, we need to calculate the total hours he spends on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and the total hours he spends on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes each day, and each class is 1 hour long. So, the total hours he spends on these days is 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes each day, and each class is 2 hours long. So, the total hours he spends on these days is 2 * 2 * 2 = 8 hours.

The total hours Kimo spends attending classes in a week is 9 + 8 = 17 hours.

Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, we multiply the total hours Kimo spends in a week by 16 to find the total hours he spends in a semester. 

17 * 16 = 272

The final answer is: 272"
"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the length of each type of baked good in inches and then convert it to feet. 

First, let's calculate the total length of the rolls: 
300 rolls * 4 inches per roll = 1200 inches

Next, let's calculate the total length of the croissants: 
120 croissants * 6 inches per croissant = 720 inches

Now, let's calculate the total length of the baguettes. Since each baguette is 2 feet long, we need to convert the number of baguettes to inches first: 
60 baguettes * 12 inches per foot = 720 inches

Now, let's add up the total length of all the baked goods in inches: 
1200 inches (rolls) + 720 inches (croissants) + 720 inches (baguettes) = 2640 inches

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12: 
2640 inches / 12 = 220 feet

The final answer is: 220"
"To find out how many bananas the zookeeper needs to order, we need to calculate the total number of bananas needed for 2 months.

The monkeys need 200 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 200 x 2 = 400 bananas.

The gorillas need 400 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 400 x 2 = 800 bananas.

The baboons need 100 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 100 x 2 = 200 bananas.

Now, we add up the total number of bananas needed for all the apes: 400 (monkeys) + 800 (gorillas) + 200 (baboons) = 1400 bananas.

The zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months. 

1400"
"To find out who the winner is, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Since he's running back and forth, we multiply the distance by 2. So, Blake's total distance is 15 * 2 * 100 = 3000 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 100 yards. Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards (100 - 40 = 60, and 60 * 2 = 120, but since she's running to the 40-yard line, it's 80 yards). She does this 34 times. So, Kelly's total distance is 100 + (80 * 34) = 100 + 2720 = 2820 yards.

Since Blake's total distance (3000 yards) is more than Kelly's total distance (2820 yards), Blake is the winner.

To find out how much farther the winner ran than the loser, we subtract the loser's distance from the winner's distance: 3000 - 2820 = 180 yards.

The final answer is: 180"
"To find out how much Raphael spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the pens, notebooks, and the bond paper.

First, let's calculate the cost of the pens: 4 pens * $1.5 = $6

Next, let's calculate the cost of the notebooks: 2 notebooks * $4 = $8

Now, let's add the cost of the pens and notebooks: $6 + $8 = $14

Finally, let's add the cost of the bond paper to the total: $14 + $20 = $34

So, Raphael spent $34 on everything.

The final answer is: $34"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Finn initially sees 11 tadpoles. Then, 6 more tadpoles come out of hiding, so we add 6 to the initial number: 11 + 6 = 17. 

After that, 2 tadpoles hide under a rock, so we subtract 2 from the current number: 17 - 2 = 15.

So, Finn can see 15 tadpoles in the pond now.

"To find the depth of the water on Wednesday, we need to first find the depth of the water on Tuesday. 

The depth of the water on Monday is 17 feet. On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water, so the depth of the water on Tuesday is 17 + 7 = 24 feet.

Now, we need to find two thirds of the depth of the water on Tuesday. Two thirds of 24 is calculated by multiplying 24 by 2 and then dividing by 3. 

24 * 2 = 48
48 / 3 = 16

So, the depth of the water on Wednesday is 16 feet.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how many fish Anakin and Locsin caught, we need to calculate the total number of fish each of them caught and then add them together.

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. 

Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.
Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.
Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Now, let's add up the total number of fish caught by Anakin: 10 (starfish) + 6 (sea horses) + 3 (clownfish) = 19 fish.

Now, let's add up the total number of fish caught by Locsin: 5 (starfish) + 3 (sea horses) + 5 (clownfish) = 13 fish.

The total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin is 19 + 13 = 32.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the cost of the marbles after 36 months, we need to calculate the price increase every two months and add it to the original price.

Original price = $20

After 2 months, the price increases by 20% of $20, which is 0.2 x $20 = $4. 
New price after 2 months = $20 + $4 = $24

After 4 months, the price increases by 20% of $24, which is 0.2 x $24 = $4.80.
New price after 4 months = $24 + $4.80 = $28.80

After 6 months, the price increases by 20% of $28.80, which is 0.2 x $28.80 = $5.76.
New price after 6 months = $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56

After 8 months, the price increases by 20% of $34.56, which is 0.2 x $34.56 = $6.912.
New price after 8 months = $34.56 + $6.912 = $41.472

After 10 months, the price increases by 20% of $41.472, which is 0.2 x $41.472 = $8.2944.
New price after 10 months = $41.472 + $8.2944 = $49.7664

After 12 months, the price increases by 20% of $49.7664, which is 0.2 x $49.7664 = $9.95328.
New price after 12 months = $49.7664 + $9.95328 = $59.71968

After 14 months, the price increases by 20% of $59.71968, which is 0.2 x $59.71968 = $11.943936.
New price after 14 months = $59.71968 + $11.943936 = $71.663616

After 16 months, the price increases by 20% of $71.663616, which is 0.2 x $71.663616 = $14.3327232.
New price after 16 months = $71.663616 + $14.3327232 = $85.9963392

After 18 months, the price increases by 20% of $85.9963392, which is 0.2 x $85.9963392 = $17.19926784.

"To find the total worth of all the toys, we need to calculate the cost of each type of toy and then add them up.

The doll costs as much as 3 action figures. Since an action figure costs $5, the doll costs 3 x $5 = $15.

One red car costs $4. We have 5 red cars, so the total cost of the red cars is 5 x $4 = $20.

We have 3 action figures, and each costs $5, so the total cost of the action figures is 3 x $5 = $15.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the toys: $15 (doll) + $20 (red cars) + $15 (action figures) = $50.

The total worth of all the toys is $50.

"To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the difference between the income she'll lose by doing her taxes herself and the cost of hiring the accountant.

First, let's calculate the income she'll lose by doing her taxes herself. She'll be able to do 3 fewer hours of freelance work, and she'll lose $35/hour in missed income. 

Income lost = 3 hours * $35/hour = $105

Now, let's compare this to the cost of hiring the accountant, which is $90.

Difference = Income lost - Cost of hiring the accountant
= $105 - $90
= $15

So, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

The final answer is: $15"
"To find out how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to subtract the total cost of the computer accessories from her budget.

First, let's add up the cost of the accessories:

- Computer: €1090
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Total cost of accessories = €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102 = €1323

Now, let's subtract the total cost of the accessories from Elvira's budget:

Budget = €1500
Total cost of accessories = €1323

Money left for clothing = Budget - Total cost of accessories
= €1500 - €1323
= €177

So, Elvira will have €177 left for her clothing.

"To find out how many times Sandra has to babysit, we need to divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets each time she babysits. 

First, let's find out how many eggs Sandra needs in total. Since she needs 3 eggs for each Spanish flan and she's making 15, she needs 3 * 15 = 45 eggs.

Now, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets each time she babysits: 45 / 9 = 5.

So, Sandra has to babysit 5 times to get the eggs she needs for the Spanish flans.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let's say Brooke's current age is B. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's current age is 2B.

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be B + 2 and Seth's age will be 2B + 2.

According to the problem, the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28. So, we can write the equation:

(B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28

Combine like terms:

3B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3B = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 8

Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's age is 2B, which is 2 * 8 = 16.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much money Jimmy has, we need to first find out what twice the money Ethel has is.

There are 7 days in a week. Pancho walks 20 miles a day from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days. So, he walks 20 * 5 = 100 miles from Monday to Friday. 

On Saturday and Sunday, he walks 10 miles each day. So, he walks 10 * 2 = 20 miles on the weekends.

Now, let's add the miles he walks from Monday to Friday and the miles he walks on the weekends. 100 + 20 = 120 miles.

So, Pancho walks 120 miles in a week.

"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of the hat, jacket, and pants separately and then add them together.

The hat costs $25.

The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so the jacket costs 3 x $25 = $75.

The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. To find the average, we add the costs of the hat and jacket and divide by 2. The average cost is ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50.

Now, we add the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants together: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

The total cost of each uniform is $150.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red.
2. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four.
3. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, and Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.

From point 3, we know Sally Four is 8 years old. 

From point 2, we know Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

From point 1, we know Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we have the ages of three birds: Sally Four (8), Granny Red (16), and Sally Two (19). 

The only bird left is Sally, but we don't have any information about Sally's age. However, the question asks for the total age of the four birds, and we have three of them. Since Sally is not mentioned in the other points, we can assume Sally is the same as Sally Two, Sally Four, or Sally Thirtytwo. 

Given that Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old, and Sally Four is also 8 years old, it's likely that Sally is Sally Four or Sally Thirtytwo. However, since Sally Thirtytwo is mentioned separately, it's more likely that Sally is Sally Four. 

So, the total age of the four birds is 8 (Sally Four) + 8 (Sally Thirtytwo) + 16 (Granny Red) + 19 (Sally Two) = 51 years.

"To find out how much Jessica pays in a year, we need to calculate the total amount she pays each month and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's calculate the minimum payments for each debt:

- Student loans: $300
- Credit card: $200
- Mortgage: $500

Since Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we need to calculate 50% of each minimum payment and add it to the minimum payment.

- Student loans: $300 + (50% of $300) = $300 + $150 = $450
- Credit card: $200 + (50% of $200) = $200 + $100 = $300
- Mortgage: $500 + (50% of $500) = $500 + $250 = $750

Now, let's add up the total amount she pays each month:

$450 (student loans) + $300 (credit card) + $750 (mortgage) = $1500

To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the total monthly payment by 12:

$1500 * 12 = $18,000

"To find the total time it takes Billy to peel and cut all the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel one potato and multiply it by the total number of potatoes, then add the time it takes to cut one potato and multiply it by the total number of potatoes.

Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds = 5/60 minutes (converting seconds to minutes)

Now, let's calculate the total time to peel all the potatoes:
60 potatoes * 1.5 minutes/potato = 90 minutes

Now, let's calculate the total time to cut all the potatoes:
60 potatoes * (5/60) minutes/potato = 5 minutes

Now, we add the total time to peel and cut all the potatoes:
90 minutes + 5 minutes = 95 minutes

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, let's find out how much they make per gallon. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon, so they make 20 x $0.50 = $10 per gallon.

Now, let's find out their profit per gallon. They make $10 per gallon and their total profit is $25. Since they made this profit from selling one gallon, their cost per gallon must be $10 - $25 = -$15. However, since you can't spend a negative amount of money, this means they must have made more than one gallon.

Let's say they made x gallons. Their total revenue is $10x and their total cost is $3x (for lemons) + $2x (for sugar) = $5x. Their total profit is $10x - $5x = $5x. We know that their total profit is $25, so $5x = $25.

To find x, we divide both sides by 5: x = $25 / $5 = 5.

Now that we know they made 5 gallons, we can find out how much they spent on lemons. They spent $3 per gallon on lemons, so they spent 5 x $3 = $15 on lemons.

"To find out how much money Zaid has left, we need to follow the order of operations. 

First, let's find out how much Zaid spends on rent. He earns 6000$ per month and spends 1/4 of it on rent. 

1/4 of 6000 is 6000 / 4 = 1500.

Now, let's find out how much he spends on car fuel. He spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel. 

1/3 of 6000 is 6000 / 3 = 2000.

Now, let's subtract the rent and car fuel expenses from his total salary. 

6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500.

Now, he donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity. 

Half of 2500 is 2500 / 2 = 1250.

Now, let's subtract the donation from the remaining amount. 

2500 - 1250 = 1250.

Now, let's subtract the money he gives to his daughter and wife. 

1250 - 200 - 700 = 350.

So, Zaid will have 350$ left after all these expenses and donations.

Bo has 40 crabs. 
Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs. 
Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

To find the total number of crabs the three have together, we need to add the number of crabs each one has. 
Total crabs = Bo's crabs + Monic's crabs + Rani's crabs
Total crabs = 40 + 36 + 46
Total crabs = 122

For the second week, Lloyd tutored 8 hours at $10 an hour, so his earnings for the second week are:
8 hours * $10/hour = $80

Now, we add his earnings for both weeks together:
$50 + $80 = $130

So, Lloyd earned $130 for the first two weeks."
"To find the number of votes the loser got, we need to first find the number of votes the winner got. Since the winner got 3/4 of the votes, we can multiply the total number of votes by 3/4.

Total votes = 80
Winner's votes = 3/4 * 80
Winner's votes = 60

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser got is the remaining 1/4 of the total votes. We can find this by subtracting the winner's votes from the total votes.

Loser's votes = Total votes - Winner's votes
Loser's votes = 80 - 60
Loser's votes = 20

She also ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations. This means the number of white carnations is 200 / 5 = 40.

Now that we know the number of white carnations is 40, we can find the number of red roses. Since the number of red roses is four times the number of white carnations, the number of red roses is 4 * 40 = 160.

So, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem.

1. Jean is two years older than Mark.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age.
3. Jan is 30 years old.

From point 2, we know that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. Since Jan is 30 now, two years ago, Jan was 28. Half of 28 is 14. So, two years ago, Mark was 14 + 5 = 19 years old.

Since Mark was 19 two years ago, Mark is 19 + 2 = 21 years old now.

From point 1, Jean is two years older than Mark. So, Jean is 21 + 2 = 23 years old.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total time for each team, we need to add up the time for each runner. 

The well-rounded team's total time is 55 seconds for each runner, so their total time is 55 * 4 = 220 seconds.

The less well-rounded team's first runner runs 60 seconds, the second runner runs 60 - 3 = 57 seconds, the third runner runs 57 - 3 = 54 seconds, and the fourth runner runs 54 - 3 = 51 seconds. 

The less well-rounded team's total time is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 162 seconds.

The difference in time between the two teams is 220 - 162 = 58 seconds.

The faster team will win by 58 seconds."
"To find the probability of Jerry rolling a number greater than 3, we need to count the favorable outcomes and divide it by the total possible outcomes. 

There are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, and 6) out of 6 possible outcomes. So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 = 1/2 or 50%.

To find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to count the favorable outcomes and divide it by the total possible outcomes. 

The possible even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, the probability of rolling an even number is 3/6 = 1/2. 

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 or 25%.

Now, to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row, we need to subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3.

50% - 25% = 25%

So, it is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

"To find out how many apples Jenna picked, we need to find half of the number of apples her mom picked. Since her mom picked 20 apples, we can divide 20 by 2 to find out how many apples Jenna picked.

20 / 2 = 10

Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, and her mom picked 20 apples, Jenna picked 10 apples.

To find the total number of apples they both picked, we need to add the number of apples Jenna picked to the number of apples her mom picked.

20 (mom's apples) + 10 (Jenna's apples) = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how many rats are in each cage, we need to figure out how many rats and hamsters there are in total and then use that information to find out how many rats are in each cage.

First, let's find out how many pieces of straw are given to the hamsters. There are 10 cages of hamsters and each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw. So, the total number of straw given to hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.

Now, we know that 160 pieces of straw are distributed among the small rodents, and 50 pieces are given to the hamsters. So, the number of straw given to the rats is 160 - 50 = 110.

The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. Let's say the number of rats in each cage is 'r'. Then, the total number of rats is 3r.

Since each rat gets 6 pieces of straw, the total number of straw given to the rats is 6 * 3r = 18r.

We know that the total number of straw given to the rats is 110. So, we can set up the equation 18r = 110.

To find 'r', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 18. 

r = 110 / 18
r = 6.11 (approximately)

Since we can't have a fraction of a rat, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, we need to check if 6 rats in each cage will give us a total of 110 straw. 

6 * 6 * 3 = 108 (which is less than 110)

If we try 7 rats in each cage, we get:
7 * 6 * 3 = 126 (which is more than 110)

So, we need to find a number between 6 and 7. Let's try 6.11 (which is not possible) and 6 and 7. Since 6.11 is not possible, we'll try 6 and 7. 

6.11 is between 6 and 7, so we'll try 6 and 7. We already know that 6 rats in each cage will give us 108 straw, which is less than 110. So, we'll try 7 rats in each cage, which will give us 126 straw, which is more than 110.

"To find out how much Mandy should pay Benedict after 3 months, we need to calculate the interest for 3 months and add it to the initial amount.

The initial amount Mandy owes is $100.
The monthly interest rate is 2%.

To calculate the interest for 1 month, we multiply the initial amount by the interest rate:
$100 * 0.02 = $2

Since the interest is for 3 months, we multiply the interest for 1 month by 3:
$2 * 3 = $6

Now, we add the interest to the initial amount to find the total amount Mandy should pay:
$100 + $6 = $106

So, Mandy should pay $106 to Benedict.

The final answer is: $106"
"To find the number of bags the trader sold, we need to first find the total cost and the total revenue. 

Let's denote the number of bags as 'x'. 

The total cost of buying the bags is $20x (since each bag costs $20). 
The total cost of transporting the bags is $2x (since each bag costs $2 to transport). 
The total cost is $20x + $2x = $22x.

The total revenue from selling the bags is $30x (since each bag is sold at $30).

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is given as $400. So, we can set up the equation:

$30x - $22x = $400

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$8x = $400

To find the value of x, we divide both sides by 8:

x = $400 / $8
x = 50

So, the trader sold 50 bags. 

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how much each friend paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets, food, and rides, and then divide it by 3.

First, let's find the cost of the food. They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. Since they spent $20.25 on tickets, the cost of food is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.

The cost of the rides is 2 rides * $33 per ride = $66.

Now, let's add up the total cost: $20.25 (tickets) + $15.75 (food) + $66 (rides) = $102.

Since they agreed to split the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3: $102 / 3 = $34.

He collects peaches for 3 hours. 
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 3 hours by 60 minutes to get the total number of minutes: 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, we multiply the number of peaches he collects per minute by the total number of minutes: 2 peaches/minute * 180 minutes = 360 peaches.

"To find out how many trees Tom has left, we need to calculate the total number of trees he has after 10 years, and then subtract the trees that die.

First, let's find out how many trees Tom plants and chops down in 10 years. 

He plants 10 trees a year, so in 10 years, he plants 10 x 10 = 100 trees.
He chops down 2 trees a year, so in 10 years, he chops down 2 x 10 = 20 trees.

Now, let's find out how many trees he has after 10 years. He starts with 50 trees, plants 100 trees, and chops down 20 trees. So, he has 50 + 100 - 20 = 130 trees.

After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. To find out how many trees die, we need to calculate 30% of 130. 
30% of 130 is 0.3 x 130 = 39.

Now, let's subtract the trees that die from the total number of trees. 
130 - 39 = 91.

So, Tom has 91 trees left.

"To find out how many more pink plastic flamingos were out than white plastic flamingos, we need to first find out how many pink and white flamingos were out on Sunday.

On Friday, there were 18 pink flamingos. On Saturday, the neighbors took one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6. They painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back out. So, there were 6 white flamingos and 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos left.

On Sunday, the neighbors added 18 more pink flamingos to the collection. So, there were 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

To find out how many more pink plastic flamingos were out than white plastic flamingos, we need to subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

Since Violetta needs 5 crayons, she can buy 5 crayons with $10. She will have $10 left as change.

So, the change Violetta will get is $10."
"To find the cost of 8 pens, we first need to find the cost of one pen. 

Since a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined, we can add the cost of a pencil and an eraser to find the cost of a pen. 

Cost of a pencil = $1.20
Cost of an eraser = $0.30
Cost of a pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser
Cost of a pen = $1.20 + $0.30
Cost of a pen = $1.50

Now that we know the cost of one pen, we can multiply it by 8 to find the cost of 8 pens.

Cost of 8 pens = Cost of a pen * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $1.50 * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $12

Total pounds of carrots used = 40 * 2
Total pounds of carrots used = 80 pounds

Now, we need to subtract the total pounds of carrots used from the total pounds of carrots available to find out how many pounds will not be used.

Total pounds of carrots available = 200 pounds
Pounds of carrots not used = Total pounds of carrots available - Total pounds of carrots used
Pounds of carrots not used = 200 - 80
Pounds of carrots not used = 120

In the first month, she collected three times the number of cards she initially had, which is 3 * 20 = 60 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month, which is 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months. The combined number is 60 + 40 = 100. Twice that number is 2 * 100 = 200 cards.

To find the total number of cards Elaine has now, we add the cards she had initially to the cards she collected in each month: 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320.

The final answer is: 320"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Mark edits 1000 sentences each week. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, he edits 1000 / 2 = 500 sentences for each publisher.

Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence, so the total amount Mark makes from Publisher A is 500 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents.

Since Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, Publisher B pays 2 * 5 cents/sentence = 10 cents/sentence.

The total amount Mark makes from Publisher B is 500 sentences * 10 cents/sentence = 5000 cents.

To find the total amount Mark makes in a week, we add the amounts from both publishers: 2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents.

The final answer is: 7500"
"To find out how many liters of water Baldur gets every day, we need to calculate the total number of pails he gets in a day and then multiply it by the number of liters in each pail.

Baldur gets 5 pails of water every morning and 6 pails of water every afternoon. So, the total number of pails he gets in a day is 5 + 6 = 11 pails.

Since each pail contains 5 liters of water, we multiply the total number of pails by the number of liters in each pail: 11 pails * 5 liters/pail = 55 liters.

The final answer is: 55"
"To find out how much John made that year, we need to calculate his total earnings from his weekly salary and the one-time award.

First, let's calculate his total weekly earnings for the year. Since he makes $2000 a week and there are 52 weeks in a year, his total weekly earnings would be:

2000 * 52 = 104,000

Now, let's calculate the 5% raise in salary. A 5% raise on his current salary of $2000 would be:

2000 * 0.05 = 100

So, his new salary would be:

2000 + 100 = 2100

Now, let's calculate his total earnings for the year with the new salary:

2100 * 52 = 109,200

Now, let's add the one-time award of $5000 to his total earnings:

109,200 + 5000 = 114,200

So, John made a total of $114,200 that year.

The final answer is: $114,200"
"To find out how many barrels of wine Josie's farm produces per year, we need to calculate the total number of tons of grapes first, and then multiply that by the number of barrels each ton makes.

Since each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year, and there are 10 acres, we multiply 5 tons by 10 acres to get the total tons of grapes.

5 tons/acre * 10 acres = 50 tons

Now, we know that each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine. So, we multiply the total tons of grapes by 2 to get the total barrels of wine.

50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how many slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the total number of slices used in the sandwiches, omelets, and macaroni and cheese.

Carl ate a sandwich every day for a week, which is 7 days. He used 2 slices of cheese per sandwich, so the total number of slices used in sandwiches is 7 * 2 = 14.

He ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days, using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. So, he used 3 slices per omelet. The total number of slices used in omelets is 3 * 3 = 9.

He used 8 slices of cheese in the macaroni and cheese dish.

To find the total number of slices used, we add the slices used in sandwiches, omelets, and macaroni and cheese: 14 + 9 + 8 = 31.

The final answer is: 31"
"To find out how many pens Janet has now, we need to calculate the total number of pens she had initially and then add the pens she bought.

Janet initially had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, so she had a total of 22 + 10 = 32 pens.

She bought 6 bags of blue pens, and each bag had 9 pens, so she bought 6 x 9 = 54 blue pens.

She also bought 2 bags of red pens, and each bag had 6 pens, so she bought 2 x 6 = 12 red pens.

Now, let's add the pens she bought to the pens she already had: 54 (blue) + 12 (red) = 66 pens.

So, the total number of pens Janet has now is 32 (initial pens) + 66 (new pens) = 98 pens.

The final answer is: 98"
"To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we first need to find the total score she needs for the semester. 

Since Mr. Bert allows the students to remove the lowest score, we need to find the lowest score among the five test scores Brinley has so far. The scores are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. The lowest score is 71.

Now, we remove the lowest score from the list: 89, 92, 100, 86.

To find the total score needed for the semester, we multiply the desired average by the number of tests. The desired average is 93, and there are 6 tests. 

Total score needed = Desired average * Number of tests
Total score needed = 93 * 6
Total score needed = 558

Now, we add up the remaining scores: 89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367.

Since we removed the lowest score, we need to add the lowest score to the total score needed to find the total score of all six tests. The lowest score is 71.

Total score of all six tests = Total score needed + Lowest score
Total score of all six tests = 558 + 71
Total score of all six tests = 629

Now, we subtract the total score of the first five tests from the total score of all six tests to find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test.

Score needed on the sixth test = Total score of all six tests - Total score of the first five tests
Score needed on the sixth test = 629 - 367
Score needed on the sixth test = 262

The final answer is: 262"
"To find the total number of kilometers Michael rode his bike, we need to calculate the total kilometers for the first four weeks and the total kilometers for the next three weeks, then add them together.

In the first four weeks, Michael rode his bike 5 times a week for 4 weeks. So, the total number of times he rode his bike in the first four weeks is 5 * 4 = 20 times. Since he rode 25 kilometers each time, the total kilometers in the first four weeks is 20 * 25 = 500 kilometers.

In the next three weeks, Michael rode his bike 2 times a week for 3 weeks. So, the total number of times he rode his bike in the next three weeks is 2 * 3 = 6 times. Since he rode 60 kilometers each time, the total kilometers in the next three weeks is 6 * 60 = 360 kilometers.

Now, we add the total kilometers from the first four weeks and the next three weeks: 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers.

The final answer is: 860"
"To find the total weight of the bag of candy, we need to find the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples, then add them together.

First, let's find the weight of the chocolate bars. We know that there are 25 chocolate bars and each chocolate bar weighs 40g. 

Weight of chocolate bars = Number of chocolate bars * Weight of each chocolate bar
Weight of chocolate bars = 25 * 40g
Weight of chocolate bars = 1000g

Next, we need to find the weight of the candied apples. We know that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, so the weight of each candied apple is half the weight of each chocolate bar.

Weight of each candied apple = Weight of each chocolate bar / 2
Weight of each candied apple = 40g / 2
Weight of each candied apple = 20g

Now, we can find the total weight of the candied apples by multiplying the weight of each candied apple by the number of candied apples.

Weight of candied apples = Number of candied apples * Weight of each candied apple
Weight of candied apples = 80 * 20g
Weight of candied apples = 1600g

Finally, we can find the total weight of the bag of candy by adding the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples.

Total weight of the bag of candy = Weight of chocolate bars + Weight of candied apples
Total weight of the bag of candy = 1000g + 1600g
Total weight of the bag of candy = 2600g

On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.

On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 cakes.

On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is 5 * 12 = 60 cakes.

Now, let's add up the number of cakes she bought each day: 4 + 12 + 60 = 76.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. 

First, let's find the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since each plate costs $6000, half a dozen plates will cost 6 * $6000 = $36,000.

Now, we know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than $36,000. So, the total cost of twenty dozen cups is $36,000 - $1200 = $34,800.

Since there are 12 cups in a dozen, twenty dozen cups will be 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

To find the cost of each cup, we need to divide the total cost of twenty dozen cups by the number of cups. 

Cost of each cup = Total cost of twenty dozen cups / Number of cups
= $34,800 / 240
= $144

The final answer is: $144"
"To find out how many times Sara must mow the lawn, we need to calculate how much money she needs to earn and how much she earns from babysitting and mowing the lawn.

The total cost of the jacket and 2 pairs of shoes is $30 + $20 * 2 = $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved. She earns $5 each time she babysits and $4 each time she mows the lawn. 

Let's calculate how much more money she needs to earn: $70 - $10 = $60.

Now, let's calculate how much she earns from babysitting: $5 * 4 = $20.

So, she needs to earn $60 - $20 = $40 from mowing the lawn.

Since she earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, she needs to mow the lawn $40 / $4 = 10 times.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's say the number of red chickens is x. Since Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, the number of white chickens is x + 2.

The total number of eggs produced by the red chickens is 3x, and the total number of eggs produced by the white chickens is 5(x + 2). The total number of eggs collected is 42, so we can set up the equation:

3x + 5(x + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3x + 5x + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8x + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8x = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

x = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the total distance he walks and then divide it by his speed.

The park is a rectangle, so we need to find the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all its sides. 

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
Perimeter = 2 * (6 + 1.5)
Perimeter = 2 * 7.5
Perimeter = 15 miles

Since Gary walks around the edge of the park, he covers the entire perimeter. 

Now, we need to divide the perimeter by his speed to find the time he spends walking.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. 

On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so she counted 100 + 50 = 150 customers.

The total number of customers by the third day was 500. To find out how many customers she counted on the third day, we need to subtract the total number of customers on the first two days from the total number of customers by the third day.

Total customers on the first two days = 100 + 150 = 250

Customers on the third day = Total customers by the third day - Total customers on the first two days
= 500 - 250
= 250

"Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago is x gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the amount of water in the big pool 4 minutes ago is 2x gallons.

Since both pools leak at 4 gallons/minute, in 4 minutes, each pool will lose 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water.

So, the amount of water in the small pool now is x - 16 gallons, and the amount of water in the big pool now is 2x - 16 gallons.

We are given that the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. We can set up an equation based on this information:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x - 16 = 4x - 64

Subtracting 2x from both sides gives us:

-16 = 2x - 64

Adding 64 to both sides gives us:

48 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

24 = x

So, the small pool had 24 gallons of water 4 minutes ago. 

Now, we need to find out how much water is in the small pool now. We subtract the 16 gallons that leaked out:

24 - 16 = 8

The small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn, which is the cost of the shoes and the belt. 

Total cost = cost of shoes + cost of belt
Total cost = $320.00 + $32.00
Total cost = $352.00

Since Lori earns $8.00 an hour, we can divide the total cost by her hourly wage to find out how many hours she needs to work.

Hours to work = Total cost / Hourly wage
Hours to work = $352.00 / $8.00
Hours to work = 44 hours

"To find out Janeth's remaining balance, we need to calculate the total amount she will pay in 12 months and then subtract that from the initial amount she borrowed plus the additional 10%.

First, let's calculate the total amount she will pay in 12 months:

$165 per month for 12 months = $165 * 12 = $1980

Now, let's calculate the total amount she borrowed with the additional 10%:

10% of $2000 = 0.1 * $2000 = $200
Total amount = $2000 + $200 = $2200

Now, let's subtract the total amount she will pay from the total amount she borrowed:

$2200 - $1980 = $220

So, Janeth's remaining balance by then will be $220."
"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to know the number of dahlias and add it to the number of roses. 

First, we know there are 4 roses. Then, we are told there are 7 more dahlias than roses. So, the number of dahlias is 4 (number of roses) + 7 (more dahlias) = 11 dahlias.

Now, we add the number of roses and dahlias to get the total number of flowers: 4 (roses) + 11 (dahlias) = 15.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Harriet's current age is 21 years.
2. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack's age is 2 * Harriet's age = 2 * 21 = 42 years.
3. Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, so Adrian's age is 3 * Harriet's age = 3 * 21 = 63 years.

Now, let's calculate their ages in three years:

1. Harriet's age in three years = 21 + 3 = 24 years.
2. Zack's age in three years = 42 + 3 = 45 years.
3. Adrian's age in three years = 63 + 3 = 66 years.

To find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages and divide by 3:

Average age = (24 + 45 + 66) / 3
Average age = 135 / 3
Average age = 45

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first find out how many points Yuri and Brianna scored. 

Naomi scored 68 points. 
Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Half of 68 is 34, and 10 more than that is 44. So, Yuri scored 44 points. 
Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, we know that the total points scored by the four students is 251. We can subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total to find out how many points Jojo scored. 
Jojo's points = Total points - (Naomi's points + Yuri's points + Brianna's points)

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how much money Johnny had after a year, we need to follow the steps he took.

First, Johnny started with $20 and added an extra $10 to it. So, his total amount of money is $20 + $10 = $30.

Then, he invested this sum of money, which tripled in a year. This means that his $30 tripled, so we need to multiply $30 by 3.

$30 * 3 = $90

So, after a year, Johnny had $90."
"To find the sum of the ages of the three girls, we need to find the ages of Mary and Joan first.

Jessa is 20 years old. 
Joan is five years older than Jessa, so Joan is 20 + 5 = 25 years old.
Mary is two years younger than Joan, so Mary is 25 - 2 = 23 years old.

Now, we can find the sum of their ages: 
20 (Jessa) + 25 (Joan) + 23 (Mary) = 68

The final answer is: 68"
"To find the number of students who went out through exit C, we need to follow the given sequence of events.

First, 30% of the students went out through exit A. 
30% of 1000 is 0.3 x 1000 = 300 students.

Now, the remaining students are 1000 - 300 = 700.

Then, 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B. 
3/5 of 700 is (3/5) x 700 = 420 students.

Now, the remaining students are 700 - 420 = 280.

The rest of the students went out through exit C, which is 280.

The final answer is: 280"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

We know that John has 54 candies. We also know that John has twice as many candies as Robert. So, we can find out how many candies Robert has by dividing the number of candies John has by 2.

Robert's candies = John's candies / 2
Robert's candies = 54 / 2
Robert's candies = 27

We also know that James has 6 more candies than Robert. So, we can find out how many candies James has by adding 6 to Robert's candies.

James' candies = Robert's candies + 6
James' candies = 27 + 6
James' candies = 33

Now, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James. To do this, we subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has.

Difference = John's candies - James' candies
Difference = 54 - 33
Difference = 21

"Let's break it down step by step. 

Dolly has 2 books and Pandora has 1 book. 

Dolly will read her own 2 books and Pandora's 1 book, so Dolly will read a total of 3 books. 

Pandora will read her own 1 book and Dolly's 2 books, so Pandora will read a total of 3 books.

In total, they will read 3 (Dolly's total) + 3 (Pandora's total) = 6 books.

"To find out how many hours Mike spends writing a week, we need to calculate the total number of letters he writes and then multiply it by the time it takes him to write one page.

First, let's find out how many letters Mike writes in a week. He has 3 pen pals left, and they each send 2 letters a week. So, the total number of letters he receives is 3 * 2 = 6 letters.

Since he responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters a week.

Each letter is 5 pages long, so the total number of pages he writes in a week is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

It takes him 6 minutes to write one page, so the total time he spends writing in a week is 30 * 6 = 180 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). 

180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many minutes Jason has left, we need to calculate the total minutes he used for his daily calls and the extra minutes, then subtract that from his total minutes.

First, let's calculate the total minutes Jason used for his daily calls. He has a 15-minute call with his boss every day, and this month has 30 days. 

15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes

He also had 300 extra minutes of calls this month. 

Total minutes used = 450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes

Now, let's subtract the total minutes used from his total minutes. 

1000 minutes - 750 minutes = 250 minutes

So, Jason has 250 minutes left.

The final answer is: 250"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Griffin initially had 24 fries. Kyle took 5 of them, so Griffin was left with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.

Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so Billy took 2 x 5 = 10 fries. Now, Griffin has 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

Ginger gave Griffin some fries, and then Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had taken. Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries.

After Colby took 2 fries, Griffin had 9 - 2 = 7 fries. But we know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. So, Ginger must have given Griffin 27 - 7 = 20 fries.

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let's say the number of fish in each aquarium is x. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28.

According to the problem, this difference is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums, so we can set up the equation:

28 = 2(2x)

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

14 = 2x

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2 again to find the value of x:

x = 7

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find out how much Jean paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the makeup first. 

The makeup artist charges $250 an hour and works 6 hours a day. So, the daily cost is 250 * 6 = $1500.

Since she needs it done 4 times a week, the weekly cost is 1500 * 4 = $6000.

The movie takes 5 weeks to finish, so the total cost before the discount is 6000 * 5 = $30,000.

After the movie is done, the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount. To find the discount amount, we multiply the total cost by 0.1: 30000 * 0.1 = $3000.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost: 30000 - 3000 = $27000.

So, Jean paid $27,000."
"To find out how much each person paid, we need to first find the total cost of the party supplies. 

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the cake, presents, decorations, invitations, and goodie bags. 

Total cost = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96

Since Isabelle and her two parents split the cost evenly, there are 3 people in total. 

To find out how much each person paid, we divide the total cost by 3.

$96 / 3 = $32

Each person paid $32."
"To find out how much the chef spent, we need to calculate the total weight of the onions and then multiply it by the cost per pound.

The chef bought 4 bags of onions, and each bag weighs 50 pounds. So, the total weight of the onions is:

4 bags * 50 pounds/bag = 200 pounds

Since a pound of onions costs $1.50, the total cost is:

200 pounds * $1.50/pound = $300

The chef spent $300."
"Let's break down the information given. 

On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 5 cookies, so Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday.

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 13 cookies, so Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.

To find the total number of cookies Sue ate, we add the cookies she ate on Monday and Tuesday: 20 + 26 = 46 cookies.

Her sister ate 5 + 13 = 18 cookies in total.

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, Sue consumed 46 * 200 = 9200 calories and her sister consumed 18 * 200 = 3600 calories.

The difference in calories consumed is 9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories.

The final answer is: 5600"
"To find the number of boys in the third class, we need to first find the total number of girls in the school and then the total number of boys. 

Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, and there are 3 classes with 20 students each, the total number of students in the school is 3 * 20 = 60.

The total number of girls in the school is 50% of 60, which is 0.5 * 60 = 30.

We already know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27.

Now, we subtract the total number of girls in the first two classes from the total number of girls in the school to find the number of girls in the third class: 30 - 27 = 3.

Since the school is 50% girls, the number of boys in the school is also 30. 

The total number of boys in the first two classes is 60 - (15 + 12) = 33. 

Now, we subtract the total number of boys in the first two classes from the total number of boys in the school to find the number of boys in the third class: 30 - 33 is incorrect, we need to find the boys in the third class. We know the total number of students in the third class is 20. Since the total number of girls in the third class is 3, the number of boys in the third class is 20 - 3 = 17.

"Let's break down the information given. 

Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars. 

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's say the number of cougars he killed today is x. Then, the number of wolves he killed today is 3x.

We also know that Rick killed three fewer cougars today than the previous night. So, the number of cougars he killed today is 15 - 3 = 12.

Since we know the number of cougars he killed today is 12, we can set up the equation 3x = 12 to find the number of wolves he killed today. 

Solving for x, we get x = 12 / 3 = 4. However, this is the number of cougars, not wolves. We already know that the number of wolves he killed today is 3x, so the number of wolves he killed today is 3 * 4 = 12.

To find the total number of animals Rick killed, we add the number of animals he killed last night and the number of animals he killed today. 

Total animals killed = 10 (wolves) + 15 (cougars) + 12 (wolves) + 12 (cougars) = 49

"To find out how many times Anne went down the slide, we need to calculate 30% of 30, which is 0.3 x 30 = 9. 

Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we subtract 9 from 30 to get 30 - 9 = 21. 

Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne, so we multiply 21 by 4 to get 21 x 4 = 84.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we first need to find out how many cows Mr. Sylas added to each stall. 

There are 10 stalls initially with 20 cows each, so there are 10 * 20 = 200 cows in total. 

Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows and adds them to the stalls. Now, there are 200 + 40 = 240 cows in total. 

Since Mr. Sylas divides the 40 new cows equally among the 10 stalls, each stall gets 40 / 10 = 4 new cows. 

So, each stall now has 20 (initial cows) + 4 (new cows) = 24 cows. 

Now, we need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. Since each stall has 24 cows, 8 stalls will have 8 * 24 = 192 cows.

"To find the total weight of the redwood tree, we need to calculate the total number of 10-foot sections and then multiply it by the weight of each section. 

The redwood tree is 200 feet tall, so we divide 200 by 10 to get the total number of sections: 200 / 10 = 20 sections.

Each section weighs 400 pounds, so we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section: 20 * 400 = 8000 pounds.

However, termites ate 30% of the wood, so we need to subtract 30% of 8000 from the total weight. To find 30% of 8000, we multiply 8000 by 0.3: 8000 * 0.3 = 2400.

Now, we subtract 2400 from the total weight: 8000 - 2400 = 5600 pounds.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal.
2. Andrea has 52 apples, so Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.
3. Jamal has half as many bananas as apples, so Jamal has 44 / 2 = 22 bananas.
4. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, but this is not true, so we need to find the correct number of bananas for Jamal. Let's say Jamal has x bananas. Then, Jamal has x - 4 apples. Since Jamal has 44 apples, we can set up the equation x - 4 = 44.
5. Solving the equation, we get x = 48 bananas for Jamal.
6. Now we know Jamal has 48 bananas and 44 apples. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.
7. To find the total number of fruits, we add the number of apples and bananas for both Andrea and Jamal: 52 (Andrea's apples) + 44 (Jamal's apples) + 24 (Andrea's bananas) + 48 (Jamal's bananas) = 168.

"To find out how many cups of flour Carla needs, we need to calculate the total number of cookies she's making and then divide that by the number of cups needed per dozen cookies.

Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow. So, the total number of cookies is 36 + 30 = 66.

Since 1 dozen (12) cookies need 2 cups of flour, we can find out how many cups are needed per cookie by dividing 2 cups by 12 cookies. 2 cups / 12 cookies = 1/6 cup per cookie.

Now, we multiply the total number of cookies by the amount of flour needed per cookie: 66 cookies * 1/6 cup/cookie = 11 cups.

So, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow.

"To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, we need to first find out how many stitches the collar and the rosette take. 

The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches, which is 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, we know that the total number of stitches in the sweater is 1800. We already know that the body takes 900 stitches and the collar and rosette take 90 and 180 stitches respectively. 

So, the total number of stitches taken by the collar and the rosette is 90 + 180 = 270 stitches.

Now, we subtract the total number of stitches taken by the collar and the rosette from the total number of stitches in the sweater to find out how many stitches the body and the sleeves take together: 1800 - 270 = 1530 stitches.

Since the body takes 900 stitches, the sleeves take 1530 - 900 = 630 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the total number of stitches taken by the sleeves by 2 to find out how many stitches each sleeve takes: 630 / 2 = 315 stitches.

"To find out how many cards had the letter D on them, we need to first find out how many cards had the letters A, B, and C on them, and then subtract that from the total number of cards.

First, we find out how many cards had the letter A on them. 2/5 of the cards had the letter A, so we multiply 80 by 2/5.

80 * (2/5) = 80 * 2 / 5 = 160 / 5 = 32

So, 32 cards had the letter A on them.

Now, we need to find out how many cards were left after removing the cards with the letter A. 

80 - 32 = 48

Now, 1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B on them. We multiply 48 by 1/2.

48 * (1/2) = 48 * 1 / 2 = 48 / 2 = 24

So, 24 cards had the letter B on them.

Now, we need to find out how many cards were left after removing the cards with the letter B. 

48 - 24 = 24

Now, 5/8 of the remaining cards had the letter C on them. We multiply 24 by 5/8.

24 * (5/8) = 24 * 5 / 8 = 120 / 8 = 15

So, 15 cards had the letter C on them.

"To find the total time it takes Matthew to dig the holes, we need to calculate the time for small holes and large holes separately and then add them together.

Time for small holes: 3 minutes per hole * 30 holes = 90 minutes
Time for large holes: 10 minutes per hole * 15 holes = 150 minutes

Total time in minutes: 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 
240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours

The final answer is: 4"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Let's say Mico's age is x and Marco's age is (20 - x), since their sum of ages is 20.

In 10 years, Mico's age will be x + 10 and Marco's age will be (20 - x) + 10.

The sum of their ages in 10 years will be (x + 10) + ((20 - x) + 10).

Simplifying the equation, we get (x + 10) + (20 - x + 10) = 30.

So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say Sam's current age is 'x'. Since Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, Ruby's current age is 6x.

In 9 years, Sam's age will be x + 9 and Ruby's age will be 6x + 9.

According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. So, we can set up the equation:

6x + 9 = 3(x + 9)

Now, let's solve the equation:

6x + 9 = 3x + 27

Subtract 3x from both sides:

3x + 9 = 27

Subtract 9 from both sides:

3x = 18

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 6

So, Sam is 6 years old now.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total amount Peter paid, we need to calculate the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars separately and then add them together.

The cost of the popsicles is 20 popsicles * $0.25 per popsicle = $5.

The cost of the ice cream bars is 4 ice cream bars * $0.50 per ice cream bar = $2.

Now, we add the cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars together: $5 + $2 = $7.

The final answer is: $7"
"To find the total number of spots on the cobras, we multiply the number of cobras by the number of spots on one cobra. 

Number of cobras: 40
Number of spots on one cobra: 70
Total spots on cobras: 40 * 70 = 2800

Since the cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, we can find the number of spots on one mamba by dividing the number of spots on a cobra by 2.

Number of spots on one mamba: 70 / 2 = 35

Now, we multiply the number of mambas by the number of spots on one mamba to find the total number of spots on the mambas.

Number of mambas: 60
Number of spots on one mamba: 35
Total spots on mambas: 60 * 35 = 2100

Now, we add the total number of spots on the cobras and the mambas to find the combined total.

Total spots on cobras: 2800
Total spots on mambas: 2100
Combined total spots: 2800 + 2100 = 4900

To find half the number of spots, we divide the combined total by 2.

Half the combined total spots: 4900 / 2 = 2450"
"To find out how many pizzas Maddy will need, we need to calculate the total number of people she needs to serve. 

There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, so the total number of people from the team and coaches is 12 + 3 = 15. 

Each team member brings 2 guests, so the total number of guests is 12 * 2 = 24. 

The total number of people Maddy needs to serve is 15 (team and coaches) + 24 (guests) = 39.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, the total number of pizzas Maddy will need is 39 / 3 = 13.

Each pizza costs $15, so the total amount Maddy will spend is 13 * 15 = $195.

The final answer is: $195"
"To find out how many sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to first find out how much space the topaz gemstones take up. 

Since each topaz gemstone is one inch long, and there are 8 of them, they take up a total of 8 inches. 

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches, and the topaz gemstones take up 8 inches, so the space left for the sterling silver beads is 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

Each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long, so to find out how many beads fit in 17 inches, we need to divide 17 by 0.25 (which is the length of one bead in inches).

17 / 0.25 = 68

So, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

The final answer is: 68"
"To find the total number of stories they wrote in the first week, we need to add the number of stories each of them wrote. 

Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories. 

Total number of stories in the first week = 20 + 40 + 60 = 120

In the second week, they each doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week. 

Alani doubled 20 to 20 * 2 = 40 stories
Braylen doubled 40 to 40 * 2 = 80 stories
Margot doubled 60 to 60 * 2 = 120 stories

Total number of stories in the second week = 40 + 80 + 120 = 240

To find the total number of stories they wrote altogether, we need to add the number of stories they wrote in the first and second week.

Total number of stories = 120 + 240 = 360

The final answer is: 360"
"To find out how old Ann's brother will be in 3 years, we need to first find out how old he is now. Since Ann is 9 years old and her brother is twice her age, we can calculate his current age by multiplying Ann's age by 2.

Ann's brother's current age = 9 * 2 = 18 years

Now, to find out how old he will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age.

Ann's brother's age in 3 years = 18 + 3 = 21 years

The final answer is: 21"
"To find out how many cents Kelly has, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has. 

Kelly has 5 quarters, and each quarter is worth 25 cents. So, 5 quarters will be 5 x 25 = 125 cents. 

Kelly also has 2 dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents. So, 2 dimes will be 2 x 10 = 20 cents.

Now, let's add the total amount of money Kelly has: 125 cents + 20 cents = 145 cents.

Kelly buys a can of pop for 55 cents. To find out how many cents she has left, we need to subtract the cost of the pop from the total amount of money she has: 145 cents - 55 cents = 90 cents.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the number of rows of 5-star, we first need to find the total number of stars and then subtract the stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows.

There are 3 rows of 8 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 3 x 8 = 24.

There are 2 rows of 6 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 2 x 6 = 12.

The total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows is 24 + 12 = 36.

The total number of stars in the flag is 76.

Now, we subtract the stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows from the total number of stars to find the number of stars in the 5-star rows: 76 - 36 = 40.

Since each 5-star row has 5 stars, we divide the total number of stars in the 5-star rows by 5 to find the number of rows: 40 / 5 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how many trucks are needed, we need to calculate the total weight of the flagstones and then divide that by the weight capacity of each truck.

First, let's find the total weight of the flagstones: 
80 flagstones * 75 pounds per flagstone = 6000 pounds

Now, let's divide the total weight by the weight capacity of each truck:
6000 pounds / 2000 pounds per truck = 3

So, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we need to first find the speed of the car in the slow lane. 

The car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, which is 60 miles/hour. So, the speed of the car in the slow lane is 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed. 

Given that the distance is 480 miles and the speed of the car in the slow lane is 30 miles/hour, we can calculate the time as follows:

Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours.

The final answer is: 16"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Ali has 22 medals. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals. 

Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals. 

It's given that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have. 

Let's represent the total number of medals given out as 'x'. Then, we can write the equation: x = 10 * 39.

To find the total number of medals given out, we multiply 10 by 39. 

10 * 39 = 390

The final answer is: 390"
"To find out how many chocolate bars each child will get, we first need to find out how many chocolate bars are left after the adults get their share. 

There are 4 adults and each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, so the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 x 6 = 24. 

Since each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, the total number of chocolate bars is 8 packets x 5 = 40. 

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars given to adults from the total number of chocolate bars: 40 - 24 = 16. 

There are 8 children and the remaining 16 chocolate bars are to be shared equally among them. To find out how many each child will get, we divide 16 by 8: 16 / 8 = 2.

So, each child will get 2 chocolate bars.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much money Susan earns, we need to calculate the total time she works and then multiply it by her hourly wage.

First, let's find out how many hours she works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total time.

3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours

Now, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 2.5 hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we multiply 2.5 hours by 60 to get the total minutes.

2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Now, we divide the total minutes by 10 to find out how many 10-minute intervals.

150 minutes / 10 minutes/interval = 15 intervals

Since Susan earns $5 for every 10-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by her earnings per interval.

15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

The final answer is: $75"
"Let's break down the information given. 

After 3 rounds, Mike has 21 points. 
Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points. 
Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

Now, let's see who gets an extra point in the fourth round. 
Mike has 21 points, which is less than 20, so he doesn't get an extra point. 
Jim has 18 points, which is less than 20, so he doesn't get an extra point. 
Tony has 42 points, which is more than 20, so he gets an extra point.

So, after the extra points are distributed, the points are: 
Mike - 21, Jim - 18, Tony - 43.

Now, let's add up the points of all three players: 
21 + 18 + 43 = 82

"To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we need to first find out how many oranges the sons washed. 

The oldest son is 8 years old, and he washes as many oranges as he is years old, so he washes 8 oranges. 

The youngest son is half as old as the oldest son, so he is 8 / 2 = 4 years old. He washes as many oranges as he is years old, so he washes 4 oranges.

In total, the sons wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

Will buys 15 oranges, and the sons wash 12 oranges. To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we subtract the number of oranges washed from the total number of oranges: 15 - 12 = 3.

"To find the total count of activities, we need to calculate the number of each activity done on the first and second day and then add them together.

On the first day, Darren did:
- 100 pushups
- 50 squats
- 20 dumbbell presses

On the second day, Darren did:
- 100 + 20 = 120 pushups
- 50 - 10 = 40 squats
- 20 * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses

Now, let's add the activities done on both days:
- Total pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Total squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Total dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

The total count of activities is the sum of the total pushups, squats, and dumbbell presses: 220 + 90 + 60 = 370

"To find out how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day and then divide the total amount of rice by that.

First, let's find out how much rice is consumed per day. Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 3 meals in a day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner). So, the total rice consumed per person per day is 0.2 kg * 3 = 0.6 kg.

Since there are 5 members in the household who eat rice every lunch and dinner, the total rice consumed per day is 0.6 kg * 5 = 3 kg.

Now, we need to find out how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last. To do this, we divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the amount consumed per day (3 kg). 

42 kg / 3 kg = 14 days

Since we want to know how many weeks it will last, we need to convert the days to weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide 14 days by 7.

14 days / 7 days per week = 2 weeks

So, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 2 weeks. 

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to first calculate the total number of crates he sold in the week. 

Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he sold bread for 5 days. 

He sold 20 crates over the weekend, which is 2 days. 
He sold 15 crates on Tuesday, 12 crates on Wednesday, and 18 crates on Thursday.

Total crates sold = 20 (weekend) + 15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday)
Total crates sold = 65

Since Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, he had 5 working days. 
Total working days = 7 (days in a week) - 2 (days closed) = 5

Target for 5 working days = 120 (target for a week) / 7 (days in a week) * 5 (working days)
Target for 5 working days = 85.71 (approximately)

Since we can't sell a fraction of a crate, we'll consider the target as 85 crates for 5 working days.

Crates off from target = Target for 5 working days - Total crates sold
Crates off from target = 85 - 65
Crates off from target = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how much Carmen paid for the desk, we need to calculate the total amount she bid. 

The first bid is $200. Then, 3 other people bid once, so the desk price increases by $50 three times. 

The total increase in price is 3 * $50 = $150. 

So, the price of the desk after the 3 other people bid is $200 + $150 = $350. 

Carmen then bids after each of the 3 other people, so she bids 4 times. Each time, the price increases by $50. 

The total increase in price is 4 * $50 = $200. 

So, the final price of the desk is $350 + $200 = $550.

The final answer is: $550"
"To find out how much John pays a year for driving, we need to calculate the total miles driven, the total cost of driving, and then add the bonus.

First, let's calculate the total miles driven. Since John goes to work and back each day, the total miles driven per day is 30 * 2 = 60 miles. He goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year, so the total miles driven per year is 60 * 5 * 50 = 15,000 miles.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of driving. John is charged $2 per mile driven, so the total cost of driving per year is 15,000 * $2 = $30,000.

Finally, let's calculate the total bonus per year. John gives his driver a $150 bonus per month, and there are 12 months in a year, so the total bonus per year is $150 * 12 = $1,800.

Now, let's add the total cost of driving and the total bonus to find the total amount John pays a year for driving: $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

Monday: 16 minutes
Sunday: 23 minutes
Combined: 16 + 23 = 39 minutes

Since Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to multiply the combined minutes by 2.

Combined minutes: 39
Twice the combined minutes: 39 * 2 = 78 minutes

So, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal.

"To find out how much money Watson made in April, we need to calculate his total earnings from his hourly wage and the weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate his total hours worked in a week. Watson works 10 hours a day, 5 days a week, so his total hours worked in a week is 10 hours/day * 5 days/week = 50 hours/week.

Since Watson earns $10 per hour, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage is 50 hours/week * $10/hour = $500/week.

In April, there are 4 weeks. So, his total earnings from his hourly wage in April is $500/week * 4 weeks = $2000.

Watson also gets a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well. Since the company performed well for the whole month, he gets a $300 bonus for each of the 4 weeks in April. So, his total bonus in April is $300/week * 4 weeks = $1200.

The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. 

Two-thirds of 60 is 60 * (2/3) = 40 loaves sold in the morning.

So, the number of loaves left after the morning sales is 60 - 40 = 20 loaves.

Half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening. Half of 20 is 20 / 2 = 10 loaves.

Since the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is 10.

"To find the total savings, we need to calculate the savings on the tubs of ice cream and the packets of milk separately and then add them together.

The original price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $13 = $26. 
The discounted price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $11 = $22. 
The savings on 2 tubs of ice cream is $26 - $22 = $4.

The original price of 4 packets of milk is 4 x $1 = $4 (assuming the price of a packet of milk is $1).
The discounted price of 4 packets of milk is 4 x ($1 - $0.5) = 4 x $0.5 = $2.
The savings on 4 packets of milk is $4 - $2 = $2.

The total savings is $4 + $2 = $6.

"To find out how much Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners, we need to first calculate how much he has spent so far and how much he has left after saving $2000.

1. Cost of business suits: 6 suits * $100 = $600
2. Cost of suitcases: 3 suitcases * $50 = $150
3. Cost of flight ticket: The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. 
   5 times the cost of a business suit is 5 * $100 = $500
   So, the cost of the flight ticket is $500 + $700 = $1200
4. Total cost so far: $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950
5. Amount left after saving $2000: $6000 - $1950 = $4050

"To find out how many eggs the family consumes in a week, we need to first find out how many eggs they eat in a day. 

There are 5 people in the family. 3 people eat 3 eggs each day, so the total number of eggs they eat is 3 * 3 = 9. The rest of the people, which is 5 - 3 = 2, eat 2 eggs each day. So, the total number of eggs they eat is 2 * 2 = 4. 

Now, we add the total number of eggs eaten by both groups: 9 + 4 = 13.

"Let's break down the information given. 

Let's say the number of players on the defense is D. 

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2D.

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is D/2.

We know that the total number of players on the team is 105. The sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams is equal to 105. 

So, we can write the equation: D + 2D + D/2 = 105

To solve for D, we need to get rid of the fraction. We can do this by multiplying the entire equation by 2, which gives us: 2D + 4D + D = 210

Combine like terms: 7D = 210

Now, divide both sides by 7: D = 30

The number of players on the defense is 30.

"To find out how many people show up for Martha's party, we need to first calculate the total number of people invited and then subtract the number of people who couldn't come.

First, let's find the total number of people invited. Martha invited 2 families with 6 people and 3 families with 4 people. 

2 families with 6 people = 2 x 6 = 12 people
3 families with 4 people = 3 x 4 = 12 people
Total people invited = 12 + 12 = 24 people

Now, 8 people couldn't come due to illness. 
1/4 of 8 people is 8 / 4 = 2 people who had previous commitments. 
So, the total number of people who couldn't come is 8 + 2 = 10 people.

Now, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited to find out how many people show up for Martha's party.
Total people invited = 24
Total people who couldn't come = 10
People who show up = 24 - 10 = 14

The final answer is: 14"
"To find the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store, we need to calculate the total number of marbles first. 

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and added them to a store that had 50. So, the total number of marbles in the store after buying from Johanna is 20 + 50 = 70.

His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. 2/5 of 20 is (2/5) * 20 = 8. So, his father gave him 8 marbles.

Now, the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store is 70 + 8 = 78.

Each marble weighs 2kgs. To find the total weight of marbles, we multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble: 78 * 2 = 156.

The final answer is: 156"
"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to find the volume of the pool first. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (such as the pool) is length x width x height.

Length (L) = 6 feet
Width (W) = 4 feet
Height (H) = 5 feet

Volume = L x W x H = 6 x 4 x 5 = 120 cubic feet

Now, we know the volume of the pool is 120 cubic feet. The cost to fill the pool is $0.1 per cubic foot. 

Cost = Volume x Cost per cubic foot
Cost = 120 x 0.1
Cost = 12

The final answer is: $12"
"To find the total number of children in the classroom, we need to find the number of girls and nongendered children first.

Since there are 3 times as many girls as boys, and there are 30 boys, the number of girls is 3 * 30 = 90.

The number of nongendered children is 1/10 as many as the number of boys, so it's 30 / 10 = 3.

Now, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children to find the total number of children: 30 + 90 + 3 = 123.

The final answer is: 123"
"To find the total number of electric poles required, we need to use the given ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This means for every 1 electric pole, 3 electric wires are needed.

Given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles.

Let's say the number of electric poles is x. The ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, so we can write the equation as:

1/x = 3/45

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

1 * 45 = 3x
45 = 3x

Now, divide both sides by 3:

x = 45 / 3
x = 15

So, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find the total number of people at the party. We know there were 25 men and 15 women at the beginning. 

Total number of people = 25 (men) + 15 (women) = 40

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. To find the number of people who left, we multiply the total number of people by 1/4.

Number of people who left = 1/4 * 40 = 10

Now, we know that 22 men stayed at the party. Since 10 people left, the number of men who left is the difference between the initial number of men and the number of men who stayed.

Number of men who left = 25 (initial men) - 22 (men who stayed) = 3

Since the total number of people who left is 10, and 3 of them are men, the number of women who left is the difference between the total number of people who left and the number of men who left.

Number of women who left = 10 (total people who left) - 3 (men who left) = 7

Now, we know the initial number of women was 15, and 7 of them left. To find the number of women who stayed, we subtract the number of women who left from the initial number of women.

Number of women who stayed = 15 (initial women) - 7 (women who left) = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the cost of the pen, we need to first find the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book, and the book costs $4, the magazine costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, we know that the pen costs $1 less than the magazine. So, the cost of the pen is $2 - $1 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"Let's break down the problem. Jam has 3 boxes of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils. We can set up an equation to represent this:

3x + 2 = 26

where x is the number of pencils in each box. To find x, we can subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

3x = 26 - 2
3x = 24

Now, we can divide both sides by 3 to solve for x:

x = 24 / 3
x = 8

So, each box has 8 pencils. Now, let's find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 3 boxes with 8 pencils each, which is 3 * 8 = 24 pencils. Meg has 46 pencils. So, the total number of pencils they have is 24 + 46 = 70.

To find the number of boxes needed to store all the pencils, we can divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils in each box:

70 / 8 = 8.75

Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

The final answer is: 9"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees and then calculate the total weakening effect of the ice cubes and the added cream.

First, let's find out how many ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, so we can divide 65 by 13 to find the number of ice cubes needed:

65 / 13 = 5

So, 5 ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees.

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so 5 ice cubes will make it 5 x 12 = 60 milliliters weaker.

Now, let's add the effect of the cream. The cream makes the coffee 15 milliliters weaker.

The total weakening effect is the sum of the weakening effect of the ice cubes and the cream:

60 + 15 = 75

The final answer is: 75"
"Let's break this down step by step. 

If 5 people leave with 7 new records, that means the total number of new records given out is 7. Since they trade 2 old records for 1 new one, the total number of old records traded must be double the number of new records given out. 

So, the total number of old records traded is 7 * 2 = 14.

Since there are 5 people, and they all traded in the same ratio, we can divide the total number of old records traded by 5 to find out how many old records each person brought in. 

14 / 5 = 2.8

However, since you can't trade a fraction of a record, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. But in this case, we can also consider that 2.8 is the average number of records each person brought in, and since it's a trade, the number of records must be a whole number. 

Let's re-evaluate the problem: If 5 people leave with 7 new records, that means the total number of new records given out is 7. Since they trade 2 old records for 1 new one, the total number of old records traded must be double the number of new records given out.

"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to find the number of junior and senior programmers, and then calculate their total salaries.

First, let's find the number of junior programmers. We know that the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, which is 100. 

Number of junior programmers = 2/5 * 100 = 40

Since there are 100 employees in total, the number of senior programmers is 100 - 40 = 60.

Now, let's find the salary of senior programmers. We know that senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, who are paid $2000 per month. 

Salary of senior programmers = $2000 + $400 = $2400

Now, let's calculate the total salary of junior programmers and senior programmers separately.

Total salary of junior programmers = Number of junior programmers * Salary of junior programmers
= 40 * $2000
= $80000

Total salary of senior programmers = Number of senior programmers * Salary of senior programmers
= 60 * $2400
= $144000

Now, let's find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month.

Total amount = Total salary of junior programmers + Total salary of senior programmers
= $80000 + $144000
= $208000

The final answer is: $208000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let's say the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is x.

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the total number of people on the bus is x + 5.

At the second bus stop, 7 people got down, so the number of people who got down is subtracted from the total: (x + 5) - 7 = x - 2.

Then, 8 more people got in, so the total number of people on the bus is (x - 2) + 8 = x + 6.

We are given that the total number of people heading to the third stop is 20, so we can set up the equation: x + 6 = 20.

To solve for x, we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation: x = 20 - 6.

x = 14

He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now, he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.

He eats 3 more that night, so he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops left.

"To find out how long it will take to fully charge the phone, we need to first find out how many percentage points are left to charge. Since the phone is already at 60% charged, it still needs 100% - 60% = 40% to be fully charged.

Now, we know that the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes. To find out how many minutes it will take to charge 40%, we multiply the rate by the amount left to charge: 40% * 3 minutes/percentage-point = 120 minutes.

"To find out how much the customer paid, we need to calculate the rewards they got from their last shopping trip, then subtract that from their current shopping trip's total, and finally apply the coupon.

The customer spent $80 on their last shopping trip, so they got $80 / $20 = 4 rewards. 

Their rewards are $1 off each, so they got a total of 4 * $1 = $4 off.

On their current shopping trip, they spent $43 and used their rewards, so we subtract the rewards from the total: $43 - $4 = $39.

They also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. Twice the rewards is 2 * $4 = $8. 

So, we subtract the coupon from the price: $39 - $8 = $31.

The customer paid $31 on this shopping trip.

"To find out which job pays more, we need to calculate the net pay for each job.

For Job A, Nick earns $15 an hour for 2000 hours a year. 

First, we calculate the total income from Job A: 
$15/hour * 2000 hours/year = $30,000/year

Since the state tax rate is 20%, we need to calculate the taxes:
$30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000

Now, we subtract the taxes from the total income to get the net pay for Job A:
$30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

For Job B, Nick earns $42,000 a year, but there's a property tax of $6,000 and a 10% tax rate on the net income after property tax.

First, we subtract the property tax from the total income:
$42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000

Now, we calculate the taxes on the net income:
$36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600

Now, we subtract the taxes from the net income to get the final net pay for Job B:
$36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

To find out which job pays more, we compare the net pay of both jobs:
$32,400 (Job B) > $24,000 (Job A)

Since Job B pays more, we need to find out how much more Nick will make at Job B compared to Job A:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

"To find the total cost of each offer, we need to add the advance payment to the total of the monthly installments.

For Furniture United's offer:
- Advance payment: $1,350
- Monthly installments: 6 * $350 = $2,100
- Total cost: $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450

For Cozy Homes' offer:
- Advance payment: $1,100
- Monthly installments: 9 * $250 = $2,250
- Total cost: $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350

Now, let's find the cost difference between the two offers:
Cost difference = Total cost of Furniture United's offer - Total cost of Cozy Homes' offer
Cost difference = $3,450 - $3,350
Cost difference = $100

"To find out how many guns each person would have if they were to share them equally, we need to add up all the guns and then divide by the number of people.

DJ has 8 guns, Nick has 10 guns, RJ has 1 gun, and Richard has 5 guns. 

First, let's add up all the guns: 8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24

Now, we need to divide the total number of guns by the number of people. There are 4 people.

24 / 4 = 6

So, if they were to share their guns equally, each person would have 6 guns.

"To find out how much sugar Mason needs, we need to calculate the total amount of sugar needed for the suckers and the fudge separately, and then add them together.

For the suckers, Mason needs 30 ounces per batch. Since he's making 8 batches, we multiply 30 ounces by 8:

30 ounces/batch * 8 batches = 240 ounces

For the fudge, Mason needs 70 ounces per batch. Since he's making 1 batch, we multiply 70 ounces by 1:

70 ounces/batch * 1 batch = 70 ounces

Now, we add the total amount of sugar needed for the suckers and the fudge:

240 ounces (suckers) + 70 ounces (fudge) = 310 ounces

"To find the final value of Maria's shares, we need to calculate the price of the shares after the first year and then after the second year.

First, let's calculate the price of the shares after the first year. The stock price increases by 50%, so the new price will be 150% of the original price. 

Original price = $8
Increase = 50% of $8 = 0.5 * $8 = $4
New price after the first year = Original price + Increase = $8 + $4 = $12

Now, let's calculate the price of the shares after the second year. The stock price decreases by 25%, so the new price will be 75% of the price after the first year.

Decrease = 25% of $12 = 0.25 * $12 = $3
New price after the second year = Price after the first year - Decrease = $12 - $3 = $9

Since Maria bought 8 shares, we need to multiply the price after the second year by 8 to find the final value of all her shares.

Final value = New price after the second year * Number of shares
Final value = $9 * 8
Final value = $72

The final answer is: $72"
"To find out how many hot dogs John ate, we need to first find out how many hot dogs Thomas ate. Since Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, and Luke ate 2 hot dogs, Thomas ate 2 * 3 = 6 hot dogs.

Then, John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so John ate 6 / 2 = 3 hot dogs.

Now, we need to find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke. John ate 3 hot dogs and Luke ate 2 hot dogs, so John ate 3 - 2 = 1 more hot dog than Luke.

"Let's break this down step by step. 

Let's say the number of students in the two equal groups is x. Since the last group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the last group is x - 10.

We know that the total number of students is 200, and the sum of the students in all three groups is equal to 200. 

So, we can write the equation: x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms: 2x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms again: 3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides: 3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3: x = 70

Since the last group has x - 10 students, we can find the number of students in the last group by subtracting 10 from x: 70 - 10 = 60

The final answer is: 60"
"Let's break down the information given. Farmer Brown has 60 animals in total, and he has twice as many chickens as cows. 

Let's say the number of cows is x. Then, the number of chickens will be 2x (since he has twice as many chickens as cows).

We know that the total number of animals is 60, so we can set up the equation: x + 2x = 60

Combine like terms: 3x = 60

Divide both sides by 3: x = 20

So, the number of cows is 20, and the number of chickens is 2x = 2(20) = 40.

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each.

The total number of cow legs is 20 * 4 = 80
The total number of chicken legs is 40 * 2 = 80

The total number of legs is 80 + 80 = 160

The final answer is: 160"

1. Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week for 4 weeks. 
   So, after 4 weeks, he has 3 + 4 = 7 balls.

2. When Josh drops 3 balls, 2 are caught by the crowd, and 1 is lost.
   So, he loses 1 ball.

3. Now, Josh has 7 - 1 = 6 balls left.

4. Josh starts juggling with the balls he has left, which is 6.

"Let's break down the information given:

- The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
- The pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle and the green toad, so they also weigh 50 pounds.
- The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
- The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal:

Weight of the pink frog = 50 pounds
Weight of the blue beetle = 50 pounds
Weight of the green toad = 50 pounds
Weight of the yellow snake = 60 pounds
Weight of the red bird = 30 pounds
Weight of the container = 20 pounds

Total weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 pounds

"To find the total distance Tyson covered in June, we first need to find out how much more he needs to run each day. 

The coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters than 5000. To find 1/5 of 5000, we multiply 5000 by 1/5. 

5000 * (1/5) = 5000 / 5 = 1000

So, he needs to run 1000 more meters each day. 

Now, we add this to the original 5000 meters to find the new daily distance. 

5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters

Since there are 30 days in June, we multiply the new daily distance by 30 to find the total distance covered in June. 

6000 * 30 = 180,000

"To find the percentage more they are making per day now, we need to first find the difference in the amount they are making per day now and the amount they used to make per day.

The factory used to make $100 per tractor and sold 10 tractors a day, so they made $100 * 10 = $1000 per day.

Now, they make $220 per silo and sell 5 silos a day, so they make $220 * 5 = $1100 per day.

The difference in the amount they are making per day now and the amount they used to make per day is $1100 - $1000 = $100.

To find the percentage more they are making per day now, we need to divide the difference by the original amount and multiply by 100.

($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%

So, the factory is making 10% more per day now.

First, let's find the cost per month. 

Food costs $25 per week, and there are 4 weeks in a month, so the cost of food per month is $25 * 4 = $100.

Treats cost $20 per month.

Medicine costs $100 per month.

The total cost per month is $100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine) = $220.

She needs 30 plant pots for the daisies. 
She needs twice as many for the roses, which is 2 * 30 = 60 plant pots. 
So, in total, she needs 30 + 60 = 90 plant pots.

April had already bought 100 plant pots from the garden center. 
To find out how many plant pots she has left over, we need to subtract the total number of plant pots she needs from the total number of plant pots she bought.

"To find out how much time John spent sightseeing, we need to first find out the total time he spent on all activities. 

John spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours. 

He watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so that's 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

We know that the time spent watching shows is 30% of the total time. Let's call the total time 'T'. Then 30% of T is 6 hours. We can write this as 0.3T = 6.

To find T, we divide both sides by 0.3: T = 6 / 0.3 = 20 hours.

Now we know the total time is 20 hours. We also know that 40% of this time was spent sightseeing. We can write this as 0.4T = x, where x is the time spent sightseeing.

Since T is 20 hours, we can substitute this into the equation: 0.4 * 20 = x.

0.4 * 20 = 8.

So, John spent 8 hours sightseeing.

"To find out how much money Annabelle still needs to save, we need to calculate how much money she has earned and then subtract that from the total cost of the phone.

First, let's calculate how much money Annabelle earned from her first job. She worked for 20 hours at $10 per hour, so she earned 20 x $10 = $200.

Next, let's calculate how much money Annabelle earned from her second job. She worked for 15 hours at $5 per hour, so she earned 15 x $5 = $75.

Now, let's add the money she earned from both jobs: $200 + $75 = $275.

Annabelle already had $80 in her savings, so we add that to the money she earned: $275 + $80 = $355.

To find out how much money Annabelle still needs to save, we subtract the total amount she has from the cost of the phone: $400 - $355 = $45.

Now, we need to find the combined height of the two shorter trees. The shortest tree is 6 feet and the second tree is 11 feet. 

So, the combined height of the two shorter trees is 6 + 11 = 17 feet.

The height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two shorter trees combined. 

So, the height of the tallest tree is 2 * 17 = 34 feet.

The total amount Dean spent is $12 + $5 = $17.

Dean's mother gave him $28 initially, and then gave him an extra $10. So, the total amount of money Dean had is $28 + $10 = $38.

"To find out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to first calculate the total cost of the activities. 

The cost of mini-golf for Morgan and her friends is 1 round * $5 = $5. 
Since there are 'x' friends, the total cost for mini-golf for all of them will be 1 round * $5 + 1 round * $5 = $10. 

The cost of arcade tokens for all of them is 1 * $5 = $5. 

The cost of go-karts for all of them is 2 rides * $10 = $20.

The total cost for all activities is $10 (mini-golf) + $5 (arcade tokens) + $20 (go-karts) = $35.

Morgan's dad has a budget of $90. So, the amount left after spending $35 on activities is $90 - $35 = $55.

This $55 will be used to buy food or other expenses for Morgan and her friends. However, we are only interested in the number of friends she can invite. 

The cost for mini-golf and arcade tokens for 'x' friends is $10 + $5 = $15. 

The remaining budget for go-karts is $55 - $15 = $40. 

Since each go-kart ride costs $10, the number of friends that can ride the go-karts is $40 / $10 = 4.

However, this is not the number of friends she can invite. This is the number of friends that can ride the go-karts. 

The number of friends she can invite is the number of friends that can ride the go-karts plus 1 (Morgan herself). 

So, the number of friends she can invite is 4 + 1 = 5.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Billy starts with $10. He buys candy, so let's call the number of pounds of candy he buys 'x'. The cost of the candy is $1.5 per pound, so the total cost of the candy is 1.5x.

Since Billy has $10, the amount of change he gets after buying the candy is $10 - 1.5x.

He then takes half of this change and spends it on gumballs. The cost of each gumball is $0.05, and he buys 40 gumballs. So, the total amount he spends on gumballs is 0.05 * 40 = $2.

Since he takes half of his change, the amount he spends on gumballs is half of the change he got from buying the candy. So, we can set up the equation:

(10 - 1.5x) / 2 = 2

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2:

10 - 1.5x = 4

Now, we can subtract 10 from both sides:

-1.5x = -6

Now, we can divide both sides by -1.5:

x = 4

So, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy.

"Let's break down the problem. Carver's age is 45, and it's 5 years less than twice the age of his son. 

Let's represent the son's age as 'x'. 

The statement ""5 years less than twice the age of his son"" can be written as an equation: 2x - 5 = 45.

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x' on one side of the equation. 

First, we add 5 to both sides of the equation: 2x - 5 + 5 = 45 + 5
This simplifies to: 2x = 50

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 2: (2x) / 2 = 50 / 2
This simplifies to: x = 25

So, the son is 25 years old.

"To find the total distance the train travels in one trip, we need to add the distances between the cities. 

Distance from the first city to the second city = 75 miles
Distance from the second city to the third city = 100 miles
Distance from the third city to the first city = 100 - 50 = 50 miles

Total distance in one trip = 75 + 100 + 50 = 225 miles

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance it travels in a day is:
Total distance in a day = 225 miles * 3 = 675 miles

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we need to divide the total distance it travels in a day by the distance it needs to travel before service:
Days between services = 18,000 miles / 675 miles/day

Days between services = 26.67 days

Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we'll round down to the nearest whole number because the train will still be in service on the last day before it needs service.

"To find the amount of stuffing needed for the collie beds, we need to find the average of the stuffing for the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds. 

The average is calculated by adding the two amounts and dividing by 2. 

For Rottweiler and chihuahua beds: (8 + 2) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5 pounds.

Now, we know that a collie bed takes 5 pounds of stuffing.

To find the total amount of stuffing needed for the collie beds, we multiply the amount of stuffing per collie bed by the number of collie beds: 5 * 3 = 15 pounds.

To find the total amount of stuffing needed for the chihuahua beds, we multiply the amount of stuffing per chihuahua bed by the number of chihuahua beds: 2 * 4 = 8 pounds.

Now, we add the total amount of stuffing needed for the collie beds and the chihuahua beds: 15 + 8 = 23 pounds.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 200 / 70
Time = 2.857 hours (approximately)

However, he took a detour that added 10 miles to his trip. So, the actual distance to his friend's house is 200 + 10 = 210 miles. 

Time taken to drive to his friend's house with the detour = 210 / 70
Time = 3 hours

Now, let's find the time taken to drive back home. Distance = 240 miles, Speed = 80 mph.

Time = Distance / Speed

- 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.
- A number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. 
  This means 4 * 3 - 5 = 7 were kicked out for shoplifting.
- Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. 
  This means 3 * 7 = 21 were kicked out for physical violence.

We know that a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart. We can add up the numbers of people kicked out for each reason and subtract that from 50 to find the number of people kicked out for other reasons.

People kicked out for refusing to wear masks: 3

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the picture frames, the etching, the pins, and the cords separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the picture frames. There are 44 seniors, and each picture frame costs $20. So, the total cost of the picture frames is 44 x $20 = $880.

Next, we need to find the cost of etching the logo on each picture frame. The etching costs an additional 20% of the cost of the picture frame. 20% of $20 is 0.2 x $20 = $4. So, the total cost of etching the logo on all the picture frames is 44 x $4 = $176.

Now, let's find the cost of the pins. 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each. So, the total cost of the pins is 2 x $5 = $10.

Next, we need to find the cost of the cords. 1/4 of the seniors are officers, which is 1/4 x 44 = 11 officers. Each officer will receive a cord that costs $12. So, the total cost of the cords is 11 x $12 = $132.

"To find the total cost of making the hand-painted wallpaper, we need to first find the cost of the materials. 

The original price of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400. If a DIY saves 20% of the cost, that means the DIY version will be 80% of the original price. 

To find 80% of the original price, we multiply the original price by 0.8 (which is the decimal form of 80%).

So, 80% of $400 is 0.8 x $400 = $320.

This $320 is the cost of the materials for the DIY version. 

The total cost of making the hand-painted wallpaper is the cost of the materials, which is $320.

The final answer is: $320"
"To find the total number of shoes sold, we need to calculate the number of shoes sold each day and then add them up.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes they sold on Friday, which is 2 x 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the number of shoes they sold on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

Now, let's add up the number of shoes sold each day: 14 + 28 + 14 = 56 pairs.

However, six people returned their shoes, so we need to subtract those from the total: 56 - 6 = 50 pairs.

Since each pair has 2 shoes, we need to multiply the number of pairs by 2 to get the total number of shoes sold: 50 x 2 = 100.

The final answer is: 100"

On Tuesdays, she had 1 hour of dance practice. 
On Thursdays, she had 2 hours of dance practice. 
On Saturdays, she had dance practice that lasted twice as long as Tuesday's night class, which is 2 * 1 = 2 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours: 1 (Tuesday) + 2 (Thursday) + 2 (Saturday) = 5 hours.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we need to first find the value of the faulty equipment and then subtract it from the total amount spent.

The total amount spent is $400,000. 
40% of the total amount is faulty. 
40% of $400,000 = 0.4 * $400,000 = $160,000.

The value of the faulty equipment is $160,000. 
To find the value of the functioning equipment, we subtract the value of the faulty equipment from the total amount spent.
$400,000 - $160,000 = $240,000.

The total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is $240,000.

"To find out how many pieces of rolls Mrs. Sherman fed to the chickens, we first need to find out how many rolls were left after feeding her children. 

Mrs. Sherman started with a dozen rolls, which is 12 rolls. She fed 6 of her children, so she had 12 - 6 = 6 rolls left. 

Then, she broke each of the remaining rolls into 8 pieces. So, she had 6 rolls * 8 pieces per roll = 48 pieces of rolls. 

The final answer is: 48"
"To find out how many pupils like the color yellow, we first need to find out how many pupils like blue, then how many like green, and finally subtract those from the total number of pupils.

Half of the class likes blue, so that's 40 / 2 = 20 pupils.

One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green. The remaining pupils are 40 - 20 = 20. One-fourth of 20 is 20 / 4 = 5 pupils.

So, the number of pupils who like green is 5. The number of pupils who like blue is 20. The total number of pupils who like blue or green is 20 + 5 = 25.

Now, to find out how many pupils like yellow, we subtract the number of pupils who like blue or green from the total number of pupils: 40 - 25 = 15.

"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total interest she has to pay and then divide it by the number of months.

First, let's calculate the total interest she has to pay. The formula for simple interest is:

Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

In this case, the principal is $3,650, the rate is 10% or 0.10, and the time is 5 months.

Interest = $3,650 * 0.10 * 5
Interest = $1,825

Now, we need to add the interest to the principal to find the total amount she has to pay:

Total Amount = Principal + Interest
Total Amount = $3,650 + $1,825
Total Amount = $5,475

Since she has to pay an equal amount every month for 5 months, we can divide the total amount by 5:

Monthly Payment = Total Amount / Number of Months
Monthly Payment = $5,475 / 5
Monthly Payment = $1,095

The final answer is: $1095"
"To find out how far Cho hiked, we need to multiply the speed by the time. Cho hiked 14 kilometers per hour for 8 hours, so Cho hiked 14 * 8 = 112 kilometers.

To find out how far Chloe hiked, we need to multiply Chloe's speed by the time she hiked. Chloe hiked 9 kilometers per hour for 5 hours, so Chloe hiked 9 * 5 = 45 kilometers.

To find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked than Chloe, we need to subtract Chloe's distance from Cho's distance. Cho hiked 112 kilometers and Chloe hiked 45 kilometers, so Cho hiked 112 - 45 = 67 kilometers farther.

"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to calculate the total number of pesos each of them has and then add them together.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. 

Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos. 
Anna also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

Now, let's add the total number of pesos each of them has:
Axel's total pesos = 50 (silver) + 80 (gold) = 130
Anna's total pesos = 100 (silver) + 120 (gold) = 220

Total number of pesos they have together = Axel's total pesos + Anna's total pesos = 130 + 220 = 350

The final answer is: 350"
"To find the total profit Millie makes per hour, we need to first find out how much money she makes per hour and then subtract the cost of supplies per hour.

First, let's find out how much money she makes per hour. She sells 4 cups per hour at $1 per cup, so she makes 4 x $1 = $4 per hour.

Now, let's find out how much money she makes in total. She makes 3 pitchers of lemonade, and each pitcher holds 12 cups, so she makes 3 x 12 = 36 cups of lemonade. She sells each cup for $1, so she makes 36 x $1 = $36 in total.

Now, let's find out how much profit she makes in total. She made $36 and spent $18 on supplies, so her profit is $36 - $18 = $18.

To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours she works. Since she sells all of the lemonade, she works for 36 / 4 = 9 hours. So, her profit per hour is $18 / 9 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

If Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land, that means he has 2/5 of his land left. We are given that the remaining land is 12.8 hectares. 

Let's set up an equation to find the total land he had initially. Let x be the total land he had initially.

2/5 * x = 12.8

To find x, we need to isolate it. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by 5/2.

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land initially.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find out how many people sang in the performance, we first need to find out how many female members are in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are girls, we can calculate this by multiplying the total number of members by 0.5.

Total members = 52
Number of girls = Total members * 0.5
Number of girls = 52 * 0.5
Number of girls = 26

Now, we know that half the people performing can't make it to the show. This means that half of the girls can't make it, so the other half will perform. To find out how many girls performed, we can divide the total number of girls by 2.

Number of girls performing = Number of girls / 2
Number of girls performing = 26 / 2
Number of girls performing = 13

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them. To find the total number of people who sang in the performance, we add the number of girls performing to the number of teachers.

Total people performing = Number of girls performing + Number of teachers
Total people performing = 13 + 3
Total people performing = 16

"To find out how much money David saves, we need to calculate how much Dasha would have spent if she bought a ride bracelet and compare it to what she actually spent.

Each ride costs 2 tickets at $2 per ticket, so the cost of one ride is 2 * $2 = $4. 

Since they rode 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha would be 9 * $4 = $36.

However, Dasha bought tickets, not a ride bracelet. David bought a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides. 

Since Dasha rode 9 rides, she would have needed 9 tickets. The cost of 9 tickets is 9 * $2 = $18.

Now, let's compare the cost of what Dasha actually spent ($18) to what she would have spent if she bought a ride bracelet ($36). 

The difference is $36 - $18 = $18.

So, David saves $18 by buying a ride bracelet instead of buying individual tickets.

"To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we need to first find out how many popsicles each of them has. 

Let's say the number of popsicles Betty has is 5x and the number of popsicles Sam has is 6x. 

Since the total number of popsicles they have together is 165, we can write the equation: 5x + 6x = 165

Combine like terms: 11x = 165

Divide both sides by 11: x = 15

Now that we know x, we can find out how many popsicles each of them has. Betty has 5x = 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles. Sam has 6x = 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has: 90 - 75 = 15

"To find out how much Tim saves by cancelling his cable package, we need to compare the cost of the streaming services to the cost of the cable package. 

First, let's calculate the cost of the streaming services. 

The cost of Netflix is $10 a month. 

The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 each, but he saves 20% for bundling. To find the bundled cost, we need to calculate 20% of $20 (the total cost of Hulu and Disney Plus) and subtract it from $20.

20% of $20 is 0.2 x $20 = $4. 

So, the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $20 - $4 = $16.

The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26.

Now, let's compare this to the cost of the cable package, which is $60.

The amount of money Tim saves by cancelling his cable package is $60 - $26 = $34.

The final answer is: $34"
"To find the total time spent, we need to add up the time spent writing, recording, and editing the song. 

Time spent writing: 4 hours
Time spent recording: 4 hours / 2 = 2 hours
Time spent editing: 90 minutes = 1.5 hours

Total time spent = 4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5 hours

Now, we need to find the percentage of time spent editing. To do this, we'll divide the time spent editing by the total time and multiply by 100.

Percentage of time spent editing = (1.5 / 7.5) * 100
= 0.2 * 100

"To find out how many Valentine's cards Erica has now, we need to calculate the total number of cards she had initially and then add or subtract the cards she received or gave away.

Erica initially made 20 Valentine's cards.

Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards that had 15 cards each, so she got 2 x 15 = 30 cards.

So, Erica had 20 + 30 = 50 cards initially.

She passed out 24 to her classmates and 5 to her family, so she gave away 24 + 5 = 29 cards.

She received 17 cards from family and friends.

To find out how many cards she has now, we need to subtract the cards she gave away and add the cards she received: 50 - 29 + 17 = 38.

So, Erica now has 38 Valentine's cards.

The final answer is: 38"
"To find out how many slices Jenny has left, we need to first calculate how many slices she gave away. 

Jenny gave 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since there are 12 slices, we multiply 12 by 1/3 to find out how many slices Bill got. 

12 * 1/3 = 12 / 3 = 4 slices

Jenny gave 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. We multiply 12 by 1/4 to find out how many slices Mark got.

12 * 1/4 = 12 / 4 = 3 slices

Jenny gave away a total of 4 + 3 = 7 slices.

"To find out how many bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we need to calculate the total amount of flour and milk required for the quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. Since Mark is making a quadruple batch, he needs 4 times the amount of flour and milk.

For flour: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups
For milk: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark needs to buy:
12 cups / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags of flour

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so Mark needs to buy:
4 cups / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles of milk

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour:
6 bags of flour - 2 bottles of milk = 4

"To find out how much energy Mel uses in a day, we need to multiply the power of the air conditioner (in watts) by the number of hours it's used. 

Power of the air conditioner = 900 watts
Hours used per day = 8 hours

Energy used per day = Power of the air conditioner * Hours used per day
Energy used per day = 900 watts * 8 hours
Energy used per day = 7200 watt-hours or 7.2 kilowatt-hours (kWh)

Now, let's find out how much energy Mel uses in a day after reducing the time by 5 hours.

New hours used per day = 8 hours - 5 hours
New hours used per day = 3 hours

Energy used per day after reduction = Power of the air conditioner * New hours used per day
Energy used per day after reduction = 900 watts * 3 hours
Energy used per day after reduction = 2700 watt-hours or 2.7 kWh

Now, let's find the difference in energy used per day.

Difference in energy used per day = Energy used per day - Energy used per day after reduction
Difference in energy used per day = 7.2 kWh - 2.7 kWh
Difference in energy used per day = 4.5 kWh

Now, let's find the total energy saved in 30 days.

Total energy saved in 30 days = Difference in energy used per day * 30

"To find out how much money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese, we need to calculate the total amount of meat and cheese needed and then multiply it by the cost per pound.

First, we need to find out how many sandwiches Tyson needs to make. Since each sandwich serves 4 people and there are 20 people in total, we divide 20 by 4 to get the number of sandwiches needed:

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, Tyson needs 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

Now, we multiply the amount of meat and cheese needed by the cost per pound:

Meat cost: 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00
Cheese cost: 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the meat and the cost of the cheese:

"To find out how many minutes Toby will be early, we need to calculate how long it will take him to read the book and then subtract that from the time it takes to get to the airport.

First, let's find out how many words are in the book. Since the book is 45 pages long and it averages 200 words per page, we multiply the number of pages by the number of words per page:

45 pages * 200 words/page = 9000 words

Now, we know Toby can read 300 words per minute. To find out how long it will take him to read the book, we divide the total number of words by his reading speed:

9000 words / 300 words/minute = 30 minutes

It takes 10 minutes to get to the airport, so we add that to the time it takes to read the book:

30 minutes (reading time) + 10 minutes (travel time) = 40 minutes

Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes, so we subtract the total time it takes him to read and travel from the time he has to be there:

60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes

Toby will be 20 minutes early."
"To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately and then add them together.

In May, the company hired 40 employees. Each employee worked for 40 hours a week and was paid $15 per hour. So, the total hours worked by each employee in May is 40 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in May is 40 hours * $15 per hour = $600. 

Since there are 4 weeks in May, the total amount paid to each employee in May is $600 * 4 = $2400. 

The total amount paid to all employees in May is 40 employees * $2400 = $96,000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 1/4 of 40 employees left, so 10 employees left. The remaining employees are 40 - 10 = 30 employees.

Each employee still worked for 40 hours a week and was paid $15 per hour. So, the total hours worked by each employee in June is 40 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in June is 40 hours * $15 per hour = $600.

Since there are 4 weeks in June, the total amount paid to each employee in June is $600 * 4 = $2400.

The total amount paid to all employees in June is 30 employees * $2400 = $72,000.

The total amount paid to all employees in the two months is $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000.

"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. Since she bought 2 pounds and the deal is ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off,"" we can break it down as follows:

- 1 pound at $3
- 1/2 pound is half of $3, which is $1.50
- Total cost for 2 pounds of taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50

Next, let's calculate the cost of the magnets:
4 magnets at $0.25 each is 4 x $0.25 = $1

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items:
- Taffy: $4.50
- Seashells: $1.50
- Magnets: $1
- Total cost: $4.50 + $1.50 + $1 = $7

Sally started with $10, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost from the initial amount:
$10 - $7 = $3

The final answer is: $3"
"To find the total amount Tim spent, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks and the finale firework separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the two packs of fireworks. The first pack costs $400, and the second pack costs twice that much, which is 2 * $400 = $800. So, the total cost of the two packs is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Since Tim gets a 20% discount on the two packs, we need to find 20% of $1200. 20% is the same as 0.2, so 0.2 * $1200 = $240. This is the discount amount. To find the final cost of the two packs, we subtract the discount from the original cost: $1200 - $240 = $960.

Now, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the final cost of the two packs: $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To find out how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we need to calculate how many cookies she eats in 30 days and then divide that by the number of cookies her recipe makes.

Shannon eats 2 cookies a night. There are 30 days in 30 days, so she eats 2 * 30 = 60 cookies in 30 days.

Her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies. To find out how many dozens she needs, we divide the total number of cookies she needs (60) by the number of cookies her recipe makes (12).

60 / 12 = 5

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozen cookies to have enough for 30 days.

"To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to find the intersection of the two events. 

First, let's find the number of candles that smell like wet dog. 5% of 50,000 candles smell like wet dog, so we multiply 50,000 by 0.05.

0.05 * 50,000 = 2,500 candles smell like wet dog.

Next, we need to find the number of candles that are guaranteed not to explode. Since 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode, we multiply 50,000 by 0.99.

0.99 * 50,000 = 49,500 candles are guaranteed not to explode.

However, the candles that smell like wet dog are part of the 1% that are not guaranteed not to explode. So, we need to find the number of candles that are not guaranteed not to explode, which is 1% of 50,000.

0.01 * 50,000 = 500 candles are not guaranteed not to explode.

Since 5% of the candles that are not guaranteed not to explode smell like wet dog, we multiply 500 by 0.05.

0.05 * 500 = 25 candles both smell like wet dog and are not guaranteed not to explode.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to first find the price of one discounted blouse and then multiply it by 4.

The regular price of each blouse is $20. Since it's 30% off, we need to find 30% of $20 and subtract it from the regular price.

30% of $20 is 0.3 x $20 = $6.

So, the discounted price of one blouse is $20 - $6 = $14.

Now, we multiply the discounted price by 4 to find the total cost of the discounted blouses:

$14 x 4 = $56

The final answer is: $56"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Let's say the number of apples Joanne gathered from the tallest trees is T, from the average trees is A, and from the shortest trees is S. 

We know that Joanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees, so T = 30. We also know that she gathered half this amount from the shortest trees, so S = 30 / 2 = 15.

We are also given that her sister gathered twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, so her sister gathered 2T apples from the tallest trees. We know that her sister gathered 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so her sister gathered 3S apples from the shortest trees.

Since her sister didn't gather any apples from the average trees, her total number of apples gathered is 2T + 3S. 

We know that the total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, so we can write the equation: T + A + S + 2T + 3S = 500.

Substituting the values we know, we get 30 + A + 15 + 2(30) + 3(15) = 500.

Combine like terms: 30 + A + 15 + 60 + 45 = 500.

Combine the constants: 150 + A = 500.

Subtract 150 from both sides: A = 350.

The final answer is: 350"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump. We also know that there are a total of 304 bumps. 

Let's say the number of camels is C and the number of dromedaries is D. We can set up the equation for the total number of bumps: 2C + D = 304.

We also know that the total number of heads is 180. Since each animal has one head, we can set up the equation: C + D = 180.

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for C and D by substituting the second equation into the first one. 

Rearranging the second equation, we get C = 180 - D. 

Substituting this into the first equation, we get 2(180 - D) + D = 304.

Expanding the equation, we get 360 - 2D + D = 304.

Combine like terms: 360 - D = 304.

Subtract 360 from both sides: -D = -56.

Multiply both sides by -1: D = 56.

So, there are 56 dromedaries.

"To find the total distance Tom traveled, we need to break it down into parts.

First, let's calculate the distance Tom traveled in the first 4 days. 
Distance = 200 kilometers/day * 4 days = 800 kilometers.

Next, let's calculate the distance Tom traveled over the next two days. 
He traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days. 
Distance = 30% * 800 kilometers = 0.3 * 800 = 240 kilometers.

So, the total distance Tom traveled in the first 6 days is 800 + 240 = 1040 kilometers.

On the 7th day, he didn't travel at all, so we don't need to add anything to the total.

Now, let's calculate the distance Tom traveled during the second week. 
Distance = 300 kilometers/day * 7 days = 2100 kilometers.

Finally, let's add the distances traveled in the first 6 days and the second week to get the total distance.
Total distance = 1040 kilometers + 2100 kilometers = 3140 kilometers.

The final answer is: 3140"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, and Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, we can find Zack's locker size by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4. 

Zack's locker size = 5 * 4 = 20 cubic inches.

Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can find Timothy's locker size by multiplying Zack's locker size by 2.

Timothy's locker size = 20 * 2 = 40 cubic inches.

"To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to find the difference between the elevation of Stanley's comb and Oliver's current elevation.

Stanley's comb fell from 10,000 feet to 6,000 feet (10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000), so the elevation of Stanley's comb is 6,000 feet.

Now, we need to find the difference between 6,000 feet and Oliver's current elevation of 3,000 feet.

6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000

So, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, the first bank gave Mr. Josue $4000. 

The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, so the second bank gave him 2 * $4000 = $8000.

Now, let's add the money from both banks: $4000 + $8000 = $12000.

Mr. Josue initially had $5000 in capital. To find the total capital now, we need to add the money from the banks to his initial capital: $5000 + $12000 = $16000.

The final answer is: $16000"
"To find out how many cats were left on the rock, we first need to calculate how many cats were taken away by the boats. 

There were 4 boats, and each boat took 5 cats. So, the total number of cats taken away is 4 * 5 = 20.

Now, we subtract the number of cats taken away from the initial number of cats on the rock. 
50 - 20 = 30

After that, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find out how many cats ran after the mouse, we need to calculate 3/5 of 30. 

3/5 * 30 = (3 * 30) / 5 = 90 / 5 = 18

Now, we subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats. 
30 - 18 = 12

So, there were 12 cats left on the rock.

"To find the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into the different periods and calculate the cost for each period.

The first 6 months cost $8 a month, so the total cost for the first 6 months is 6 * $8 = $48.

The next 8 months cost $12 a month, so the total cost for the next 8 months is 8 * $12 = $96.

After that, the price increased to $14 a month. Since 2 years is 24 months, we have 24 - 6 - 8 = 10 months left. The cost for the remaining 10 months is 10 * $14 = $140.

Now, we add up the costs for each period: $48 + $96 + $140 = $284.

The total cost for 2 years of the service is $284.

The final answer is: $284"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say the cost of the jogger jeans is x. Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, the cost of the tattered jeans is x + $6.

The total savings is $6, and Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. This means he saved 1/3 * $6 = $2 from the jogger jeans and the rest, which is $6 - $2 = $4, from the tattered jeans.

Since he saved $4 from the tattered jeans, the cost of the tattered jeans is $28 - $4 = $24.

Now we know the cost of the tattered jeans is $24 and the jogger jeans is x. We also know that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so x = $24 - $6 = $18.

The question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. The jogger jeans cost $18 and the tattered jeans cost $24, so the jogger jeans cost $24 - $18 = $6 less than the tattered jeans. However, the question asks how much more the jogger jeans cost than the tattered jeans, so the answer is the opposite, which is $6.

"Let's break this down step by step. Lillian made 3 bird feeders and bought 3, so she has a total of 3 + 3 = 6 bird feeders.

We know that each bird feeder attracts 20 birds, but the ones she made herself attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones. This means the store-bought ones attract 20 birds and the ones she made herself attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds.

Since there are 3 store-bought bird feeders and 3 homemade ones, we can calculate the total number of birds attracted by each type:

- Store-bought bird feeders: 3 * 20 = 60 birds
- Homemade bird feeders: 3 * 30 = 90 birds

Now, we add the total number of birds attracted by both types of bird feeders to get the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day:

60 + 90 = 150

"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to figure out how many cards he sold. 

First, we know that Kenny has $50 in spending cash and he needs $100 for the ticket. So, he needs to make $50 more. 

Since he sells each card for $1.5, we can divide $50 by $1.5 to find out how many cards he needs to sell to get the remaining money. 

$50 / $1.5 = 33.33

Since you can't sell a fraction of a card, we'll round down to 33 cards. 

Now, we know that Kenny sold 33 cards to get the remaining money. 

We also know that he kept 1/3 of his cards. Let's call the total number of cards he started with 'x'. 

So, the number of cards he sold is x - (1/3)x = 2/3x. 

We know that 2/3x = 33. 

To find x, we can multiply both sides by 3/2. 

x = 33 * (3/2) 
x = 49.5 

Since you can't have a fraction of a card, we'll round up to 50 cards. 

So, Kenny started with 50 cards.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many guests were originally supposed to have two hotdogs and how many were supposed to have one hotdog.

The caterer prepared enough hotdogs for half of the guests to have two hotdogs. Since there are 36 guests, half of them would be 36 / 2 = 18 guests. These 18 guests were supposed to have two hotdogs each.

The other half of the guests, which is also 18, were supposed to have one hotdog each.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means that the 18 guests who were supposed to have two hotdogs already got their second hotdog, and the remaining 22 guests (40 - 18 = 22) who were supposed to have one hotdog each also got a second hotdog.

Now, we need to find out how many guests did not get a second hotdog. Since the 18 guests who were supposed to have two hotdogs already got their second hotdog, and the 22 guests who were supposed to have one hotdog each got a second hotdog, the only guests who did not get a second hotdog are the 18 guests who were supposed to have one hotdog each.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items: $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

Since everything is 20% off, we need to find 20% of $165.00. 
20% of $165.00 is 0.20 x $165.00 = $33.00.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost: $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

15 gallons were equally divided into 5 containers, so each container has 15 / 5 = 3 gallons of gas.

Since Josey needed 1/4 of a container, we need to find 1/4 of 3 gallons. 

1/4 of 3 gallons is 3 * 1/4 = 3/4 gallon.

Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we need to convert 3/4 gallon to pints. 

3/4 gallon is equal to 3/4 * 8 = 6 pints.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

George spent $5 and had 1% of his money left, which means he spent 99% of his money. 

Since 1% of his money is equal to 1/100 of his money, we can set up an equation to find out how much money he had initially. Let's call the initial amount of money he had ""x"".

We know that 99% of x is equal to $5. We can write this as an equation:

0.99x = 5

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.99:

x = 5 / 0.99
x = 5.05

So George had $5.05 initially.

Now, let's find out how much he spent on chips. He bought 3 bags of chips for 40 cents each, so the total amount he spent on chips is:

3 x 0.40 = 1.20

Since he had $5.05 initially and spent $1.20 on chips, we can find out how much he had left after buying chips:

$5.05 - $1.20 = $3.85

Now, let's find out how much he spent on candy bars. He had $3.85 left and spent 99% of his money, which is equal to $3.85. We know that he spent $3.85 on chips and candy bars, so the amount he spent on candy bars is:

$3.85 - $1.20 = $2.65

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can find out how many candy bars he bought by dividing the total amount he spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar:

$2.65 / 0.75 = 3.53

Since we can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can buy 3 candy bars for $2.25 and have $0.40 left, which is not enough to buy another candy bar. Therefore, George bought 3 candy bars.

Ray had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. So, the number of lollipops he shared is 25 - 5 = 20.

Since he shared the lollipops equally with his 4 friends, we need to divide the number of lollipops he shared by the number of friends. 

20 lollipops / 4 friends = 5 lollipops per friend.

So, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

"To find out how much the remaining cake weighs, we need to first find out how much cake was eaten. 

Rory and her mom each had a piece, so that's 2 pieces in total. Since there were 8 pieces in the cake, we can subtract 2 from 8 to find out how many pieces are left. 

8 - 2 = 6

Since each piece weighs the same, we can multiply the number of remaining pieces by the weight of one piece. The cake weighs 20 ounces in total, so we need to divide 20 by 8 to find the weight of one piece.

20 / 8 = 2.5 ounces per piece

Now, we multiply the weight of one piece by the number of remaining pieces.

2.5 * 6 = 15

The remaining cake weighs 15 ounces.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how long it takes Bernadette to get to the theater and then add 5 minutes to that time to make sure she arrives before Wayne.

Since it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, and Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's, we can multiply Wayne's time by 4 to find Bernadette's time.

Bernadette's time = 4 * 4 = 16 minutes

To arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, Bernadette needs to leave 5 minutes before Wayne's time. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes, Bernadette needs to leave 4 - 5 = -1 minutes before Wayne. However, since time can't be negative, this means Bernadette needs to leave 1 minute after Wayne to arrive 5 minutes before him.

So, Bernadette should leave 1 minute after Wayne.

"To find the perimeter of the room, we first need to find the width of the room. We know the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards. 

First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet because the area is given in square feet. There are 3 feet in a yard, so 3 yards is equal to 3 x 3 = 9 feet.

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is length times width (A = lw). We can rearrange this formula to solve for the width: width = area / length. 

Plugging in the values we know, we get width = 360 / 9 = 40 feet.

Now that we have the width, we can find the perimeter of the room using the formula P = 2(length + width). Plugging in the values we know, we get P = 2(9 + 40) = 2(49) = 98 feet.

The final answer is: 98"

"To find the final temperature, we need to calculate the temperature after Marcus bakes and then after he opens the window.

First, let's calculate the temperature after baking. The oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour, and Marcus bakes for 3 hours. So, the temperature increase is 5 * 3 = 15 degrees.

The initial temperature is 40 degrees, and it increases by 15 degrees after baking. So, the temperature after baking is 40 + 15 = 55 degrees.

Now, let's calculate the temperature after Marcus opens the window. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes, which is 3 sets of 10 minutes. So, the temperature decrease is 2 * 3 = 6 degrees.

The temperature after baking is 55 degrees, and it decreases by 6 degrees after the window is open. So, the final temperature is 55 - 6 = 49 degrees.

"To find out how long it took James to do the run, we need to first find out how long it took James to complete the entire triathlon. 

First, let's find out how long it took Jon to complete the triathlon. 
Jon's total time is 40 minutes (swim) + 80 minutes (bike ride) + 50 minutes (run) = 170 minutes.

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James' total time is 170 minutes - 10 minutes = 160 minutes.

Now, let's find out how long it took James to swim. 
James swims 10% faster than Jon, so James' swim time is 40 minutes - (10% of 40 minutes) = 40 minutes - 4 minutes = 36 minutes.

Now, let's find out how long it took James to bike. 
James takes 5 minutes longer than Jon on the bike, so James' bike time is 80 minutes + 5 minutes = 85 minutes.

Now, we know James' swim time (36 minutes), bike time (85 minutes), and total time (160 minutes). 
We can find James' run time by subtracting his swim and bike times from his total time. 
James' run time is 160 minutes - 36 minutes - 85 minutes = 39 minutes.

"To find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay, we need to calculate the total cost of the hay and subtract it from the amount of money he has.

First, let's find out how many miles the horse runs in 30 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 30 minutes is half an hour. 

Speed = 32 miles per hour
Time = 0.5 hours

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 32 * 0.5
Distance = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile, and it ran 16 miles, it will eat 16 * 1/2 = 8 bails of hay.

A bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost of the hay is:
8 bails * $3 per bail = $24

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of:
6 * $5 = $30

Now, let's subtract the cost of the hay from the amount of money Michael has:
$30 - $24 = $6

So, Michael has $6 in change after buying the hay.

The final answer is: $6"
"To find out how many eggs Rozanne has in total, we need to calculate the number of eggs in the cases and add the loose eggs. 

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, 4 dozen eggs will be 4 x 12 = 48 eggs. 

Adding the 2 loose eggs, Rozanne has a total of 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Each glass of eggnog needs 5 eggs, so the total number of glasses Rozanne can make is 50 / 5 = 10 glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, the number of trays Rozanne can put out is 10 / 5 = 2 trays.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many points Joey is winning by, we need to first calculate the total points each person has after their turn.

Joey starts with 214 points and scores 26 points, so he now has 214 + 26 = 240 points.

Marcy starts with 225 points and scores 10 points, so she now has 225 + 10 = 235 points.

To find out how many points Joey is winning by, we subtract Marcy's points from Joey's points: 240 - 235 = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the salesman's profit, we need to first find the total cost and total revenue.

The salesman bought 48 sneakers for $576. 

The cost per sneaker can be found by dividing the total cost by the number of sneakers:
Cost per sneaker = Total cost / Number of sneakers
Cost per sneaker = $576 / 48
Cost per sneaker = $12

The salesman sold 17 sneakers for $20 each on Monday:
Revenue from Monday sales = Number of sneakers sold * Price per sneaker
Revenue from Monday sales = 17 * $20
Revenue from Monday sales = $340

The rest of the sneakers were sold to a department store for $25 each. Since there were 48 sneakers in total and 17 were sold on Monday, the number of sneakers sold to the department store is:
Number of sneakers sold to department store = Total sneakers - Sneakers sold on Monday
Number of sneakers sold to department store = 48 - 17
Number of sneakers sold to department store = 31

Revenue from department store sales = Number of sneakers sold to department store * Price per sneaker
Revenue from department store sales = 31 * $25
Revenue from department store sales = $775

Total revenue = Revenue from Monday sales + Revenue from department store sales
Total revenue = $340 + $775
Total revenue = $1115

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $1115 - $576
Profit = $539

The final answer is: $539"

First, let's find the total number of crayons in the six packets with 8 pieces each: 
6 packets * 8 crayons/packet = 48 crayons

Next, let's find the total number of crayons in the four packets with 16 pieces each: 
4 packets * 16 crayons/packet = 64 crayons

Now, we add the total number of crayons from both types of packets to find the overall total: 
48 crayons + 64 crayons = 112 crayons

The final answer is: 112"
"Let's break down the information given. 

If you buy the super ticket for $20, you get one popcorn and a soda for $1 extra. This means the total cost for the super ticket and the popcorn and soda is $21. 

If you buy the movie ticket for $12 and the popcorn and soda at regular price, the total cost is $12 + (popcorn price + soda price). 

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the total cost of the movie ticket and the popcorn and soda at regular price is $21 - $2 = $19.

We know the soda costs $3, so the popcorn price can be found by subtracting the soda price from the total cost minus the movie ticket price: $19 - $12 - $3 = $4.

The regular price of popcorn is $4. 

The final answer is: $4"
"To find out how much Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons after the price increase, we first need to find out the cost of filling one balloon before the price increase. 

Let's call the original cost of filling one balloon 'x'. Since the total cost of filling 20 balloons was $900, we can set up the equation 20x = 900. 

To find 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 20: x = 900 / 20 = 45. 

So, the original cost of filling one balloon was $45. 

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20, so the new cost of filling one balloon is 45 + 20 = 65 dollars.

Now, we need to find out how much Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons at the new price. We multiply the new cost of filling one balloon by the number of balloons: 65 * 170 = 11050.

The final answer is: 11050"
"To find the average speed of the car during the trip, we need to find the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

First, let's find the distance traveled at 60 mph for 2 hours. 

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 60 mph x 2 hours
Distance = 120 miles

Next, let's find the distance traveled at 30 mph for 1 hour.

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 30 mph x 1 hour
Distance = 30 miles

Now, let's find the total distance traveled.

Total Distance = 120 miles + 30 miles
Total Distance = 150 miles

The total time taken is 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours.

Now, we can find the average speed.

Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
Average Speed = 150 miles / 3 hours
Average Speed = 50 mph

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how much money all her jewels are worth, we need to first find out how many sapphires and rubies Jenna has left after the trade.

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires and trades 3 for 2 rubies. This means she has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left.

She now has 2 rubies.

The value of sapphires is $800 each, so 5 sapphires are worth 5 x $800 = $4000.

The value of rubies is $1200 each, so 2 rubies are worth 2 x $1200 = $2400.

To find the total value of all her jewels, we add the value of the sapphires and rubies together: $4000 + $2400 = $6400.

The final answer is: $6400"
"To find out how many apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of apples they eat per day and then multiply it by 30.

Marin and Nancy each eat 4 apples a day. So together, they eat 4 + 4 = 8 apples per day.

Now, we multiply 8 apples per day by 30 days: 8 * 30 = 240 apples.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the total volume of soil needed, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed and then multiply it by the number of beds. 

The volume of one raised bed is calculated by multiplying its length, width, and height: 
Volume = length * width * height
Volume = 8 * 2 * 2
Volume = 32 cubic feet

Since there are 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:
Total Volume = Volume * Number of beds
Total Volume = 32 * 10
Total Volume = 320 cubic feet

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil, so the total number of bags needed is:
Total Bags = Total Volume / Volume per bag
Total Bags = 320 / 2
Total Bags = 160

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:
Total Cost = Total Bags * Cost per bag
Total Cost = 160 * 12
Total Cost = 1920

The final answer is: $1920"
"To find the total number of cards, we need to find the number of green cards and yellow cards first. 

First, let's find the number of green cards. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can calculate it as follows:

Number of green cards = Number of red cards + (60% of Number of red cards)
= 15 + (0.6 * 15)
= 15 + 9
= 24

Now, let's find the number of yellow cards. It's given that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards.

Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
= 15 + 24
= 39

Now, we have the number of red cards, green cards, and yellow cards. To find the total number of cards, we add them together.

Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
= 15 + 24 + 39
= 78

The final answer is: 78"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Katelyn saw 50 fairies initially. 

After 20 minutes, one of her friends saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the fairies that were there. This means her friend saw 50 / 2 = 25 fairies. So, the total number of fairies now is 50 + 25 = 75.

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. So, the remaining number of fairies is 75 - 30 = 45.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the total number of puppies, we need to add Jennifer's puppies and Brandon's puppies. 

Jennifer has 8 puppies and Brandon has 12 puppies, so the total number of puppies is 8 + 12 = 20.

Now, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots. Jennifer has 3 puppies with spots and Brandon has 4 puppies with spots, so the total number of puppies with spots is 3 + 4 = 7.

To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we need to divide the number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiply by 100.

Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

"To find out how many trips the farmer needs to make, we need to calculate the total weight of all the feed and divide it by the weight his truck can carry.

First, let's calculate the total weight of each type of feed:

- Sugar cubes: 2 boxes * 1 pound per box = 2 pounds
- Carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds per bag = 48 pounds
- Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds per bale = 3150 pounds
- Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds per sack = 1300 pounds

Now, let's add up the total weight of all the feed:
2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3400 pounds

Since the farmer's truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, we need to divide the total weight by the truck's capacity to find out how many trips are needed:
3400 / 2250 = 1.511 (round up to 2 trips since you can't make a fraction of a trip)

The farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To find out how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate the total amount she earns from aluminum cans and plastic bottles separately and then add them together.

Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans a week. Since an aluminum can is worth 2 cents, she earns 3 x 2 = 6 cents from aluminum cans per week. 

In a four-week month, she earns 6 x 4 = 24 cents from aluminum cans.

Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles a week. Since a plastic bottle is worth 3 cents, she earns 5 x 3 = 15 cents from plastic bottles per week.

In a four-week month, she earns 15 x 4 = 60 cents from plastic bottles.

To find the total amount she earns in a four-week month, we add the amount from aluminum cans and plastic bottles: 24 + 60 = 84 cents.

"To find out how many plants Shondra has, we need to first find out how many plants Toni has. 

Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick. Since Frederick has 10 plants, we need to find 60% of 10 and add it to 10.

60% of 10 is 0.6 x 10 = 6. 

So, Toni has 10 + 6 = 16 plants.

Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. Since Toni has 16 plants, we subtract 7 from 16 to find out how many plants Shondra has.

16 - 7 = 9

So, Shondra has 9 plants.

9"

"To find out how many students Miss Maria has, we need to know the total number of cards she has. 

First, let's calculate the total number of basketball cards. She has 6 decks with 25 cards in each deck. 

6 decks * 25 cards/deck = 150 basketball cards

Next, let's calculate the total number of baseball cards. She has 5 boxes with 40 cards in each box.

5 boxes * 40 cards/box = 200 baseball cards

Now, we add the total number of basketball cards and baseball cards to find the total number of cards.

150 basketball cards + 200 baseball cards = 350 cards

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards, so we subtract 50 from the total number of cards to find the number of cards she gives to her students.

350 cards - 50 cards = 300 cards

Since each student gets 10 cards, we divide the total number of cards given to students by 10 to find the number of students.

300 cards / 10 cards/student = 30 students

"Let's break down the problem. Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total. He can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus 2 extra for cleaning his room. 

Let's say the number of carrot sticks Matt eats is 'x'. Then, the number of cookies he gets for eating carrot sticks is x/2. He also gets 2 extra cookies for cleaning his room. 

So, the total number of cookies he gets is x/2 + 2. Since he wants to eat 5 cookies in total, we can set up the equation:

x/2 + 2 = 5

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. We can do this by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation:

x/2 = 5 - 2
x/2 = 3

Now, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks to get 5 cookies.

So, Stetson ate 24 oranges. 

Now, we multiply the number of oranges Stetson ate by the amount he gave up for each orange, which is $10.

24 * 10 = 240

The final answer is: $240"
"To find the cost of Jillian's handbag, we need to first find 3 times the cost of her shoes. 

3 times the cost of her shoes is 3 x $80 = $240.

Since her handbag cost $20 less than 3 times as much as her shoes, we need to subtract $20 from $240.

$240 - $20 = $220.

The final answer is: $220"
"To find out how many hours James runs a week, we need to first find out how many miles he runs in a week. 

James runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week. So, the total miles he runs in a week is 12 miles/day * 5 days/week = 60 miles/week.

Since James runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour, we can find the total hours he runs in a week by dividing the total miles he runs in a week by his speed. 

Total hours = Total miles / Speed
Total hours = 60 miles/week / 10 miles/hour
Total hours = 6 hours/week

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, we first need to calculate how much oats his horses eat in a day. 

Each horse eats 5 pounds of oats per meal, and he feeds them twice a day. So, each horse eats 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of oats per day.

Since Uncle Ben has 4 horses, the total amount of oats they eat in a day is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

Now, we need to find out how much oats they eat in 5 days. So, we multiply the daily consumption by 5: 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats, so we need to divide the total amount of oats needed by the amount in each bag: 200 / 50 = 4.

So, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for 5 days.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many Pomeranians Jana has, we need to calculate two thirds of 27. 

Two thirds of 27 is calculated as (2/3) * 27 = 18. 

Now, we need to find out how many of these 18 Pomeranians are girls. One third of the Pomeranians are girls, so we calculate one third of 18.

One third of 18 is (1/3) * 18 = 6.

So, Jana has 6 girl Pomeranians.

"To find the average highest temperature, we need to add up all the temperatures and divide by the number of countries.

The highest temperature in Southlandia is -48 degrees Fahrenheit.
The highest temperature in Northlandia is 21 degrees Fahrenheit.
The highest temperature in Midlandia is -3 degrees Fahrenheit.

First, let's add up the temperatures: 
-48 + 21 + (-3) = -30

Now, we divide the sum by the number of countries (3):
-30 / 3 = -10

The average highest temperature of these 3 countries is -10 degrees Fahrenheit.

"To find out how many days it will take for the child to save the remaining amount, we need to first find out how much more money he needs to save. 

The toy costs $12 and he already has $4, so he needs to save $12 - $4 = $8 more.

He promises to save $2 daily from his allowance. To find out how many days it will take to save $8, we can divide the amount he needs to save ($8) by the amount he saves daily ($2).

$8 / $2 = 4

So, it will take the child 4 days to save the remaining amount of money. 

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many eggs Jaime won't be able to place on the tray, we need to see how many eggs he can place on the 2 trays and then subtract that from the total number of eggs he has.

Each tray can hold 24 eggs, and Jaime has 2 trays, so he can place 24 * 2 = 48 eggs on the trays.

Jaime has 64 eggs in total, and he can place 48 eggs on the trays. To find out how many eggs he won't be able to place, we subtract 48 from 64.

64 - 48 = 16

So, Jaime won't be able to place 16 eggs on the tray.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much Sally spent, we need to calculate the cost of the family-size pizza first. Since it costs 3 times as much as the small pizza, we multiply the cost of the small pizza by 3.

Cost of small pizza: $8
Cost of family-size pizza: $8 * 3 = $24

Now, we add the cost of the small pizza and the family-size pizza to find the total amount spent.

Total cost: $8 + $24 = $32

The final answer is: $32"
"To find the cost of each individual razor after the discount, we need to first calculate the total cost of 2 packs of razors with the sale and the coupon.

Since the razors are buy one get one free, Heather will only pay for 1 pack of razors. The cost of 1 pack is $4.00. 

Heather also has a $2.00 coupon, so she will get a discount of $2.00.

The total cost of 1 pack of razors after the coupon is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since there are 4 razors in a pack, the cost of each individual razor is $2.00 / 4 = $0.50.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.50 * 100 = 50 cents.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total height of the human pyramid, we need to add the heights of the cheerleaders in each level. 

First, let's find the average height of the 9 cheerleaders who are 64"" tall. 

Average height = (9 * 64) / 9 = 64 inches

Now, let's calculate the total height of each level:

- The bottom 4 girls are 64"" each, so their total height is 4 * 64 = 256 inches.
- The 3 girls on top of the 4 are also 64"" each, so their total height is 3 * 64 = 192 inches.
- The 2 girls on top of the 3 are also 64"" each, so their total height is 2 * 64 = 128 inches.
- The shortest girl at the top is 60"" tall.

Now, let's add the heights of all the levels: 
256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 536 inches

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches):
536 / 12 = 44.67 feet

The final answer is: 44.67"
"To find out how many minutes Charisma walked, we need to calculate the total number of minutes she walked in a day and then multiply it by the number of days she worked.

Charisma walks 5 minutes every hour, and she works 8 hours a day. So, the total minutes she walks in a day is 5 * 8 = 40 minutes.

Since she worked for 5 days, we multiply the daily minutes by the number of days: 40 * 5 = 200 minutes.

The final answer is: 200"
"Let's break this down step by step. 

Brett is 14 years old now. In four years, he will be 14 + 4 = 18 years old.

In four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. Since Brett is 14 now, three times that is 3 * 14 = 42.

So, in four years, Angela will be 42 years old. To find out how old Angela is now, we need to subtract 4 from 42. 

42 - 4 = 38.

Angela is 38 years old now.

38"
"To find out how much money Paul spent on driving his car, we need to calculate the total cost of the morning rides and the total cost of the afternoon rides, then add them together.

The cost of the morning rides is the cost per ride multiplied by the number of rides. Since Paul drives twice a day for 14 days, he drives a total of 2 * 14 = 28 rides in the morning. The cost per ride is $6, so the total cost of the morning rides is 28 * $6 = $168.

The cost of the afternoon rides is also the cost per ride multiplied by the number of rides. Since Paul drives twice a day for 14 days, he drives a total of 2 * 14 = 28 rides in the afternoon. The cost per ride is $2, so the total cost of the afternoon rides is 28 * $2 = $56.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the morning rides and the cost of the afternoon rides: $168 + $56 = $224.

The final answer is: $224"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so she has a total of 5 x 10 = 50 oranges.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so she has 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

In total, they have 50 + 70 = 120 oranges.

One Greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, so to find out how many pies they can make, we need to divide the total number of oranges by 3.

120 ÷ 3 = 40

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's break down the costs for each venue.

For the first venue, the cost is a flat fee of $200, plus $5 per guest. If there are x guests, the total cost for the first venue is $200 + $5x.

For the second venue, the cost is $25 per guest. If there are x guests, the total cost for the second venue is $25x.

Since we want the two venues to be equal in cost, we can set up an equation:

$200 + $5x = $25x

To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting $5x from both sides:

$200 = $20x

Next, we can divide both sides by $20 to solve for x:

x = $200 / $20
x = 10

So, Mark needs 10 guests for the two venues to be equal in cost. 

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Let's say David found x insects. Since Lily found 7 more than David, Lily found x + 7 insects. 

We also know that David found half of what Bodhi found. So, Bodhi found 2x insects (since David found half of Bodhi's insects).

We know that together they collected 43 insects. So, the total number of insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi is x + (x + 7) + 2x = 43.

Combine like terms: 4x + 7 = 43.

Subtract 7 from both sides: 4x = 36.

Divide both sides by 4: x = 9.

Since David found x insects, David found 9 insects. Since Lily found 7 more than David, Lily found 9 + 7 = 16 insects.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how many yards of yarn they used altogether, we need to find out how many yards Mariah used and how many yards her grandma used, then add them together.

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein of yarn. Since there are 364 yards in a skein, we multiply 364 by 1/4 to find out how many yards Mariah used. 

364 * 1/4 = 364 / 4 = 91 yards

Her grandma used 1/2 of a skein of yarn. We multiply 364 by 1/2 to find out how many yards her grandma used.

364 * 1/2 = 364 / 2 = 182 yards

Now, we add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma together.

91 + 182 = 273 yards

They used 273 yards of yarn altogether.

273"
"To find the total number of gifts Cherrie bought, we need to calculate the number of gifts for her friends and add the 10 random gifts.

First, let's calculate the number of gifts for her friends. 2 friends want 5 gifts each, so that's 2 x 5 = 10 gifts. The other 3 friends want 2 gifts each, so that's 3 x 2 = 6 gifts. 

Now, let's add the gifts for her friends: 10 + 6 = 16 gifts.

Then, we add the 10 random gifts: 16 + 10 = 26 gifts.

So, Cherrie bought 26 gifts in total.

The final answer is: 26"
"To find the length of the couch, we need to first find the width of the rug. 

The chair is 3 feet wide, and the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair. So, the rug's width is 3 + 5 = 8 feet.

The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Twice the width of the rug is 2 * 8 = 16 feet. 

Adding 2 feet to that, the couch is 16 + 2 = 18 feet long.

"Let's break down the information given. Suzie bought 4 packs of gum in total. She bought 2 packs of strawberry gum, 1 pack of grape gum, and 1 pack of green apple gum.

We know that the pack of grape gum cost $2. The pack of green apple gum cost half as much as the pack of grape gum, so it cost $2 / 2 = $1.

We also know that Suzie paid a total of $7. We can set up an equation to represent this:

2x + 2 + 1 = 7

Where x is the cost of each pack of strawberry gum.

Combine like terms:

2x + 3 = 7

Subtract 3 from both sides:

2x = 4

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 2

The cost of each pack of strawberry gum is $2."
"To find the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to determine which type of wood gives him the most sticks per dollar spent. 

Let's calculate the cost per stick for each type of wood:

For a 2 x 4, Frederick can get 200 sticks for $4. 
Cost per stick = $4 / 200 sticks = $0.02 per stick

For a 2 x 8, Frederick can get 400 sticks for $6.
Cost per stick = $6 / 400 sticks = $0.015 per stick

Since the 2 x 8 costs less per stick, Frederick should buy the 2 x 8 wood to get the most popsicle sticks.

Now, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces of wood Frederick can buy with $24:
Number of 2 x 8 pieces = $24 / $6 = 4

Since each 2 x 8 piece gives 400 sticks, the total number of sticks Frederick can make is:
Total sticks = 4 * 400 = 1600

The final answer is: 1600"
"To find the total cost of the snowshoes, we need to first find out how many snowshoes Mario needs in total. Since each dog has 4 legs and he has 6 dogs, we multiply the number of dogs by the number of legs each dog has.

6 dogs * 4 legs = 24 legs

Since each dog needs a pair of snowshoes, we need to divide the total number of legs by 2 to get the total number of snowshoes.

24 legs / 2 = 12 snowshoes

Now, we multiply the total number of snowshoes by the cost of each pair to find the total cost.

12 snowshoes * $12.00 = $144.00

The final answer is: $144.00"
"To find out how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate how much she spends on bus trips in a week and then subtract the cost of the weekly pass from that amount.

Janet takes two bus trips a day, five days a week. So, she takes 2 * 5 = 10 bus trips a week. 

Each bus trip costs $2.20, so the total cost of bus trips in a week is 10 * $2.20 = $22.

The weekly bus pass costs $20. To find out how much Janet would save, we subtract the cost of the weekly pass from the total cost of bus trips: $22 - $20 = $2.

So, Janet would save $2 by buying a weekly bus pass. 

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's break down the information given:

- The farm has 30 cows.
- The zoo has 20 sheep.
- The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does. This means the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.
- The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does. Since the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals in the farm and the zoo:

Farm: 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals
Zoo: 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals

Total animals in the farm and the zoo: 40 + 80 = 120

"Let's break down the information given. Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. We know that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought. 

Let's assume the number of onions Sophia bought is 'x'. Then, the number of potatoes Sophia bought is also 'x'. 

Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, the number of onions Rose bought is 4x and the number of potatoes Rose bought is also 4x. 

We are given that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. So, we can set up the equations: 
4x = 12 (for onions) 
4x = 4 (for potatoes)

For onions: 4x = 12 
x = 12 / 4 
x = 3 

So, Sophia bought 3 onions. 

For potatoes: 4x = 4 
x = 4 / 4 
x = 1 

So, Sophia bought 1 potato.

The total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is 3 + 1 = 4.

December has 31 days, and from January to July, there are 6 months with 30 days each, and one month (July) with 19 days. 

31 + (30 * 6) + 19 = 31 + 180 + 19 = 230 days

Now, we know Andy needs to lose 30 pounds, and it takes 3500 calories to lose 1 pound. So, to lose 30 pounds, he needs to burn 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories.

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories needed by the number of days: 105,000 / 230 = 456.52 calories.

So, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of approximately 457 calories to reach his goal.

"To find out how much Gerald has left, we need to first calculate how much he earned in a week. Since he works 7 days a week, and he earns $30 per day, we multiply the number of days by his daily earnings.

7 days * $30/day = $210

Now, we know Gerald spent a total of $100. To find out how much he has left, we subtract the amount he spent from the amount he earned.

$210 - $100 = $110

So, Gerald has $110 left."
"To find out how many milliliters of water Hannah needs to drink, we need to first find out how many kilometers she will run. 

Since each lap is 0.25 km and she needs to run 8 laps, we multiply the number of laps by the distance of each lap: 
8 laps * 0.25 km/lap = 2 km

Now, we know Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs. So, we multiply the total distance she runs by the amount of water she needs per kilometer:
2 km * 60 ml/km = 120 ml

First, Julie spent 20% of $500 on clothes. 

20% of $500 is 0.2 x 500 = $100. 

So, she spent $100 on clothes, leaving her with $500 - $100 = $400.

Then, she spent 25% of the remaining money on CDs. 

25% of $400 is 0.25 x 400 = $100.

So, she spent $100 on CDs, leaving her with $400 - $100 = $300.

The final answer is: $300"
"Let's break this problem down step by step. 

Let's say the cost of the lot is x. Since the house cost three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot together is $120,000. We can write an equation to represent this:

x + 3x = 120,000

Combine like terms:

4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 30,000

So the cost of the lot is $30,000. Since the house cost three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x = 3 * 30,000 = 90,000.

Kelsie made 18 cookies."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps below:

1. First, we need to find the total amount of money Ali has. He has 4 $10 bills and 6 $20 bills. 
   The total amount of money from $10 bills is 4 * $10 = $40.
   The total amount of money from $20 bills is 6 * $20 = $120.
   So, the total amount of money Ali has is $40 + $120 = $160.

2. Now, Ali gives his sister half of the total money he has. Half of $160 is $160 / 2 = $80. 
   So, Ali gives his sister $80 and is left with $160 - $80 = $80.

3. Then, Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount of money to buy dinner. 3/5 of $80 is (3/5) * $80 = $48.
   So, Ali has $80 - $48 = $32 left after buying dinner.

Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Bobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony, so Bobby can pick 6 - 1 = 5 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy can pick 2 * 5 = 10 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy, so Ricky can pick 10 - 2 = 8 quarts of strawberries per hour.

"To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to first find out how many cups of raisins she has left after dividing the bag among the three recipes. 

Since she's dividing the raisins equally among the three recipes, she'll divide the total raisins by 3. 

Total raisins = 27 cups
Raisins per recipe = 27 / 3 = 9 cups

Now, we know that each batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins. To find out how many batches she can make, we'll divide the raisins per recipe by the raisins per batch of oatmeal cookies.

Raisins per recipe = 9 cups
Raisins per batch of oatmeal cookies = 3/4 cup

To divide 9 by 3/4, we can multiply 9 by the reciprocal of 3/4, which is 4/3.

9 * (4/3) = 12

So, Heather can make 12 batches of oatmeal cookies.

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we need to calculate her daily and weekly consumption before and after adding the new device.

Before adding the new device, Ada's daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. Since there are 24 hours in a day, her daily consumption in dollars is:

12 kilowatts/hour * 24 hours = 288 kilowatt-hours per day
288 kilowatt-hours per day * $1.50 = $432 per day

Since there are 7 days in a week, her weekly consumption is:

$432 per day * 7 days = $3024 per week

After adding the new device, her daily consumption will be:

12 kilowatts/hour + 2 kilowatts/hour = 14 kilowatts/hour
14 kilowatts/hour * 24 hours = 336 kilowatt-hours per day
336 kilowatt-hours per day * $1.50 = $504 per day

Her weekly consumption after adding the new device is:

$504 per day * 7 days = $3528 per week

The difference in her weekly electric bill is:

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many days it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house. 

If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then 5 people can paint half a house in 5 / 5 = 1 day. 

Since 5 people can paint half a house in 1 day, they can paint a whole house in 2 days. 

Now, we need to convert the number of days into hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 2 days is equal to 2 x 24 = 48 hours.

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

The final answer is: 48"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem.

Ophelia has 20 sofas. Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than Ophelia, Jenna has 20 - 2 = 18 sofas.

It's also given that Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. If we let the number of Ophelia's chairs be 'x', then Jenna has 3x chairs. Since Ophelia has 20 sofas, we can set up an equation to find the number of Ophelia's chairs: x = 20 + 2 (since Ophelia has 2 fewer chairs than sofas). 

Solving for x, we get x = 22. This means Ophelia has 22 chairs.

Now, Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.

To find the total number of sofas and chairs, we add the number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have: 20 (Ophelia's sofas) + 18 (Jenna's sofas) + 22 (Ophelia's chairs) + 66 (Jenna's chairs) = 106.

The final answer is: 106"
"Let's break down the problem. Tom bought a CD for $4 and a headphone set for some amount of money. The total he paid is $48. 

Let's say the cost of the headphone set is x. Then, the total cost of the items is 4 + x = 48. 

To find the cost of the headphone set, we need to solve for x. 

4 + x = 48
x = 48 - 4
x = 44

So, the cost of the headphone set is $44. 

Now, let's find out how many CDs Tom could have bought if he had not bought the headphone set. 

The cost of one CD is $4. If he had not bought the headphone set, he would have had $44 more to spend on CDs. 

Number of CDs he could have bought = 44 / 4
= 11

So, Tom could have bought 11 more CDs if he had not bought the headphone set.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we need to calculate the total hours he spent in the weeks where he worked out 4 hours, 5 hours, and 6 hours.

Let's assume the weeks where he worked out 4 hours are x weeks. Since he worked out 5 hours for 2 consecutive weeks, that's 2 weeks. And he worked out 6 hours for 1 week.

The total number of weeks is 8. So, the number of weeks where he worked out 4 hours is 8 - 2 - 1 = 5 weeks.

The total hours spent working out 4 hours per week is 4 * 5 = 20 hours.
The total hours spent working out 5 hours per week is 5 * 2 = 10 hours.
The total hours spent working out 6 hours per week is 6 * 1 = 6 hours.

Now, let's add up the total hours: 20 + 10 + 6 = 36 hours.

The total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is 36."
"To find the number of passengers after the second stop, we need to follow the sequence of events step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off. So, the number of passengers left is 48 - 8 = 40.

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (which is 8) get into the bus. So, 5 * 8 = 40 people get in. Now, the total number of passengers is 40 (left) + 40 (got in) = 80.

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off. So, the number of passengers left is 80 - 21 = 59.

Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on. Since 3 times fewer means 1/3 of the number of passengers who got off, we need to find 1/3 of 21. 1/3 of 21 is 7. So, 7 passengers get in. Now, the total number of passengers is 59 (left) + 7 (got in) = 66.

The final answer is: 66"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let Jame's current age be x. 

In 5 years, Jame will be x + 5 years old.

In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be (x + 5) + 8 = x + 13 years old.

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 13 = 2(x + 5) - 5

Simplifying the equation:

x + 13 = 2x + 10 - 5
x + 13 = 2x + 5
13 - 5 = 2x - x
8 = x

So, Jame's current age is 8 years.

Now, let's find Jame's cousin's current age. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age, which is 8 + 13 = 21 years old. 

Since Jame's cousin will be 21 in 8 years, his current age is 21 - 8 = 13 years old.

The difference in their ages is 8 - 13 = -5 years. However, since age difference cannot be negative, we need to take the absolute value of the difference.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the information given. 

The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400. The computer costs $1,100. 

Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, the cost of the printer is $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, we know the total cost of the computer and the printer is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800. 

To find the cost of the 2 monitors, we subtract the cost of the computer and the printer from the total cost: $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.

Since there are 2 monitors, we divide the cost of the 2 monitors by 2 to find the cost of one monitor: $600 / 2 = $300.

The final answer is: $300"
"To find out how many seashells each girl brought, we first need to find out how many seashells the girls brought in total. 

Since there are 20 kids in total and they were divided into two equal groups, there are 10 boys and 10 girls. 

The boys brought 60 shells each, so the total number of shells brought by the boys is 10 x 60 = 600.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 600 + 4 x 60 seashells.

First, we need to find out how many seashells the girls brought in total. 4 x 60 = 240. So, the girls brought 600 + 240 = 840 seashells in total.

Since there are 10 girls, to find out how many seashells each girl brought, we need to divide the total number of seashells brought by the girls by the number of girls. 

840 / 10 = 84.

The final answer is: 84"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we know that Nick had twice as many candies as George. If we say George had x candies initially, then Nick had 2x candies initially.

Then, George ate 5 candies, so George now has x - 5 candies.

We are also given that George now has 3 candies left, so we can set up the equation x - 5 = 3 to find out how many candies George had initially.

Solving the equation, we get x = 8. This means George had 8 candies initially.

Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, Nick had 2x = 2 * 8 = 16 candies initially.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how old Anne is, we need to know Alyana's age first. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, we can find Alyana's age by subtracting 4 from Chenny's age.

Alyana's age = Chenny's age - 4
Alyana's age = 10 - 4
Alyana's age = 6

Now that we know Alyana's age, we can find Anne's age by adding 2 to Alyana's age.

Anne's age = Alyana's age + 2
Anne's age = 6 + 2
Anne's age = 8

"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to find the thickness of each book first.

The first book is 31 mm thick.

The second book is 50 mm thick.

The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it's 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick.

The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it's 2 x 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add up the thickness of all four books: 31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188 mm.

"To find out how many vlogs Emma needs to make to complete 72 vlogs per month, we need to subtract the vlogs she has already made from the total number of vlogs she can make in a month.

Emma made 18 vlogs in the first week, 21 vlogs in the second week, and 15 vlogs in the third week. 

Total vlogs made = 18 + 21 + 15 = 54

Since Emma can make 72 vlogs per month, we subtract the total vlogs made from the total possible vlogs to find out how many more she needs to make.

Vlogs needed to complete = 72 - 54 = 18

So, Emma should make 18 more vlogs to complete 72 vlogs per month.

"To find out how much you paid, first, you need to calculate the total amount of the bill with the 20% tip. 

The 20% tip on a $50 dinner bill is calculated as 0.20 * $50 = $10. 

Now, add the tip to the original bill: $50 + $10 = $60.

Since your wife wants to split the check evenly, you'll divide the total amount by 2: $60 / 2 = $30.

So, you ended up paying $30.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much money the eldest boy initially got. Since $18 is shared among 3 boys, we divide $18 by 3 to find out the initial share of the eldest boy.

Initial share of the eldest boy = $18 / 3 = $6

The eldest boy added $5 to his share, so his new total is $6 + $5 = $11.

The following day, he added another $10, making his total $11 + $10 = $21.

Then, he spent $8 from his total, leaving him with $21 - $8 = $13.

After saving some more, he tripled the amount he had left after spending the $8. To find out how much he had left after saving, we need to multiply $13 by 3.

$13 * 3 = $39

So, the eldest boy now has $39."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much Elvis needs to save in the first half of the month. 

Let's assume the number of days in the first half of April is x. Since April has 30 days, the number of days in the second half will also be x. 

The total number of days in April is 30, so x + x = 30. 
Solving for x, we get 2x = 30, x = 15. 

So, the first half of April has 15 days and the second half also has 15 days.

Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half as in the first half. Let's say he saves y dollars in the first half. Then, he will save 2y dollars in the second half.

The total savings for the month is the sum of the savings in the first and second half: y + 2y = 1125.

Combine like terms: 3y = 1125.

Divide both sides by 3: y = 375.

So, Elvis needs to save 375 dollars in the first half of the month.

Since the second half has 15 days, and he needs to save twice as much as in the first half, he will save 2 * 375 = 750 dollars in the second half.

- 5 oranges at $0.80 each: 5 x $0.80 = $4.00
- 6 peaches at $0.75 each: 6 x $0.75 = $4.50

Now, let's add up the total cost: $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00

Since Verna gave $20, the change she received is: $20 - $13.00 = $7.00

The total amount of money they have is 100 dollars, so we can set up the equation: x + 4x = 100.

Combine like terms: 5x = 100.

Divide both sides by 5: x = 20.

Since Jeff gets 4x dollars, we can multiply x by 4: 4x = 4 * 20 = 80.

So, Jeff gets 80 dollars. 

The final answer is: $80"
"To find out how many miles Jeff walks in a week, we need to calculate the total distance he walks each day and then multiply it by the number of days he works.

Since Jeff walks to work and back each day, the distance he walks each day is 2 miles (3 miles to work + 3 miles back home).

So, the total distance he walks each day is 2 miles.

Since he works 5 times a week, we multiply the daily distance by 5:

2 miles/day * 5 days/week = 10 miles/week

"This is a classic example of exponential growth. Let's break it down step by step.

In the first round, Ali calls 3 families directly.

In the second round, each of the 3 families calls 3 other families, so there are 3 x 3 = 9 new families notified.

In the third round, each of the 9 families calls 3 other families, so there are 9 x 3 = 27 new families notified.

In the fourth round, each of the 27 families calls 3 other families, so there are 27 x 3 = 81 new families notified.

However, we also need to include the families that were notified in the previous rounds. In this case, we have 3 (from the first round) + 9 (from the second round) + 27 (from the third round) = 39 families that were already notified.

So, in the fourth round, a total of 81 (new families) + 39 (previously notified families) = 120 families will be notified.

"To find out how many toys Jonathan currently has, we need to first determine the total number of toys in the larger play set. Since James's play set has 80 toys and the larger play set is five times larger, we multiply 80 by 5.

80 * 5 = 400

Now, we know the larger play set has 400 toys. Since Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to make this set, we can represent the number of toys Jonathan currently has as x. The equation would be x + 2 = 400.

To find x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation.

x + 2 - 2 = 400 - 2
x = 398

So, Jonathan currently has 398 toys.

When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. 

When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long. This means he swims a mile in 2 * 16 + 2 = 32 + 2 = 34 minutes.

To find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a cold day, we multiply the time it takes him to swim 1 mile by 3. So, 16 * 3 = 48 minutes.

To find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day, we multiply the time it takes him to swim 1 mile by 3. So, 34 * 3 = 102 minutes.

"To find out how many cups Juan needs to reduce, we first need to know how many cups he drinks. Since Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, and Octavia drinks half the daily recommended amount, we need to know the daily recommended amount first.

Let's assume the daily recommended amount is x cups. Since Octavia drinks half of this, she drinks x/2 cups. Since Juan drinks 10 times the amount of Octavia, he drinks 10 * (x/2) = 5x cups.

We are told that Juan's doctor wants him to drink 4 cups a day. To find out how many cups he needs to reduce, we subtract the recommended amount from the amount he currently drinks: 5x - 4.

However, we don't know the value of x. But we can still express the answer in terms of x. The question asks for the number of cups Juan needs to reduce, so we don't need to find the actual value of x.

The number of cups Juan needs to reduce is 5x - 4.

But we need to find the numerical answer. To do that, we need to know the daily recommended amount of coffee. The daily recommended amount of coffee varies, but a common recommendation is 8 cups per day. 

If the daily recommended amount is 8 cups, then x = 8.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break this down step by step. 

Let's say Shiloh's nephew's age today is x. 

In 7 years, Shiloh will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old. 

In 7 years, his nephew will be x + 7 years old. 

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, we can set up the equation: 51 = 3(x + 7).

Now, let's solve for x. 

51 = 3x + 21

Subtract 21 from both sides: 
30 = 3x

Divide both sides by 3: 
10 = x

So, Shiloh's nephew is 10 years old today.

10"
"To find the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we need to calculate the money for each set of teeth and add them up.

For the first tooth, the tooth fairy left $5.00.

For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy left $1.00 each, so that's 3 x $1.00 = $3.00.

For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy left half the amount of the previous three teeth, which is $1.00 / 2 = $0.50 per tooth. So, for the last two teeth, the tooth fairy left 2 x $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up the money for all the teeth: $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"Let's break down the information given. 

Richie scored 80 goals. We know that Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, so Mark scored 80 - 20 = 60 goals. 

We also know that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, so Anna scored 80 - 45 = 35 goals.

To find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we add their individual goals: 80 (Richie) + 60 (Mark) + 35 (Anna) = 175.

The final answer is: 175"
"To find out how much more money Mitchell made than Liam, we need to first find out how much money Mitchell made and then subtract the amount Liam made from it.

Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 apiece, so we multiply 21 by 4 to find out how much he made: 21 * 4 = 84.

Now, we subtract the amount Liam made ($63) from the amount Mitchell made ($84): 84 - 63 = 21.

So, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam that weekend.

The final answer is: $21"
"To find out how many action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate how much money he has left after buying the wooden action figures and then see how many plastic action figures he can buy with the remaining money.

Peter spent $5 each day for 4 days (Sunday through Wednesday) on wooden action figures. So, he spent a total of 4 x $5 = $20 on wooden action figures.

He started with $70, so he has $70 - $20 = $50 left.

For the rest of the week (Thursday through Saturday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. There are 4 days left in the week, so he can buy 4 x $2 = $8 worth of plastic action figures.

However, he only has $50 left, and he can only spend $8 on plastic action figures. This means he will not be able to buy any more plastic action figures.

So, he will have 4 wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday and 0 plastic action figures from Thursday through Saturday.

Total action figures = 4 + 0 = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total cost of the kitten, we need to add up the cost of spaying, vaccines, and the broken vases.

The cost of spaying is $200.
The cost of 3 vaccines is 3 x $20 = $60.
The cost of 4 vases is 4 x $12 = $48.

Now, let's add up the costs: $200 + $60 + $48 = $308.

The final answer is: $308"
"To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops, we need to first find out how many roses he supplies in total per week and then subtract that from the total number of roses he grows per week.

The total number of roses Ford supplies per week is 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses.

Since Ford grows 40 roses per week, we subtract the total number of roses he supplies from the total number of roses he grows: 40 - 65 = -25 roses.

Since we can't have a negative number of roses, this means Ford lacks 25 roses per week.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks per month, we multiply the number of roses he lacks per week by the number of weeks in a month. There are approximately 4 weeks in a month, so 25 * 4 = 100 roses.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how much money will be remaining in Katina's account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount of money she will remove from the account in 2 years.

There are 12 months in a year, so in 2 years, there are 2 x 12 = 24 months.

Katina removes $100 from her account every month, so in 24 months, she will remove 24 x $100 = $2400.

To find out how much money will be remaining in her account, we need to subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount.

Initial amount = $3000
Total amount removed = $2400

Remaining amount = Initial amount - Total amount removed
= $3000 - $2400
= $600

So, after 2 years, Katina will have $600 remaining in her account.

The final answer is: $600"
"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

The cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is $3.00 per loaf, and since each loaf makes 10 sandwiches, the cost per sandwich is $3.00 / 10 = $0.30 per sandwich. 

The cost of cheese and condiments for 10 sandwiches is $30.00. So, the cost per sandwich is $30.00 / 10 = $3.00 per sandwich.

The total cost per sandwich is $0.30 (bread) + $3.00 (cheese and condiments) = $3.30 per sandwich.

The revenue per sandwich is $7.00.

The net profit per sandwich is $7.00 (revenue) - $3.30 (cost) = $3.70 per sandwich.

Since they sell 10 sandwiches, the total revenue is $7.00 x 10 = $70.00 and the total cost is $3.30 x 10 = $33.00.

The net profit is $70.00 (total revenue) - $33.00 (total cost) = $37.00.

The final answer is: $37.00"
"To find out how much money Kate can make, we need to know how many muffin crayons she can make. 

Since Kate melts 8 small pieces of crayons together in each muffin tin, and there are 3 boxes of 64 crayons, we need to find out how many small pieces of crayons there are in total. 

There are 3 boxes of 64 crayons, so there are 3 x 64 = 192 crayons in total. 

Since each box has 64 crayons, and each crayon is divided into 8 small pieces, there are 64 x 8 = 512 small pieces of crayons in total.

Now, we need to find out how many muffin crayons Kate can make. Since she melts 8 small pieces of crayons together in each muffin tin, she can make 512 / 8 = 64 muffin crayons.

If Kate can sell each muffin crayon for $1.50, she can make 64 x $1.50 = $96.

The final answer is: $96"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the area of the bedroom and then multiply it by the costs of the carpet, padding, and installation.

The area of the bedroom is 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet.

The cost of the new carpet is $12 per square foot, so the total cost of the carpet is 216 * $12 = $2592.

The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot, so the total cost of the padding is 216 * $2 = $432.

The cost of removing the old carpet is $4 per square foot, so the total cost of removing the old carpet is 216 * $4 = $864.

The cost of installing the new carpet is $34 per square foot, so the total cost of installing the new carpet is 216 * $34 = $7344.

The total cost is the sum of the costs of the carpet, padding, removal, and installation: $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344 = $11332.

The final answer is: $11332"
"To find the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we need to add up the total number of birds he saw over the week and then divide by the number of days.

First, let's add up the total number of birds Mack saw:

Day 1 and 2: 50 birds
Day 3: 0 birds
Day 4 and 5: 120 birds
Day 6: 20 birds
Day 7: 90 birds

Total number of birds = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds

There are 7 days in a week. To find the average, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days:

Average number of birds per day = Total number of birds / Number of days
= 280 / 7
= 40

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the final value of the number train, we need to follow the given steps.

1. The starting value of the number train is 20.
2. Half of the starting value is 20 / 2 = 10.
3. The starting value plus half the number is 20 + 10 = 30.
4. The resulting value is divided by 5, so 30 / 5 = 6.
5. The resulting value is multiplied by the starting value minus 12, so 6 * (20 - 12) = 6 * 8 = 48.

The final value of the number train is 48."
"To find out how many cards the brother has, we need to subtract 3 from the number of cards the boy has. 

The boy has 5 cards, so his brother has 5 - 3 = 2 cards.

Now, to find the total number of cards they have together, we need to add the number of cards the boy has to the number of cards his brother has.

5 (boy's cards) + 2 (brother's cards) = 7

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the percentage by which the oven is off, we need to find the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature, then divide it by the set temperature. 

The difference is 468 - 450 = 18. 
The percentage is (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%. 

Since the oven is off by 4%, we need to find the temperature that is 4% less than 520. 

First, we find 4% of 520: 0.04 * 520 = 20.8. 

Then, we subtract 20.8 from 520: 520 - 20.8 = 499.2.

So, Maggie should set her oven to 499.2 degrees. 

499.2"
"To find the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to add the length of both movies together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. We need to convert this to just minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 1 hour is 60 minutes. Adding 30 minutes to that gives us 60 + 30 = 90 minutes for the first movie.

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. We need to convert this to just minutes as well. 2 hours is 2 x 60 = 120 minutes. Adding 5 minutes to that gives us 120 + 5 = 125 minutes for the second movie.

Now, we add the time for both movies together: 90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes.

The final answer is: 215"
"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house price and subtract it from Herb's house price. 

30% of $76,000 is 0.3 x $76,000 = $22,800.

Now, subtract $22,800 from $76,000 to find the value of Juan's house: $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200.

The value of Juan's house is $53,200.

To find the combined value of the two houses, add the value of Juan's house to Herb's house price: $53,200 + $76,000 = $129,200.

The final answer is: $129,200."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy. So, her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

To find the total number of cups, we add Judy's cups and her friend's cups: 12 + 40 = 52 cups.

To find the total number of dishes, we add Judy's dishes and her friend's dishes: 24 + 44 = 68 dishes.

The total number of utensils (cups and dishes) brought by the two is 52 + 68 = 120.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find out how many pairs of contacts Pete will need, we need to multiply the number of days he needs contacts by the number of contacts he uses per day. 

Since 90 contacts will last 45 days, we can find out how many contacts he uses per day by dividing 90 by 45. 

90 / 45 = 2 contacts per day

Since Pete needs contacts for 2 boxes, we multiply the number of contacts per day by the number of days he needs contacts. 

2 contacts per day * 90 days = 180 contacts

Since 90 contacts come in a box, we need to find out how many boxes he needs. 

180 contacts / 90 contacts per box = 2 boxes

Since Pete buys 2 boxes, and each box is $100.00 with a 10% discount, we need to find the discount amount first. 

10% of $100.00 = 0.1 * $100.00 = $10.00

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the discounted price. 

$100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00

Since Pete buys 2 boxes, we multiply the discounted price by 2. 

$90.00 * 2 = $180.00

Now, we need to find the cost per pair of contacts. Since 90 contacts come in a box, we divide the total cost by the number of contacts in a box. 

$180.00 / 90 = $2.00

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we need to calculate how much each of them earned and then find the difference.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, for a total of 3 hours. Since she earns $10 an hour, she earned 3 * $10 = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday. In total, John worked 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

Since John earns $10 an hour, he earned 7 * $10 = $70.

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

"To find out how much water Hannah needs to drink, we need to calculate the total calories she burns from both activities. 

First, let's calculate the calories burned from aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories.

Next, let's calculate the calories burned from running: 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories.

Now, let's add the calories burned from both activities: 1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we need to divide the total calories by 200 to find out how many 200-calorie units she burned: 1600 calories / 200 calories = 8.

Now, we multiply the number of 200-calorie units by the amount of water needed per unit: 8 * 100 ml = 800 ml.

The final answer is: 800"
"Let's break down the information given. 

Let's say the number of blue jelly beans is B. 

Since there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans, the number of red jelly beans is B - 0.01B = 0.99B.

Since there are 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans, the number of green jelly beans is B + 0.01B = 1.01B.

The total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write the equation: B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500.

Combine like terms: 3.00B = 4500.

Divide both sides by 3: B = 1500.

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans. 

Number of red jelly beans: 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485.

Number of green jelly beans: 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515.

To find the difference between the number of green and red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans: 1515 - 1485 = 30.

After some lessons, his typing speed increased to 52 WPM. 
If he continues to increase his typing speed once more by 5 words, his new typing speed will be 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

Now, we have the three measurements: 47, 52, and 57. 

To find the average, we add the three measurements and divide by 3: 
(47 + 52 + 57) / 3 = 156 / 3 = 52.

"To find the difference in weight, we need to calculate the weight change for each option and then subtract the weight gained from the weight lost.

If Martin eats Cheerios every day for breakfast, he'll lose 1.25 pounds/week. After 5 weeks, he'll lose 1.25 * 5 = 6.25 pounds.

If Martin eats donuts every day for breakfast, he'll gain 1.75 pounds/week. After 5 weeks, he'll gain 1.75 * 5 = 8.75 pounds.

The difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options is 8.75 - 6.25 = 2.5 pounds.

"To find the total number of people attending, we need to break it down step by step.

First, Alex invites 100 people via email. Each of these people will bring 2 friends, so we multiply 100 by 2 to get 200. 

Now, we add the 200 people brought by the initial invitees to the 100 people Alex invited directly, which gives us 300 people.

Then, Alex calls 10 friends and 8 of them say they will bring their spouses. This means 8 more people will be attending. 

So, we add 8 to the 300 people we already have, which gives us 308 people.

However, we also need to include the 2 friends each of the 100 people invited via email brought, and the 10 friends Alex called, and their spouses. This is 100*2 + 10 + 8 = 228 people.

Now, we add the 228 people to the 308 people we already have, which gives us 536 people.

However, we counted the 100 people invited via email and the 10 friends Alex called twice. We need to subtract them once to avoid double counting. 

So, we subtract 100 + 10 = 110 from 536, which gives us 426.

The final answer is: 426"

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to first find out how many grams of protein he gets per day. 

Since a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein, we can find the protein percentage in a cup of mushrooms by dividing the protein by the weight: 3 grams / 100 grams = 0.03 or 3%.

Now, we know that John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day. To find out how many grams of protein he gets per day, we multiply the weight of mushrooms he eats by the protein percentage: 200 grams * 0.03 = 6 grams of protein per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7 to find the weekly protein intake: 6 grams/day * 7 days = 42 grams of protein per week.

Let Jerry's current age be 'x'. 

Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can write an equation: x = 2(x - 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get: x = 2x - 10

Subtracting 2x from both sides, we get: -x = -10

Dividing both sides by -1, we get: x = 10

So, Jerry's current age is 10 years.

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age: 10 + 3 = 13

George needs 2 implants, each costing $2000. So, the total cost for the implants is 2 * $2000 = $4000. 

One of the implants has a porcelain crown, which costs an extra $500. So, the total cost for the implants with the crown is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already put down a deposit of $600. So, the remaining amount he needs to pay is $4500 - $600 = $3900.

George makes $15 per hour at work. To find out how many hours he needs to work to pay for the remaining amount, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage: $3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let the smallest angle be x. 

Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, it will be 2x. 

And since one angle is three times the smallest angle, it will be 3x.

We know that the sum of all three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So, we can write the equation: x + 2x + 3x = 180.

Combine like terms: 6x = 180.

Now, divide both sides by 6: x = 30.

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles. One angle is 2x, which is 2 * 30 = 60 degrees. The other angle is 3x, which is 3 * 30 = 90 degrees.

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has in cents. 

First, let's convert the quarters to cents: 8 quarters * 25 cents = 200 cents
Next, let's convert the dimes to cents: 6 dimes * 10 cents = 60 cents
Then, we already know the number of nickels in cents: 14 nickels * 5 cents = 70 cents
Lastly, let's convert the pennies to cents: 15 pennies * 1 cent = 15 cents

Now, let's add up the total amount of money Colby has: 200 cents + 60 cents + 70 cents + 15 cents = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs a nickel (5 cents), we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball: 345 cents / 5 cents = 69

Colby can buy 69 gumballs."

50% of 8 pounds is 0.5 x 8 = 4 pounds.

So, the weight after increasing by 50% is 8 + 4 = 12 pounds.

Since Jamaal then uses a weight two pounds lighter than that, we need to subtract 2 pounds from 12 pounds.

12 - 2 = 10 pounds.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

In the first year, Steve gets 5 games as a birthday gift and 5 games as Christmas gift, so he gets 10 games in the first year. He also buys 1 game per month for 12 months, which is 12 games. So, in total, he gets 10 + 12 = 22 games in the first year.

In the second year, he gets 5 games as a birthday gift and 5 games as Christmas gift, so he gets 10 games in the second year. He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, which is 24 games. So, in total, he gets 10 + 24 = 34 games in the second year.

In the third year, he gets 5 games as a birthday gift and 5 games as Christmas gift, so he gets 10 games in the third year. He buys 4 games per month for 12 months, which is 48 games. So, in total, he gets 10 + 48 = 58 games in the third year.

Now, let's add up the total number of games Steve gets in 3 years: 22 + 34 + 58 = 114 games.

The total number of games Steve has after 3 years is 114."

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

Since the question asks for the additional hours it would take to travel 2000 miles, we need to subtract the initial 3 hours from the total time.

Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in 2 hours. Since Ruiz makes 60 pounds in an hour, we can multiply 60 by 2 to find out how much he makes in 2 hours, then multiply that by 3/4 to find out how much Marissa makes in an hour.

Ruiz makes 60 * 2 = 120 pounds in 2 hours. 
Marissa makes 3/4 * 120 = 90 pounds in an hour.

Now that we know how much each person makes in an hour, we can multiply their hourly production by the number of hours they worked in a day, which is 12 hours.

Ruiz makes 60 * 12 = 720 pounds in 12 hours.
Marissa makes 90 * 12 = 1080 pounds in 12 hours.

To find the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together, we add the amount made by Ruiz and Marissa.

720 + 1080 = 1800

The final answer is: 1800"
"To find out how much money Howard has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent at the arcade and subtract it from the original amount he had.

On Monday, Howard spent $8.
On Tuesday, he spent twice as much as Monday, so he spent 2 x $8 = $16.
On Wednesday, he spent 4 times as much as Tuesday, so he spent 4 x $16 = $64.

The total amount he spent is $8 + $16 + $64 = $88.

He originally had $100, so to find out how much he has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the original amount: $100 - $88 = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To find out how much money Patrick earned, we need to calculate the total number of cups he sold and multiply it by the total amount he earned per cup.

First, let's find out how many cups he sold in the first four hours. He sold 15 cups per hour for 4 hours, so he sold 15 * 4 = 60 cups.

Next, let's find out how many cups he sold in the next two hours. He sold 10 cups per hour for 2 hours, so he sold 10 * 2 = 20 cups.

Now, let's add the total number of cups he sold: 60 + 20 = 80 cups.

He sold 80 cups at a price of $0.50 per cup for the first 4 hours, so he earned 80 * 0.50 = $40 from the first 4 hours.

He sold 20 cups at a price of $0.60 per cup for the next 2 hours, so he earned 20 * 0.60 = $12 from the next 2 hours.

Now, let's add the total amount he earned: $40 + $12 = $52.

The final answer is: $52"
"To find out how many times the tires rotate in a month, we need to multiply the number of miles driven in a month by the number of rotations per mile. 

Number of rotations per mile = 725
Miles driven in a month = 400

Total rotations in a month = 725 * 400 = 290,000

Now, we need to find out how many months the tire can last. 

Total rotations allowed = 10,440,000
Total rotations in a month = 290,000

Number of months the tire can last = Total rotations allowed / Total rotations in a month
= 10,440,000 / 290,000
= 36

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can find out how many years the tire can last by dividing the number of months by 12.

Number of years the tire can last = 36 / 12
= 3

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how much each pump costs, we need to first find out how many pumps are in the jumbo bottle. Since the bottle gives 120 washings with 2 pumps, we can divide 120 by 2 to get the total number of pumps.

120 / 2 = 60 pumps

Now, we know the total number of pumps and the total cost of the shampoo. To find the cost per pump, we need to divide the total cost by the total number of pumps.

Total cost in cents = $24.00 * 100 = 2400 cents
Cost per pump = Total cost / Total number of pumps
Cost per pump = 2400 / 60
Cost per pump = 40 cents

The final answer is: 40"
"To find out how much money Joe will have left after the purchase, we need to calculate the total cost of the outfit and then subtract that from the $50 he has.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the outfit. The shirt is $25 and the shorts are $35, so the total cost is $25 + $35 = $60.

However, there's a 30% off sale. To find the discount, we multiply the total cost by 0.3 (which is the decimal form of 30%): $60 * 0.3 = $18.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final price: $60 - $18 = $42.

Since the sales tax is included, we don't need to add any additional tax to the final price.

Joe started with $50, and the outfit costs $42, so he will have $50 - $42 = $8 left after the purchase.

The final answer is: $8"
"To find out how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we need to calculate the total number of croissants he wants to make and then multiply it by the amount of butter needed per dozen.

Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week. There are 7 days in a week, so he wants to make 4 * 7 = 28 dozen croissants.

Since it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants, we need to multiply the total number of dozen croissants by 1/4 to find the total amount of butter needed.

28 dozen croissants * (1/4 pound/dozen) = 28 * 1/4 = 7 pounds

So, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make the croissants.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find out how much it costs to repave Lewis' street, we need to multiply the cost per meter by the length of his street. 

Cost per meter: $194
Length of Lewis' street: 490 meters

Cost to repave Lewis' street = Cost per meter * Length of Lewis' street
Cost to repave Lewis' street = $194 * 490
Cost to repave Lewis' street = $95,060

Now, to find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's, we need to subtract the cost of repaving Monica's street from the cost of repaving Lewis' street.

Cost to repave Monica's street = Cost per meter * Length of Monica's street
Cost to repave Monica's street = $194 * 150
Cost to repave Monica's street = $29,100

Difference in cost = Cost to repave Lewis' street - Cost to repave Monica's street
Difference in cost = $95,060 - $29,100
Difference in cost = $65,960

"To find the total cost of John's research, we need to calculate the cost for the first 5 months and the cost for the remaining 45 months.

The initial funding for the first 5 months is $100,000. 

For the remaining 45 months, the funding is 50% more than the initial funding. 50% of $100,000 is $50,000. So, the funding for the remaining 45 months is $100,000 + $50,000 = $150,000 per month.

To find the total cost for the remaining 45 months, we multiply the monthly funding by the number of months: $150,000 * 45 = $6,750,000.

Now, we add the cost for the first 5 months and the cost for the remaining 45 months: $100,000 + $6,750,000 = $6,850,000.

The total cost of John's research is $6,850,000.

"To find the total amount of meat consumed, we need to calculate the amount eaten by the first, second, and third players. 

The first player ate a 6-ounce steak. 
The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so 8 ounces of beef tips. 
The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, the third player ate 16 ounces of steak.

Now, let's add up the total amount of meat consumed: 
6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total number of posts in March, we need to first find out how many days are in March. March has 31 days.

Since each member posts an average of 3 posts per day, we multiply the number of members by the number of posts per day to get the total posts per day. 

1000 members * 3 posts/day = 3000 posts/day

Now, we multiply the total posts per day by the number of days in March to get the total number of posts in March.

3000 posts/day * 31 days = 93,000 posts

The final answer is: 93000"
"To find out how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to calculate the total amount of water used in a year and then multiply it by the cost of a gallon of water.

Gary does laundry twice a week, so in a year (52 weeks), he does laundry 2 * 52 = 104 times.

Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water, so in a year, Gary uses 104 * 20 = 2080 gallons of water.

Since a gallon of water costs $0.15, the total cost of water for laundry in a year is 2080 * $0.15 = $312.

"To find out how much Scarlett spent, we need to add up the cost of all the items she bought.

First, let's find the total cost of the rocks: 2 bags of rocks at $2.50 each is 2 x $2.50 = $5.00.

Next, let's find the total cost of the coral: 3 pieces of coral at $2.00 each is 3 x $2.00 = $6.00.

Then, we find the total cost of the fish: 20 fish at $0.50 each is 20 x $0.50 = $10.00.

Now, we add up the cost of the fish food, which is $2.00.

So, the total cost of the fish food is $2.00.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items: $5.00 (rocks) + $6.00 (coral) + $10.00 (fish) + $2.00 (fish food) = $23.00.

We also need to add the cost of the aquarium, which is $10.00.

"To find the total number of functioning street lights, we first need to find the total number of street lights. 

There are 6 poles at each intersection, and each pole has 4 street lights. So, the total number of street lights at each intersection is 6 * 4 = 24. 

Since there are 4 intersections, the total number of street lights is 24 * 4 = 96.

However, 20 street lights are not working. To find the total number of functioning street lights, we subtract the non-working lights from the total number of lights. 

Total functioning street lights = Total number of street lights - Non-working street lights
Total functioning street lights = 96 - 20
Total functioning street lights = 76

"To find out how many pieces of gum Jim chews at school, we need to calculate how many 2-hour periods are in an 8-hour school day. 

8 hours / 2 hours = 4 periods

Since Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours, he chews 4 pieces of gum at school.

He also chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner, so that's 2 more pieces.

In total, Jim chews 4 + 2 = 6 pieces of gum.

Jim started with 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

When his sister asks for gum, he gives her half of the remaining gum. Half of 14 is 14 / 2 = 7.

So, Jim gives his sister 7 pieces of gum. 

Now, Jim has 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum left.

The baseball coach bought 9 baseballs for $3 each, so the total amount spent by the baseball coach is 9 x $3 = $27.

The basketball coach bought 8 basketballs for $14 each, so the total amount spent by the basketball coach is 8 x $14 = $112.

Now, we subtract the baseball coach's total from the basketball coach's total: $112 - $27 = $85.

The basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach."
"To find out how many flowers have bloomed, we need to first find the total number of flowers in the garden. Since there are 10 rows with 20 flowers in each row, we multiply the number of rows by the number of flowers in each row.

Total flowers = 10 rows * 20 flowers/row = 200 flowers

Now, we know that only 4/5 of the flowers have bloomed. To find out how many flowers have bloomed, we multiply the total number of flowers by 4/5.

Number of bloomed flowers = Total flowers * (4/5)
= 200 * (4/5)

"To find out how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to subtract his current height from the required height and then divide by his growth rate.

The required height is 4 feet, which is equal to 48 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches). 

Adam's current height is 40 inches. 

So, the difference between the required height and Adam's current height is 48 - 40 = 8 inches.

Adam grows 2 inches a year. 

To find out how many years it will take for Adam to grow 8 inches, we divide 8 by 2.

"To find out how much James made, we need to calculate the profit from selling the cars and then find 10% of that profit.

First, let's find the total cost of the cars. Since James sold 10 cars that cost $25,000 each, the total cost is 10 x $25,000 = $250,000.

The company paid 30% of the price to acquire the cars, so the amount they paid is 30% of $250,000, which is 0.3 x $250,000 = $75,000.

The profit is the selling price minus the cost, which is $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.

James got a 10% commission on the profit, so his commission is 10% of $175,000, which is 0.1 x $175,000 = $17,500.

Therefore, James made $17,500. 

$17,500"
"To find the number of men who can stay upright, we first need to find the total number of riders who can stay upright. 

Since 25% of the riders can stay upright, and there are 100 riders, we can find the total number of riders who can stay upright by multiplying 100 by 0.25. 

100 * 0.25 = 25

Now, we know that 60% of these 25 riders are women. To find the number of women, we multiply 25 by 0.6.

25 * 0.6 = 15

Since the remaining riders are men, we can find the number of men by subtracting the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright.

25 - 15 = 10

"To find the total price for all three jewels, we need to find the price of the gold and silver jewels first.

The price of a diamond jewel is $2000. 
The price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of a diamond jewel. 
So, the price of a gold jewel = (4/5) * 2000 = 1600.

The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold. 
So, the price of a silver jewel = 1600 - 400 = 1200.

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels.
Total price = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800.

The final answer is: $4800"

"To find out how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to find the time it takes for the distance between them to decrease to 0.

First, we need to find the relative speed between Tom and Bob. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract their speeds: 70 mph (Tom's speed) - 55 mph (Bob's speed) = 15 mph.

Now, we know that the initial distance between them is 75 miles. We can use the formula: time = distance / speed. In this case, the distance is 75 miles and the speed is 15 mph.

time = 75 miles / 15 mph
time = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"To find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to find out the maximum number of classes he can attend without exceeding $10 per class.

The total cost of the classes is $60. If there are 10 classes, the cost per class would be $60 / 10 = $6 per class. 

Since Manny's parents won't sign him up again if the cost per class exceeds $10, we need to find the maximum number of classes he can attend without exceeding $10 per class.

Let's say Manny misses x classes. The number of classes he attends would be 10 - x.

The total cost of the classes he attends would be (10 - x) * $10.

The total cost of the classes is $60, so we can set up the equation:

(10 - x) * $10 = $60

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by $10:

10 - x = $60 / $10
10 - x = 6

Now, we can solve for x by subtracting 10 from both sides:

-x = 6 - 10
-x = -4

Multiplying both sides by -1:

x = 4

So, Manny can miss 4 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total weekly production, we first need to find out how many customers each of them can process in a week. 

Jewel processes 50 customers per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, Jewel's weekly production is 50 * 7 = 350 customers.

Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, Julie processes 2 * 50 = 100 customers per day. So, Julie's weekly production is 100 * 7 = 700 customers.

The total weekly production for both Jewel and Julie is 350 + 700 = 1050 customers.

The cost of 3 oranges is $3.30, so the cost of one orange is $3.30 / 3 = $1.10.

Now, we can find the total cost of 5 apples: 5 apples * $1.30/apple = $6.50.

Next, we can find the total cost of 5 oranges: 5 oranges * $1.10/orange = $5.50.

Finally, we can add the cost of the apples and the cost of the oranges to find the total amount Clyde will pay: $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add them to the base price.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade costs $7,500.

The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of the leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of the running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the features and the base price:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

"To find out how much Tim will make in a year, we need to calculate his new monthly salary and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's calculate the 5% raise on his $20,000 a month salary. 
5% of $20,000 is 0.05 x $20,000 = $1,000. 
So, his new monthly salary will be $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000.

Next, let's calculate the bonus, which is half a month's salary. 
Half of $21,000 is $10,500.

Now, let's add the bonus to his new monthly salary. 
$21,000 + $10,500 = $31,500.

Finally, let's multiply his new monthly salary by 12 to find out how much he will make in a year.

The cost of the dress shirts is 10 suits * 3 shirts per suit * $60 per shirt = 30 shirts * $60 = $1800.

Now, we add up the costs: $7500 + $1500 + $1800 = $10800.

The final answer is: $10800"
"To find the total number of articles published in February, we need to calculate the total number of articles published by both websites in a day and then multiply it by the number of days in February.

The news website publishes 20 political and weather news articles every day, and its sister company publishes 10 business news articles daily. 

So, the total number of articles published by both websites in a day is 20 + 10 = 30.

Since there are 28 days in February, the total number of articles published in February is 30 * 28 = 840.

The final answer is: 840"

"To find the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions, we need to first find the total amount of flour in one bag and then multiply it by 3.

Since the bag is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, the total amount of flour in one bag is 8 * 2 = 16 kilograms.

Now, we multiply the amount of flour in one bag by 3 to find the total amount of flour in three bags: 16 * 3 = 48 kilograms.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the total miles biked by Alisa and Stanley, we need to calculate the distance each of them biked and then add them together.

Alisa biked at 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours. To find the distance she biked, we multiply her speed by the time: 
12 miles/hour * 4.5 hours = 54 miles

Stanley biked at 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours. To find the distance he biked, we multiply his speed by the time: 
10 miles/hour * 2.5 hours = 25 miles

Now, we add the distances biked by Alisa and Stanley to find the total miles biked:
54 miles + 25 miles = 79 miles

The final answer is: 79"
"To find the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay, then add those times together.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil. Bill can dig 4 feet/hour through soil, and he needs to dig 24 feet of soil. 

Time to dig through soil = Total soil depth / Rate of digging through soil
Time to dig through soil = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour
Time to dig through soil = 6 hours

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the clay. Bill can dig half as fast through clay as he can through soil, so his rate of digging through clay is 4 / 2 = 2 feet/hour. He needs to dig 8 feet of clay.

Time to dig through clay = Total clay depth / Rate of digging through clay
Time to dig through clay = 8 feet / 2 feet/hour
Time to dig through clay = 4 hours

Now, we add the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay to get the total time.

Total time = Time to dig through soil + Time to dig through clay
Total time = 6 hours + 4 hours
Total time = 10 hours

"To find out how many cupcakes Howie should buy, we need to calculate the total number of people in his class, including himself, his teacher, and his classmates. 

There are 25 classmates and 1 teacher, so the total number of people is 25 + 1 = 26. 

Since Howie also wants to get cupcakes for himself, we add 1 more to the total number of people. So, the total number of people is 26 + 1 = 27.

Howie wants to get 2 cupcakes for each person, so we multiply the total number of people by 2. 

27 * 2 = 54

Howie should buy 54 cupcakes.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, Fishio received 2000 likes on her selfie.

Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times as many as the initial number of likes. 
So, the number of likes after 3 weeks = 70 * 2000 = 140000.

Now, she received 20000 more new likes recently. 
So, the total number of likes now = 140000 + 20000 = 160000.

The final answer is: 160000"
"To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost of the pomegranates on each day and then subtract the two costs.

On the first day, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. She got a $2 discount, so the total cost is:
20 pomegranates * $20 = $400
$400 - $2 = $398

On the second day, the price of each pomegranate is $30, and there's a 10% discount on the total cost. The total cost is:
20 pomegranates * $30 = $600
10% of $600 is 0.1 * $600 = $60
$600 - $60 = $540

Now, let's find the difference between the two costs:
$540 - $398 = $142

The final answer is: $142"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

In the first month, Ariadne's sales from red hats were $400, and this is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. So, the total sales from green hats in the first month would be 2 times the sales from red hats, which is 2 * $400 = $800.

The total sales in the first month would be the sum of sales from red and green hats, which is $400 + $800 = $1200.

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. So, the sales in the second month would be (3/4) * $1200 = $900.

The total amount she made in two months would be the sum of sales in the first and second months, which is $1200 + $900 = $2100.

The final answer is: $2100"
"To find out how much James paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the hours he used the carriage. 

First, we need to find out how many hours he used the carriage. He hired it from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is 4 hours. However, he got 1 hour free, so he actually used it for 4 - 1 = 3 hours.

The first hour costs $15. Each hour after that costs twice the cost, which is 2 * $15 = $30.

So, the total cost for the first hour is $15, and the total cost for the remaining 2 hours is 2 * $30 = $60.

The total cost is $15 + $60 = $75.

The final answer is: $75"
"To find out how much was withheld from Sally's wage, we need to find out how much she should have in her account if she received her full wage. 

Her weekly wage is $300, and she started with $200. So, if she received her full wage, her account should be $200 + $300 = $500.

However, her account now holds $420. To find out how much was withheld, we need to subtract the current amount from the amount she should have. 

$500 - $420 = $80.

So, $80 was withheld from Sally's wage.

The final answer is: $80"
"To find out how many deviled egg halves Lori's guests will eat, we multiply the number of guests by the number of deviled egg halves each guest will eat. 

16 guests * 3 deviled egg halves per guest = 48 deviled egg halves

Since Lori needs 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves, we need to find out how many eggs are needed for 48 deviled egg halves. 

48 deviled egg halves / 2 deviled egg halves per egg = 24 eggs

To find out how many dozens of eggs Lori needs, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 (since 1 dozen = 12).

24 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 2 dozens

"To find out how many days it will take Mike to finish reading the book, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he plans to read each day.

Total number of pages = 200
Pages read per day = 10

Number of days to finish reading = Total number of pages / Pages read per day
= 200 / 10
= 20

Since Mike has 30 days to complete the assignment, we need to subtract the number of days it will take him to finish reading from the total number of days.

Days before the deadline = Total number of days - Number of days to finish reading

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the plane, the cost of renting the hanger, and the cost of fuel for the first year.

The cost of the plane is $150,000.

The cost of renting the hanger is $5000 per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total cost of renting the hanger for the first year is $5000 * 12 = $60,000.

The cost of fuel is twice as much as the cost of renting the hanger, which is $5000 * 2 = $10,000 per month. The total cost of fuel for the first year is $10,000 * 12 = $120,000.

Now, let's add up the costs: $150,000 (plane) + $60,000 (hanger) + $120,000 (fuel) = $230,000.

The final answer is: $230,000"
"Let's break down the information given. 

First, we know it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice. Since it took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, it took her 30 + 20 = 50 minutes to cook pork.

We are also told that beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. Half of 80 minutes is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

Now, we have the cooking times for all three foods: rice (30 minutes), pork (50 minutes), and beans (40 minutes). To find the total cooking time, we add these times together: 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes.

"Let's break down the information given. We know that sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs. Let's use the variable 's' to represent the number of sheep and 'g' to represent the number of geese.

We are given two pieces of information: 
1. The total number of animal legs is 70.
2. The total number of animal heads is 20.

From the first piece of information, we can write the equation: 4s + 2g = 70.

From the second piece of information, we can write the equation: s + g = 20.

We can solve the second equation for 's': s = 20 - g.

Now, we can substitute this expression for 's' into the first equation: 4(20 - g) + 2g = 70.

Expanding the equation, we get: 80 - 4g + 2g = 70.

Combine like terms: -2g = -10.

Divide both sides by -2: g = 5.

Now that we know the number of geese, we can find the number of sheep by substituting g into the equation s = 20 - g: s = 20 - 5.

s = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee and the cost of the donut. 

First, let's find the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more. 

20% of $5 is 0.2 x $5 = $1. 
So, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

Since Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day and he buys a week's worth, he buys 7 pounds of coffee. 

The cost of the more expensive coffee is 7 x $6 = $42. 
The cost of the donut is $2.

The total cost is $42 + $2 = $44.

"Let's break it down step by step. 

Let's say Sally has x number of books. 

Since Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has, we can write an equation for Janey's books as 2x + 3.

We are given that Janey has 21 books. So, we can set up the equation 2x + 3 = 21.

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. We can do this by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 21 - 3.

This simplifies to 2x = 18.

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for x: x = 18 / 2.

x = 9.

So, Sally has 9 books.

"To find out how many cookies are in the box, we need to know how many cookies Greta and Celinda baked in total, and then subtract the number of cookies they ate.

Greta bakes 30 cookies. Celinda bakes twice as many, so she bakes 2 x 30 = 60 cookies. 

In total, they baked 30 + 60 = 90 cookies.

They ate 10 cookies, so the number of cookies left is 90 - 10 = 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let's say the age of the triplet is x. Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, the other twin's age would be x + 7. 

We have two sets of siblings, so the total number of people is 3 (triplets) + 2 (twins) = 5. 

The combined ages of all the siblings are 44. So, we can write the equation: x + (x + 7) + x = 44.

Combine like terms: 3x + 7 = 44.

Subtract 7 from both sides: 3x = 37.

Divide both sides by 3: x = 12.33 (round down to 12 since age can't be a fraction).

Now that we know the age of the triplet is 12, we can find the age of the twin who is 7 years older: 12 + 7 = 19.

The final answer is: 19"
"To find out how many minutes John has to nap, we need to first calculate the total time he spends on his homework. 

John has 20 minutes of math homework, 40 minutes of reading homework, and 20 minutes of history homework. 

Total homework time = 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes

John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we need to convert 3 hours to minutes.

3 hours = 3 x 60 = 180 minutes

Now, we subtract the total homework time from the total time before dinner to find out how many minutes John has to nap.

Time to nap = Total time before dinner - Total homework time
Time to nap = 180 - 80
Time to nap = 100 minutes

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we first need to find the cost of one candy. 

We know that Manolo bought 5 lollipops and 4 candies for $3.20. The cost of 5 lollipops is 5 x $0.40 = $2. 

Now, we subtract the cost of 5 lollipops from the total cost to find the cost of 4 candies. $3.20 - $2 = $1.20. 

The cost of one candy is $1.20 / 4 = $0.30. 

Now, we can find the cost of 10 lollipops, which is 10 x $0.40 = $4. 

The cost of 10 candies is 10 x $0.30 = $3. 

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $4 + $3 = $7. 

The final answer is: $7"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Rong saves 20 coins every month. 

Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, so we need to find 2/5 of 20. 
2/5 of 20 is (2 * 20) / 5 = 40 / 5 = 8. 
So, Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins every month.

Now, let's find out how many months are in 10 years. 
There are 12 months in a year, so there are 10 * 12 = 120 months in 10 years.

Rong saves 20 coins every month, so in 120 months, he will save 20 * 120 = 2400 coins.

Neil saves 28 coins every month, so in 120 months, he will save 28 * 120 = 3360 coins.

The total number of coins they have after 10 years is 2400 + 3360 = 5760.

The final answer is: 5760"
"To find the total bill, we need to calculate the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check. 

The cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40. 

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's call the total bill 'x'. Then, 60% of x is 0.6x. Since the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, we can say that the heartworm check is 0.6x and the vaccines are $40. 

The total bill is the sum of the heartworm check and the vaccines, so we can write the equation: 0.6x + 40 = x. 

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. We can do this by subtracting 0.6x from both sides of the equation: 40 = 0.4x. 

Now, we can divide both sides by 0.4 to find x: x = 40 / 0.4 = 100. 

So, the total bill is $100. 

Since John brought $125 with him, he will leave with $125 - $100 = $25. 

The final answer is: $25"
"To find the price of the crate, we need to find the total cost of all the fruits in it. 

First, let's find the cost of one banana. Since one banana costs twice as much as an apple, and one apple costs $0.5, one banana costs 2 * $0.5 = $1.

Now, let's find the cost of one orange. Since one orange costs three times as much as a banana, and one banana costs $1, one orange costs 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, let's find the total cost of the fruits in one crate. 
- The cost of 5 bananas is 5 * $1 = $5.
- The cost of 12 apples is 12 * $0.5 = $6.
- The cost of 7 oranges is 7 * $3 = $21.

The total cost of the fruits in one crate is $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

The price for such a crate of fruit is $32."
"To find the total number of square feet in Brittany's comforter, we need to find the total number of squares and multiply it by the area of each square.

We know that there are 14 red squares. 
There are 4 more blue squares than red squares, so there are 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.
There are 6 more green squares than blue squares, so there are 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.
There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so there are 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.

Now, we add up the total number of squares: 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68 squares.

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the area of each square is 1 square foot. 
So, the total area of the comforter is 68 * 1 = 68 square feet.

The final answer is: 68"
"To find out how many chairs Mia needs, we first need to find out how many regular chairs she has. Since there are 8 high chairs and the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, we multiply 8 by 5 to get the number of regular chairs.

8 * 5 = 40

Now, we know there are 42 adults and 15 babies attending. Since babies also need chairs, we add the number of adults and babies to get the total number of people who need chairs.

42 + 15 = 57

Since there are 8 high chairs, we need to subtract the number of high chairs from the total number of people to find out how many regular chairs are needed.

57 - 8 = 49

Now, we know there are 40 regular chairs, but we need 49. To find out how many more chairs Mia needs, we subtract the number of regular chairs she has from the number of regular chairs needed.

49 - 40 = 9

So, Mia needs 9 more chairs."
"To find the number of 8-point bucks, we need to first find the total number of bucks. 

50 percent of the deer are bucks, so the number of bucks is 50% of 50, which is 0.5 x 50 = 25 bucks.

Next, we need to find 20 percent of the bucks that are 8 points. 20 percent of 25 is 0.2 x 25 = 5.

So, there are 5 8-point bucks.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Adam has 50 points.
- Betty collected 30% more than Adam, so Betty has 50 + (30% of 50) = 50 + 15 = 65 points.
- Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.
- Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom, so Marta has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up the points of all the students: 50 (Adam) + 65 (Betty) + 35 (Tom) + 105 (Marta) = 255 points.

Since the minimum threshold is 400 points, the class is missing 400 - 255 = 145 points to go on the trip.

"To find the total amount spent on snacks and drinks, we need to first find the total number of people, then the total number of drinks and snacks.

Aiden and his 12 friends are going, and they meet up with 7 more friends, so the total number of people is 1 (Aiden) + 12 (his friends) + 7 (new friends) = 20.

Each seat can hold 1 person, 2 drinks, and 3 snacks. Since there are 20 people, there are 20 seats. 

So, the total number of drinks is 20 seats * 2 drinks/seat = 40 drinks.
The total number of snacks is 20 seats * 3 snacks/seat = 60 snacks.

The cost of each drink is $2, and the cost of each snack is $2. 

The total cost of drinks is 40 drinks * $2/drinks = $80.
The total cost of snacks is 60 snacks * $2/snack = $120.

The total amount spent on snacks and drinks is $80 (drinks) + $120 (snacks) = $200.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel. 
Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so Gordy's truck can haul 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds of gravel. 
The combined capacity of Gissela and Gordy's trucks is 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds of gravel. 
When Gary joins them, the total capacity becomes 11,600 pounds of gravel. 
To find out how much Gary's truck can carry, we need to subtract the combined capacity of Gissela and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity of all three trucks. 
Gary's truck capacity = Total capacity - Combined capacity of Gissela and Gordy's trucks 
Gary's truck capacity = 11,600 - 8,800 
Gary's truck capacity = 2,800 pounds of gravel.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we know there are 8 males and 6 females. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, let's assume each female ate x dumplings. Then each male ate x + 1 dumplings.

We know each female ate 3 dumplings, so x = 3. 

Now, we can find out how many dumplings each male ate. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

Now, we can find the total number of dumplings eaten by males and females. The total number of males is 8, and each male ate 4 dumplings, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32.

The total number of females is 6, and each female ate 3 dumplings, so the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.

Now, we can find the total number of dumplings eaten by both males and females. The total number of dumplings eaten is 32 + 18 = 50.

Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is equal to the total number of dumplings eaten. Therefore, Larry cooked 50 dumplings.

"To find out how much money Gerald had left, we first need to find out how much money he initially got from the $100. 

The ratio of the money Gerald and Julia got is 3:2. This means that for every 3 parts Gerald got, Julia got 2 parts. The total parts are 3 + 2 = 5 parts.

Since Gerald got 3 parts, we can find out how much 1 part is by dividing $100 by 5. 

$100 / 5 = $20 per part

Gerald got 3 parts, so he got 3 x $20 = $60.

Gerald spent $10 on a book, so to find out how much he had left, we subtract $10 from $60.

$60 - $10 = $50

The city uses 40% of the river's water. 

80% of that 40% is used for industrial purposes, so we need to find 20% of 40% (since 100% - 80% = 20%). 

20% of 40% is 0.2 x 0.4 = 0.08 or 8%.

So, the city uses 8% of the river's total water for industrial purposes. 

To find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes, we subtract 8% from 40%: 40% - 8% = 32%.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 5 people in total, including Bryce, and 2 of them ate 2/3 of their pizzas, that means 3 people ate 2/3 of their pizzas. 

Since each pizza has 12 slices, 3 people eating 2/3 of their pizzas means they ate 3 * (2/3) * 12 = 24 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 friends, they ate 2 * (3/4) * 12 = 18 slices.

In total, 24 + 18 = 42 slices were eaten. 

Since there were 5 people and each person ordered one pizza, there were 5 pizzas in total. Each pizza has 12 slices, so there were 5 * 12 = 60 slices in total.

To find out how many slices were left, we subtract the number of slices eaten from the total number of slices: 60 - 42 = 18.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages, we need to multiply the time it takes for the cat by 2/3. 

Time taken by cat = 30 minutes
Time taken by dog = (2/3) * 30 minutes = 20 minutes

Now, we need to find the average time taken by both the cat and the dog. 

Average time = (Time taken by cat + Time taken by dog) / 2
Average time = (30 + 20) / 2
Average time = 50 / 2
Average time = 25 minutes

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to first convert the length of Topher's shoe into inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 8 feet into inches by multiplying 8 by 12, which equals 96 inches. Adding the 4 inches, we get 100 inches for the length of one of Topher's shoes.

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's represent the length of one of Bobby's shoes as 'x'. We can write the equation as:

100 = 9x + 10

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x' on one side of the equation. Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us:

90 = 9x

Now, we divide both sides by 9 to find the value of 'x':

x = 90 / 9
x = 10

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches. 

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many windows Hannah smashes, we need to calculate the total number of windows she smashes from students' cars and teachers' cars separately and then add them together.

First, let's find out how many windows she smashes from students' cars. There are 64 students' cars with 4 windows each. A quarter of the students' cars' windows are smashed, which is 1/4 * 64 = 16 cars. Since each car has 4 windows, the total number of windows smashed from students' cars is 16 * 4 = 64.

Next, let's find out how many windows she smashes from teachers' cars. There are 32 teachers' cars with 2 windows each. Three-fourths of the teachers' cars' windows are smashed, which is 3/4 * 32 = 24 cars. Since each car has 2 windows, the total number of windows smashed from teachers' cars is 24 * 2 = 48.

Now, let's add the total number of windows smashed from students' cars and teachers' cars. 64 + 48 = 112.

The final answer is: 112"
"To find the total number of blue spools, we need to add the number of light blue and dark blue spools. 

Total blue spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60

Next, we need to find the total number of spools. 

Total spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 150

Now, we can find the percentage of blue spools by dividing the total number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of blue spools = (60 / 150) * 100 = 40%

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we need to first find out how many people voted by 16:00 and then subtract that from the total number of people.

By midday, 2/5 of 5000 people had voted. 

2/5 * 5000 = 2000 people voted by midday.

So, the remaining people are 5000 - 2000 = 3000.

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. 

2/3 * 3000 = 2000 people voted by 16:00.

The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 3000 - 2000 = 1000.

The final answer is: 1000"
"To find out how many packs of gum Parker will need, we need to calculate how many pieces of gum he will need for 30 days and then divide that by the number of pieces in a pack.

Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day. For 30 days, he will need 4 * 30 = 120 pieces of gum.

A pack of gum has 15 pieces. To find out how many packs Parker will need, we divide the total number of pieces he needs (120) by the number of pieces in a pack (15).

120 / 15 = 8

So, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how many boxes of graham crackers they need, we first need to calculate the total number of smores needed. 

9 kids want 2 smores each, so the total number of smores for kids is 9 * 2 = 18. 
6 adults will eat 1 s'more each, so the total number of smores for adults is 6 * 1 = 6. 
The total number of smores needed is 18 + 6 = 24.

Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes 8 smores, we need to divide the total number of smores needed by 8 to find out how many sleeves are needed. 
24 / 8 = 3.

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we need to divide the number of sleeves needed by 3 to find out how many boxes are needed. 
3 / 3 = 1.

"To find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to find their individual ages first.

Dora's age is given as 15 years.

Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. 
So, father's age = 2 * Dora's age + 8 
= 2 * 15 + 8 
= 30 + 8 
= 38 years.

Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. 
So, mother's age = father's age - 4 
= 38 - 4 
= 34 years.

Now, we can find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother.
Total combined age = Dora's age + father's age + mother's age 
= 15 + 38 + 34 
= 87 years.

"To find out how many votes candidate C got, we first need to find out how many votes candidate B got. 

Candidate A got 20% of the votes, which is 20% of 100 voters. 
20% of 100 is 0.2 x 100 = 20 votes.

Candidate B got 50% more than candidate A's votes. 
50% of 20 votes is 0.5 x 20 = 10 votes. 
So, candidate B got 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

Since there are 100 voters in total, and candidate A and B got 20 and 30 votes respectively, candidate C got 100 - (20 + 30) = 50 votes.

Cost of a gallon jar = $5
Cost of a half-gallon jar = Cost of a gallon jar - $2
Cost of a half-gallon jar = $5 - $2
Cost of a half-gallon jar = $3

Now, let's calculate the total cost of 10-gallon jars:
Cost of 10-gallon jars = 10 * Cost of a gallon jar
Cost of 10-gallon jars = 10 * $5
Cost of 10-gallon jars = $50

"Let's break this down step by step. 

First, we know that there are 80 students in total and that each class has the same number of students. Let's call the number of students in each class ""x"". Since there are two classes, the total number of students is 2x. We know that 2x = 80.

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2. 

2x / 2 = 80 / 2
x = 40

So, each class has 40 students.

Next, we know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. To find the number of girls in each class, we can multiply the total number of students in each class by 0.4 (which is the decimal form of 40%).

Number of girls in each class = 40 * 0.4
= 16

Since the total number of students in each class is 40, and there are 16 girls, the number of boys in each class can be found by subtracting the number of girls from the total number of students.

Number of boys in each class = 40 - 16
= 24

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Step 1: Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 

90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 x 30 = 27 small stickers. Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons from trading her small stickers.

Step 2: Now, Lorraine has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left. 

Step 3: She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 x 40 = 20 large stickers. Since each large sticker is worth a large button, she gets 20 large buttons from trading her large stickers.

Step 4: Now, Lorraine has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left. 

Step 5: She trades the rest of her large stickers (20) for small buttons. Since each large sticker is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 x 3 = 60 small stickers. But we know that each small sticker is worth one small button, so she gets 60 small buttons from trading her large stickers.

Step 6: Now, Lorraine has 3 small stickers and 20 large stickers left. We already know that each large sticker is worth three small stickers, so she can trade her 20 large stickers for 20 x 3 = 60 small stickers. But we already know she has 3 small stickers, so she gets 60 - 3 = 57 small buttons from trading her large stickers.

Step 7: Now, Lorraine has 57 small buttons and 27 small buttons from step 1, and 20 large buttons from step 3. So, she has a total of 57 + 27 + 20 = 104 buttons.

"To find out how many puppies Jana has, we need to figure out how many Pomeranians there are first. We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. 

Let's use the equation: (1/3) * Pomeranians = 6, where Pomeranians is the total number of Pomeranians. 

To find Pomeranians, we can multiply both sides by 3 to isolate Pomeranians. This gives us Pomeranians = 6 * 3 = 18.

Now that we know there are 18 Pomeranians, we can find out how many puppies Jana has. We know that two thirds of the puppies are Pomeranians, so we can use the equation: (2/3) * Total Puppies = 18.

To find Total Puppies, we can multiply both sides by 3/2 to isolate Total Puppies. This gives us Total Puppies = 18 * (3/2) = 27.

"Let's break down the information given. 

Let's say the second house needs x cases of shingles. Since the first house needs 1/2 of the second, the first house will need x/2 cases of shingles. 

The third house needs double the first house, so it will need 2 * (x/2) = x cases of shingles.

We know that the total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. So, we can write the equation: x + x/2 + x = 250.

To solve for x, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 2x + x + 2x = 500.

Combine like terms: 5x = 500.

Now, divide both sides by 5: x = 100.

Since the third house needs x cases of shingles, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

"To find out how many pears George has, we need to calculate 45% of 200 bananas and add it to the number of bananas. 

45% of 200 is 0.45 * 200 = 90. 

So, George has 90 more pears than bananas. Since he has 200 bananas, he has 200 + 90 = 290 pears.

Now, to find the total number of fruits George has, we need to add the number of bananas and pears. 

Total fruits = 200 (bananas) + 290 (pears) = 490.

The final answer is: 490"
"To find out how many candy bars Marissa bought for Jimmy, we need to subtract the cost of the ball from the money she had. 

Marissa had $80 and spent $20 on the ball. 

$80 (initial money) - $20 (cost of the ball) = $60

Now, we need to find out how many candy bars she can buy with $60. Each candy bar costs $5.

$60 (remaining money) ÷ $5 (cost of each candy bar) = 12

So, Marissa bought 12 candy bars for Jimmy.

12"
"To find out how much money Sam needs to spend, we first need to find out how many kilograms of oranges he needs to make 4 liters of juice. Since Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges to make 1 liter of juice, he would need 5 * 4 = 20 kilograms of oranges to make 4 liters of juice.

Now, we need to find out the cost of 20 kilograms of oranges. Each kilogram of oranges costs $3, so 20 kilograms would cost 20 * 3 = $60.

The final answer is: $60"
"To find out how many books Ahmed read, we need to divide the number of books Ezra read by 2. 

Ezra read 300 books, so Ahmed read 300 / 2 = 150 books.

Now, we need to add the number of books Ezra decided to read to the number of books he already read. 

Ezra read 300 books and decided to read 150 more, so he will read 300 + 150 = 450 books in total.

Now, we need to add the number of books Ahmed read to the number of books Ezra will read. 

Ahmed read 150 books and Ezra will read 450 books, so altogether they will read 150 + 450 = 600 books.

The final answer is: 600"
"To find out how much Tanya earned, we need to calculate her earnings for each day separately and then add them together.

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Since she earns $15 per hour, her total earnings for the hours she worked is 5 hours * $15 per hour = $75. 

Additionally, she earns $5 per day if she teaches more than 3 classes. Since she taught 4 classes, she earns the extra $5. So, her total earnings for Monday is $75 + $5 = $80.

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Her earnings for the hours she worked is 2 hours * $15 per hour = $30.

Since she taught less than 3 classes on Wednesday, she doesn't earn the extra $5. So, her total earnings for Wednesday is $30.

Now, we add her earnings for Monday and Wednesday to find the total earnings: $80 + $30 = $110.

The final answer is: $110"
"To find out how many more vanilla scents sold compared to the fruity scents, we need to first find the total number of vanilla scents sold and the total number of fruity scents sold.

The company sold 5 of each of the 4 vanilla scents, so the total number of vanilla scents sold is 5 x 4 = 20.

The company sold 2 of each of the 8 fruity scents, so the total number of fruity scents sold is 2 x 8 = 16.

Now, we need to find the difference between the total number of vanilla scents sold and the total number of fruity scents sold. 

20 (vanilla scents sold) - 16 (fruity scents sold) = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for, we need to first calculate how much money he makes from selling the eggplants. 

He sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total amount of money he makes from selling the eggplants is 20 x 3 = $60.

Now, we know that Bennet wants to make a total of $135. Since he already made $60 from selling the eggplants, he needs to make $135 - $60 = $75 from selling the corn.

He has 25 ears of corn, so to find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we need to divide the total amount of money he needs to make from the corn ($75) by the number of ears of corn (25).

$75 ÷ 25 = $3

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To find out how much time Tatiana spends playing soccer, we first need to find out how much time she has left after reading and playing video games. 

Tatiana has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, so she has a total of 7 + 5 = 12 hours for the weekend.

She reads for 3 hours, so she has 12 - 3 = 9 hours left.

She plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time, which is 1/3 * 9 = 3 hours.

So, she has 9 - 3 = 6 hours left for soccer.

To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we divide the time spent playing soccer by the total time and multiply by 100.

(6 / 12) * 100 = 50%

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how many pencils Anthony kept, we need to follow the steps of the problem.

Anthony started with 50 pencils. He gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon. 

1/2 of 50 is 50 / 2 = 25. So, Anthony gave 25 pencils to Brandon.

Now, Anthony has 50 - 25 = 25 pencils left.

He then gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. 

3/5 of 25 is 25 * (3/5) = 15. So, Anthony gave 15 pencils to Charlie.

Now, Anthony has 25 - 15 = 10 pencils left.

Anthony kept the remaining pencils, which is 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how long Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the total time he spends driving and the time he spends at the museum.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Jack to drive to the museum. 

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 150 miles / 75 mph
Time = 2 hours

Since he drives to the museum and back, we need to multiply the time by 2.
Total driving time = 2 hours * 2 = 4 hours

Now, we add the time he spends at the museum to the total driving time.
Total time = Total driving time + Time at the museum
Total time = 4 hours + 6 hours
Total time = 10 hours

So, Jack is gone from home for 10 hours. 

10"
"To find out how many wheels Henry will need, we need to calculate the total number of wheels required for the cars and the motorcycles. 

For the cars, he needs 4 wheels for each car, and he has 57 cars. So, the total number of wheels needed for the cars is 57 * 4 = 228.

For the motorcycles, he needs 2 wheels for each motorcycle, and he has 73 motorcycles. So, the total number of wheels needed for the motorcycles is 73 * 2 = 146.

Now, we add the total number of wheels needed for the cars and the motorcycles: 228 + 146 = 374.

Since Henry has a box with 650 wheels, we subtract the total number of wheels needed from the total number of wheels he has: 650 - 374 = 276.

The final answer is: 276"
"To find the discount amount, we need to calculate 20% of the original price. 

20% of $1000 is calculated as 0.20 x $1000 = $200.

$1000 - $200 = $800.

So, you have to pay $800. 

The final answer is: $800."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the movies in series, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the normal movies.

First, let's find the number of movies in series. A third of the movies are in series, so we multiply 600 by 1/3.

600 * (1/3) = 200 movies in series

Since the movies in series cost $6 each, but Mike can buy them together for a lower price, we need to find the total cost of the series. However, we don't know the cost of the series yet. Let's call it 'x'. We know that the cost of the series is 1/6 of the cost of a normal movie, since it's $6 for the series and $10 for a normal movie.

x = (1/6) * 10
x = 10/6
x = 5/3

Now we know the cost of the series is $5/3 per movie. We multiply this by the number of movies in series to find the total cost of the series.

200 * (5/3) = 1000/3
1000/3 = 333.33

Now, let's find the number of older movies. 40% of the remaining movies are older movies. First, we need to find the number of remaining movies. We subtract the movies in series from the total number of movies.

600 - 200 = 400

40% of 400 is 0.4 * 400 = 160 older movies.

Since the older movies cost $5 each, we multiply the number of older movies by the cost.

160 * 5 = 800

Now, let's find the number of normal movies. We subtract the movies in series and the older movies from the total number of movies.

600 - 200 - 160 = 240 normal movies

Since the normal movies cost $10 each, we multiply the number of normal movies by the cost.

240 * 10 = 2400

Now, we add the cost of the series, the older movies, and the normal movies to find the total cost.

Total cost = 333.33 + 800 + 2400
Total cost = 3533.33

The final answer is: $3533.33"
"To find out how much Winston spent on fruit, we need to calculate the total cost of each type of fruit and then add them together.

The final answer is: $38.00"
"To find the distance to their vacation spot, we need to find the total distance they traveled by driving and hiking. 

First, let's find the speed at which they hiked. They hiked 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Their driving speed is 50 miles per hour. Half of 50 is 25, and 5 miles per hour less than that is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

Now, let's find the distance they traveled by driving. They drove for 6 hours at 50 miles per hour. Distance = speed * time, so the distance they traveled by driving is 50 * 6 = 300 miles.

Next, let's find the distance they traveled by hiking. They hiked for 1.5 hours at 20 miles per hour. Distance = speed * time, so the distance they traveled by hiking is 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

Now, let's add the distance they traveled by driving and hiking to find the total distance to their vacation spot. Total distance = 300 + 30 = 330 miles.

The final answer is: 330"
"To find the difference in their scores, we need to calculate the points each of them gets from enemies, berries, and the timer.

Let's say Emma jumps on x enemies and collects y berries. Then Ava jumps on x + 8 enemies and collects y + 3 berries.

The points from enemies for Emma would be 10x and for Ava would be 10(x + 8).

The points from berries for Emma would be 5y and for Ava would be 5(y + 3).

The points from the timer for Emma would be 30(60 - time taken by Emma) and for Ava would be 30(60 - time taken by Ava - 4).

Since we don't know the time taken by Emma and Ava, let's assume the time taken by Emma is t seconds. Then the time taken by Ava is t + 4 seconds.

The total score for Emma would be 10x + 5y + 30(60 - t) and for Ava would be 10(x + 8) + 5(y + 3) + 30(60 - t - 4).

Simplifying the total scores:
Emma's score = 10x + 5y + 1800 - 30t
Ava's score = 10x + 40 + 5y + 1740 - 30t

Now, let's find the difference between their scores:
Difference = Ava's score - Emma's score
= (10x + 40 + 5y + 1740 - 30t) - (10x + 5y + 1800 - 30t)
= 40 + 1740 - 1800
= -20

"To find out how much the other two pizzas cost, we need to first find out how much the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars each cost in total. 

Two pizzas that cost 30 dollars each will be 2 x 30 = 60 dollars.

Now, we know that the total cost of all four pizzas is 64 dollars. To find out how much the other two pizzas cost, we need to subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars from the total cost.

So, 64 - 60 = 4 dollars.

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we need to divide the remaining cost by 2 to find out how much each of them cost.

4 / 2 = 2 dollars.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week, we need to calculate the number of times they ride on usual days and the number of times they ride on the two extra days.

On usual days, they ride their bikes 3 times a day for 5 days. So, the total number of times they ride on usual days is 3 * 5 = 15.

On the two extra days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, which is 2 * 3 = 6 times a day. Since there are two extra days, the total number of times they ride on these days is 6 * 2 = 12.

Now, we add the total number of times they ride on usual days and the extra days to get the total number of times they ride in a week. 15 + 12 = 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"Let's break down the information given. 

Initially, Bob had 7 fish in his pond, with 3 being orange and 4 being white. 

Let's say the number of white fish Bob bought is 'x'. Since he bought a total of 17 fish, the number of orange fish he bought is 17 - x.

After adding the new fish to his pond, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. This means the total number of orange fish is 2 times the total number of white fish. 

The total number of white fish in the pond is the initial 4 plus the x fish he bought, which is 4 + x. The total number of orange fish is the initial 3 plus the 17 - x fish he bought, which is 3 + (17 - x).

Since the total number of orange fish is twice the total number of white fish, we can set up the equation: 3 + (17 - x) = 2(4 + x).

Simplifying the equation, we get: 3 + 17 - x = 8 + 2x.

Combine like terms: 20 - x = 8 + 2x.

Add x to both sides: 20 = 8 + 3x.

Subtract 8 from both sides: 12 = 3x.

Divide both sides by 3: 4 = x.

So, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to calculate the total miles driven per week and then multiply it by the fuel efficiency and the price of gas.

First, let's find the total miles driven per week. Since Andy drives to work and back home every day from Monday to Friday, the total miles driven per day is 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles. 

The total miles driven per week is 10 miles/day * 5 days = 50 miles/week.

Now, let's calculate the amount of gas consumed per week. We can do this by dividing the total miles driven per week by the fuel efficiency (10 MPG). 

Gas consumed per week = Total miles driven per week / Fuel efficiency
Gas consumed per week = 50 miles/week / 10 MPG
Gas consumed per week = 5 gallons/week

Finally, we can find the total cost of gas per week by multiplying the gas consumed per week by the price of gas.

Total cost per week = Gas consumed per week * Price of gas
Total cost per week = 5 gallons/week * $3/gallon
Total cost per week = $15/week

"To find the total amount of money Carrie spent, we need to calculate the amount she spent from the quarters and the amount she spent from the twenties, then add them together.

First, let's find the total amount of money she had from the quarters. Since she had 140 quarters, and each quarter is worth $0.25, we can multiply the number of quarters by the value of each quarter:

140 quarters * $0.25 = $35

Next, let's find the amount she spent from the twenties. She spent 3/5 of the twenties, and she had 10 twenties. To find 3/5 of 10, we can multiply 10 by 3/5:

10 * (3/5) = 10 * 3 / 5 = 30/5 = 6

Since each twenty is worth $20, we can multiply the number of twenties she spent by the value of each twenty:

6 * $20 = $120

Now, let's add the amount she spent from the quarters and the amount she spent from the twenties:

$35 + $120 = $155

"To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we first need to determine the temperature difference between the current temperature and the temperature at which the pipes will freeze. 

The current temperature during the day is 45 degrees. It's 33 degrees colder during the night, so the temperature at night is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees. 

Since the pipes will freeze at 32 degrees, we need to find the difference between the night temperature and the freezing point: 12 - 32 = -20 degrees. 

However, since we can't burn logs to make the temperature lower, we need to find the difference between the current temperature and the freezing point: 32 - 12 = 20 degrees. 

Each log heats the house up by 5 degrees, so we need to divide the total temperature difference by the amount of heat each log produces: 20 / 5 = 4.

So, there were 10 groups. 

Now, 3/5 of the groups brought back seashells. To find 3/5 of 10, we multiply 10 by 3 and then divide by 5.

(10 * 3) / 5 = 30 / 5 = 6

So, 6 groups brought back seashells. 

Each of these groups brought back 2 seashells. To find the total number of seashells, we multiply the number of groups that brought seashells by the number of seashells each group brought.

Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Now, we need to find 30% of 14. 

30% of 14 = 0.3 * 14 = 4.2

Since we can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. 

So, Bubbles should buy 5 stuffed goats.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many hours Kris has played, we need to calculate the total hours she played in 2 weeks and 1 week.

In 2 weeks, there are 14 days. If Kris plays for half an hour every day, she plays 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours in 2 weeks.

In 1 week, there are 7 days. If Kris plays for 2 hours every day, she plays 7 * 2 = 14 hours in 1 week.

So, the total hours Kris has played is 7 + 14 = 21 hours.

To earn the achievement, Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours. Since she has already played 21 hours, she still needs to play 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours and then find the difference between the two distances.

The first car is traveling at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours it will travel:
60 miles/hour * 2 hours = 120 miles

The second car is traveling at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours it will travel:
70 miles/hour * 2 hours = 140 miles

The distance between the two cars will be the difference between the distances traveled by the two cars:
140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

So, after 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost, we need to add the cost of the diamond and the gold, then add the 30% premium.

The cost of the diamond is $600 and the cost of the gold is $300. 

First, we add the cost of the diamond and the gold: $600 + $300 = $900.

Next, we need to find 30% of $900. To do this, we multiply $900 by 0.30 (since 30% is the same as 0.30). 

$900 * 0.30 = $270.

Now, we add the 30% premium to the total cost of the diamond and gold: $900 + $270 = $1170.

So, James paid $1170 for the ring.

The final answer is: $1170"
"To find the overall pass rate, we need to find the total number of students who passed and the total number of students. 

First, let's find the number of students who passed in each grade level:

- Third graders: 340 passed out of 500
- Fourth graders: 40 passed out of 100
- Fifth graders: The pass rate is twice the fourth graders', so it's 2 * 40 = 80 out of 400

Now, let's find the total number of students who passed and the total number of students:

- Total passed: 340 (third graders) + 40 (fourth graders) + 80 (fifth graders) = 460
- Total students: 500 (third graders) + 100 (fourth graders) + 400 (fifth graders) = 1000

Now, we can find the overall pass rate by dividing the total number of students who passed by the total number of students and multiplying by 100:

Overall pass rate = (Total passed / Total students) * 100
= (460 / 1000) * 100
= 46%

The final answer is: 46"
"To find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we first need to find out how many square inches of mosaic he can make with the glass chips he has. 

Since it takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch, and he has 2 bags of glass chips, we need to find out how many glass chips he has in total. Each bag has 72 chips, so 2 bags will have 2 x 72 = 144 chips.

Now, we need to divide the total number of chips by the number of chips needed to make one square inch. 144 chips / 12 chips per square inch = 12 square inches.

Since the mosaic is 3 inches tall, and we know the area of the mosaic (12 square inches), we can find the length of the mosaic by dividing the area by the height. 

Area = length x height
12 square inches = length x 3 inches
length = 12 square inches / 3 inches
length = 4 inches

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total amount of tea left, we need to calculate the total amount of tea drank by the students. 

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea drank by these students is 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts. 

16 students each drank 2 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea drank by these students is 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

The total amount of tea drank by all students is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 10 quarts of tea left, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is 38 + 10 = 48 quarts.

Since 1 gallon is equal to 4 quarts, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party in gallons is 48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break this down step by step. 

Dale started with 100 candies. He sold 150, but he only had 100, so he must have sold all of them. Now, he ordered 100 more. 

So, he now has 100 (initial candies) + 100 (new candies) = 200 candies.

He already sold 150 candies, so he still needs to sell 200 (total candies) - 150 (sold candies) = 50 candies.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the number of students at the end of May, we need to calculate the number of times the students double in a year. 

Since the students double every month, in a year (12 months), they will double 12 times. 

Starting with 10 students, the number of students at the end of the year will be:
10 * 2^12 = 10 * 4096 = 40960 students.

However, we are only interested in the number of students at the end of May. Since the students double every month, we need to find the number of students at the end of May, which is 5 months after the beginning of the year.

The number of students at the end of May will be:
10 * 2^5 = 10 * 32 = 320 students.

Now, to find the number of additional students who joined by the end of May, we subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May:
320 - 10 = 310

The final answer is: 310"
"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day, we need to first find out how many branches he climbed in total. We know he made $105 and he charges $0.25 per branch. 

To find the total number of branches, we can divide the total amount of money he made ($105) by the cost per branch ($0.25).

Total branches = Total money made / Cost per branch
Total branches = $105 / $0.25
Total branches = 420

Since Felix works 5 days a week, we can find the average number of branches he climbed per day by dividing the total number of branches by 5.

Average branches per day = Total branches / 5
Average branches per day = 420 / 5
Average branches per day = 84

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the total number of petals, we need to calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers and then subtract the petals that were dropped.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers:

- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 x 5 = 15 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 x 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 x 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 x 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add up the total number of petals: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 petal from each set of flowers, we need to subtract 4 petals (1 from each set) from the total: 101 - 4 = 97 petals

The final answer is: 97"
"To find out how many marshmallows are left, we need to subtract the marshmallows used and the ones dropped from the total. 

Total marshmallows = 35
Marshmallows used by John = 9
Marshmallows used by DeSean = 9
Total marshmallows used = 9 + 9 = 18
Marshmallows dropped = 3
Total marshmallows lost = 18 + 3 = 21
Marshmallows left = 35 - 21 = 14

Now, we need to find out how many S'mores each kid can make with the remaining marshmallows. Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, the number of S'mores each kid can make is equal to the number of marshmallows they have.

Total marshmallows left = 14
Total kids = 2
Marshmallows per kid = 14 / 2 = 7

The final answer is: 7"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how long each of Jack's friends can play with 1 quarter. Since two of his friends can only play half as long as Jack, and Jack can play for 20 minutes, these two friends can play for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes each. 

The other friend can play 1.5 times as long as Jack, so this friend can play for 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes.

Now, let's find out how many quarters each friend can play for 4 hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 4 hours is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes. 

The two friends who can play for 10 minutes each will use 240 / 10 = 24 sets of quarters. Since each set is 1 quarter, they will use 24 quarters.

The friend who can play for 30 minutes will use 240 / 30 = 8 sets of quarters. Since each set is 1 quarter, they will use 8 quarters.

Jack can play for 20 minutes, so he will use 240 / 20 = 12 sets of quarters. Since each set is 1 quarter, he will use 12 quarters.

In total, the three friends will use 24 + 8 + 12 = 44 quarters.

Since each quarter is worth 0.25 dollars, the total amount of money used is 44 * 0.25 = 11 dollars.

The final answer is: $11"
"Let's break down the information given. 

Let's denote the amount of citrus zest as Z, the amount of fragrance as F, the amount of salt as S, the amount of sugar as S, and the amount of oil as O.

We know that Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, so F = Z.

We also know that she uses the same amount of salt as sugar, so S = S.

We know that she uses twice as much oil as salt, so O = 2S.

We also know that she uses twice as much salt as zest, so S = 2Z.

Since F = Z, we can substitute F with Z in the equation S = 2Z, so S = 2Z.

Now we have O = 2S and S = 2Z. We can substitute S with 2Z in the equation O = 2S, so O = 2(2Z) = 4Z.

Since the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, the sum of all the ingredients is 10. So, Z + F + S + S + O = 10.

We know that F = Z and S = 2Z, so we can substitute these values in the equation, Z + Z + 2Z + 2Z + 4Z = 10.

Combine like terms, 10Z = 10.

Divide both sides by 10, Z = 1.

Now that we know Z = 1, we can find the amount of oil. O = 4Z = 4(1) = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how much money John spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows, then add them together.

The cost of 3 goats is 3 x $500 = $1500.
The cost of 2 cows is 2 x $1500 = $3000.

Now, we add the cost of the goats and the cows together: $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

So, John spent $4500 in total. 

$4500"
"To find out how many more cupcakes Paul needs to buy, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs.

Paul needs 63 cupcakes in total. He already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes, so the total number of cupcakes he has is 8 + 40 = 48.

Now, let's subtract the number of cupcakes he has from the total number of cupcakes he needs: 63 - 48 = 15.

So, Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes. 

15"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

2. Joe sells 20% of his cars. 20% of 40 is 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars.

3. He gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

4. So, Joe sold 8 cars and gave away 16 cars. In total, he gave away 8 + 16 = 24 cars.

5. Now, let's find out how many cars Joe has left. He had 40 cars initially and gave away 24 cars. So, Joe has 40 - 24 = 16 cars left.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to first find out how much money the students raised in total. We know that the charity raised a total of $175,000 and $50,000 came from organizations. 

So, the amount raised by the students is $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000.

Since there are 20 students and they all earn the same amount, we can divide the total amount raised by the students by the number of students to find out how much each student raised.

$125,000 / 20 = $6,250.

The final answer is: $6,250."
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the first day and the second day.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. 

On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she walked on the first day. So, she walked 8 / 2 = 4 hours on the second day.

To find the total time, we add the time she walked on the first day and the second day. 
Total time = 8 hours + 4 hours = 12 hours.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we need to convert the total time from hours to minutes. 
Total time in minutes = 12 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 720 minutes.

The final answer is: 720"
"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during lunch break, we need to first find the total number of cars in the parking lot when he got out of class for lunch. 

Initially, there were 50 cars. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, so the total number of cars became 50 + 20 = 70.

When Hunter got out of class for lunch, 1/2 of the cars had gone. This means 1/2 of 70 had left, so 1/2 of 70 is 35 cars left. 

So, the number of cars that left is 70 - 35 = 35. 

Now, we need to find the total number of cars Hunter counted during lunch break. This is the number of cars that were left, which is 35.

The total number of cars Hunter counted during lunch break is 35."
"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of tasks he completes in a day and then multiply it by the number of days he works in a week.

John does 30 cycles a day and each cycle has 5 tasks. So, the total number of tasks he completes in a day is 30 * 5 = 150 tasks.

Since each task pays $1.20, the total amount he makes in a day is 150 * $1.20 = $180.

John works a full 7-day week, so we multiply the amount he makes in a day by 7 to get the total amount he makes in a week: $180 * 7 = $1260.

The final answer is: $1260"
"To find out how many points Sasha scored in the first game, we already know that she scored 14 points. 

In the first game, Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, so we need to subtract 4 from Sasha's score. 
Julie's score in the first game = 14 - 4 = 10 points.

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. 
Sasha's score in the second game = 10 - 6 = 4 points.

To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we need to add her scores from both games. 
Total points = 14 + 4 = 18 points.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Total cards = 341
2. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick.
3. Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has.

Let's use 'x' to represent the number of cards PJ has. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards.

We know Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is the sum of the cards each person has: x (PJ) + 3x (Smendrick) + (3x + 12) (Becca) = 341.

Combine like terms: x + 3x + 3x + 12 = 341
Combine the x terms: 7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides: 7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7: x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find out how many cards Smendrick has: 3x = 3 * 47 = 141

And Becca has 12 more than Smendrick: 141 + 12 = 153

Becca has 153 cards."
"To find out how many eggs Cindy had altogether, we need to find out how many of each color she had and then add them up.

Cindy had 5 green eggs. 
She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.
She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.
She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add up the number of eggs of each color: 
5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27

The final answer is: 27"
"To find out how much Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total cost of shipping the book and subtract the refund amount from the purchase price.

First, let's calculate the shipping cost. The book weighs 4 pounds and the shipping company charges $0.35 per pound, so the weight-based shipping cost is 4 * $0.35 = $1.40. The book needs to be returned 20 miles away, and the shipping company charges $0.08 per mile, so the distance-based shipping cost is 20 * $0.08 = $1.60. The total shipping cost is $1.40 + $1.60 = $2.99.

Now, let's calculate the refund amount. Amazon will refund 75% of the book's purchase price, which is 0.75 * $32 = $24.

The total cost of shipping is $2.99, and the refund amount is $24. To find out how much Milly will lose, we subtract the refund amount from the shipping cost: $2.99 - $24 = -$21.41. However, since we can't lose a negative amount of money, we need to recalculate the refund amount as the difference between the shipping cost and the refund amount. 

The correct calculation is: $2.99 - $24 = -$21.01. However, since we can't lose a negative amount of money, we need to recalculate the refund amount as the difference between the shipping cost and the refund amount.

"To find out how much money Mulan has left, we need to first calculate the total amount of money she has after her father gave her $100. 

Mulan initially had $40. Her father gave her $100, so she now has $40 + $100 = $140.

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought. She bought two pairs of jeans at $30 each, so the total cost of the jeans is 2 x $30 = $60. She also bought a bag for $20. The total cost of the items is $60 + $20 = $80.

Now, we need to subtract the total cost of the items from the total amount of money she has. $140 - $80 = $60.

So, Mulan has $60 left.

The final answer is: $60"
"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the production for the first three weeks and then find the pattern.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.

In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars of chocolate.

In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars of chocolate.

Now, let's add up the production for the first three weeks: 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars of chocolate.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month, we can find out how much he produces in the fourth week by subtracting the production of the first three weeks from the total production: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000.

The final answer is: 14,000"
"To find out how much time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the total time she spends on TikTok in a week and then multiply it by 4.

First, let's calculate the time Britany spends on TikTok each week:

- She records 18 videos, each taking 4 minutes. So, the total time spent recording videos is 18 * 4 = 72 minutes.
- She spends 2 hours writing songs, which is 2 * 60 = 120 minutes.
- She spends 15 minutes each day for 6 days on makeup, so the total time spent on makeup is 15 * 6 = 90 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time spent on TikTok each week:
72 + 120 + 90 = 282 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 282 minutes to hours:
282 / 60 = 4.7 hours

Now, let's multiply the time spent on TikTok each week by 4 to find the total time spent in a month:
4.7 * 4 = 18.8 hours

The final answer is: 18.8"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the initial installation and the cost of the additional items.

The initial installation includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. The cost of the initial installation is $129.00.

Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures that she needs installed. Since the initial installation already includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, and 1 chandelier, we need to subtract these from the total number of items she has. 

6 (mirrors) - 4 (initial installation) = 2 mirrors
2 (chandeliers) - 1 (initial installation) = 1 chandelier
20 (pictures) - 10 (initial installation) = 10 pictures

The number of additional items is 2 mirrors + 1 chandelier + 10 pictures = 13 items.

The cost of the additional items is 13 items * $15.00 per item = $195.00.

The total cost is the cost of the initial installation + the cost of the additional items: $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00.

The final answer is: $324.00"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Eva has saved $20.00.
2. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, so Anthony has saved $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.
3. Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we multiply $30.00 by 0.4: $30.00 * 0.4 = $12.00.
4. To find the total amount Roy has saved, we add the 40% more to Anthony's savings: $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

The final answer is: $42.00"
"To find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to find out how high Saskay can lift a mountain, then multiply it by 4 to find out how high Kagiyami can lift a mountain, and then multiply that by 10 to find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain.

First, Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei can. Since Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, Saskay can lift a mountain 12 * 1 = 12 inches.

Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay can. So, Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami can. So, Naruto can lift a mountain 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 since there are 12 inches in a foot. 480 / 12 = 40 feet.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the total distance Mason has traveled, we need to calculate the distance he covered in the first 4 hours and the distance he covered in the next 6 hours.

Distance = Speed x Time

For the first 4 hours:
Distance = 8 miles/hour x 4 hours = 32 miles

For the next 6 hours:
Distance = 8 miles/hour x 6 hours = 48 miles

Total distance = Distance in the first 4 hours + Distance in the next 6 hours
Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles
Total distance = 80 miles

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the speed of the kangaroos. Since it takes 3 kangaroos 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can find the total speed of the kangaroos by dividing the total time by the number of kangaroos.

Total speed of kangaroos = Total time / Number of kangaroos
Total speed of kangaroos = 18 hours / 3
Total speed of kangaroos = 6 hours

Now, we know that the turtles are traveling at half the speed of the kangaroos. So, the speed of the turtles is:

Speed of turtles = Total speed of kangaroos / 2
Speed of turtles = 6 hours / 2
Speed of turtles = 3 hours

Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of the kangaroos, it will take them twice as long to travel the same distance. 

Time taken by turtles = 2 * Time taken by kangaroos
Time taken by turtles = 2 * 18 hours
Time taken by turtles = 36 hours

The final answer is: 36"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Kora made 20 dishes. 
Rory made 20 more dishes than Kora, so Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes. 
Jada made twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

To find the total number of dishes they made together, we need to add the number of dishes each person made. 
Total dishes = Kora's dishes + Rory's dishes + Jada's dishes 
Total dishes = 20 + 40 + 80 
Total dishes = 140

The final answer is: 140"
"Let's break down the information given. Erika's new laptop costs $600, but she gets a discount of $200 for trading in her old laptop. So, the price of the new laptop after the discount is $600 - $200 = $400.

Erika already has some savings in her purse, let's call it x. She also got paid $150 for her part-time job and her mom gave her $80. So, the total amount of money she has is x + $150 + $80.

We know that after getting this money, Erika only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop. This means the total amount of money she has is $400 (price of the laptop after discount) - $50 (amount she still needs) = $350.

Now, we can set up an equation to find the amount of money Erika had in her purse: x + $150 + $80 = $350.

Combine the constants: $150 + $80 = $230.

Now the equation is: x + $230 = $350.

Subtract $230 from both sides: x = $350 - $230.

x = $120.

So, Erika has $120 in her purse. 

The final answer is: $120"
"To find out how many slices Adam has left, we need to first calculate the total number of slices he made. 

He sliced 3 large apples, and each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces. So, the total number of slices from large apples is 3 x 5 = 15.

He also sliced 5 small apples, and each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces. So, the total number of slices from small apples is 5 x 3 = 15.

Now, we add the total number of slices from large and small apples: 15 + 15 = 30.

Adam ate 15 slices, so we subtract the number of slices he ate from the total number of slices: 30 - 15 = 15.

Therefore, Adam has 15 apple slices left.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how many cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to find out how many liters of milk one cow produces per day. 

Since the farmer extracts 5 liters of milk a day from one cow, and he has 3 cows, the total milk produced per day is 5 * 3 = 15 liters.

Now, we need to find out how many cows are needed to produce 25 liters of milk per day. We can do this by dividing the total milk needed (25 liters) by the milk produced per cow (5 liters). 

25 / 5 = 5 cows. 

Since the farmer already has 3 cows, he needs 5 - 3 = 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to find the length of each used part and subtract it from the original length of the glue stick.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so the used part is 5/6. 
5/6 of 12 millimeters is (5/6) * 12 = 10 millimeters.

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so the used part is 1/3. 
1/3 of 12 millimeters is (1/3) * 12 = 4 millimeters.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so the used part is 1/2. 
1/2 of 12 millimeters is (1/2) * 12 = 6 millimeters.

Now, we add the lengths of the used parts together: 10 + 4 + 6 = 20 millimeters.

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 12 - 20 = -8 millimeters. However, since we can't have a negative length, this means that the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 0 millimeters.

The final answer is: 0"
"To find out how much money Gabriel still needs, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he wants to buy and subtract the amount of money he already has.

The total cost of the items is $10000 (car) + $800 (phone) = $10080.

Gabriel has $5000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200, so he has a total of $5000 + $200 = $5200.

Now, let's subtract the amount of money Gabriel has from the total cost of the items: $10080 - $5200 = $3580.

So, Gabriel still needs $3580.

He also buys 3 packs of water balloons for $3 each, so he spent 3 x $3 = $9.

The total amount he spent is $12 + $9 = $21.

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount he had: $40 - $21 = $19.

So, Craig has $19 left.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so the number of socks Jack has is 60 / 2 = 30 socks.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has 2 * 30 = 60 socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:

Total socks = Jack's socks + Peter's socks = 30 + 60 = 90 socks
Total dishes = Jack's dishes + Peter's dishes = 60 + 30 = 90 dishes

Total number of socks and dishes together = 90 + 90 = 180

"Let's break down the information given. We know that there are 20 students in total. 5 students are good at math only, and 8 students are good at English only. The rest of the students are good at both math and English.

Let's denote the number of students good at both math and English as x. Since the total number of students is 20, we can set up the equation:

5 (good at math only) + 8 (good at English only) + x (good at both) = 20

Combine the constants on the left side of the equation:

13 + x = 20

Now, solve for x by subtracting 13 from both sides:

x = 20 - 13
x = 7

This means that 7 students are good at both math and English. To find the total number of students good at math, we need to add the students who are good at math only (5) to the students who are good at both math and English (7):

Total good at math = 5 (good at math only) + 7 (good at both)
Total good at math = 12

The concert is 2 hours long, which is 120 minutes. We subtract the 10-minute intermission from this, so we have 120 - 10 = 110 minutes left for performances.

Each group takes 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit the stage. So, each group takes 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes.

Now, we divide the total time available for performances (110 minutes) by the time each group takes (10 minutes). 

110 / 10 = 11

So, 11 groups can perform in the concert.

Now, let's find out how many goats are left in each farm:
- In Farm X, there were 55 goats initially and 10 were sold, so 55 - 10 = 45 goats are left.
- In Farm Y, there were 45 goats initially and 20 were sold, so 45 - 20 = 25 goats are left.

Now, let's add the number of goats left in both farms to find the total number of goats left:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. I am three years younger than my brother.
2. I am 2 years older than my sister.
3. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age.
4. When you add all our ages, you get 87.

Let's use variables to represent each person's age:
- Let B be my brother's age.
- Let S be my sister's age.
- Let M be my mom's age.
- Let A be my age.

From the given information:
1. A = B - 3 (I am three years younger than my brother)
2. A = S + 2 (I am 2 years older than my sister)
3. M = 3B - 1 (My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age)
4. A + B + S + M = 87 (The sum of all our ages is 87)

We can substitute the first two equations into the fourth equation:
(B - 3) + B + (B - 3 - 2) + (3B - 1) = 87
Combine like terms:
6B - 8 = 87
Add 8 to both sides:
6B = 95
Divide by 6:
B = 15.83 (round down to 15 since age can't be a fraction)

Now that we know my brother's age, we can find my mom's age:
M = 3B - 1
M = 3(15) - 1
M = 45 - 1
M = 44

Now that we know my brother's age, we can find my age:
A = B - 3
A = 15 - 3
A = 12

Now that we know my age, we can find my sister's age:
A = S + 2
12 = S + 2
Subtract 2 from both sides:
S = 10

The final answer is: 12"
"To find out how many packs Mr. Jackson needs, we need to first find out how many glue sticks he needs in total. Since each student needs 2 glue sticks and there are 27 students, he needs 27 * 2 = 54 glue sticks.

Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks in a pack. 54 / 8 = 6.75. 

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he will need to round up to the nearest whole number. So, he will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount of water passing through the river at the given point. 

First, we know that the amount of water passing through the river doubles after a day of heavy rain. So, the amount of water on the second day is 2 times the amount on the first day, which is 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.

On the third day, the volume of water increases by 6000 gallons. So, the amount of water on the third day is 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

To find the total amount of water passing through the river at that point, we need to add the amounts of water on each day. 

Total amount of water = 4000 (first day) + 8000 (second day) + 14000 (third day) = 24000 gallons.

The final answer is: 24000"
"To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of exponential growth. 

On the first day, the 10 people infect 6 others, making a total of 10 + 6 = 16 people infected.

On the second day, the 16 people infect 6 others, making a total of 16 + (16 * 6) = 16 + 96 = 112 people infected.

On the third day, the 112 people infect 6 others, making a total of 112 + (112 * 6) = 112 + 672 = 784 people infected.

So, after three days, there are 784 people infected.

The final answer is: 784"
"To find out how much money Julieta received, we need to calculate 10% of Rafaela's tips and subtract it from Rafaela's total. 

Rafaela received 40 * $20 = $800 in tips. 

10% of $800 is 0.1 * $800 = $80. 

So, Julieta received $800 - $80 = $720 in tips.

Now, to find the total amount of money they received altogether, we add Rafaela's and Julieta's tips: $800 + $720 = $1520.

The final answer is: $1520"
"To find out how many oranges Jennifer remained with, we need to first calculate how many oranges she gave away. 

She gave her 3 daughters 2 oranges each, so that's 3 x 2 = 6 oranges. 
Then, she gave her boy 3 oranges. 
So, in total, she gave away 6 + 3 = 9 oranges.

Jennifer bought 12 oranges initially. She gave away 9 oranges. To find out how many oranges she remained with, we subtract the number of oranges given away from the total number of oranges she bought: 12 - 9 = 3.

The final answer is: 3"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Claire earns 1 badge per month.
- Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge than Claire, so Amber earns 1/2 badge per month.
- Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so Wendy earns 3 badges per month.

In a 1-year time frame (12 months), the number of badges earned by each person would be:

- Claire: 1 badge/month * 12 months = 12 badges
- Amber: 1/2 badge/month * 12 months = 6 badges
- Wendy: 3 badges/month * 12 months = 36 badges

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a 1-year time frame, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns:

36 badges (Wendy) - 6 badges (Amber) = 30 badges

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how much Paige raised, we need to calculate the total number of slices she baked and sold. 

First, let's find out how many hours she baked. She baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is 5 hours.

Since she can bake 2 loaves per hour, she baked 2 * 5 = 10 loaves in 5 hours.

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so she baked 10 * 8 = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, and she sold all 80 slices. To find the total amount raised, we need to multiply the number of slices by the price per slice. 

80 * 0.5 = 40 dollars.

The final answer is: $40"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. If Gretchen has 70 gold coins, we can represent the number of silver coins as x. 

Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can write an equation: x + 30 = 70. 

To find the number of silver coins, we need to solve for x. Subtract 30 from both sides of the equation: x = 70 - 30. 

x = 40. 

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins. 

Now, to find the total number of coins, we add the number of gold coins and silver coins: 70 (gold) + 40 (silver) = 110.

The final answer is: 110"
"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we need to first find out how many burritos were eaten in total. 

There were 50 students at the picnic, and each student was given 10 burritos. So, the total number of burritos given to the students is 50 * 10 = 500.

Mr. George also ate 20 burritos. 

The total number of burritos eaten is 500 (given to students) + 20 (eaten by Mr. George) = 520.

Since there were 600 burritos ordered in total, the number of leftover burritos is 600 - 520 = 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"Let's break down the information given:

- The rink has 12 red cars.
- They have 2 fewer green cars than they have red cars, so they have 12 - 2 = 10 green cars.
- They have 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars, so they have 3 * 10 = 30 blue cars.
- The total number of cars is 75.

We know the total number of red, green, and blue cars: 12 (red) + 10 (green) + 30 (blue) = 52 cars.

To find the number of yellow cars, we subtract the total number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars: 75 - 52 = 23.

The rink has 23 yellow cars.

23"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have 85 books together.
2. Sofie has 25 more books than Anne.
3. Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn.

Let's use variables to represent the number of books each person has:

- Let A be the number of books Anne has.
- Since Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, Fawn has A + 12 books.
- Since Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, Sofie has A + 25 books.

We know that the total number of books is 85, so we can write an equation:

A + (A + 12) + (A + 25) = 85

Combine like terms:

3A + 37 = 85

Subtract 37 from both sides:

3A = 48

Divide both sides by 3:

A = 16

Now that we know Anne has 16 books, we can find out how many books Fawn has:

Fawn has A + 12 books, so Fawn has 16 + 12 = 28 books.

The final answer is: 28"
"To find out how many pounds of carrots Daisy bought, we need to first find out how much the sweet potatoes weighed. We know that the sweet potatoes weighed 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weighed 5 pounds. 

So, the sweet potatoes weighed 2 * 5 = 10 pounds.

We also know that the carrots weighed 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes. 

So, the carrots weighed 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

"To find out how much Greg will spend on jello, we need to first find out how many jello cups he needs in total. Since there are 30 kids and each kid will get 4 jello cups, we multiply 30 by 4.

30 kids * 4 jello cups/kid = 120 jello cups

Since one 3-ounce box of jello makes 10 small jello cups, we need to find out how many boxes of jello Greg needs to buy. We can do this by dividing the total number of jello cups needed by the number of jello cups one box makes.

120 jello cups / 10 jello cups/box = 12 boxes

Now that we know Greg needs 12 boxes of jello, we can find out how much he will spend. Each box costs $1.25, so we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box.

12 boxes * $1.25/box = $15

"To find out how much change the seller will give back, we need to first calculate the total cost of the phones. 

The seller bought 5 phones for $700 each, so the total cost is 5 x $700 = $3500.

The seller gave the seller $4000 in dollar bills. To find the change, we need to subtract the total cost from the amount given. 

Change = $4000 - $3500 = $500.

The final answer is: $500"
"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we first need to find out how much Keenan spends in a month. 

Since Madeline pays 60% of the cost, Keenan pays 40% of the cost. 

40% of $400 is 0.4 x 400 = $160. 

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we need to divide the total amount Keenan pays in a month by 4 to find out how much he pays per week. 

$160 / 4 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find out how many pieces Tobias ate, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he ate on each day and add them up.

On the first day, he ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces. To find 2/5 of 60, we multiply 60 by 2 and divide by 5. 

60 * 2 = 120
120 / 5 = 24

So, on the first day, he ate 24 pieces.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces. To find the remaining pieces after the first two days, we subtract the pieces eaten on the first two days from the total.

60 - 24 - 10 = 26

Now, we need to find 7/13 of 26. To do this, we multiply 26 by 7 and divide by 13.

26 * 7 = 182
182 / 13 = 14

So, on the third day, he ate 14 pieces.

Now, we add up the pieces eaten on each day to find the total.

"To find the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water, we need to first find the cost of one bottle of soda and one bottle of water.

The cost of 7 bottles of soda is $21.00, so the cost of one bottle of soda is $21.00 / 7 = $3.00.

The cost of 4 bottles of water is $8.00, so the cost of one bottle of water is $8.00 / 4 = $2.00.

Now, we can find the total cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water by multiplying the cost of one bottle of soda by 3 and the cost of one bottle of water by 2, then adding the two amounts together.

The cost of 3 bottles of soda is 3 x $3.00 = $9.00.
The cost of 2 bottles of water is 2 x $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost is $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00.

First, let's find the total cost of the bolts. 
Number of bolts: 16
Cost per bolt: $0.03
Total cost = Number of bolts * Cost per bolt
Total cost = 16 * $0.03
Total cost = $0.48

Now, let's subtract the total cost from the amount of money David has.
Initial amount of money: $12.48
Total cost of bolts: $0.48

1. First, we add the marbles Paul received from his friend to the marbles he already had. 
   Paul had 52 marbles initially. His friend gave him 28 marbles. 
   Total marbles = 52 + 28 = 80

2. Then, we need to find out how many marbles Paul lost. He lost 1/4 of his marbles. 
   To find 1/4 of 80, we multiply 80 by 1/4 or divide 80 by 4.

"To find out how much money Isaias bought the chickens for, we need to first find out how many chickens he plans to sell. Since he has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them, we can calculate the number of chickens he plans to sell as follows:

Number of chickens to sell = 300 * (3/5)
= 300 * 0.6
= 180 chickens

Now, we know that Isaias plans to sell 180 chickens at $50 per chicken. To find the total amount of money he will make, we multiply the number of chickens by the price per chicken:

Total money made = 180 * $50
= $9000

Since Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000, we can find the total cost of the chickens by subtracting the profit from the total money made:

Total cost = Total money made - Profit
= $9000 - $2000
= $7000

So, Isaias bought the chickens for $7000.

The final answer is: $7000"

"Let's break this down step by step. 

First, we know that in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. This means that her current age is 18 - 10 = 8 years old.

Now, we need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her present age. Let's call this number 'x'. So, her age after 'x' years will be 8 + x.

We are told that her age after 'x' years will be thrice her present age, which is 8. So, we can write the equation: 8 + x = 3 * 8.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 8 + x = 24.

Now, we need to solve for 'x'. Subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation, we get: x = 24 - 8.

x = 16.

So, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age in 16 years.

"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's find the cost of the chicken. Each pack of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, and since 5 packs of bacon cost $10, each pack of bacon costs $10 / 5 = $2. So, each pack of chicken costs $2 * 2 = $4. Since Kelly has 6 packs of chicken, the total cost of chicken is 6 * $4 = $24.

Next, let's find the cost of the strawberries. Each pack of strawberries costs $4, and Kelly has 3 packs, so the total cost of strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.

Now, let's find the cost of the apples. Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is $4 / 2 = $2. Since Kelly has 7 packs of apples, the total cost of apples is 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items: $10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60.

Kelly's budget is $65, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget: $65 - $60 = $5.

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants. 
75 * 2/3 = 50 plants are outdoor plants.

The rest of the remaining plants are flowering plants. 
75 - 50 = 25 plants are flowering plants.

"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to know the speed of the thingamabob first. Since the whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob, and the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, we can find the speed of the thingamabob by dividing 121 by 11.

Speed of thingamabob = 121 / 11 = 11 meters per second

Now, we know that the whirligig spins at five times the speed of the thingamabob. So, we can find the speed of the whirligig by multiplying the speed of the thingamabob by 5.

Speed of whirligig = 11 * 5 = 55 meters per second

"Let's break down the information given. Ellen eats two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day. The salad costs $6, and the yogurt is half the price of the salad. 

Since the yogurt is half the price of the salad, and the salad costs $6, the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.

Ellen pays a total of $11 for her daily goods. We know the cost of the salad ($6) and the yogurt ($3), so we can subtract these from the total to find the cost of the carrots. 

Cost of carrots = Total cost - (Cost of salad + Cost of yogurt)
Cost of carrots = $11 - ($6 + $3)
Cost of carrots = $11 - $9
Cost of carrots = $2

Since Ellen eats two carrots every day, the cost of one carrot is:

"To find out how much Mark makes a week, we need to calculate his new hourly wage and then multiply it by the number of hours he works in a week.

Mark used to make $10 an hour, but his pay was raised by $2 per hour. So, his new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12 per hour.

Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week. To find out how many hours he works in a week, we multiply the number of hours he works per day by the number of days he works per week: 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week.

"Let's break down the information given. 

Let's say Tasha mowed Joe's lawn x times. 

The first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times. 

The second week, she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times. 

We know that the total number of times she mowed lawns is 3x + x + 5x = 9x. 

We also know that she made $6 for mowing Joe's lawn. 

Since she made $80 in total, the amount she made from mowing lawns is $80 - $6 = $74. 

The amount she made from mowing lawns is 9x, so 9x = $74. 

To find x, we divide both sides by 9: x = $74 / 9 = $8.22 (approximately). 

Since x is the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn, and she made $6 for that, we can find the total amount she made from mowing Kamala's and Alba's lawns. 

The total amount she made from mowing Kamala's and Alba's lawns is 3x + 5x = 8x. 

8x = 8 * $8.22 = $65.76. 

The amount she made from lemonade sales is $80 - $65.76 = $14.24.

"To find Harry's weight, we need to find Christian's weight first, then subtract 5 kg from it.

Martin's weight is 55 kg. 
Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so Carl's weight is 55 + 16 = 71 kg.
Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight is 71 + 8 = 79 kg.
Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight is 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

The final answer is: 74"
"To find the total amount John earns from renting his car, we need to multiply the number of times he rents it by the number of hours and the hourly rate.

Number of times he rents his car: 10
Number of hours per rental: 3
Hourly rate: $25

Total earnings = Number of times * Number of hours * Hourly rate
Total earnings = 10 * 3 * $25
Total earnings = $750

Now, we need to subtract the car payment from the total earnings to find the profit.

Profit = Total earnings - Car payment
Profit = $750 - $500
Profit = $250

The final answer is: $250"
"Let's break this down step by step. 

Martha initially had some notebooks, but we don't know how many. Let's call the number of notebooks Martha had initially ""x"". Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, Joseph had 3x notebooks.

Martha bought 5 more notebooks, so now she has x + 5 notebooks.

We are also told that after buying 5 more notebooks, Martha had a total of 7 notebooks. So, we can set up the equation x + 5 = 7 to find out how many notebooks Martha initially had.

Solving for x, we get x = 2. This means Martha initially had 2 notebooks.

Now, we know Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, so Joseph had 3 * 2 = 6 notebooks.

To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract the number of notebooks Joseph has from the number of notebooks Martha has: 7 - 6 = 1.

So, Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph."
"To find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we need to first find out how far Anis rowed. 

Dijana rowed 50 miles. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. To find 1/5 of 50, we multiply 50 by 1/5, which is 10. 

So, Anis rowed 50 + 10 = 60 miles. 

Now, to find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we add their individual distances: 50 + 60 = 110 miles.

The final answer is: 110"
"To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we need to first find out how many cookies are left after Susan's husband took some. 

Susan had 100 cookies initially. Her husband took 4 cookies, so we subtract 4 from 100: 100 - 4 = 96 cookies left.

Now, we need to divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews, which is 6. 

To divide 96 cookies by 6, we do 96 ÷ 6 = 16.

So, each of Susan's nephews will get 16 cookies. 

16"
"To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we need to calculate the total number of pages each of them read.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. 

Today, Denise read 5 more than Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read 13 + 5 = 18 pages today.

So, Denise read a total of 10 + 18 = 28 pages. Daniel read a total of 13 pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the total number of pages Daniel read from the total number of pages Denise read: 28 - 13 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many bowls of soup Calvin's family will use for dinner. 

Since Calvin, his wife, and their two children are eating, that's a total of 3 adults and 2 children. 

Adults need 1 bowl each, so 3 adults will use 3 bowls. Children need 1 bowl each, so 2 children will use 2 bowls. 

In total, they will use 3 + 2 = 5 bowls for dinner.

The pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child's bowls. Since 5 bowls were used for dinner, we need to find out how many child's bowls that is. 

Since 4 adult bowls is equal to 8 child's bowls, we can set up a proportion: 4 adult bowls = 8 child's bowls. 

To find out how many child's bowls 5 bowls is, we can multiply 5 by 2 (since 4 adult bowls is equal to 8 child's bowls, and 8 divided by 4 is 2). 

5 * 2 = 10 child's bowls. 

So, the pot can fill 10 child's bowls. Since 2 child's bowls were used for dinner, there are 10 - 2 = 8 child's bowls left.

Since there are 2 children, and there are 8 child's bowls left, each child can have 8 / 2 = 4 bowls of soup for lunch. 

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how much William spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the notebooks and the ballpen separately and then add them together.

The cost of 5 notebooks is 5 x $1.50 = $7.50.

Now, let's add the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen together: $7.50 + $0.5 = $8.

The final answer is: $8"
"To find out how much material Jo needs, we need to calculate the total amount of material needed for small and large masks separately and then add them together.

For small masks, Jo needs 2 yards of material for 4 masks. To find out how much material she needs for 20 small masks, we multiply the amount of material needed for 4 small masks by 5 (20/4 = 5). 

2 yards * 5 = 10 yards for 20 small masks.

For large masks, Jo needs 2.25 yards of material for 3 masks. To find out how much material she needs for 8 large masks, we multiply the amount of material needed for 3 large masks by 2.67 (8/3 = 2.67, rounded to two decimal places).

2.25 yards * 2.67 = 6 yards for 8 large masks.

Now, we add the material needed for small and large masks together.

10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the average price Deepa paid per ticket, we need to know the total number of tickets she bought and the total amount she spent. 

Since Deepa saw each of the 9 movies three times, she bought a total of 9 * 3 = 27 tickets.

The total amount she spent is $216.

To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets: 

Average price per ticket = Total amount spent / Total number of tickets
= $216 / 27
= $8

"To find out how much free time Harold has left in his day, we need to calculate the total hours in a day and subtract the hours he spends sleeping, working, and walking his dog.

There are 24 hours in a day. 

Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night. 
He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours a day.
He walks his dog for 1 hour a day.

Total hours spent on these activities: 10 (sleep) + 8 (work) + 1 (walking dog) = 19 hours.

Free time left in a day = Total hours in a day - Total hours spent on activities
= 24 - 19

"To find out how many red shoeboxes Tim used, we need to calculate 1/3 of 9. 

1/3 of 9 is 9 / 3 = 3.

So, Tim used 3 red shoeboxes. 

Now, we know Tim used 3 blue shoeboxes and 3 red shoeboxes. 

He started with 7 blue shoeboxes, so he has 7 - 3 = 4 blue shoeboxes left.

He started with 9 red shoeboxes, so he has 9 - 3 = 6 red shoeboxes left.

The total number of blue and red shoeboxes left is 4 + 6 = 10.

"To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we need to first calculate how many marbles he gave away. 

Dean gave 1/5 of his marbles to Jamie. 1/5 of 30 is 30 / 5 = 6. 

So, Dean gave 6 marbles to Jamie. 

Then, he gave 10 marbles to Donald. 

In total, Dean gave away 6 + 10 = 16 marbles.

Now, we need to subtract the marbles he gave away from the total number of marbles he had. 

30 - 16 = 14

So, Dean has 14 marbles left.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say Adam's age four years ago was x. 

Since Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, we can write an equation: 
Duncan's age eight years ago = 2 * Adam's age four years ago
(60 - 8) = 2 * (x - 4)
52 = 2x - 8

Now, let's solve for x:
52 + 8 = 2x
60 = 2x
x = 60 / 2
x = 30

So, Adam's age four years ago was 30. 

Now, let's find Adam's current age:
Adam's current age = x + 4
Adam's current age = 30 + 4
Adam's current age = 34

Finally, let's find Adam's age in 8 years:
Adam's age in 8 years = Adam's current age + 8
Adam's age in 8 years = 34 + 8
Adam's age in 8 years = 42

"To find the total acres of Farmer Smith's farm, we need to calculate twice the acres of Farmer Brown's farm and then add 100 to it. 

Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. Twice that would be 2 x 200 = 400 acres. 

Adding 100 acres to that would be 400 + 100 = 500 acres. 

So, Farmer Smith's farm is 500 acres. 

Now, to find the total acres of both farms, we need to add the acres of both farms. 

200 (Farmer Brown's farm) + 500 (Farmer Smith's farm) = 700 acres.

The final answer is: 700"
"To find out how much Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday, we need to first find out how many packages he completes in an hour and then multiply that by the number of hours he works and his pay per package.

Colby completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, so he completes 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

In an 8-hour workday, he would complete 40 * 8 = 320 packages.

Since he gets paid $0.20 for every package, he earns 320 * $0.20 = $64 in an 8-hour workday.

The final answer is: $64"
"To find out how many bottles of water John drinks, we need to calculate the time it takes to solve the extreme sudoku and then divide it by the time it takes to drink one bottle of water.

A normal sudoku takes 45 minutes, and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long, so an extreme sudoku takes 45 * 4 = 180 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, that's 30 minutes per bottle. 

To find out how many bottles he drinks in 180 minutes, we divide 180 by 30. 

180 / 30 = 6

So, John drinks 6 bottles of water while solving the extreme sudoku. 

The final answer is: 6"
"Let's break down the information given. Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces at each yellow balloon. We know that he threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna. 

Let's denote the number of red balloons as R and the number of yellow balloons as Y. We know that R = 20. 

The total number of bologna pieces thrown at red balloons is 2R, and the total number of bologna pieces thrown at yellow balloons is 3Y. Since the total number of bologna pieces is 58, we can set up the equation:

2R + 3Y = 58

Substituting R = 20 into the equation:

2(20) + 3Y = 58
40 + 3Y = 58

Now, let's solve for Y:

3Y = 58 - 40
3Y = 18

Divide both sides by 3:

Y = 18 / 3
Y = 6

So, there are 6 yellow balloons in the bundle.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how many tune-ups Jon needs, we need to calculate the total miles he drives in 30 days. 

Jon drives 100 miles a day for 30 days, so the total miles driven is 100 * 30 = 3000 miles.

Since Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we need to divide the total miles driven by 1000 to find out how many tune-ups he needs.

3000 miles / 1000 miles per tune-up = 3 tune-ups.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. They bought a cake for $11.
2. They bought 1 dozen balloons, which is 12 balloons. Since 2 balloons cost $0.5, we can find the cost of 1 balloon by dividing $0.5 by 2, which is $0.25. Now, we multiply the cost of 1 balloon by 12 to get the total cost of the balloons: 12 * $0.25 = $3.
3. The total cost of the cake and balloons is $11 + $3 = $14.
4. They bought 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each, so the total cost of the ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.
5. The total cost of the cake, balloons, and ice cream is $14 + $14 = $28.
6. Since they used all the money to buy these items, the total amount of money they had is $28.
7. Since they had the same amount of allowance, we can divide the total amount of money by 2 to find out how much each of them had: $28 / 2 = $14.

"To find the total amount of money the class was able to raise, we need to find the total profit. 

First, let's find the total number of lollipops sold. Since each student sold 10 lollipops and there are 30 students, the total number of lollipops sold is 10 * 30 = 300.

The total cost of the lollipops is the number of lollipops sold multiplied by the cost per lollipop, which is 300 * $0.5 = $150.

The total revenue from selling the lollipops is the number of lollipops sold multiplied by the selling price per lollipop, which is 300 * $0.8 = $240.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $240 - $150 = $90.

So, the class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops.

"To find out how many pets Larry has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet and then add them up.

Larry has 3 cats.

He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.

He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.

He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 * 7 = 21 fish.

He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

Now, let's add up the number of each type of pet: 3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47

"To find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row, we first need to find out how many cups of tea are in each row. 

Lana has 27 cups of tea in total. She divides these into 3 rows. 

To find out how many cups are in each row, we divide 27 by 3. 

27 / 3 = 9 cups in each row.

Since she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, the number of mint tea cups in each row will be half of the total cups in each row.

9 / 2 = 4.5 cups of mint tea in each row.

However, since we can't have half a cup of tea, we can assume that the 4.5 cups of mint tea in each row are actually 4 full cups of mint tea and 0.5 cups of another type of tea (which is not specified in the question)."

"To find out how many movies Colby can see, we need to first calculate how much money he has left. 

Colby's parents give him $150 per month. He already spent money on 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays ($10 each), 8 movies on other days ($7 each), 2 tubs of popcorn ($8 each), and 4 boxes of candy ($2 each). 

First, let's calculate the total amount spent on movies: 
5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays = 5 * $10 = $50
8 movies on other days = 8 * $7 = $56
Total spent on movies = $50 + $56 = $106

Next, let's calculate the total amount spent on snacks:
2 tubs of popcorn = 2 * $8 = $16
4 boxes of candy = 4 * $2 = $8
Total spent on snacks = $16 + $8 = $24

Now, let's calculate the total amount spent:
Total spent = $106 (movies) + $24 (snacks) = $130

Colby started with $150, so he has $150 - $130 = $20 left.

Since tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10, and he has $20 left, he can see 2 more movies on Fridays or Saturdays.

"To find the total calories of the pastries, we need to first find the calories of a mini cinnamon roll and a mini blueberry muffin. 

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini pastry has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal version. So, a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories. 

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini pastry has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal version. So, a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, we can find the total calories of the pastries. There are 200 mini cinnamon rolls, each with 200 calories, so the total calories from cinnamon rolls are 200 * 200 = 40,000. 

There are 300 mini blueberry muffins, each with 150 calories, so the total calories from blueberry muffins are 300 * 150 = 45,000.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old.
2. Paul is 10 years older than John.
3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age.

Let's denote John's age as x. Since Paul is 10 years older than John, Paul's age is x + 10.

We know that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age, so Peter's age is x + (x + 10) = 2x + 10.

The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old, so we can write the equation: (2x + 10) + (x + 10) + Jean's age = 100.

Since we don't have any information about Jean's age, we can't directly solve for x. However, we can simplify the equation by combining like terms: 3x + 20 + Jean's age = 100.

We still can't solve for x because we don't know Jean's age. But we can express Peter's age in terms of x: Peter's age = 2x + 10.

However, we can express Paul's age in terms of x: Paul's age = x + 10.

Since we know that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age, we can write: 2x + 10 = x + 10 + x.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 2x + 10 = 2x + 10.

This equation is true for any value of x, which means we can't find a unique solution for x. However, we can express Peter's age in terms of x: Peter's age = 2x + 10.

But we can simplify the original equation: (2x + 10) + (x + 10) + Jean's age = 100.

Combine like terms: 3x + 20 + Jean's age = 100.

Subtract 20 from both sides: 3x + Jean's age = 80.

Subtract Jean's age from both sides: 3x = 80 - Jean's age.

Divide both sides by 3: x = (80 - Jean's age) / 3.

Since we don't know Jean's age, we can't find a numerical value for x.

However, we can express Peter's age in terms of Jean's age: Peter's age = 2 * ((80 - Jean's age) / 3) + 10.

But we can simplify the original equation: (2x + 10) + (x + 10) + Jean's age = 100.

Combine like terms: 3x + 20 + Jean's age = 100.

Subtract 20 from both sides: 3x + Jean's age = 80.

Subtract Jean's age from both sides: 3x = 80 - Jean's age.

Divide both sides by 3: x = (80 - Jean's age) / 3.

Since we don't know Jean's age, we can't find a numerical value for x.

However, we can express Peter's age in terms of Jean's age: Peter's age = 2 * ((80 - Jean's age) / 3) + 10.

But we can simplify the original equation: (2x + 10) + (x + 10) + Jean's age = 100.

Combine like terms: 3x + 20 + Jean's age = 100.

Subtract 20 from both sides: 3x + Jean's age = 80.

Subtract Jean's age from both sides: 3x = 80 - Jean's age.

Divide both sides by 3: x = (80 - Jean's age) / 3.

"To find the total number of balloons, we need to calculate the initial number of balloons and then add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, Maria had 1 water balloon, and her 4 friends had 2 balloons each. So, the total number of balloons initially is:
1 (Maria's balloon) + (4 x 2) = 1 + 8 = 9

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional balloons is:
5 x 3 = 15

Now, we add the initial number of balloons to the additional balloons:
9 (initial balloons) + 15 (additional balloons) = 24

The total number of balloons the girls have is 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find out how many tables they need, we first need to calculate the total number of boxes they have. 

10 people donate 5 boxes each, so they get 10 x 5 = 50 boxes from donations. 
They already have 10 boxes, so they have a total of 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

They can fit 2 boxes per table, and they already have 15 tables. To find out how many more tables they need, we need to divide the total number of boxes by the number of boxes per table.

60 boxes / 2 boxes per table = 30 tables needed in total.

Since they already have 15 tables, they need 30 - 15 = 15 more tables.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the average total distance spat, we need to find the total distance spat by each person and then divide it by the number of seeds they spat.

Zoey spits 40 seeds, each 10 feet, so the total distance spat by Zoey is 40 x 10 = 400 feet.

Sydney spits 35 seeds, each 12 feet, so the total distance spat by Sydney is 35 x 12 = 420 feet.

The total distance spat by both of them is 400 + 420 = 820 feet.

They spat a total of 40 + 35 = 75 seeds.

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the total distance spat by the number of seeds spat: 820 / 75 = 10.93 (rounded to two decimal places).

The final answer is: 10.93"
"To find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the total number of widgets each machine can make in a month and then multiply that by the price of each widget.

First, let's calculate the total number of widgets each machine can make in a month:

Widgeteer 3000: 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets
WidgetMaster 9000: 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money each machine can make in a month:

Widgeteer 3000: 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200
WidgetMaster 9000: 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

Now, let's find the difference in the amount of money each machine can make:

$259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

"To find out how much Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his stay with the 24-hour option and the cost of his stay with the 12-hour option plus the additional hours.

First, let's calculate the cost of the 24-hour stay: 
The cost for 24 hours is 1600 pesos.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the 12-hour stay plus the additional hours. 
Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, so he stays for 17 hours (from 5 pm to 10 am the next day). 
The cost for the first 12 hours is 1000 pesos. 
The cost for the additional 5 hours (17 - 12 = 5) is 5 * 70 = 350 pesos.
So, the total cost for the 12-hour option plus the additional hours is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

Now, let's find out how much money Cameron would save:
Cost of 24-hour stay - Cost of 12-hour stay plus additional hours = 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

The final answer is: $250"
"To find out how much hay Nate needs, we need to calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep separately, and then add them together.

First, let's find out how much hay each sheep needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds, and each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, we can calculate the amount of hay each sheep needs as follows:

Twice the amount each goat needs: 2 * 5 = 10 pounds
3 pounds less than that: 10 - 3 = 7 pounds

Now, let's calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep:

Total hay for goats: 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds
Total hay for sheep: 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds

Now, we add the total hay needed for the goats and the sheep to find the total amount of hay Nate needs:

75 pounds (goats) + 84 pounds (sheep) = 159 pounds

The final answer is: 159"
"To find out how much money John has left after buying gas and depositing money in the bank, we need to subtract the gas money from his total earnings and then subtract the money he deposited in the bank.

John's total earnings = 50 dollars/hour * 6 hours = 300 dollars

After buying gas, he has = 300 - 50 = 250 dollars

After depositing 100 dollars in the bank, he has = 250 - 100 = 150 dollars

Now, let's calculate how much money he has left after buying 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each. 

Cost of 5 pencils = 5 * 10 = 50 dollars

So, after buying pencils, he has = 150 - 50 = 100 dollars

Now, let's find out how many 25 dollar pens he can buy with the remaining money.

Number of pens = Total money / Cost of one pen
= 100 / 25

Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. So, the total number of letters in the words Craig's brother spelled is 300 + 50 = 350.

To find the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds, we add the total number of letters in the words Craig spelled and the total number of letters in the words Craig's brother spelled. 

Total number of letters = 300 + 350 = 650

There are 29 students and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles given to the students is 29 * 2 = 58 bottles.

The teacher has 9 coupons, each redeemable for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles she gets is 9 * 100 = 900 bottles.

Now, we need to subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles the teacher got. 

900 - 58 = 842

So, the teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice left for herself. 

The final answer is: 842"
"To find the total amount Patty charged, we need to calculate the labor cost and add it to the cost of parts and the visit fee.

The labor cost is $35 per hour, and the job took 2.25 hours. Since the labor is charged per hour or part thereof, we need to round up to the nearest hour. However, in this case, we can simply multiply 2.25 hours by $35 per hour to get the labor cost.

Labor cost = 2.25 hours * $35 per hour = $78.75

The cost of parts is $60.

The visit fee is $40.

Now, we add the labor cost, parts cost, and visit fee to get the total amount charged by Patty.

Total amount = Labor cost + Parts cost + Visit fee
Total amount = $78.75 + $60 + $40
Total amount = $178.75

The final answer is: $178.75"
"To find out how much James spent on the CDs, we need to calculate the original price and then subtract the discount. 

First, let's find the original price of the CDs. James bought 10 CDs at $15 each, so the original price is 10 x $15 = $150.

Since James got a 40% discount, we need to find 40% of $150. To do this, we multiply $150 by 0.4 (which is the decimal form of 40%). So, 0.4 x $150 = $60.

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price: $150 - $60 = $90. This is how much James paid for the CDs.

Next, James sold 5 CDs for $40 each. To find out how much he made from selling the CDs, we multiply the number of CDs sold by the price per CD: 5 x $40 = $200.

Now, we need to find out how much money James was out. To do this, we subtract the amount he made from the amount he paid: $90 - $200 = -$110. However, since we can't have a negative amount of money, this means James actually lost money. 

The final answer is: -$110"

"To find the total time it took James to get across the lake, we need to break it down into three parts: the time he spent swimming the first 60% of the distance, the time he rested, and the time he spent swimming the remaining distance.

First, let's find the distance James swam in the first part. 60% of 20 miles is 0.6 x 20 = 12 miles.

Since James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time he spent swimming the first 12 miles is 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours.

The time he rested is half as long as the swimming time, so he rested for 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

The remaining distance is 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles. Since James swims at half the speed, his new speed is 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour. The time he spent swimming the remaining 8 miles is 8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours.

The total time is the sum of the time spent swimming the first 12 miles, the time he rested, and the time spent swimming the remaining 8 miles: 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours.

The final answer is: 17"

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Deanna is 26 years old. Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, so Marcus is 26 - 5 = 21 years old. 

Since Marcus is half of Leo's age, we can set up an equation to find Leo's age: 

Let L be Leo's age. 
Marcus is half of Leo's age, so Marcus = L/2. 
We know Marcus is 21, so L/2 = 21. 
To find L, we multiply both sides by 2: L = 21 * 2. 

L = 42.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Let's say Azibo scored x points. Since Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, Bahati scored x + 20 points. Dinar scored 10 points less than Bahati, so Dinar scored (x + 20) - 10 = x + 10 points.

We know that the total points scored by the three team members is 45. So, we can write the equation: x + (x + 20) + (x + 10) = 45.

Combine like terms: 3x + 30 = 45.

Subtract 30 from both sides: 3x = 15.

Divide both sides by 3: x = 5.

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

"To find the total number of pages in the book, we need to find out how many pages are in 1.5 inches. 

Since there are 100 pages per inch, we multiply 1.5 by 100 to find the total number of pages in 1.5 inches.

1.5 * 100 = 150

So, the book has 150 pages. 

The final answer is: 150"
"To find out how many reports Vince stapled, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he worked and then multiply it by the number of reports he staples per minute.

First, let's find the total number of minutes he worked. He worked from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is a total of 15 hours. 

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we multiply 15 hours by 60 minutes per hour to get the total minutes worked:
15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Now, we know Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many reports he staples per minute, we divide 30 reports by 15 minutes:
30 reports / 15 minutes = 2 reports/minute

Now, we multiply the total minutes worked by the number of reports stapled per minute:
900 minutes * 2 reports/minute = 1800 reports

So, Vince stapled 1800 reports altogether."
"To find out how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m. This means she sleeps for 8 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she sleeps for 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she actually woke up at 5:55 a.m. (6 a.m. - 5 minutes = 5:55 a.m.). This means she went to sleep at 10 p.m. and woke up at 5:55 a.m.

To find the total sleep time, we need to calculate the time difference between 10 p.m. and 5:55 a.m. 
10 p.m. is 12:00 a.m. + 2 hours, so we can convert 10 p.m. to 12:00 a.m. + 2 hours = 2:00 a.m. 
Then, we calculate the time difference between 2:00 a.m. and 5:55 a.m. 
5:55 a.m. - 2:00 a.m. = 3 hours 55 minutes. 
3 hours * 60 minutes = 180 minutes, and 55 minutes is already given. 
So, the total sleep time is 180 + 55 = 235 minutes.

Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. We need to find the time difference between 2:15 a.m. and 2:38 a.m. 
2:38 a.m. - 2:15 a.m. = 23 minutes.

Now, we subtract the time she was sleepwalking from the total sleep time to find out how many minutes she slept on her bed that day.
235 minutes - 23 minutes = 212 minutes.

The final answer is: 212"
"To find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we first need to find out how many measuring spoons he has initially. 

Jonathan has two dozen cups, which is 2 x 12 = 24 cups. 

Since he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, he has (2/3) x 24 = 16 measuring spoons.

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, Jonathan is left with 16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons.

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is the sum of the measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons, which is 24 + 10 = 34.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we need to first find the number of occupied beds and then subtract it from the total capacity.

The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 of them are occupied. 

1/5 of 1000 is 100. So, 100 beds are occupied.

Each day, 50 patients are admitted into the hospital. In 2 weeks, there are 14 days. 

In 14 days, 50 patients are admitted each day, so the total number of patients admitted is 50 * 14 = 700.

Initially, 100 beds were occupied. After 2 weeks, 700 more patients are admitted, so the total number of occupied beds is 100 + 700 = 800.

The total capacity of the hospital is 1000 beds. The number of unoccupied beds is 1000 - 800 = 200.

The final answer is: 200"
"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we need to first find out how many emails are not work-related. 

Robyn sends 16 emails a day, and 7 of them are work emails. So, the number of non-work emails is 16 - 7 = 9.

Two-thirds of the remainder (non-work emails) are to her family. Two-thirds of 9 is (2/3) * 9 = 6. This means 6 emails are to her family.

Now, we need to find out how many emails are left after subtracting the family emails from the non-work emails. 9 - 6 = 3.

One-third of the remaining emails are to her boyfriend. One-third of 3 is (1/3) * 3 = 1.

So, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Aliya is 3 years old. Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, so Shawna is 3 * 3 = 9 years old. 

Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, so Shawna's father is 5 * 9 = 45 years old.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the correct number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number Courtney reported and subtract it from the number she reported.

Let's assume the number Courtney reported is 100%. 
20% of 100 is 20. 

So, the number Kelly said Courtney overstated by 20% is 20. 

Now, we need to subtract 20 from the number Courtney reported to find the correct number of people who attended the concert.

Correct number of people = 48 - 20
Correct number of people = 28

The final answer is: 28"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

- Jason carried 2 balls.
- Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jeffrey carried half of what Jason carried, which is 2 / 2 = 1 ball.
- Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

Now, let's add up the number of balls each boy carried: 1 (Jeffrey) + 2 (Jason) + 4 (Jordan) = 7 balls.

The total number of balls the coach brought to practice is 7. 

The final answer is: 7"
"To find out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to first find out how many holes they had at the end of the third day. 

They dug 10 holes the first day, 13 holes the second day, and 8 holes the third day. So, the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 8 = 31 holes. However, they filled in 2 holes, so the actual number of holes at the end of the third day is 31 - 2 = 29 holes.

The island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, the island had 4 * 10 = 40 holes by the fourth day.

Now, we know that the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 40. We also know that there were 29 holes at the end of the third day. So, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is 40 - 29 = 11 holes.

The final answer is: 11"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and the third person got 15 more than each of them. 

So, the third person got 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

Since Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, the total number of corn chips they got is 2 * 70 = 140.

The total number of corn chips is the sum of what Amora, Lainey, and the third person got. 

Total corn chips = 140 (Amora and Lainey's share) + 85 (the third person's share)
Total corn chips = 225

The final answer is: 225"
"To find the cost of the travel, we need to first find 50% of the cost of the supplies. 

50% of $400 is 0.5 x 400 = $200.

The cost of the travel is 50% more than the supplies, so we add the 50% to the cost of the supplies. 

Cost of travel = cost of supplies + (50% of cost of supplies)
Cost of travel = 400 + 200
Cost of travel = 600

The final answer is: $600"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Let's say Adelwolfe has caught x number of Pokémon. 

Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe, so Stan has caught 4x - 13 Pokémon. 

Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so Alex has caught (4x - 13) + 5 = 4x - 8 Pokémon.

The total number of Pokémon caught by all three is 339, so we can write the equation: x + (4x - 13) + (4x - 8) = 339.

Combine like terms: 9x - 21 = 339.

Add 21 to both sides: 9x = 360.

Divide both sides by 9: x = 40.

Now that we know Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokémon, we can find out how many Stan has caught. Stan has caught 4x - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 Pokémon.

The final answer is: 147"
"Let's break down the information given. Each episode is 20 minutes long, and there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. 

If there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, then the number of episodes is 20 / 2 = 10 episodes.

To find the total time John will spend watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode: 10 episodes * 20 minutes per episode = 200 minutes.

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in the southerly direction and then add it to the distance traveled in the northerly direction.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled in the southerly direction for the first 10 hours at 30 miles per hour:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour x 10 hours
Distance = 300 miles

Then, the bird flies towards the north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour. Since this is in the opposite direction, we subtract this distance from the previous distance:

Distance traveled in the southerly direction = 300 miles
Distance traveled in the northerly direction = 18 miles/hour x 2 hours = 36 miles
Net distance traveled in the southerly direction = 300 miles - 36 miles = 264 miles

Finally, the bird flies towards the south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour. We add this distance to the net distance traveled in the southerly direction:

Net distance traveled in the southerly direction = 264 miles
Distance traveled in the final southerly direction = 22 miles/hour x 5 hours = 110 miles
Total distance = 264 miles + 110 miles = 374 miles

The final answer is: 374"
"To find out how many brownies Greta had left over, we need to calculate the total number of brownies she had and subtract the number of brownies eaten.

Greta made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies for herself. 1 dozen is equal to 12 brownies. 

At her office, they sent her home with 1/2 a dozen brownies. 1/2 a dozen is equal to 6 brownies. 

Her friends had 4 dozen brownies waiting for her at home. 4 dozen is equal to 48 brownies.

So, the total number of brownies Greta had is 12 (from her) + 6 (from the office) + 48 (from her friends) = 66 brownies.

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten. 1 1/2 dozen is equal to 18 brownies.

To find out how many brownies Greta had left over, we need to subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies she had. 

66 (total brownies) - 18 (brownies eaten) = 48

The final answer is: 48"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Nani is 8 years old.
2. His brother is twice his age, so his brother is 8 * 2 = 16 years old.
3. Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of his age. To find her age, we multiply Nani's age by 0.75: 8 * 0.75 = 6 years old.

Now, let's add up the ages of all three family members: 
Nani's age: 8 years
Brother's age: 16 years
Sister's age: 6 years
Total age: 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first 2 phones and the remaining 2 phones. 

The first 2 phones cost $600 each, so the total cost for the first 2 phones is 2 * $600 = $1200.

The remaining 2 phones are half price, so each costs $600 / 2 = $300. The total cost for the remaining 2 phones is 2 * $300 = $600.

The total cost for all 4 phones is $1200 + $600 = $1800.

"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides. 

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
Perimeter = 2 * (15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2 * 25
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2.

Total slats needed = Perimeter * 2
Total slats needed = 50 * 2
Total slats needed = 100

"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we need to first find out how many oranges she had initially and then subtract the oranges she kept and gave away.

Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges, and each box contains 20 oranges. So, the total number of oranges she bought is 12 * 20 = 240 oranges.

She gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes each, which is 2 * 2 = 4 boxes. Since each box contains 20 oranges, she gave away 4 * 20 = 80 oranges.

Now, she kept 1/4 of the oranges. 1/4 of 240 is 240 / 4 = 60 oranges.

So, the total number of oranges she had left after giving some to her mom and sister is 240 - 80 = 160 oranges.

Since she kept 60 oranges, she sold 160 - 60 = 100 oranges.

"Let's break down the information given. We know that Robert has 30 cherries and he has 10 more than Richard. So, Richard must have 30 - 10 = 20 cherries.

We also know that the total number of cherries is 60. Since Robert and Richard have 30 and 20 cherries respectively, the number of cherries Jerry has can be found by subtracting the total number of cherries Robert and Richard have from the total number of cherries. 

So, 60 - 30 - 20 = 10 cherries. 

Now, we need to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry. Robert has 30 cherries and Jerry has 10 cherries. 

The difference between the number of cherries Robert and Jerry have is 30 - 10 = 20.

"Let's break down the information given:

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread. 
On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday.

On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. 
On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie. 
So, on Saturday, he sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each day:

On Saturday, he sold 10 boxes of gingerbread at $6 each, so he earned 10 x 6 = $60 from gingerbread. 
He sold 11 boxes of apple pie at $15 each, so he earned 11 x 15 = $165 from apple pie. 
Total earnings on Saturday = $60 + $165 = $225.

On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of gingerbread at $6 each, so he earned 15 x 6 = $90 from gingerbread. 
He sold 15 boxes of apple pie at $15 each, so he earned 15 x 15 = $225 from apple pie. 
Total earnings on Sunday = $90 + $225 = $315.

Total earnings for two days = $225 + $315 = $540.

First, let's find 40% of the price of the blue car. 
40% of $100 = 0.4 x $100 = $40

Now, subtract $40 from the price of the blue car to find the price of the red car.
Price of the red car = Price of the blue car - 40% of the price of the blue car
Price of the red car = $100 - $40
Price of the red car = $60

So, the price of the red car is $60.

The price of the blue car is $100.
The price of the red car is $60."
"Let's break down the information given. 

Emil is 19 years old now. When he turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad and twice as old as his brother. 

Let's denote Emil's age when he turns 24 as E, his dad's age as D, and his brother's age as B. 

We know that E = 24. 

Since Emil will be half the age of his dad when he turns 24, we can write the equation: E = 0.5D. 

Substituting E = 24, we get 24 = 0.5D. 

Solving for D, we get D = 24 / 0.5 = 48. 

Since Emil will be twice as old as his brother when he turns 24, we can write the equation: E = 2B. 

Substituting E = 24, we get 24 = 2B. 

Solving for B, we get B = 24 / 2 = 12. 

Now, we know Emil's dad is 48 years old and his brother is 12 years old. 

To find the sum of their ages, we add D and B: 48 + 12 = 60.

First, let's find out how many students are football players. 20% of 30 students are football players. 

20% of 30 = 0.2 x 30 = 6 students are football players.

Now, let's find out how many students are not football players. 
30 - 6 = 24 students are not football players.

Out of these 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. 

25% of 24 = 0.25 x 24 = 6 students are cheerleaders or part of the band.

"To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to first convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches because the width of the plants is given in inches. 

1 foot is equal to 12 inches. So, 111 feet is equal to 111 x 12 = 1332 inches.

Now, we need to find out how much space each plant will occupy in total, including the space between them. Each plant occupies 12 inches, and there's 1.5 feet (18 inches) between each plant. So, the total space each plant occupies is 12 + 18 = 30 inches.

Now, we can divide the total length of the flower bed by the total space each plant occupies to find out how many plants can fit in the flower bed.

1332 / 30 = 44.4

Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we'll round down to 44 plants.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 44 - 17 = 27 more flowers.

Each flower costs $6, so the total amount Pat will spend at the store is 27 x 6 = $162.

"To find out how much Katherine will spend, we need to calculate the cost of the petunias and the sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the petunias. Each basket will have 3 petunias, and there are 5 baskets. So, the total number of petunias is 3 * 5 = 15. The cost of each petunia is $3.00, so the total cost of the petunias is 15 * $3.00 = $45.00.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the sweet potato vines. Each basket will have 2 sweet potato vines, and there are 5 baskets. So, the total number of sweet potato vines is 2 * 5 = 10. The cost of each sweet potato vine is $2.50, so the total cost of the sweet potato vines is 10 * $2.50 = $25.00.

Now, we add the cost of the petunias and the sweet potato vines together to find the total cost. $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00.

4 sunflowers need 4 x 3 = 12 pounds of soil. 
10 carnations need 10 x 1.5 = 15 pounds of soil. 

So, the total soil used for sunflowers and carnations is 12 + 15 = 27 pounds. 

Now, we subtract the used soil from the total soil to find out how much is left for roses. 
30 - 27 = 3 pounds.

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, they can plant 3 roses with the remaining soil.

"To find out how many shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we need to first calculate how much money she saves each month for shoes. 

Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month and sets 25% of her paycheck aside for shoes. To find 25% of $2,000.00, we multiply $2,000.00 by 0.25 (since 25% is the same as 0.25).

$2,000.00 * 0.25 = $500.00

So, Jessica saves $500.00 each month for shoes.

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the amount she saves each month by 12 to find out how much she saves in a year.

$500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00

Now, we need to find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy with $6,000.00. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00.

First, let's find out how many shrimp Emily can peel and cook in one minute. She can peel 6 shrimp a minute and saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. So, in one minute, she can saute 3 shrimp (30 shrimp / 10 minutes = 3 shrimp per minute). 

Now, let's find out how many shrimp Emily can peel and cook in one minute. She can peel 6 shrimp a minute and saute 3 shrimp a minute. So, in one minute, she can peel and cook 9 shrimp (6 shrimp + 3 shrimp = 9 shrimp per minute).

Now, let's find out how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp. We can divide 90 shrimp by the number of shrimp she can peel and cook in one minute, which is 9 shrimp. 

90 shrimp / 9 shrimp per minute = 10 minutes.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the final temperature, we need to calculate the total change in temperature. 

First, let's calculate the change in temperature when the air conditioner is on low for 3 hours: 
- The air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees an hour on low. 
- So, in 3 hours, it cools the room 2 * 3 = 6 degrees.

Next, let's calculate the change in temperature when the air conditioner is on high for 4 hours: 
- The air conditioner cools the room 3 degrees an hour on high. 
- So, in 4 hours, it cools the room 3 * 4 = 12 degrees.

Now, let's calculate the change in temperature when the air conditioner is turned off for 2 hours: 
- The room warms up 2 degrees an hour when the air conditioner is off. 
- So, in 2 hours, it warms up 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

Now, let's add up all the changes in temperature: 
- The room cools 6 degrees when the air conditioner is on low for 3 hours.
- The room cools 12 degrees when the air conditioner is on high for 4 hours.
- The room warms up 4 degrees when the air conditioner is off for 2 hours.

Total change in temperature = 6 - 12 + 4 = -2 degrees.

So, the final temperature is 2 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how old Bill's dad was when he saw the comet and then use that information to find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet.

Let's start by finding out how old Bill's dad was when he saw the comet. We know that the comet orbits the sun every 75 years and Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. 

Since the comet orbits every 75 years, we can assume that the time Bill's dad saw the comet is a multiple of 75 years. Let's call the number of times the comet orbited the sun since Bill's dad saw it ""x"". Then, the time Bill's dad saw the comet is 75x years ago.

We know that Bill's dad was 30 years old when he saw the comet, so we can set up the equation:

75x - 30 = 30 (since 75x years ago, Bill's dad was 30 years old)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

75x = 60

Dividing both sides by 75, we get:

x = 60/75
x = 0.8

Since x is the number of times the comet orbited the sun since Bill's dad saw it, we can multiply it by 75 to find the time Bill's dad saw the comet:

Time Bill's dad saw the comet = 0.8 * 75
Time Bill's dad saw the comet = 60 years ago

Now, we know that Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. We also know that the comet orbits every 75 years, so the time between Bill's two sightings of the comet is 75 years.

Let's call the time Bill's dad saw the comet ""t"". Then, the time Bill saw the comet for the second time is t + 75.

We know that Bill was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet for the second time, so we can set up the equation:

Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time = 3 * Bill's dad's age when he saw the comet

We know that Bill's dad was 30 years old when he saw the comet, so we can substitute that into the equation:

Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time = 3 * 30
Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time = 90

We also know that the time between Bill's two sightings of the comet is 75 years, so we can set up the equation:

t + 75 = 90

Subtracting 75 from both sides, we get:

t = 15

Now that we know the time Bill's dad saw the comet, we can find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time. We know that the comet orbits every 75 years, so the time between Bill's two sightings of the comet is 75 years. We also know that the time Bill's dad saw the comet is 60 years ago, so the time Bill saw the comet for the first time is 60 - 75 = -15 years ago.

However, this is not possible, since Bill was born after his dad saw the comet. This means that the time Bill's dad saw the comet is not 60 years ago, but rather 60 + 75 = 135 years ago.

Now, we can find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time. We know that the time between Bill's two sightings of the comet is 75 years, so the time Bill saw the comet for the first time is 135 - 75 = 60 years ago.

We also know that Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. We know that Bill's dad was 30 years old when he saw the comet, so we can set up the equation:

Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time = (1/3) * Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time

We know that Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time, so we can substitute that into the equation:

Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time = (1/3) * 90
Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how many checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the total number of checks he writes in a year.

Buford writes a check once per month for the electric bill, so that's 12 checks per year.
He also writes a check every month for the gas bill, which is another 12 checks per year.
He writes a check twice per month to the church, so that's 2 * 12 = 24 checks per year.
He writes a check quarterly to the pest and lawn service, which means 4 times a year. 

Now, let's add up all the checks: 
12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn service) = 52 checks per year.

The final answer is: 52"
"To find the number of flights to France, we need to first find the total number of flights made by the first plane. 

Let's denote the total number of flights made by the first plane as 'x'. Since the second plane makes 44 flights, which is half the number of flights made by the first plane, the first plane makes 2 * 44 = 88 flights.

Now, we know that the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so the number of flights to Greece is (3/4) * 88 = 66. The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of flights to France is (1/2) * (88 - 66) = (1/2) * 22 = 11.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to find out how long each wolf howls and then add them up.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. 
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 x 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we add up the time each wolf howls: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: 2"
"Let's break down the information given. Adam's mother gave him $6, and his father gave him twice as much as his mother. 

Since his father gave him twice as much as his mother, we can calculate the amount his father gave him by multiplying the amount his mother gave him by 2. 

Father's contribution = 2 * Mother's contribution
Father's contribution = 2 * $6
Father's contribution = $12

Now, we know that Adam bought the trousers for $30. We also know that his mother gave him $6 and his father gave him $12. 

Total amount given by parents = Mother's contribution + Father's contribution
Total amount given by parents = $6 + $12
Total amount given by parents = $18

To find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount given by his parents from the cost of the trousers.

Amount from savings = Cost of trousers - Total amount given by parents
Amount from savings = $30 - $18
Amount from savings = $12

The final answer is: $12"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote the age of Wilfred as 'W'. Since Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group, we can represent Helene's age as 2 * (average age of the group).

The total age of the children is 20, and we know the ages of Akbar and Alessandro. So, we can write the equation:

Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age + Wilfred's age = Total age of the group
3 + 4 + 2 * (average age of the group) + W = 20

We also know that the average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children. Since there are 4 children, the average age of the group is 20 / 4 = 5.

Now, we can substitute the average age of the group into the equation:

3 + 4 + 2 * 5 + W = 20
7 + 10 + W = 20
17 + W = 20

To find the age of Wilfred, we need to isolate W. We can do this by subtracting 17 from both sides of the equation:

W = 20 - 17
W = 3

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how much Walter's lawyer is going to contribute, we need to first find out the total amount of money Walter has collected from his neighbors and the online fund. 

Walter collected $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. 

Total amount collected so far = $500 + $1500 = $2000

Walter's friend gives him $200, but this is not included in the amount that Walter's lawyer will donate based on. 

Walter's lawyer will donate three times as much as everyone else donates. Everyone else donates $500 + $1500 = $2000. 

So, Walter's lawyer will donate 3 * $2000 = $6000.

The final answer is: $6000"
"To find out how many cookies were given to the church, we need to first find out the total number of cookies. Since each guest brought 15 cookies and there were 100 guests, the total number of cookies is 100 * 15 = 1500.

The bride gave 1/2 of the cookies to the church, so the number of cookies given to the church is 1500 / 2 = 750.

Since each person in the church got 15 cookies, we can find the number of people in the church by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person got. 

Number of people in the church = Total cookies given to the church / Cookies per person
= 750 / 15
= 50

"Let's say the total number of slices the watermelon is divided into is 'x'. Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices the adults get is 2, and the total number of slices the kids get is 4.

Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid, let's say the number of slices each kid gets is 'y'. Then, the number of slices each adult gets is 2y.

The total number of slices the kids get is 4y, and the total number of slices the adults get is 2 * 2y = 4y.

Since the total number of slices is 'x', we can set up the equation: 4y + 4y = x.

Combining like terms, we get 8y = x.

Now, we know that the adults get 4y slices, and the total number of slices is x. To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to divide the number of slices the adults get by the total number of slices and multiply by 100.

So, the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets is (4y / x) * 100.

Since 8y = x, we can substitute x with 8y in the equation: (4y / 8y) * 100.

Simplifying the equation, we get (1/2) * 100 = 50.

So, each adult gets 50% of the watermelon.

"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones has left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time he spends on rounds and appointments, and then subtract that from the total hours he works.

First, let's calculate the time spent on rounds. He has 9 inpatients and each round takes 20 minutes. 

9 inpatients * 20 minutes/inpatient = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 180 minutes to hours by dividing by 60.

180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours

Next, let's calculate the time spent on appointments. He has 10 appointments and each appointment takes 30 minutes.

10 appointments * 30 minutes/appointment = 300 minutes

Converting 300 minutes to hours:

300 minutes / 60 = 5 hours

Now, let's add the time spent on rounds and appointments to get the total time spent.

3 hours (rounds) + 5 hours (appointments) = 8 hours

Since Doctor Jones works 9 hours, we subtract the total time spent from the total hours worked to find the time left for updating records.

9 hours (total hours worked) - 8 hours (time spent) = 1 hour

"To find the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake. 

First, let's add the time it takes to make the cake batter and bake the cake: 20 minutes + 30 minutes = 50 minutes.

Next, we add the time it takes to cool the cake: 50 minutes + 2 hours = 50 minutes + 120 minutes = 170 minutes.

Now, we convert 2 hours to minutes to make it easier to add the remaining time: 2 hours = 120 minutes.

Now, we add the time it takes to frost the cake: 170 minutes + 10 minutes = 180 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 180 minutes to hours and minutes: 180 minutes = 3 hours.

Now, we add the total time to the serving time: 3 hours + 5:00 pm = 8:00 pm.

So, Jordan should start making the cake by 8:00 am to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm.

The final answer is 8:00 am."
"Let's break down the information given. Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. Together, they sold 64 chocolate bars. 

To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we need to add the number of boxes Lisa and Peter sold and then divide the total number of chocolate bars sold by the total number of boxes sold.

First, let's add the number of boxes sold by Lisa and Peter: 3.5 + 4.5 = 8

Now, we know that together they sold 64 chocolate bars in 8 boxes. To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we'll divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes: 64 / 8 = 8

The number of chocolate bars in a box is 8."
"To find the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the total cost of the students per session, then multiply it by the number of sessions in a month.

The studio is rented 3 days a week, so that's 3 sessions per week. There are 4 weeks in a month, so the total number of sessions in a month is 3 sessions/week * 4 weeks/month = 12 sessions/month.

The cost to rent the studio per session is $25. So, the total cost to rent the studio per month is $25/session * 12 sessions/month = $300/month.

The cost per student per session is $1.50. With 10 students, the total cost per session is $1.50/student * 10 students = $15/session.

The total cost per session is the sum of the studio rental and the student cost, which is $25 + $15 = $40/session.

The total earnings per month is the total cost per session multiplied by the number of sessions in a month, which is $40/session * 12 sessions/month = $480/month.

The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is $480."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box for Peter and Martha, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars they have by the number of boxes they have.

Peter has 64 chocolate bars in 4 boxes, so we divide 64 by 4 to get the number of chocolate bars in each box: 64 / 4 = 16.

Martha has 56 chocolate bars in 7 boxes, so we divide 56 by 7 to get the number of chocolate bars in each box: 56 / 7 = 8.

Now, we need to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha. To do this, we subtract the number of chocolate bars Martha has in each box from the number of chocolate bars Peter has in each box: 16 - 8 = 8.

"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the width, length, and depth of the pool. 

Volume = width * length * depth
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company needs to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the gallons of water needed, we do that next.

Gallons = Volume * 5.9
Gallons = 1400 * 5.9
Gallons = 8260 gallons

Now, we need to find the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon, so we multiply the gallons by the cost per gallon.

Cost = Gallons * cost per gallon
Cost = 8260 * 0.10
Cost = 826

"To find the number of female students, we need to first find the number of students over 16 and under 16, then find the number of male students in each group, and finally subtract the total number of male students from the total number of students.

First, let's find the number of students over 16: 
Half of the students are over 16, so 3000 / 2 = 1500 students are over 16.

Next, let's find the number of male students over 16: 
One-fourth of the students over 16 are male, so 1500 / 4 = 375 male students are over 16.

Now, let's find the number of female students over 16: 
1500 - 375 = 1125 female students are over 16.

Next, let's find the number of students under 16: 
The remaining half of the students are under 16, so 3000 / 2 = 1500 students are under 16.

Next, let's find the number of male students under 16: 
Half of the students under 16 are male, so 1500 / 2 = 750 male students are under 16.

Now, let's find the number of female students under 16: 
1500 - 750 = 750 female students are under 16.

Finally, let's find the total number of female students:

"To find out how many laps each person can run, we need to follow the given information step by step.

Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.

Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.

Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.

Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we need to subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run. 

Bethany can run 10 laps and Quinn can run 5 laps, so Bethany can run 10 - 5 = 5 more laps compared to Quinn.

"To find out how much water is remaining in the tank, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank and subtract it from the tank's capacity.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped into the tank is 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 12000 gallons.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the first part where the power bank loses 9% of its capacity per hour for 5 hours, and the second part where it loses 7% of its capacity per hour for 3 hours.

Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is x%. 

In the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining will be x - (9% of x) * 5 = x - 0.45x = 0.55x.

Now, in the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining will be 0.55x - (7% of 0.55x) * 3 = 0.55x - 0.21x = 0.34x.

We are given that the final charge remaining is 28%. So, we can set up the equation 0.34x = 28.

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.34: x = 28 / 0.34 = 82.35.

Now, we need to find out how much Janet needs to save for the down payment. She wants to save 20% of the cost of a $10000 car, so she needs to save 0.2 * $10000 = $2000.

To find out how many weeks she needs to work, we divide the amount she needs to save ($2000) by her weekly earnings ($1000). 

$2000 / $1000 = 2

So, Janet needs to work 2 weeks to save the down payment.

2 kiwis at $1 each will be 2 x $1 = $2
5 apples at $0.75 each will be 5 x $0.75 = $3.75

Adding these costs together, we get $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9

Jamaar started with $10, so he has $10 - $9 = $1 left.

Since plums cost $0.25 each, we can divide the remaining money by the cost of a plum to find out how many plums he can buy: $1 / $0.25 = 4

"To find out how many pieces of sweets each friend received, we need to first find out how many packs Anne gave to her friends. 

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, so she gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs to her friends.

Since she gave the packs equally to 10 friends, we need to divide the total number of packs given away by the number of friends. 

13 packs / 10 friends = 1.3 packs per friend.

Since each pack has 60 pieces, we multiply the number of packs each friend received by the number of pieces in each pack.

1.3 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 78 pieces.

So, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets.

"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the increase in price each year and add it to the original price.

Year 1: 
Original price = $120
Increase in price = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Original price = $126
Increase in price = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Original price = $132.30
Increase in price = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139."
"Let's break down the information given. Olivia put the same number of pictures into 8 albums. This means each album has 72 / 8 = 9 pictures.

We know that 3 albums were selfies only and 2 albums were portraits. Since the total number of albums is 8, the remaining 3 albums must be a mix of both selfies and portraits. However, we don't have any information about the mix of selfies and portraits in these 3 albums.

Since we know that 3 albums were selfies only and each album has 9 pictures, the total number of selfies is 3 * 9 = 27.

Initially, the hotel had 100 guests.

24 guests checked out early, so the number of guests left is 100 - 24 = 76.

15 guests checked out late, but this doesn't change the number of guests left since they were already counted in the initial 100.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout, which is 2 * 15 = 30.

So, the total number of guests after the afternoon check-ins is 76 + 30 = 106.

After dinner, 7 more people checked in, making the total number of guests 106 + 7 = 113.

The final answer is: 113"

On Wednesday, John picked 4 bananas. 
On Thursday, John picked 6 bananas. 
On Friday, John picked triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 bananas.

Now, let's add up the bananas: 4 + 6 + 12 = 22

John has 22 bananas."
"To find out how many points Aries is sure to get, we need to calculate the number of questions she will get right in each category and then add them up.

First, let's find out how many easy, average, and difficult questions there are in the quiz. 

40% of 60 questions are easy, so the number of easy questions is 0.4 x 60 = 24 questions.

The rest of the questions are equally divided between average and difficult, so there are 60 - 24 = 36 questions left. 

Divide the remaining questions by 2 to find the number of average and difficult questions: 36 / 2 = 18 questions each.

Now, let's calculate how many questions Aries will get right in each category. 

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, so she will get 0.75 x 24 = 18 easy questions right.

She will get half of the average questions right, so she will get 18 / 2 = 9 average questions right.

She will also get half of the difficult questions right, so she will get 18 / 2 = 9 difficult questions right.

Now, let's add up the number of questions Aries will get right: 18 (easy) + 9 (average) + 9 (difficult) = 36.

The final answer is: 36"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say the number of large stuffed animals sold is L and the number of small stuffed animals sold is S. We know that S = 2L (since she sold twice as many small ones as large ones).

We also know that the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 times the price of a small one. Since each small stuffed animal costs $4, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.

The total amount earned from the sales is $120. We can set up an equation to represent this:

Price of large stuffed animals + Price of small stuffed animals = Total amount earned
(Price of large stuffed animals) * L + (Price of small stuffed animals) * S = $120
($12) * L + ($4) * S = $120

Since S = 2L, we can substitute this into the equation:
($12) * L + ($4) * (2L) = $120
($12) * L + ($8) * L = $120
($20) * L = $120

Now, we can solve for L:
L = $120 / $20
L = 6

Since S = 2L, we can find the number of small stuffed animals sold:
S = 2 * 6
S = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find out how many sandwiches the family eats in one week, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches they eat per day and then multiply it by 7.

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, the wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and the son eats 2 sandwiches per day. 

Total sandwiches eaten per day = 5 (man) + 4 (wife) + 2 (son) = 11 sandwiches per day.

Now, we multiply the total sandwiches eaten per day by 7 to find out the total sandwiches eaten in a week.

Total sandwiches eaten in a week = 11 sandwiches per day * 7 days = 77 sandwiches.

"To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we need to calculate her total earnings and then subtract the money she gave to her sisters.

First, let's calculate her earnings from selling cookies: 
80 cookies * $1 each = $80

Next, let's calculate her earnings from selling cupcakes: 
60 cupcakes * $4 each = $240

Now, let's add her earnings from cookies and cupcakes: 
$80 + $240 = $320

Suzanne gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave a total of: 
2 * $10 = $20

Now, let's subtract the money she gave to her sisters from her total earnings: 
$320 - $20 = $300

"To find out how many eggs the friends found, we need to subtract the number of eggs the Smith twins found from the total number of eggs, and then subtract the 10 eggs that were not found by the friends.

The Smith twins found 30 eggs each, so together they found 30 x 2 = 60 eggs.

The total number of eggs is 100. 

So, 100 - 60 = 40 eggs were found by the friends and the 10 that were not found by the friends. 

To find out how many eggs the friends found, we need to subtract 10 from 40. 

40 - 10 = 30

The friends found 30 eggs.

"To find out how much ore 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month, we need to first find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe in a day.

One dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. He can mine twice as much with an iron pickaxe, so he can mine 12 * 2 = 24 pounds of ore per day with an iron pickaxe. 

With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe. 50% of 24 pounds is 0.5 * 24 = 12 pounds. So, he can mine 24 + 12 = 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe.

Now, we know that one dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe. To find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day, we multiply 36 pounds by 40: 36 * 40 = 1440 pounds.

Since there are 30 days in a month, we multiply 1440 pounds by 30 to find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month: 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds.

The final answer is: 43200"
"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to find the ratio of the price to the number of sandwiches for the first two packages. 

The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3, so the price per sandwich is $3 / 2 = $1.5 per sandwich. 

The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6, so the price per sandwich is $6 / 4 = $1.5 per sandwich. 

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is the same for all packages. 

Now, we can find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches by multiplying the price per sandwich by the number of sandwiches: $1.5 * 8 = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To find out how much Tom has to pay per month, we need to subtract the amount he got from selling his old bedroom set from the total cost of the bedroom set.

Total cost of the bedroom set = $3000
Amount he got from selling his old bedroom set = $1000

Amount left to pay = Total cost of the bedroom set - Amount he got from selling his old bedroom set
Amount left to pay = $3000 - $1000
Amount left to pay = $2000

Now, we need to find 10% of $2000 to determine the monthly payment.

10% of $2000 = 0.1 x $2000
10% of $2000 = $200

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month. 

The final answer is: $200"
"To find the number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons after each event.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

First, 40% of the red balloons burst. 40% of 25 is 0.4 x 25 = 10. So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

Next, Sally released half of the yellow balloons. Half of 12 is 6, so she released 6 yellow balloons, leaving 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.

Then, she found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch. 75% of 8 is 0.75 x 8 = 6. So, she added 6 blue balloons to her clutch.

Now, let's add up the remaining balloons: 15 red balloons, 7 green balloons, 6 yellow balloons, and 6 blue balloons. 

15 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 34

"To find the chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to find the probability that he won't get an extension. 

First, let's find the probability that the substitute teacher won't collect the homework. This is given as 50%. 

Now, let's find the probability that the normal teacher will come in and not give an extension. This is 60% (100% - 40%). 

Now, let's find the probability that the normal teacher will come in and Marcus will not get a personal extension. This is 60% * 80% = 48%.

Now, let's find the total probability that Marcus won't get an extension. This is 50% + 48% = 98%.

The chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is 100% - 98% = 2%.

"To find out how many tickets each graduate can get, we need to first find out how many seats are left after the graduates and faculty have taken their seats. 

Total seats in the Fine Arts Center = 6000
Seats taken by graduates = 950
Seats taken by faculty = 300
Total seats taken = 950 + 300 = 1250

Now, we subtract the total seats taken from the total seats in the Fine Arts Center to find out how many seats are left for the graduates' friends and family.

Seats left = 6000 - 1250 = 4750

Since there are 950 graduates, we need to divide the remaining seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate can get.

Tickets per graduate = 4750 / 950
Tickets per graduate = 5

"Let's break down the information given:

- It takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up.
- He can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans. This means he can eat 2 * 75 = 150 medium-sized beans.
- Eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. This means 1 medium-sized bean is equal to 3 small beans.

Now, let's find out how many small beans Grandpa can eat. Since 1 medium-sized bean is equal to 3 small beans, we can multiply the number of medium-sized beans he can eat by 3.

150 medium-sized beans * 3 small beans/medium-sized bean = 450 small beans

"To find out how much Melissa makes per hour after expenses, we need to first calculate her total earnings and total expenses. 

Melissa spends 6 hours a day for 3 days, so her total hours are 6 * 3 = 18 hours. 

Her total earnings are $15 per day for 3 days, so her total earnings are 15 * 3 = $45.

Her total expenses are $3 per day for 3 days, so her total expenses are 3 * 3 = $9.

Now, we need to find out how much she makes per hour after expenses. To do this, we need to divide her total earnings by her total hours and then subtract her total expenses from that amount.

First, let's find out how much she makes per hour before expenses: 45 / 18 = $2.50 per hour.

Now, let's subtract her total expenses from her hourly earnings: $2.50 - $9 / 18 = $2.50 - $0.50 = $2.

"To find out how many seconds it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to find out how many soda bottles he can place along the driveway and then multiply that by the time it takes to go from one bottle to the next.

First, let's find out how many bottles Richard can place along the driveway. The driveway is 24 feet wide, and he wants to put a bottle every 3 feet. 

To find the number of bottles, we divide the total width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle: 
24 feet / 3 feet = 8 bottles

Since it takes 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, we multiply the number of bottles by the time it takes to go from one bottle to the next:
8 bottles * 5 seconds = 40 seconds

So, it will take Richard 40 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim lost while in college. 

First, let's find out how much money he lost from not working while in school. He had a $25,000 a year job and he was in college for 4 years. 

Money lost from not working = $25,000 * 4 = $100,000

Next, let's find out how much money he borrowed in total. He borrowed $50,000 per year for 4 years.

Total loans = $50,000 * 4 = $200,000

Now, let's find out how much money he earned after college. His college degree tripled his income, so he earned $25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year.

To find out how long it would take him to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working, we need to find the total amount of money he needs to earn.

Total amount to earn = Money lost from not working + Total loans
Total amount to earn = $100,000 + $200,000
Total amount to earn = $300,000

Now, let's divide the total amount to earn by his new income to find out how many years it will take him to earn the money.

Years to earn = Total amount to earn / New income
Years to earn = $300,000 / $75,000
Years to earn = 4

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. 
One-fifth of 425 is 425 / 5 = 85. 
So, they delivered 85 + 17 = 102 letters on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. 
Twice as many as Tuesday is 102 * 2 = 204. 
So, they delivered 204 + 5 = 209 letters on Wednesday.

Now, let's add up the number of letters delivered each day: 
425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736

The total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $101."
"To find the average amount Johnny's dad lost, we need to find the total amount he lost and divide it by the number of races.

On the first race, he lost $5.

On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. He lost $5, so twice that is 2 * $5 = $10. $1 more than that is $10 + $1 = $11. But since he won, we add this to the total loss, not subtract. So, his total loss is still $5.

On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. He won $11 in the second race, so 1.5 times that is 1.5 * $11 = $16.50. We add this to the total loss, so his total loss is $5 + $16.50 = $21.50.

There were 3 races, so to find the average, we divide the total loss by 3: $21.50 / 3 = $7.17.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let's say the amount the first person took is x. 

The second person took $80 more than the first, so the second person took x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person took 2(x + 80).

The total amount they divided is $1920. We can write an equation to represent this:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920

Combine like terms again:

4x + 240 = 1920

Subtract 240 from both sides:

4x = 1680

"To find the total hours each painter worked, we need to calculate the total hours they worked in 3 weeks and then divide it by the number of painters.

First, let's find the total hours in 3 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks have 3 x 7 = 21 days.

Since the painters worked 3/8ths of a day every day, we need to find 3/8ths of 21 days. 

To do this, we multiply 21 by 3/8. To multiply a fraction by a whole number, we multiply the numerator (3) by the whole number (21) and keep the denominator (8) the same. 

So, (3 x 21) / 8 = 63 / 8.

Now, we need to convert 63/8 into hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so we multiply 24 by 3/8.

(3 x 24) / 8 = 72 / 8 = 9 hours.

Now, we know that each painter worked 9 hours in 3 weeks. 

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4 to find the hours each painter worked.

9 hours / 4 = 2.25 hours.

The final answer is: 2.25"
"Let's break down the information given. 

Let's say the number of balls retrieved in the second set is x. 

In the first set, Rory retrieved x + 4 balls. 
In the third set, he retrieved x / 2 balls. 

The total number of balls retrieved is 19. So, we can write the equation: x + (x + 4) + (x / 2) = 19.

To solve for x, we need to get rid of the fraction. Multiply the whole equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38.

Now, simplify the equation: 2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38.

Combine like terms: 5x + 8 = 38.

Subtract 8 from both sides: 5x = 30.

Divide both sides by 5: x = 6.

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set: x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10.

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation of the car from 2007 to 2010.

The car was bought in 2007 for $20,000. 

The price of the car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year. 

First, we need to find the price of the car in 2008. 
Depreciation in 2008 = 21% of $20,000 = 0.21 * $20,000 = $4,200
Price in 2008 = $20,000 - $4,200 = $15,800

Next, we need to find the price of the car in 2009. 
Depreciation in 2009 = 21% of $15,800 = 0.21 * $15,800 = $3,318
Price in 2009 = $15,800 - $3,318 = $12,482

Finally, we need to find the price of the car in 2010. 
Depreciation in 2010 = 21% of $12,482 = 0.21 * $12,482 = $2,623.62
Price in 2010 = $12,482 - $2,623.62 = $9,858.38

The price of the car in 2010 is $9,858.38."

"To find the total cost of renovating your kitchen floor, we need to find the total number of tiles required and multiply it by the cost of each tile.

First, we need to find the area of one tile. Since each tile is a square with a side length of 1 ft, the area of one tile is 1 ft * 1 ft = 1 SqFt.

Now, we need to find the total number of tiles required to cover the kitchen floor. We can do this by dividing the total area of the kitchen floor (200 SqFt) by the area of one tile (1 SqFt).

Total number of tiles = Total area of kitchen floor / Area of one tile
Total number of tiles = 200 SqFt / 1 SqFt
Total number of tiles = 200

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the total number of tiles by the cost of each tile ($12).

The normal cost is $120 a month. Since it was 60% more than normal, we need to calculate 60% of $120 and add it to the normal cost.

60% of $120 is 0.6 x $120 = $72. 

So, the cost after the accident is $120 + $72 = $192.

To find out how much James pays a year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12.

$192 x 12 = $2304.

The final answer is: $2304"
"To find out how many loads of laundry Greg does in a week, we need to calculate the total number of sheets he puts on the beds and divide it by the number of sheets he can wash at a time.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. Since a twin bed has 1 set of sheets and a king size bed has 1 set of sheets, the total number of sheets he puts on the beds is 4 + 1 = 5.

Since he can wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 2 and 1, which is 2. This means he can wash 2 twin sets of sheets and 1 king set of sheets at a time.

So, the total number of loads of laundry he does in a week is 5 / 2 = 2.5. However, since we can't have half a load of laundry, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Greg does 3 loads of laundry in a week.

To find out how many loads of laundry he does in a year, we multiply the number of loads he does in a week by the number of weeks in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total number of loads of laundry he does in a year is 3 * 52 = 156.

The final answer is: 156"
"To find out how many movies Jill and her friends can watch in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of movies they watch in one week and then multiply it by 4.

They watch 4 movies every Saturday. On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies as on Saturday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies.

So, in one week, they watch 4 + 2 = 6 movies.

To find the total number of movies they can watch in 4 weeks, we multiply 6 by 4: 6 * 4 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find out how many stickers Leo has now, we need to add the stickers he had two years ago, the stickers he collected last year, and the stickers he collected this year.

Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers. 
Last year, he collected 50 stickers. 
This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which is 2 * 50 = 100 stickers.

Now, let's add all the stickers together: 100 (initial stickers) + 50 (last year's stickers) + 100 (this year's stickers) = 250 stickers.

The final answer is: 250"
"To find out how many days the cat food will last, we need to divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the amount of cat food Imma feeds her cats each day (60 grams).

First, let's calculate the total amount of cat food Imma feeds her cats per day: 3 cats * 60 grams/cat = 180 grams/day.

Now, let's divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the daily amount (180 grams): 720 grams / 180 grams/day = 4 days.

The final answer is: 4"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we know that Becky ate 10 slices. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake did, Jake must have eaten 10 - 3 = 7 slices.

We also know that Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake did. So, Silvia ate 2 * 7 = 14 slices.

Now, let's find the total number of slices eaten by all three. We know that each pizza had 8 slices and there were 4 pizzas. So, the total number of slices is 4 * 8 = 32.

However, we already know that Becky, Jake, and Silvia ate 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 slices. But we also know that there are 32 slices in total. This means that 32 - 31 = 1 slice is left uneaten.

But the question asks for the total number of slices they ate, not the total number of slices. So, we don't need to consider the uneaten slice.

The total number of slices they ate is 31.

31"
"Let's say Donovan's part took x minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, Betsy's part took x + 18 minutes. 

The total time taken to make the meal is the sum of their individual times, which is 98 minutes. So, we can write the equation: x + (x + 18) = 98.

Combine like terms: 2x + 18 = 98.

Subtract 18 from both sides: 2x = 80.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 40.

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer, Betsy's part took 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

The final answer is: 58"
"To find the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to calculate the cost of the cast, the visit, the painkillers, and the parking.

The cost of the cast is $200.

The cost of the visit is $300/hour for 0.5 hours (since it's a 30-minute visit). So, the cost of the visit is $300 * 0.5 = $150.

The cost of the painkillers is $4/pill for 30 pills. So, the cost of the painkillers is $4 * 30 = $120.

The cost of parking is $6/hour for 2 hours. So, the cost of parking is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, let's add up the costs: $200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482.

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"To find out how many emails James responds to, we need to first find out how many emails he doesn't respond to. 

20% of 80 emails is 0.2 x 80 = 16 emails. 

So, James doesn't respond to 16 emails. 

The rest of the emails he responds to is 80 - 16 = 64 emails.

Since James works 5 days a week, we need to multiply the number of emails he responds to in a day by 5.

64 emails/day * 5 days = 320 emails

The final answer is: 320"
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center, we need to add up the number of classes that visited each day.

On Monday, 32 classes visited.
On Tuesday, twice as many visited, so 2 * 32 = 64 classes visited.
On Wednesday, three times as many visited, so 3 * 32 = 96 classes visited.
On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add up the number of classes that visited each day: 
32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 = 207

The final answer is: 207"
"To find the average score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the number of tests. 

John's scores are 100, 100, 100, and 80. 

First, let's add up the scores: 100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380.

Next, we divide the total score by the number of tests: 380 / 4 = 95.

So, John's average score across the 4 tests is 95.

"To find out how many pizzas are left, we need to calculate the total number of pizzas eaten by both the glee club and the football team, and then subtract that from the total number of pizzas ordered.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. To find out how many pizzas they ate, we multiply 20 by 0.7 (which is the decimal form of 70%): 20 * 0.7 = 14 pizzas.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. They ate 80% of them, which is 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas.

Now, we add the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club and the football team: 14 + 32 = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered was 20 (glee club) + 40 (football team) = 60 pizzas.

To find out how many pizzas are left, we subtract the number of pizzas eaten from the total number of pizzas ordered: 60 - 46 = 14 pizzas.

"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons separately and then add them together.

First, let's find out how many big coupons Anthony wants to send. He wants to send twice as many big coupons as small coupons, and he's sending 700 small coupons. So, the number of big coupons is 2 * 700 = 1400.

Now, let's calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, and there are 700 small coupons. So, the cost of mailing the small coupons is 700 * 5 = 3500 cents.

Next, let's calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, and there are 1400 big coupons. So, the cost of mailing the big coupons is 1400 * 15 = 21000 cents.

Now, we add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons together to get the total cost of postage. 3500 + 21000 = 23500 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100. 23500 / 100 = 235 dollars.

The final answer is: $235"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, so he ordered 10 - 3 = 7 meatball sub sandwiches.

Each sub sandwich has 4 meatballs, so the total number of meatballs in the 7 sub sandwiches is 7 x 4 = 28.

Mark ate 4 of Sidney's sub sandwiches, so Sidney was left with 7 - 4 = 3 sub sandwiches.

Sidney then ordered 3 more sub sandwiches, so he had a total of 3 + 3 = 6 sub sandwiches left.

The total number of meatballs in the 6 sub sandwiches is 6 x 4 = 24.

"To find the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we first need to find out how many trucks were still operational after the mechanical failures. 

Mr Hezekiah had 20 trucks dispatched, and a quarter of them had mechanical failures. A quarter of 20 is 20 / 4 = 5. 

So, 5 trucks had mechanical failures, leaving 20 - 5 = 15 trucks operational.

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. Since 15 trucks were operational, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers is 15 * 20 = 300.

The final answer is: 300"
"To find out how much Dennis will pay for 6 pounds of butter, we need to calculate the total cost of the butter first. 

Since Dennis needs 6 dozen croissants, and he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter. 

The grocery store promotion is buy one pound of butter get one half off, which means that for every 2 pounds of butter, Dennis will pay the full price of 2 pounds. 

So, for 6 pounds of butter, Dennis will pay for 3 sets of 2 pounds (6 pounds / 2 pounds per set = 3 sets). 

The cost of 2 pounds of butter is 2 * $4.00 = $8.00. 

Since Dennis will pay for 3 sets of 2 pounds, the total cost will be 3 * $8.00 = $24.00.

However, Dennis will get 3 pounds of butter for free (since he gets one half off for every pound of butter he buys). 

So, the total cost will be $24.00 - $12.00 (3 pounds of free butter) = $12.00.

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To find the total cost of the party, we need to calculate the number of guests and then multiply it by the additional fee per guest. 

First, let's find the total number of guests. Kayla invited 25 classmates, 7 dance class girls, and 13 family members, but 4 people said they couldn't come. 

Total invited guests = 25 (classmates) + 7 (dance class girls) + 13 (family members) = 45
Total guests attending = 45 (invited) - 4 (couldn't come) = 41

Since the initial fee is for 20 guests, we need to find the number of additional guests. 

Additional guests = Total guests attending - 20 (initial guests) = 41 - 20 = 21

Now, we can find the total cost by adding the initial fee and the cost for the additional guests. 

Total cost = Initial fee + (Additional guests * Additional fee per guest)
Total cost = $125 + (21 * $6)
Total cost = $125 + $126
Total cost = $251

"Let's break it down step by step. 

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which means she has 3/4 of her money left. Since she had $60, she has 3/4 * 60 = 45 dollars left.

Riza spent one-third of her money, which means she has 2/3 of her money left. Since she had $60, she has 2/3 * 60 = 40 dollars left.

To find the total amount of money they have left, we add Maggie's money and Riza's money: 45 + 40 = 85.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we know that one monkey eats 10 bananas each day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day. 

Since there are three monkeys, the total number of bananas they eat in a day is 10 + 14 + x, where x is the number of bananas the third monkey eats. 

We know that the total number of bananas Mr. Robles buys is 315, and this is enough to feed the monkeys for a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of bananas the monkeys eat in a week is 315. 

We can set up an equation to represent this: 10 + 14 + x + 10 + 14 + x + 10 + 14 + x + 10 + 14 + x + 10 + 14 + x = 315

Combine like terms: 56 + 3x = 315

Subtract 56 from both sides: 3x = 259

Divide both sides by 3: x = 86.33

Since the third monkey can't eat a fraction of a banana, we round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can't round down because the question asks for the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day, and we know that the total number of bananas is a whole number. Therefore, we can assume that the third monkey eats the remaining bananas for the week, which is 315 - (10 + 14 + 14 + 10 + 14 + 10 + 14) = 315 - 76 = 239 bananas. 

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we divide 239 by 7: 239 / 7 = 34.14. 

However, we know that the third monkey eats the rest of the bananas for the day, so we can assume that the third monkey eats the remaining bananas for the day, which is 239 - (10 + 14 + 14 + 10 + 14 + 10 + 14) = 239 - 76 = 163 bananas.

"To find out how many puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we need to know how many pieces he placed in total. 

Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, which is 500 / 2 = 250 pieces. 

Then, he finished another 500 piece puzzle, which is 500 pieces. 

So, in total, Teddy placed 250 + 500 = 750 pieces during that hour.

The final answer is: 750"
"To find out how much Jenny paid for the roses, we need to calculate the cost of 15 roses. 

Since roses cost $2 each, 15 roses will cost 15 x $2 = $30. However, the florist also offers a dozen roses for $15. Since 12 roses are in a dozen, we can buy 12 roses for $15 and 3 roses for $6. 

So, 12 roses for $15 and 3 roses for $6 will be cheaper than buying 15 roses at $2 each. The total cost will be $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny has five $5 bills, which is a total of 5 x $5 = $25. She paid $21 for the roses, so she has $25 - $21 = $4 left.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to find out how many quarters are in $4. There are 4 quarters in $1, so there are 4 x 4 = 16 quarters in $4.

Jenny leaves with 16 quarters.

"To find the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to calculate the total amount from each item and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total amount from milkshakes: 
6 milkshakes * $5.50 each = 6 * 5.50 = $33

Next, let's calculate the total amount from burger platters: 
9 burger platters * $11 each = 9 * 11 = $99

Then, let's calculate the total amount from sodas: 
20 sodas * $1.50 each = 20 * 1.50 = $30

Now, let's add the total amounts from each item together: 
$33 + $99 + $30 = $162

"To find out how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the time it takes for the first three trains to arrive and leave the station, and then add the time it takes for the fourth train to arrive.

The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the first train will leave the station after 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves the station, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes after the first train arrives. The second train stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train will leave the station after 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves the station, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes after the first train arrives. The third train leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it will leave the station at 125 minutes.

The fourth train will arrive 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes after the first train arrives. Since Paul is waiting for the fourth train, we need to find out how long it takes for the first three trains to arrive and leave the station, and then add the time it takes for the fourth train to arrive.

The time it takes for the first three trains to arrive and leave the station is 30 + 65 + 125 = 220 minutes. The fourth train will arrive 145 minutes after the first train arrives. So, the total time Paul will wait for his train is 220 + 145 = 365 minutes.

"To find out how many more weeks Melanie needs to save toothpicks, we first need to find out how many toothpicks she has saved so far. 

Melanie saved 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. So, the total number of toothpicks she saved is 10 * 12 = 120.

Since she needs 200 toothpicks in total and she already has 120, she needs 200 - 120 = 80 more toothpicks.

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week. To find out how many weeks it will take her to save 80 toothpicks, we divide 80 by 10. 

80 / 10 = 8

So, Melanie needs 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to first find the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch and then the price at which he sold it to his friend.

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price, so the price he paid is 75% of $2000, which is 0.75 * $2000 = $1500.

Then, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, which is 1.2 * $1500 = $1800.

To find the discount percentage, we need to find the difference between the original price and the price at which Mr. Rogers' friend bought it, and then divide it by the original price and multiply by 100.

The discount is ($2000 - $1800) = $200.

The percentage discount is ($200 / $2000) * 100 = 10%.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many jellyfish each spring creates in 4 hours and then multiply that by the number of springs.

Since each spring creates a new jellyfish every second, in 1 minute (60 seconds), it will create 60 jellyfish. 

In 1 hour (60 minutes), it will create 60 * 60 = 3600 jellyfish.

In 4 hours, it will create 3600 * 4 = 14400 jellyfish.

Since there are 5 springs working at the same rate, the total number of jellyfish created in 4 hours will be 5 * 14400 = 72000.

The final answer is: 72000"
"To find Frankie's score, we need to first find twice Binkie's score. Binkie's score is 90, so twice that would be 2 x 90 = 180. 

Since Frankie's score is 15 better than twice Binkie's, we need to add 15 to 180. So, Frankie's score is 180 + 15 = 195.

The final answer is: 195"
"To find the total distance James walked, we need to calculate the distance to the store and back. Since he walked halfway to the store and then back home, he walked 2 miles to the store and 2 miles back home. 

Total distance = 2 miles + 2 miles = 4 miles

Since James walks 4 miles per hour, we can find the time it took him to walk the total distance by dividing the total distance by his speed.

Time = Total distance / Speed
Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 1 hour

The final answer is: 1"
"To find out how much money Jenny saved, we need to calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually and compare it to the cost of buying them in bunches.

First, let's find out how many bananas Jenny bought in total. Since she bought 10 bunches with 4 bananas per bunch, she bought 10 * 4 = 40 bananas.

If she bought the bananas individually, each banana would cost $0.80. So, the total cost of buying 40 bananas individually would be 40 * $0.80 = $32.00.

Now, let's find out how much she paid for the bunches. She bought 10 bunches for $3.00 each, so the total cost of the bunches would be 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

To find out how much money she saved, we subtract the cost of the bunches from the cost of buying the bananas individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"Let's break this down step by step. 

First, we know that Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam. If we let x be the amount of fence Sam gets, then Harry gets x + 60 feet.

We know that the total amount of fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 60) = 100.

Combine like terms: 2x + 60 = 100.

Subtract 60 from both sides: 2x = 40.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 20.

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence. 

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we need to find out how many inches it grows per year. 

We know that the crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. To find the growth rate per year, we divide the total growth by the number of years: 

8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches per year

Now, we multiply the growth rate per year by the number of years to find the total growth in 13 years:

2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches

The final answer is: 26"
"Let's break down the information given:

- The price of an MTB is $500.
- The price of a BMX is half the price of an MTB, so it's $500 / 2 = $250.
- The price of a Trekking bike is $450.
- Marcel sold a total of 300 bikes.
- Half of them were Trekking bikes, so he sold 300 / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes.
- 15% of the bikes were BMX bikes, so he sold 15% of 300, which is 0.15 * 300 = 45 BMX bikes.
- The rest of the bikes were MTB type, so he sold 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings from each type of bike:
- Earnings from Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500
- Earnings from BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250
- Earnings from MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500

Total earnings from selling bicycles during that month: $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250

"To find out how many bales of hay are left in the field, we need to see how many bales the farmer makes and how many the truck picks up in 6 hours.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour. In 6 hours, the farmer will make 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour. In 6 hours, the truck will pick up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

Since the truck is picking up the bales, we need to subtract the number of bales the truck picks up from the number of bales the farmer makes. 

So, the number of bales left in the field is 30 - 18 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find out how many minutes John spends in class, we need to multiply the number of classes he takes per day by the number of minutes per class and then multiply that by the number of days he goes to class.

John takes 2 extra classes, so he has 6 + 2 = 8 classes in a day. Each class is 40 minutes long, so he spends 8 * 40 = 320 minutes in class per day. 

Since he goes to class 5 days a week, he spends 320 * 5 = 1600 minutes in class per week.

Now, we need to find out how many minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday. 1/16 of his weekly minutes is spent on these days. Since there are 7 days in a week, 1/16 of the week is 7/16. 

To find out the total minutes in a week, we multiply the minutes he spends in class by 7. 1600 * 7 = 11200 minutes in a week. 

Now, we can find 1/16 of the total minutes in a week. 11200 / 16 = 700 minutes.

So, John spends 700 minutes on Saturday and Sunday.

Now, we add the minutes he spends in class and the minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday. 1600 + 700 = 2300 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60. 2300 / 60 = 38.33 hours.

The initial height of the ball is 3 stories * 24 feet/story = 72 feet. 

The ball bounces to 2/3rds of its starting height, so the height after the first bounce is 72 * 2/3 = 48 feet.

The ball bounces to 2/3rds of its starting height again, so the height after the second bounce is 48 * 2/3 = 32 feet.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to find the height of each child in inches. 

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 6 feet to inches by multiplying 6 by 12. 

6 feet * 12 inches/foot = 72 inches

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so we add 2 inches to the height of the first child.

72 inches + 2 inches = 74 inches

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so we subtract 5 inches from the height of the second child.

74 inches - 5 inches = 69 inches

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so we add 3 inches to the height of the third child.

69 inches + 3 inches = 72 inches

The fourth child is 72 inches tall.

The final answer is: 72"
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to know how many bags of apples they sold. Since they sold 2000 apples and each bag contains 10 apples, we can divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag to find the number of bags sold.

Number of bags sold = Total apples / Apples per bag
= 2000 / 10
= 200

Now that we know the orchard sold 200 bags, we can multiply the number of bags by the price per bag to find the total earnings.

Total earnings = Number of bags sold * Price per bag
= 200 * $5

"To find out how much meat was on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate, we need to work backwards. 

First, the Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat. Before that, the velociraptors ate half of what was left. So, the velociraptors ate half of 270 kilograms, which is 270 / 2 = 135 kilograms. 

Now, we know that the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, and the velociraptors ate half of what was left. So, the T-Rex ate half of the original amount, and the velociraptors ate half of the remaining half. This means the velociraptors ate 1/4 of the original amount, and the Allosaurus ate 1/8 of the original amount. 

Let's call the original amount of meat x. The Allosaurus ate 1/8 of x, which is 270 kilograms. To find x, we can multiply 270 by 8. 

x = 270 * 8
x = 2160

"To find the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted and then divide it by the area covered by one gallon of paint. 

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so their total area is 2 x (10 x 8) = 160 square feet. 

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so their total area is 2 x (5 x 8) = 80 square feet.

The total area of the walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the total number of gallons needed is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

Each gallon costs $12, so the total cost is 12 gallons x $12 per gallon = $144.

"To find the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to determine the probability of her choosing a shaken can out of the remaining cans.

Initially, there were 12 sodas. Ellen shook 3 of them, so 3 were shaken and 9 were unshaken. She took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 11 sodas. Her brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 2 shaken and 7 unshaken sodas.

Now, there are 2 shaken sodas and 7 unshaken sodas. The total number of sodas is 2 + 7 = 9.

The probability of Ellen's friend getting a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas: 2/9.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (2/9) * 100 = 22.22%

"To find the distance between the two trains, we need to find the distance each train has traveled in 3 hours and then add those distances together.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. To find the distance it has traveled in 3 hours, we multiply 60 miles per hour by 3 hours:

60 miles/hour * 3 hours = 180 miles

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. To find the distance it has traveled in 3 hours, we multiply 30 miles per hour by 3 hours:

30 miles/hour * 3 hours = 90 miles

Now, we add the distances traveled by both trains to find the total distance between them:

180 miles + 90 miles = 270 miles

"To find out how many people Billy helps, we need to first calculate the total number of days he works. 

March has 31 days, and April has 19 days (since April 19th is the last day he works). So, the total number of days in this period is 31 + 19 = 50 days.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, we need to find 20% of 50. To do this, we multiply 50 by 0.2 (which is the decimal form of 20%). 

20% of 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10 days off.

Now, we subtract the number of days off from the total number of days to find the number of days he works: 50 - 10 = 40 days.

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so we need to find out how many people he can help in a day. 

2 people per hour * 3 hours = 6 people per day.

Now, we multiply the number of people he can help in a day by the number of days he works: 6 people per day * 40 days = 240 people.

"To find the total number of people inside the church, we need to find out how many people were outside the church and then subtract that number from the total number of people who attended the wedding.

First, let's find out how many people were in the buses. There were 12 buses and each bus carried 35 people. 

Number of people in buses = 12 * 35 = 420

Next, let's find out how many people were in the private cars. There were 20 private cars and each car carried 3 people.

Number of people in cars = 20 * 3 = 60

Now, we add the number of people in buses and cars to find the total number of people outside the church.

Total number of people outside the church = 420 + 60 = 480

Since the total number of people who attended the wedding is the sum of the people inside and outside the church, we can assume that the total number of people who attended the wedding is the sum of the people outside the church and the people inside the church. However, we don't know the number of people inside the church. 

To find the number of people inside the church, we need more information. But if we assume that the total number of people who attended the wedding is equal to the number of people outside the church, then the number of people inside the church would be 0.

However, if we assume that the total number of people who attended the wedding is more than the number of people outside the church, then we can find the number of people inside the church by subtracting the number of people outside the church from the total number of people who attended the wedding. But we don't have that information.

Therefore, we can't find the exact number of people inside the church with the given information.

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total amount she spent after returning the item and then add that to the initial charge minus the returned item.

First, let's calculate the amount Sheila got back after returning the item: 
$85.00 (initial charge) - $15.00 (returned item) = $70.00

Now, let's calculate the cost of the frying pan after the 20% discount:
20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
Cost of the frying pan = $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of the set of towels after the 10% discount:
10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
Cost of the set of towels = $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Now, let's add the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels to the amount Sheila got back after returning the item:
$70.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $113.00

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"Let's break down the information given. 

A fifth of the jellyfish are large, and a third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. This means that 1/5 of the total jellyfish are large, and 1/3 of those large jellyfish change color. 

Let's say the total number of jellyfish is x. Then, the number of large jellyfish is x/5. The number of large jellyfish that change color is (1/3) * (x/5) = x/15.

The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue. Since 6 jellyfish changed color, it means that x/15 jellyfish changed color. 

We can set up an equation: x/15 = 6. 

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 15: x = 6 * 15.

x = 90.

The final answer is: 90"

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much Lauren needs to save for her retirement. 

First, let's calculate Lauren's current annual savings. Since she saves 20% of her $100,000 salary, her annual savings will be 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000.

Next, we need to calculate how much she will need for her retirement. Since she plans to live on 40% of her current salary, her annual living expenses in retirement will be 0.40 * $100,000 = $40,000. 

For 20 years of retirement, her total living expenses will be $40,000 * 20 = $800,000.

Since she will be saving $20,000 per year, we can calculate how many years she needs to save to reach her retirement goal. 

To do this, we can divide the total amount she needs for retirement by her annual savings: $800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years.

However, this is the total number of years she needs to save, not the number of years she needs to work. Since she plans to live for 20 years after retirement, we need to subtract 20 from the total number of years she needs to save: 40 - 20 = 20 years.

So, Lauren needs to work for 20 years to save enough for her retirement.

"To find the total number of students in the school, we need to use the information given about the boys. Since 40% of the students are boys and there are 240 boys, we can set up an equation to find the total number of students.

Let's say the total number of students is x. We can write the equation as:

40% of x = 240

To find 40% of x, we multiply x by 0.4 (since 40% is the same as 0.4). So the equation becomes:

0.4x = 240

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.4:

x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

Now that we know the total number of students is 600, we can find the number of girls. Since 40% of the students are boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. We can find 60% of 600 by multiplying 600 by 0.6:

Number of girls = 600 * 0.6
Number of girls = 360

The final answer is: 360"
"To find out how much money your mom spent, we need to add the cost of the pots and the garden soil, then subtract the coupon amount.

First, let's add the cost of the pots and the garden soil: $19 + $26 = $45

"To find the average height of heels, we need to first find the total height of all the heels and then divide it by the total number of women.

The three women wearing 4 inch heels have a total height of 3 x 4 = 12 inches.
The three women wearing 2 inch heels have a total height of 3 x 2 = 6 inches.

The total height of all the heels is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.
There are 6 women in total.

The average height of heels is 18 / 6 = 3 inches."
"To find out how many more miles per day Soledad needs to hike, we first need to find out how many days she has in June. June has 30 days. 

Since she wants to hike 9,300 miles in 30 days, we can divide 9,300 by 30 to find out how many miles she needs to hike per day. 

9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day.

Since she already plans to hike 125 miles twice a day, we need to find out the total miles she will hike in a day. 

125 miles * 2 = 250 miles per day.

Now, we need to find out how many more miles she needs to hike per day to reach her goal. 

310 miles per day - 250 miles per day = 60 miles per day.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the total amount the store will receive after selling all the balls, we need to calculate the total cost of each color of balls and add them together.

Red balls: 3 balls * $9 per ball = $27
Blue balls: 11 balls * $5 per ball = $55
Green balls: 25 balls * $3 per ball = $75

Now, let's add the total cost of all the balls together: $27 + $55 + $75 = $157

The store will receive $157 after all the balls are sold.

$157"
"To find out how much James will have left, we first need to find out how much Pierre and Paul will take. 

Pierre wants a quarter of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/4 = 3 kg. 

Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/3 = 4 kg.

So, Pierre and Paul will take 3 + 4 = 7 kg in total.

Now, to find out how much James will have left, we subtract the total amount taken by Pierre and Paul from the initial amount of apples. 

12 kg - 7 kg = 5 kg.

So, James will have 5 kg of apples left. 

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the temperature in the morning, we need to subtract the temperature drop from the initial temperature and then add the temperature increase.

Initial temperature = 2 degrees Celsius
Temperature drop = 8 degrees Celsius
Temperature increase = 3 degrees Celsius

First, subtract the temperature drop from the initial temperature:
2 - 8 = -6 degrees Celsius

Then, add the temperature increase to the result:
-6 + 3 = -3 degrees Celsius

The temperature in the morning was -3 degrees Celsius.

"To find out how much money Raymond has left, we need to subtract the money he spent from the money he had initially and the money he saved.

Raymond initially had $21. He saved $11, so now he has $21 + $11 = $32.

Then, he spent $5 on a comic book and $19 on a puzzle. So, the total money he spent is $5 + $19 = $24.

Now, we subtract the money he spent from the total money he has: $32 - $24 = $8.

So, Raymond has $8 left.

The final answer is: $8"
"To find out how much each book cost, we need to first find out how much Anna spent in total. We know she had a budget of $16 and she has $2 left, so she spent $16 - $2 = $14.

We also know that she bought 2 books and they both cost the same amount of money. Let's call the cost of each book 'x'. Since she spent $14 in total, we can set up the equation 2x = 14.

To find the value of 'x', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 2. So, x = 14 / 2 = 7.

Therefore, each book cost $7.

The final answer is: $7"
"To find the number of students enrolled this year, we need to calculate 20% of the previous year's enrollment and add it to the previous year's enrollment.

20% of 50 is 0.20 x 50 = 10.

So, the increase in enrollment is 10 students.

Now, we add the increase to the previous year's enrollment: 50 + 10 = 60.

Therefore, there are 60 students enrolled in the calligraphy class this year.

60"
"To find out how long it will take the light to blink 459 times, we need to first find out how many times the light blinks per minute. 

We know that the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. 

To find out the number of blinks per minute, we divide the total number of blinks by the total number of minutes: 

255 blinks / 5 minutes = 51 blinks per minute.

Now that we know the light blinks 51 times per minute, we can find out how many minutes it will take to blink 459 times by dividing the total number of blinks by the number of blinks per minute:

459 blinks / 51 blinks per minute = 9 minutes.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the total number of male and female fishes, we need to add the initial number of fishes and the number of fishes Tate bought.

Initial male guppies: 4
Initial male goldfishes: 3
Initial total male fishes: 4 + 3 = 7

Initial female guppies: 7
Initial female goldfishes: 5
Initial total female fishes: 7 + 5 = 12

Tate bought 2 male guppies, 1 female guppy, 2 male goldfishes, and 3 female goldfishes. 
Total male fishes bought: 2 + 2 = 4
Total female fishes bought: 1 + 3 = 4

New total male fishes: 7 + 4 = 11
New total female fishes: 12 + 4 = 16

To find the difference between the number of female fishes and male fishes, we subtract the number of male fishes from the number of female fishes: 
16 - 11 = 5

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total time they all took to do their chores, we need to find the time each person took and add them together.

Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia, so Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours to walk the dog.

Dior took over 4 hours longer than Amalia, so Dior took 4 + 4 = 8 hours to do laundry.

Now, we add the time each person took to do their chores: 4 (Amalia) + 6 (Megan) + 8 (Dior) = 18 hours.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the total distance John drives in a round trip, we need to calculate the distance of one way and multiply it by 2. 

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 70 mph * 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles (one way)

Since it's a round trip, we multiply the one-way distance by 2:
Total Distance = 140 miles * 2
Total Distance = 280 miles

John visits his parents twice a month, so we multiply the total distance by 2:
Total Distance per month = 280 miles * 2
Total Distance per month = 560 miles

The final answer is: 560"
"To find out how many miles Brian will walk in 7 days, we need to first find out how far Sofie will walk in 7 days. Since Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, we multiply 10 miles by 7 days.

10 miles/day * 7 days = 70 miles

Since Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days, we need to divide the total distance Sofie will walk by 2 to find out how far Brian will walk.

70 miles / 2 = 35 miles

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

The final answer is: 35"
"To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we need to first calculate the total number of toys produced by the other 4 workers.

2 workers produce 6 toys an hour, so together they produce 2 * 6 = 12 toys an hour.
2 workers produce 4 toys an hour, so together they produce 2 * 4 = 8 toys an hour.
The total number of toys produced by these 4 workers is 12 + 8 = 20 toys an hour.

Since all 5 workers work for 10 hours, the total number of toys produced by the 4 workers is 20 * 10 = 200 toys.

The manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to ship the order, so the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers is 400 - 20 = 380 toys.

Since all 5 workers work for 10 hours, the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers is 10 times the number of toys produced by the fifth worker. Let's call the number of toys produced by the fifth worker 'x'. Then, the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers is 10x.

We know that the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers is 380, so we can set up the equation 10x = 380.

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 10:
x = 380 / 10
x = 38

So, the fifth worker produces 38 toys per hour. 

The final answer is: 38"
"To find the total weight of Elijah's dogs, we need to find the weight of each of his dogs first. 

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so we multiply 60 by 1/4 to find the weight of Elijah's first dog. 

60 * 1/4 = 15 pounds

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so we multiply 60 by 1/2 to find the weight of Elijah's second dog.

60 * 1/2 = 30 pounds

Now, we add the weights of Elijah's two dogs to find the total weight of his dogs.

15 + 30 = 45 pounds

To find the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs, we add the weight of Kory's dog to the total weight of Elijah's dogs.

45 + 60 = 105 pounds

The final answer is: 105"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. This means Luis has half of Seth's stickers, and Seth has the other half. 

Luis used half of the stickers he got from Seth and gave the rest to Kris. This means Kris has half of the stickers Luis got, which is half of the half of Seth's stickers. So, Kris has 1/4 of Seth's stickers. 

Kris kept 9 stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. This means Kris had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers. Since Kris has 1/4 of Seth's stickers, we can set up an equation to find out how many stickers Seth had in the beginning.

Let x be the number of stickers Seth had in the beginning. Then, 1/4 of x is 16. 

To find x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4 to get x = 16 * 4 = 64.

So, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning.

The final answer is: 64"
"To find out how many small bags John can make, we need to first find out how many M&M's he has in total. 

Since each large bag weighs 10 ounces and each ounce has 30 M&M's, we multiply the number of large bags by the number of ounces in each bag and then multiply that by the number of M&M's in each ounce.

3 large bags * 10 ounces per bag = 30 ounces
30 ounces * 30 M&M's per ounce = 900 M&M's

Now, we know John has 900 M&M's and he puts 10 M&M's in each small bag. To find out how many small bags he can make, we divide the total number of M&M's by the number of M&M's per small bag.

900 M&M's / 10 M&M's per small bag = 90 small bags

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we need to first calculate half of the circumference of the earth. 

The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. Half of that would be 40,000 / 2 = 20,000 kilometers.

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly 20,000 kilometers. We know that Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. 

To find the number of days, we can divide the total distance (20,000 kilometers) by the distance Alfie flies per day (400 kilometers). 

20,000 / 400 = 50

So, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth.

"To find the speed of the faster car, we need to first find the speed of the 2nd fastest car. 

The average car can go 120 miles per hour. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. 

Speed of the 2nd fastest car = 5 * 120 miles per hour = 600 miles per hour.

The faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. 

Speed of the faster car = 1.25 * 600 miles per hour = 750 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 750"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

Liam is 16 years old now. Two years ago, Liam's age would be 16 - 2 = 14 years old.

Two years ago, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince. So, two years ago, Vince's age would be 14 / 2 = 7 years old.

Since two years have passed, we need to add 2 to Vince's age to find his current age. So, Vince's current age is 7 + 2 = 9 years old.

The final answer is: 9"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

We know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs. Let's call this number A. 

We also know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. Let's call the number of eggs Sarah painted S. Then, Camden painted S + 12 eggs.

Since Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, we can write the equation: S + (S + 12) = 30. 

Simplifying the equation, we get 2S + 12 = 30. Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get 2S = 18. Dividing both sides by 2, we get S = 9. 

So, Sarah painted 9 eggs. Since Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

We also know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, which is A. The total number of eggs painted by all four people is 56. We can write the equation: A + A + 21 + 9 = 56. 

Simplifying the equation, we get 2A + 30 = 56. Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get 2A = 26. Dividing both sides by 2, we get A = 13.

So, Arnold and Madeline each painted 13 eggs. 

The question asks how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold. Since Camden painted 21 eggs and Arnold painted 13 eggs, Camden painted 21 - 13 = 8 more eggs than Arnold.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we need to find the total weight of the crayons and the total weight of the boxes, then add them together.

First, let's find the total weight of the crayons. Nik has 200 crayons, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce. So, the total weight of the crayons is 200 * 1 = 200 ounces.

Since each box weighs 8 ounces, and Nik has 200 crayons, we need to find out how many boxes he needs. To do this, we divide the total number of crayons by the number of crayons per box: 200 / 8 = 25 boxes.

Now, we can find the total weight of the boxes. Since each box weighs 8 ounces, and Nik has 25 boxes, the total weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

Now, we add the total weight of the crayons and the total weight of the boxes: 200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces.

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we can convert the total weight from ounces to pounds by dividing by 16: 400 / 16 = 25 pounds.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how much John makes, we need to calculate the total number of planks he can make and then multiply it by the price of each plank.

First, John can make logs out of 80% of the 80-foot tree. 80% of 80 is 0.8 x 80 = 64 feet. 

Since he cuts the tree into 4-foot logs, the number of logs he can make is 64 / 4 = 16 logs.

From each log, he cuts 5 planks, so the total number of planks is 16 x 5 = 80 planks.

He sells each plank for $1.2, so the total amount he makes is 80 x $1.2 = $96.

The final answer is: $96"
"Let's break this down step by step. 

Valerie earns $5000 per month, and her brother earns twice as much as her, so her brother earns 2 * $5000 = $10,000 per month.

Their combined salary is $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000 per month.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so she earns 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

To find the total amount of money they all have together, we need to add their individual salaries: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The final answer is: $40,000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we know that Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. We also know that she walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk as she does on the beach. 

Let's say her speed on the beach is x miles per minute. Then, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.

We know that she spends 40 minutes walking on the beach. Since she walks at x miles per minute, the distance she covers on the beach is 40x miles.

We also know that the distance she covers on the beach is 2 miles. So, we can set up the equation 40x = 2.

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 40: x = 2/40 = 1/20 miles per minute.

Now that we know her speed on the beach, we can find her speed on the sidewalk, which is 2x = 2(1/20) = 1/10 miles per minute.

We know that she walks 1 mile on the sidewalk, so the time it takes her to walk on the sidewalk is 1 / (1/10) = 10 minutes.

The total time it takes her to complete the entire 3-mile walk is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk, which is 40 + 10 = 50 minutes.

"To find out how many more weeks it will take Jane to save $60, we need to first calculate how much she has saved so far. 

She has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so we multiply the amount she saves per week by the number of weeks: 
$4 * 8 = $32

Now, we need to find out how much more she needs to save to reach $60. We subtract the amount she has saved so far from the total amount she wants to save:
$60 - $32 = $28

Since she saves $4 per week, we need to divide the amount she still needs to save by the amount she saves per week to find out how many more weeks it will take:
$28 / $4 = 7

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60. 

The final answer is: 7"

3 trees * 7 blue birds/tree = 21 blue birds

Next, let's find the total number of blue birds in the 2 trees with 4 blue birds each. 
2 trees * 4 blue birds/tree = 8 blue birds

Then, we have 1 tree with 3 blue birds.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 x 12 = 24. 

So, if Bob receives 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. This means that before receiving the 24 marbles, he had 60 - 24 = 36 marbles.

Now, if he loses 10 marbles, he will have 36 - 10 = 26 marbles.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum temperature of the second bottle. 

Let's say the temperature of the second bottle is x degrees. 

When Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle into his water bottle, the total temperature of the water in the bottle is the average of the temperatures of the two mugs. 

The amount of water from the 33-degree mug is 4 ounces, and the amount from the second bottle is 1 ounce. 

The total amount of water in the bottle is 5 ounces. 

The average temperature of the water in the bottle is (4 * 33 + x) / 5.

Since Donny can now drink the water, the average temperature must be at least 40 degrees.

We can set up the inequality (4 * 33 + x) / 5 ≥ 40.

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 5:

4 * 33 + x ≥ 200

132 + x ≥ 200

Subtract 132 from both sides:

x ≥ 68

So, the second bottle must be at least 68 degrees.

The final answer is: 68"
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately and then add them together.

Melanie's father starts with 50 cows. Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, in one week, they bring 20 * 7 = 140 cows. In three weeks, they bring 140 * 3 = 420 cows. So, the total number of cows after three weeks is 50 + 420 = 470 cows.

Melanie's father starts with 20 chickens. Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. In one week, they bring 10 * 7 = 70 chickens. In three weeks, they bring 70 * 3 = 210 chickens. So, the total number of chickens after three weeks is 20 + 210 = 230 chickens.

The total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals.

"To find the cost of each single bagel, we need to first find the total cost of the 4 packs of bagels with the discount, and then divide that by the total number of bagels.

The cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount is 4 x $10.00 = $40.00.

Since Russell gets a 10% discount, we need to find 10% of $40.00 and subtract it from $40.00. 
10% of $40.00 is 0.1 x $40.00 = $4.00.

Now, we subtract the discount from the original cost: $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Since each pack has 9 bagels, the total number of bagels is 4 x 9 = 36.

Now, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels to find the cost of each single bagel: $36.00 ÷ 36 = $1.00.

The final answer is: $1.00"
"To find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate, we need to first find out how many scoops 1 less than 3 scoops is. 1 less than 3 scoops is 2 scoops. 

Now, we know it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. 3 less than 6 is 3 potatoes. 

So, it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. To find out how many potatoes it takes to make 1 scoop, we need to divide 3 by 2. 3 divided by 2 is 1.5. 

Now, we know Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. 5 less than 23 is 18 scoops. 

To find out how many potatoes Gomer ate, we need to multiply the number of scoops by the number of potatoes per scoop. 18 scoops * 1.5 potatoes per scoop is 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"To find out how many eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we need to calculate the total number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately, and then add them together.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days is 3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs.

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in the next 30 days is 5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs.

Now, we add the total number of eggs from both periods: 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days: 240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozen eggs.

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we know there are 17 green jellybeans. We also know that there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans. So, the number of red jellybeans is 2 * 17 = 34.

Now, we know the total number of jellybeans is 60. We already know the number of green and red jellybeans, which is 17 + 34 = 51. 

To find the number of blue jellybeans, we subtract the total number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans. So, the number of blue jellybeans is 60 - 51 = 9.

"To find the number of women who remained on the bus, we first need to find the total number of women on the bus initially. 

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, and the total number of passengers is 84. We can represent the number of men as 5x and the number of women as 9x, where x is a common multiplier. 

Since the total number of passengers is 84, we can write the equation: 5x + 9x = 84

Combine like terms: 14x = 84

Divide both sides by 14: x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of women on the bus initially: 9x = 9 * 6 = 54

After 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining is: 54 - 20 = 34

"Let's break down the information given. 

Faraday earns $26 from the sunflowers per day. Since each sunflower costs $2, he sells 26 / 2 = 13 sunflowers per day.

He also earns $56 from the bouquets per day. Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers and costs $8, he sells 56 / 8 = 7 bouquets per day. 

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, he sells 7 * 12 = 84 sunflowers per day from the bouquets.

In total, he sells 13 + 84 = 97 sunflowers per day.

To find out how many sunflowers he sells in 3 days, we multiply 97 by 3. 

97 * 3 = 291

So, Faraday was able to sell 291 sunflowers after 3 days."
"To find out how much money Adam loses, we need to first calculate how many rocks he buys, how much he sells, and then find the difference.

Adam has $100 to invest. He buys rocks for $5 each. 

Number of rocks he can buy = Total money / Price per rock
= $100 / $5
= 20 rocks

He sells 60% of his inventory, which is 60% of 20 rocks.
Number of rocks sold = 20 * 0.6
= 12 rocks

He sells each rock for $7. 
Total money earned = Number of rocks sold * Selling price per rock
= 12 * $7
= $84

He bought 20 rocks for $5 each. 
Total money spent = Number of rocks bought * Price per rock
= 20 * $5
= $100

Since he only sells 12 rocks, he still has 8 rocks left. He can't sell them, so he can't earn any money from them. 

To find out how much money he loses, we subtract the money earned from the money spent.
Money lost = Money spent - Money earned
= $100 - $84
= $16

The final answer is: $16"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of days it takes Lauren to complete each type of picture scene. 

First, let's find out how many days it takes Lauren to complete each type of picture scene:

- To draw 45 large-sized picture scenes, it will take Lauren 45 / 5 = 9 days.
- To draw 36 medium-sized picture scenes, it will take Lauren 36 / 6 = 6 days.
- To draw 49 small-sized picture scenes, it will take Lauren 49 / 7 = 7 days.

Now, we need to find the LCM of 9, 6, and 7. 

The multiples of 9 are: 9, 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, 90, 99, 108, 117, 126, 135, 144, 153, 162, 171, 180, 189, 198, 207, 216, 225, 234, 243, 252, 261, 270, 279, 288, 297, 306, 315, 324, 333,

"To find out how many eggs each child gets, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of children. 

First, let's find out how many eggs Chatty prepared in total. A dozen is 12 eggs, so three dozen eggs would be 3 x 12 = 36 eggs.

Now, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of children: 36 eggs / 4 children = 9 eggs per child.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find out how much Jen spends on food for her fish in May, we need to know how many days are in May. May has 31 days. 

Since each fish needs $1 worth of food a day, and Jen has 3 fish, the total cost per day is 3 * $1 = $3.

To find the total cost for the month of May, we multiply the daily cost by the number of days in May: $3 * 31 = $93.

The final answer is: $93"
"To find out how many roses Patricia has now, we need to first subtract the number of roses she gave to her mother from the initial number of roses she had. 

Initial number of roses = 30
Roses given to her mother = 24
Remaining roses = 30 - 24 = 6

Then, we add the number of roses she bought to the remaining roses.

Remaining roses = 6
Roses bought = 15
Total roses now = 6 + 15 = 21

So, Patricia now has 21 roses.

"To find the average speed, we need to find the total distance traveled and the total time taken. 

The total distance traveled is 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles.

The total time taken is 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours.

The average speed is calculated by dividing the total distance by the total time. 

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
Average speed = 250 miles / 5 hours
Average speed = 50 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning. 

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which is 0.2 in decimal form. 

The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability is 3 times 0.2, which is 0.6. 

Now, we multiply the probabilities of both tickets winning: 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

First, we know that Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected. So, if we let x be the number of seashells Carlos collected, then Jim collected x + 5 seashells. 

We also know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. Let's say Carrey collected y seashells. Then, Carlos collected 2y seashells.

Since Jim collected x + 5 seashells and Carlos collected 2y seashells, and we know that Jim collected 27 seashells, we can set up the equation x + 5 = 27. Solving for x, we get x = 22.

Now we know that Carlos collected 2y seashells and we know that Carlos collected 22 seashells. So, 2y = 22. Solving for y, we get y = 11.

Now we know that Carrey collected 11 seashells, Carlos collected 22 seashells, and Jim collected 27 seashells. They gathered all their seashells and divided them equally between themselves. 

The total number of seashells is 11 + 22 + 27 = 60. 

To find out how many seashells each person got, we divide the total number of seashells by 3 (the number of people). 

60 / 3 = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and add the number of carrots he eats on the weekend.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday). So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is 4 * 5 = 20.

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is 5 + 5 = 10.

Now, we add the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend to find the total number of carrots he eats in a week. 20 (weekdays) + 10 (weekend) = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to find the length of the second song first. 

The second song is 60% longer than the first song. To find 60% of the first song's length, we multiply 5 minutes by 0.6. 

5 * 0.6 = 3 minutes

Now, we add this to the length of the first song to find the length of the second song. 

5 + 3 = 8 minutes

Now, we add the lengths of both songs to find the total time of the cassette.

5 + 8 = 13 minutes

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes."
"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the profit from each day and then add them together.

On Monday, Linus bought 2 devices for $20 each. So, the total cost for Monday is 2 x $20 = $40. He sold each device for twice the original price, which is 2 x $20 = $40. So, the total revenue from Monday is 2 x $40 = $80. The profit from Monday is $80 - $40 = $40.

On Tuesday, Linus bought 4 devices for $20 each. So, the total cost for Tuesday is 4 x $20 = $80. He sold each device for twice the original price, which is 2 x $20 = $40. So, the total revenue from Tuesday is 4 x $40 = $160. The profit from Tuesday is $160 - $80 = $80.

The total profit is the sum of the profit from Monday and Tuesday, which is $40 + $80 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To find the length of Carl's cane, we need to find Carl's height first. 

Isabel is 7 feet tall, and Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel. So, Ned's height is 7 - 2 = 5 feet.

Carl is one foot taller than Ned, so Carl's height is 5 + 1 = 6 feet.

Since Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, the length of the cane is 6 / 2 = 3 feet.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to find out how many bottles are needed to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of one person. 

Since each juice can cover 20% of one person's daily energy demand, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, Hortex would need 100 / 20 = 5 bottles.

Now, to find out how many bottles are needed for 2300 people, we multiply the number of bottles needed for one person by 2300. 

5 bottles/person * 2300 people = 11500 bottles.

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, to find out how many more bottles it needs to produce, we subtract the number of bottles it can produce from the number of bottles needed. 

11500 bottles - 4200 bottles = 7300 bottles.

The final answer is: 7300"
"To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to first find out how many babies are wearing purple and how many are wearing bows.

Carla has 8 babies, and 3/4 of them are wearing purple. So, the number of babies wearing purple is 3/4 * 8 = 6.

Now, 1/4 of the babies are wearing blue, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 babies.

All the blue-wearers and 1/3 of the purple wearers are also wearing bows. So, the number of babies wearing bows is 2 (blue-wearers) + 1/3 * 6 (purple wearers) = 2 + 2 = 4.

Now, we need to find out how many of the babies wearing bows are wearing purple. This is 2 (1/3 of the purple wearers).

The percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is (2/4) * 100 = 50%.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how many reports the IRS received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday, and then subtract that number from the total number of reports received last week.

Total reports received last week = 5168
Reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

First, let's find the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday. 

Reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

Now, let's subtract the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday. 

Reports received on Wednesday = Reports received on Thursday and Friday - Reports received on Monday and Tuesday
Reports received on Wednesday = 2136 - 1907
Reports received on Wednesday = 229

The final answer is: 229"
"To find out how much money Abraham will earn, we need to calculate the total amount of money he earned from selling his land.

First, Abraham sold half of his land for $50. Since he owns 80 square meters, half of that is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters.

Then, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. Since he already sold 40 square meters, he has 80 - 40 = 40 square meters left. 1/4 of 40 is 40 / 4 = 10 square meters. 

So, he sold 40 + 10 = 50 square meters in total before selling the remaining land.

The remaining land is 80 - 50 = 30 square meters.

He sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter, so the total amount he earned from the remaining land is 30 * 3 = $90.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money he earned from selling the first 50 square meters. We know that he sold 40 square meters for $50 and 10 square meters for $30. 

The total amount he earned from the first 50 square meters is $50 + $30 = $80.

The total amount he earned from selling all his land is $80 + $90 = $170.

The final answer is: $170"
"To find Geb's age, we need to first find half of Haley's age. Haley is 26 years old, so half of that would be 26 / 2 = 13. 

Since Geb is 10 less than half of Haley's age, we need to subtract 10 from 13. 

13 - 10 = 3.

Geb is 3 years old."
"To find out how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to first find out how many face masks he uses in a day. 

Since Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out and he goes out three times a day, he uses 2 * 3 = 6 face masks in a day.

Now, to find out how many face masks he uses in 2 days, we multiply the number of face masks he uses in a day by 2. 

6 * 2 = 12

So, Tyrion uses 12 face masks every 2 days."
"To find out how many eggs are still hidden, we need to know how many eggs each person found and add them up. 

Lamar finds 5 eggs. 
Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 5 * 2 = 10 eggs. 
Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs. 
Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up the eggs found by each person: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

Since Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, we need to find out how many eggs that is. 1 dozen is 12, so 3 dozen is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Now, let's subtract the eggs found from the total number of eggs: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find out how much money John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of apartments and the total amount of money he gets paid per week.

First, let's find the total number of apartments in the first two complexes. 
200 apartments * 2 = 400 apartments

The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, so we need to find 60% of 400 and add it to 400.
60% of 400 = 0.6 * 400 = 240
Total apartments in the last complex = 400 + 240 = 640
Total apartments in all complexes = 400 + 400 + 640 = 1440

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so the total number of collections per week is 3 * 1440 = 4320

He gets paid $0.40 per collection for each apartment, so the total amount of money he makes per week is:
4320 collections * $0.40 = $1728

The final answer is: $1728"
"To find the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree, we need to calculate the fruits produced each year and add them up.

- Year 1: 5-year-old tree produces 50 fruits.
- Year 2: 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount, so 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
- Year 3: 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount, so 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
- Year 4: The tree is 8 years old, but we don't know the amount of fruits it produces yet. We know it produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. To find the amount of fruits a 10-year-old tree produces, we need to calculate the fruits produced in the 10th year. 
- Year 5: The tree is 9 years old, and it doesn't produce any fruits.
- Year 6: The tree is 10 years old, and it produces 20 times the initial amount, so 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.
- Now we know that a 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits, and an 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than that. So, an 8-year-old tree produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.
- Now we can calculate the total fruits produced in the first 4 years: 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 = 1350 fruits.

The total number of fruits produced in the first 5 years is 1350. The tree doesn't produce any fruits in the 6th year, and it produces 1000 fruits in the 10th year. 

Total fruits produced in 10 years = 1350 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1000 = 2350.

The final answer is: 2350"
"To find out how much money Jack has now, we need to first calculate how much money Sophia gave him. Sophia has $100 and gave 1/5 of it to Jack. 

1/5 of $100 is calculated as: $100 * (1/5) = $20

So, Sophia gave Jack $20. 

Now, we need to add the money Jack already had to the money Sophia gave him. Jack had $100 and got $20 from Sophia. 

$100 + $20 = $120

Jack now has $120. 

The final answer is: $120"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let's denote the length of the blue rope as B, the length of the yellow rope as Y, and the length of the red rope as R. 

We know that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so we can write an equation: R = 4B.

We also know that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so we can write another equation: B = Y - 7.

We are also given that the combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can write a third equation: R + B + Y = 37.

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the third equation to get: 4B + B + Y = 37.

Combine like terms: 5B + Y = 37.

Now, substitute the second equation into the equation above: 5B + (B + 7) = 37.

Combine like terms: 6B + 7 = 37.

Subtract 7 from both sides: 6B = 30.

Divide both sides by 6: B = 5.

Now that we know the length of the blue rope, we can find the length of the red rope using the first equation: R = 4B = 4(5) = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say Ronnie was given x dollars. Since Rissa was given thrice as much, Rissa was given 3x dollars.

After they both gave an equal amount of money to their little sister, let's call this amount y. So, Ronnie is left with x - y dollars and Rissa is left with 3x - y dollars.

We are given that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her original money. This means that 3x - y = (4/5)(3x).

To solve for y, we can multiply both sides by 5 to get rid of the fraction: 5(3x - y) = 4(3x).

Expanding the equation, we get 15x - 5y = 12x.

Now, let's isolate y by moving the x terms to one side: -5y = 12x - 15x.

Combine like terms: -5y = -3x.

Divide both sides by -5: y = (3/5)x.

Now that we know y, we can find out how much money Ronnie has left. We know that Ronnie is left with x - y dollars. We can substitute y = (3/5)x into this expression: x - (3/5)x.

To simplify this expression, we can factor out x: x - (3/5)x = (2/5)x.

So, Ronnie is left with (2/5)x dollars.

However, we don't know the value of x. We can use the information that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her original money to find x. We know that Rissa is left with 3x - y dollars, and this is equal to (4/5)(3x).

We can set up the equation: 3x - y = (4/5)(3x).

Substitute y = (3/5)x into this equation: 3x - (3/5)x = (4/5)(3x).

Combine like terms: (12/5)x = (4/5)(3x).

To simplify this expression, we can multiply both sides by 5: 12x = 12x.

This equation is true for all values of x, but we can use it to find the value of x. We know that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her original money, which is 4/5(3x) = 12/5x.

"Let's break down the information given. We know that there are four colors of paint: red, white, purple, and yellow. We also know that there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint. 

Let's say the amount of red, white, and purple paint is x. Since half the mural is yellow, the amount of yellow paint is 12 / 2 = 6 pints.

The total amount of paint used is 12 pints, which is the sum of the red, white, purple, and yellow paint. We can write this as an equation: x + x + x + 6 = 12.

Combine like terms: 3x + 6 = 12.

Subtract 6 from both sides: 3x = 6.

Divide both sides by 3: x = 2.

Since x is the amount of red, white, and purple paint, and we know that there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple, the amount of red paint is x = 2 pints.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total area of the house, we need to find the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house, then add them together.

First, let's find the area of one bedroom: 
Area of one bedroom = length * width = 20 * 12 = 240 square feet.

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms = 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area = 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas together: 
Total area = area of bedrooms + area of living room + area of the rest of the house
Total area = 960 + 1200 + 1000

"Let's break it down step by step. 

On Monday, Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds. 
On Tuesday, she counts double the number of clouds from Monday, which is 3 * 2 = 6 puffs of clouds. 
On Wednesday, she counts double the number of clouds from Tuesday, which is 6 * 2 = 12 puffs of clouds. 
On Thursday, she counts double the number of clouds from Wednesday, which is 12 * 2 = 24 puffs of clouds. 
On Friday, she counts double the number of clouds from Thursday, which is 24 * 2 = 48 puffs of clouds.

To find the total number of clouds she counted across all five days, we need to add the number of clouds from each day: 
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93

The final answer is: 93"
"To find out how many dishwashing cycles you can run with the new box, we need to first find out how many pods are in the new box. 

The new box has 20% more pods than the regular box. 20% of 100 is 0.2 x 100 = 20. So the new box has 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Now, we know that the new box costs $12 and has 120 pods. To find out how many cycles you can run for $1, we need to divide the number of pods by the cost. 

First, we need to find out how many pods you can get for $1 with the new box. We can do this by dividing the total number of pods by the cost of the box: 120 pods / $12 = 10 pods per dollar.

Now, we can find out how many cycles you can run for $1 by dividing the number of pods you can get for $1 by the number of pods per cycle, which is 1. 

10 pods / 1 pod per cycle = 10 cycles.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. This means he has 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he has 50 - 10 = 40 bills left.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill, which means he uses 40 / 2 = 20 bills. So, he has 40 - 20 = 20 bills left.

4. Thomas then triples his money. Since each bill is worth $20, tripling his money means each bill is now worth $60. So, he has 20 * 60 = $1200.

5. He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. To find out how many 5 dollar bills he has, we need to divide the total amount by 5. 1200 / 5 = 240.

The final answer is: 240"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals in the first half.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals.

Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B in the second half, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

So, in the first half, team A scored 4 goals and team B scored 2 goals. In the second half, team A scored 2 goals and team B scored 8 goals.

The total number of goals scored by team A is 4 + 2 = 6 goals. The total number of goals scored by team B is 2 + 8 = 10 goals.

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 + 10 = 16.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we need to find out how much chalk is left after Monday. 

The teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk. He used 45% of it on Monday. To find 45% of 5, we multiply 5 by 0.45. 

5 * 0.45 = 2.25 inches

So, the teacher used 2.25 inches of chalk on Monday. To find out how much chalk is left, we subtract 2.25 from 5.

5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches

Now, we need to find out how many days the 2.75 inches of chalk will last. The teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day. To find 20% of 2.75, we multiply 2.75 by 0.20.

2.75 * 0.20 = 0.55 inches

This means the teacher uses 0.55 inches of chalk each day. To find out how many days the 2.75 inches of chalk will last, we divide 2.75 by 0.55.

2.75 / 0.55 = 5

The teacher has 5 days before he has to recycle the chalk. 

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the number of students not on varsity, we first need to find the number of students on varsity. 

One-third of the girls are on varsity, so the number of girls on varsity is 12 * (1/3) = 4. 

One-fourth of the boys are on varsity, so the number of boys on varsity is 12 * (1/4) = 3.

The total number of students on varsity is 4 (girls) + 3 (boys) = 7.

Since there are 12 boys and 12 girls in the class, the total number of students is 12 + 12 = 24.

The number of students not on varsity is 24 (total students) - 7 (students on varsity) = 17.

"To find out how many face masks Johnny bought, we need to first determine how many face masks Mike bought, which is 5. 

Then, we need to find out how many face masks are thrice as many as Mike's. To do this, we multiply the number of face masks Mike bought by 3. 

5 * 3 = 15

Since Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike, we need to add 2 to the result. 

15 + 2 = 17

So, Johnny bought 17 face masks.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we need to first find out how many teeth the dentist fixes in total. The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more teeth than he drills, so the dentist caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth. 

The total number of teeth the dentist fixes is 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 teeth. 

To find the percentage of teeth fixed, we divide the number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth James has and multiply by 100. 

(15 / 30) * 100 = 50%

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how much Mr. Marcellus got in refunds, we first need to find out how many gallons of milk were expired. 

2/5 of 4000 gallons is the amount of milk that expired. To find this, we multiply 4000 by 2/5.

4000 * (2/5) = 4000 * 2 / 5 = 8000 / 5 = 1600 gallons of milk expired.

Since Mr. Marcellus bought the milk at $3.5 per gallon, we multiply the number of expired gallons by the cost per gallon to find the total refund.

1600 * $3.5 = $5600

So, Mr. Marcellus got $5600 in refunds."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say Colin's current age is C and Wendy's current age is W.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:

W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for C.

C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplify the equation:

C + 25 = (5/3)(C + 7)

Multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtract 3C from both sides:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtract 35 from both sides:

40 = 2C

Divide both sides by 2:

20 = C

So Colin is 20 years old now.

"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to first find out how many books he can buy in total. 

We know that Bob can buy 100 books for $500. To find out how many books he can buy with $27000, we need to divide the total amount by the cost of 100 books.

Cost of 100 books = $500
Total amount = $27000

Number of sets of 100 books = Total amount / Cost of 100 books
= $27000 / $500
= 54

Since Bob can buy 100 books in each set, we multiply the number of sets by 100 to find the total number of books he can buy.

Total number of books = Number of sets * 100
= 54 * 100
= 5400

Now, we need to find out how many books he can buy per school. Since he is distributing the books to 3 schools, we divide the total number of books by 3.

Number of books per school = Total number of books / 3
= 5400 / 3
= 1800

The final answer is: 1800"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Newton starts with 2 apples. 
2. He throws one apple back into the tree, and 5 more apples fall out. Now, he has 2 (initial apples) + 5 (new apples) = 7 apples. 
3. He puts all but one of these 7 apples in his pocket, so he has 1 apple left. 
4. He throws the remaining apple at the tree, and 6 more apples fall out. Now, he has 1 (remaining apple) + 6 (new apples) = 7 apples.
5. He picks up all the remaining apples, which is 7 apples.

So, Newton brought home 7 apples.

"To find the total cost of Ali's order, we need to calculate the total number of bags and multiply it by the cost per bag.

First, let's find the total number of bags: 
Total coal ordered = 850 kg
Weight of each bag = 50 kg
Number of bags = Total coal ordered / Weight of each bag
Number of bags = 850 / 50
Number of bags = 17

Now, let's find the total cost:
Cost per bag = $18
Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
Total cost = 17 * 18
Total cost = 306

The final answer is: $306"
"To find out how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices each type of pizza is needed for, and then divide that by the number of slices per pizza.

For the cheese pizza, Kate's 6 friends each eat 6 slices, so the total number of cheese pizza slices needed is 6 friends * 6 slices = 36 slices. 

For the pepperoni pizza, Kate's 6 friends each eat 4 slices, so the total number of pepperoni pizza slices needed is 6 friends * 4 slices = 24 slices.

Since the cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, we need to divide the total number of cheese pizza slices needed by 12 to find out how many cheese pizzas are needed: 36 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 3 cheese pizzas.

Since the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, we need to divide the total number of pepperoni pizza slices needed by 8 to find out how many pepperoni pizzas are needed: 24 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 3 pepperoni pizzas.

To find the total number of pizzas Kate needs to buy, we add the number of cheese pizzas and pepperoni pizzas: 3 cheese pizzas + 3 pepperoni pizzas = 6 pizzas.

"To find the total miles Sam ran this week, we need to add up the miles he ran on each day. 

On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Sam ran 3 miles each day. So, the total miles he ran on these days is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 miles.

On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day. So, the total miles he ran on these days is 5 + 5 = 10 miles.

Now, we add the total miles from both sets of days: 9 + 10 = 19 miles.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many snowballs Jay builds and how many melt in a given time period. 

Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can find out how many snowballs he builds in 15 minutes by dividing 20 by 3 (60 minutes / 15 minutes = 4). So, Jay builds 20 / 4 = 5 snowballs in 15 minutes.

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. So, the net number of snowballs Jay has after 15 minutes is 5 - 2 = 3.

To find out how many 15-minute intervals it will take for Jay to have 60 snowballs, we can divide 60 by 3 (the net number of snowballs he has after each 15-minute interval). 60 / 3 = 20.

Since each interval is 15 minutes, we multiply 20 intervals by 15 minutes to find the total time. 20 * 15 = 300 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60. 300 / 60 = 5 hours.

So, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how old Jim is, we need to figure out how old he was 20 years ago. 

Let's say Jim's age 20 years ago was x. Since John was twice as old as Jim 20 years ago, John's age 20 years ago would be 2x.

We know that John is 28 now, so 20 years ago, John was 28 - 20 = 8 years old. 

Since John was 2x 20 years ago, we can set up the equation 2x = 8. 

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 2: x = 8 / 2 = 4.

So, Jim was 4 years old 20 years ago. To find Jim's current age, we add 20 to 4: 4 + 20 = 24.

Doxa ate 1 slice. 
Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so her sister ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices. 
Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so her brother ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

To find the total number of slices they ate, we need to add the slices eaten by Doxa, her sister, and her brother. 
Total slices eaten = Doxa's slices + sister's slices + brother's slices 
Total slices eaten = 1 + 2 + 3 
Total slices eaten = 6

"Let's break down the information given:

- On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered 1 pack of 50.
- On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.
- On the third day, they ordered 2 packs of 50 bandages and used half a pack, which is 25 bandages.
- They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x. 

After the first day, they had x - 38 bandages left. 
After the second day, they had (x - 38) - 28 = x - 66 bandages left.
After the third day, they had (x - 66) - 25 + 100 (2 packs of 50) = x - 66 - 25 + 100 = x + 9 bandages left.

We know that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, so we can set up the equation: x + 9 = 78.

To find the initial number of bandages, we need to solve for x:
x = 78 - 9
x = 69

"To find out how much Jen will receive, we need to calculate her total earnings from working and her attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her total earnings from working. She works 7.5 hours a day for 6 days a week. Since there are 4 weeks in April, we need to find out how many days she works in total.

Number of days worked in a week: 6
Number of weeks in April: 4
Total days worked in April: 6 * 4 = 24

Now, let's calculate her total hours worked in April:
Total hours worked in April: 7.5 * 24 = 180 hours

Her hourly rate is $1.5, so her total earnings from working will be:
Total earnings from working: 180 * $1.5 = $270

Now, let's calculate her attendance bonus. She receives an additional $10 for complete attendance, and since she didn't incur any absences, she will receive the bonus for all 4 weeks.
Attendance bonus: $10 * 4 = $40

Now, let's add her total earnings from working and her attendance bonus to find out her total earnings:
Total earnings: $270 + $40 = $310

"To find out how much John spent on everything, we need to calculate the cost of the scotch and the cognac separately and then add them together.

The cost of the scotch is $600 for 10 bottles. To find the cost per bottle, we divide the total cost by the number of bottles: $600 / 10 = $60 per bottle.

Since John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The cognac costs 50% more than the scotch, so the cost per bottle of cognac is $60 + ($60 * 0.5) = $90.

Now, we can find the total cost of the cognac: 20 bottles * $90 per bottle = $1800.

To find the total amount John spent, we add the cost of the scotch and the cognac: $600 + $1800 = $2400.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees. He also planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, which means he planted 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, so the total number of White Oak trees becomes 20 + 10 = 30. 

For Lodgepole Pine trees, he planted 1/4 more than he did on the first day. Since he planted 40 Lodgepole Pine trees on the first day, 1/4 of 40 is 10. So, he planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day.

Now, let's calculate the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days. 

Total White Oak trees = 20 (first day) + 10 (second day) = 30
Total Lodgepole Pine trees = 40 (first day) + 50 (second day) = 90

Total number of trees = Total White Oak trees + Total Lodgepole Pine trees
Total number of trees = 30 + 90
Total number of trees = 120

The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day. Brian ran it for 3 days, so the total water removed on the low setting is 1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters.

The medium setting removes twice as much water as the low setting, which is 2 liters of water per day. Brian ran it for 3 days, so the total water removed on the medium setting is 2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters.

The high setting removes twice as much water as the medium setting, which is 4 liters of water per day. Brian ran it for 5 days, so the total water removed on the high setting is 4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters.

Now, we add the total water removed on each setting: 3 liters (low) + 6 liters (medium) + 20 liters (high) = 29 liters.

The final answer is: 29"
"To find out how many balloons they threw, we need to first find out how many balloons they had in total. 

They filled up 10 packs of balloons with 30 balloons per pack. So, the total number of balloons is 10 packs * 30 balloons per pack = 300 balloons.

By the end of the afternoon, 12 balloons were left. To find out how many balloons they threw, we need to subtract the number of balloons left from the total number of balloons. 

300 total balloons - 12 balloons left = 288 balloons thrown.

"To find out how much of the second medicine is needed for one dose, we need to multiply 14 mL by 3. 

14 mL * 3 = 42 mL

So, for one dose, Saanvi needs 14 mL of the first medicine and 42 mL of the second medicine.

To find out how much of each medicine is needed for 8 doses, we multiply the amount needed for one dose by 8.

For the first medicine: 14 mL * 8 = 112 mL
For the second medicine: 42 mL * 8 = 336 mL

The total amount of medicine needed for 8 doses is 112 mL + 336 mL = 448 mL.

"To find the capacity of John's classes, we need to find 1/8 of Ali's class capacity. 

Ali's class capacity is 120 students. 
1/8 of 120 is 120 / 8 = 15 students per class.

Since John has two classes, we multiply 15 by 2 to get the total capacity of John's classes. 
15 * 2 = 30 students.

Now, we add the capacity of Ali's class and John's classes to get the combined capacity of both schools. 
120 (Ali's class) + 30 (John's classes) = 150 students.

The final answer is: 150"
"To find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we need to calculate the total amount he paid in the first 11 months and add the remaining amount, including the interest.

First, let's find the total amount Stephen paid in the first 11 months. He paid $25 per month for 11 months, so the total amount is:

$25 * 11 = $275

Now, let's calculate the interest Stephen owes his sister. The interest is 2% of the original amount borrowed, which is $300. To find 2% of $300, we multiply $300 by 0.02:

$300 * 0.02 = $6

The remaining amount, including the interest, is the original amount borrowed plus the interest:

$300 + $6 = $306

However, Stephen already paid $275 in the first 11 months, so the remaining amount he needs to pay in the twelfth month is:

$306 - $275 = $31

Therefore, Stephen will pay $31 in the twelfth month.

The final answer is: $31"
"To find out how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we need to first find out the total number of diapers changed per day. 

Since each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, and there are 2 children, the total number of diaper changes per day is 2 * 5 = 10.

Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, so she changes 10 / 2 = 5 diapers per day.

Since Jordan's wife changes 5 diapers per day, Jordan changes the other half, which is also 5 diapers per day.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total number of jelly beans in the jar, we need to calculate the volume of the jar and then divide it by the volume of a single jelly bean, considering the packing efficiency.

The volume of the jar is the area of the base times the height: 
Volume = 6 * 6 * 15 = 540 cubic inches.

Since the jelly beans are packed with 80% efficiency, we need to divide the volume by 0.8 to get the actual volume that can be occupied by the jelly beans:
Effective Volume = 540 / 0.8 = 675 cubic inches.

Now, we divide the effective volume by the volume of a single jelly bean (0.15 cubic inches) to get the total number of jelly beans:
Total Jelly Beans = 675 / 0.15 = 4500.

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we can find the number of red jelly beans:
Number of Red Jelly Beans = 4500 * 0.3 = 1350.

However, the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find how far off Tim's guess was, we need to know his guess. Since the problem doesn't provide his guess, we can't calculate the exact difference."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, the bus had 20 people. 

At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus became 20 + 40 = 60.

At the second stop, 3/4 of the people who entered at the first stop entered the bus. Since 40 people entered at the first stop, 3/4 of 40 is (3/4) * 40 = 30. So, 30 people entered the bus at the second stop. The total number of people on the bus became 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus became 2 * 90 = 180.

The bus has a capacity of 200 people. To find the remaining spaces, we subtract the current number of people from the capacity: 200 - 180 = 20.

"To find the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to calculate the cost of visits for the first 5 years and the cost of visits for the next 3 years.

For the first 5 years, the cost of one visit is $2. Since Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year, the cost per year is 2 * 3 = $6. For 5 years, the total cost is 6 * 5 = $30.

The cost of one visit increased by 150% after 5 years. A 150% increase means the new cost is 2 + (2 * 1.5) = $5. The cost per year for the next 3 years is 5 * 3 = $15. For 3 years, the total cost is 15 * 3 = $45.

The total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is 30 + 45 = $75.

"To find out how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to find out how many groups of 8 students can be made from 10 students in each grade. 

There are 4 grades (4-7) with 10 students in each grade. So, the total number of students is 4 * 10 = 40 students.

Since only 8 students can try the escape room at a time, we need to divide the total number of students by 8 to find out how many groups we can make. 

40 students / 8 students per group = 5 groups.

Since each group uses their full 45 minutes, it will take 5 groups * 45 minutes per group to let everyone try the escape room.

5 groups * 45 minutes per group = 225 minutes.

The final answer is: 225"
"To find out how much Ali has to pay John, we need to calculate the total cost of the tables and the total cost of the roof frames, then add them together.

The cost of the tables is 4 tables * $20 per table = $80.
The cost of the roof frames is 2 frames * $10 per frame = $20.

Now, we add the cost of the tables and the cost of the roof frames together: $80 + $20 = $100.

So, Ali has to pay John $100.

"Let's say the shorter piece is x feet long. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the longer piece is 4x feet long.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, and it's divided into two pieces. So, the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is 40 feet. We can write an equation to represent this:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

So, the shorter piece is 8 feet long. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the longer piece is 4x = 4(8) = 32 feet long.

"To find out how much seasoning Aiden needs, we first need to find out how many pounds of meat he needs to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can divide 80 by 16 to find the number of pounds of meat he needs.

80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds of meat

Now that we know he needs 5 pounds of meat, and he uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning per pound of meat, we can multiply the number of pounds by the amount of seasoning per pound.

5 pounds of meat * 2 tablespoons per pound = 10 tablespoons of seasoning

So, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret seasoning for the cookout.

"To find the total width of the windows, we need to multiply the width of one window by the number of windows. 

Width of one window = 35 inches
Number of windows = 5

Total width of windows = Width of one window * Number of windows
Total width of windows = 35 * 5
Total width of windows = 175 inches

Since Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, we need to multiply the total width by 2.

Fabric needed = 2 * Total width of windows
Fabric needed = 2 * 175
Fabric needed = 350 inches

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let's say the number of cupcakes Carly made is 'c'. Since she makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, the number of brownies she made is 3c - 2.

We know that each person gets 2 treats, and there are 5 people in the class. So, the total number of treats is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, which is c + (3c - 2). We can set up an equation to represent this:

c + (3c - 2) = 10

Combine like terms:

4c - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides:

4c = 12

Divide both sides by 4:

c = 3

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure first, then add the cost of the nail art.

The cost of the manicure is $35 and the cost of the pedicure is $40. 

The total cost of the manicure and pedicure is $35 + $40 = $75.

Since there are 10 fingers, the cost of the nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost of the manicure and pedicure with nail art is $75 + $30 = $105.

Since there's a 20% discount, we need to calculate 20% of $105. 
20% of $105 is 0.2 * $105 = $21.

The total cost after the discount is $105 - $21 = $84.

The final answer is: $84"

"To find the price of the toy after the discount in January, we need to follow the steps:

1. First, we need to find the price of the toy in December after the 80% increase. 
   The original price is $40. 
   An 80% increase means the price will be 40 + (40 * 0.8) = 40 + 32 = $72.

2. Now, we need to find the price of the toy in January after the 50% decrease from the price in December.
   The price in December is $72. 
   A 50% decrease means the price will be 72 - (72 * 0.5) = 72 - 36 = $36.

The final price of the toy after the discount in January is $36."
"To find the total amount of money Charlie will make, we need to calculate the amount he makes from the standard lessons and the veteran lessons separately, then add them together.

For the standard lessons, Charlie has 4 lessons at $80 each, so the total amount from standard lessons is 4 x $80 = $320.

For the veteran lessons, Charlie reduces his rate by 25%, so his new rate is 75% of $80, which is 0.75 x $80 = $60. He has 2 lessons at this rate, so the total amount from veteran lessons is 2 x $60 = $120.

Now, we add the total amount from standard lessons and veteran lessons: $320 + $120 = $440.

5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 minutes.

The final answer is: 30"
"Let's break down the information given. 

Dominick saw half as many robots as helmets. Since there are 20 helmets, the number of robots is half of 20, which is 10.

He also saw half as many helmets as footballs. Since there are 20 helmets, the number of footballs is twice the number of helmets, which is 40.

Now, we have the total number of robots (10), helmets (20), and footballs (40). To find the total number of items Dominick saw, we need to add these numbers together.

Total number of items = 10 (robots) + 20 (helmets) + 40 (football) = 70

The final answer is: 70"
"To find out how many calls Tim deals with in a day, we need to divide the total hours he spends at work by the time it takes to deal with one call. 

First, we need to convert the time it takes to deal with a call from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 15 minutes is 15/60 = 0.25 hours.

Now, we can divide the total hours Tim spends at work by the time it takes to deal with one call: 6 hours / 0.25 hours = 24 calls per day.

Since Tim works for 5 days a week, we multiply the number of calls he deals with in a day by the number of days he works: 24 calls/day * 5 days = 120 calls.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find out how long it will take for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings to dry with the new varnish, we need to multiply the time it takes for one painting by the number of paintings. 

Time for one painting with the new varnish = 12 minutes
Time for 6 paintings with the new varnish = 12 * 6 = 72 minutes

To find out how much longer it will take, we need to compare this to the time it would take with the old varnish. 

Time for one painting with the old varnish = 7 minutes
Time for 6 paintings with the old varnish = 7 * 6 = 42 minutes

Now, we subtract the time it would take with the old varnish from the time it will take with the new varnish to find the difference.

Difference in time = Time for 6 paintings with the new varnish - Time for 6 paintings with the old varnish
= 72 - 42
= 30 minutes

So, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry as it would with the old varnish.

"To find out how many cups of water Crista needs every day, we need to calculate the total amount of water needed for each type of plant and then add them up.

4 plants need half a cup of water each, so that's 4 x 0.5 = 2 cups.

8 plants need 1 cup of water each, so that's 8 x 1 = 8 cups.

The rest of the plants are 20 - 4 - 8 = 8 plants. They need a quarter of a cup of water each, so that's 8 x 0.25 = 2 cups.

"To find the total time it takes for Phineas to return home, we need to calculate the time it takes for him to cover the land part and the water part separately, then add them together.

Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, Phineas needs to cover 100 yards on land and 100 yards in water.

Time taken to cover the land part = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes

Time taken to cover the water part = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes

Total time taken = Time taken to cover the land part + Time taken to cover the water part = 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes

Since Bob needs 56 popsicle sticks and each box has 8 sticks, we can divide 56 by 8 to find out how many boxes he needs:

56 ÷ 8 = 7

So, Bob needs 7 boxes of popsicle sticks. 

Now, we need to find out the total cost. Each box costs $2.00, so we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box:

7 * $2.00 = $14.00

The final answer is: $14.00"
"Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone. If we let the cost of each additional phone be x, then the main phone costs 2x.

We also know that the main phone plan costs $20. Since the main phone costs 2x, we can set up the equation 2x = 20 to find the cost of each additional phone.

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2: x = 20 / 2 = 10.

Now that we know the cost of each additional phone is $10, we can find the total cost of the additional phones. There are 4 additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is 4x = 4 * 10 = 40.

Finally, we add the cost of the main phone to the cost of the additional phones to find the total cost of the phone plan: 20 + 40 = 60.

The final answer is: $60"
"To find out how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to first find out how many doughnuts he sells in a day and then multiply it by the number of days in June.

Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, Derrick makes 10 x 12 = 120 doughnuts every day.

The price of each doughnut is $2. So, the total amount of money Derrick makes in a day is 120 x $2 = $240.

June has 30 days. So, the total amount of money Derrick makes in June is $240 x 30 = $7200.

$47.00 x 5 = $235.00

The final answer is: $235.00"
"To find out how long it would take John to speak 10 pages, we first need to find out his new speaking speed in words per minute (WPM). 

His original speed is 150 WPM. After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster than his starting speed. 

New speed = 2.5 * 150 WPM = 375 WPM

Now, we need to find out how many words he needs to speak in total. Each page has 450 words, and he needs to speak 10 pages.

Total words = 450 words/page * 10 pages = 4500 words

Now, we can find out how long it would take him to speak 4500 words at 375 WPM.

Time = Total words / New speed
Time = 4500 words / 375 WPM
Time = 12 minutes

"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the total number of people he saw on the first three days and add it to the total number of people he saw on the rest of the week.

On the first day, Conor saw 50 people.

On the second day, there were 20 more people than on the first day, so the number of people on the second day is 50 + 20 = 70.

On the third day, the number of people was twice the number on the second day, so the number of people on the third day is 2 * 70 = 140.

The total number of people on the first three days is 50 + 70 + 140 = 260.

Since there are 7 days in a week, and Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the rest of the week, the total number of people he saw on the rest of the week is 60 * 4 = 240.

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 260 + 240 = 500.

The final answer is: 500"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop. 

In the next 30 seconds, three times the amount pop, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.

In the next 30 seconds, four times the initial popping rate pop, which is 4 * 20 = 80 kernels.

In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate is half of the past 30 seconds, which is 80 / 2 = 40 kernels.

So, the total number of kernels popped in the first 2 minutes is 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 kernels.

After Garrett takes the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds pop from the residual heat. This is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

The total number of kernels that popped is 200 + 10 = 210 kernels.

"Let's break down the information given. We know there are 4 blue blocks and twice as many yellow blocks, so the number of yellow blocks is 4 * 2 = 8.

We also know that the total number of blocks in the tower is 32. We can add the number of blue and yellow blocks to find out how many blocks are not red. 

4 (blue blocks) + 8 (yellow blocks) = 12 blocks that are not red.

Since the total number of blocks is 32, we can subtract the number of non-red blocks to find the number of red blocks.

32 (total blocks) - 12 (non-red blocks) = 20

So, there are 20 red blocks in the tower.

"To find out how far Elvis is from his house, we need to calculate the total distance he traveled. 

First, let's find the distance he traveled west. Distance = Speed * Time. Since Elvis was driving at 18mph for 5 hours, the distance he traveled west is 18 * 5 = 90 miles.

Then, Elvis turns around and drives east for 8 hours at the same speed. The distance he traveled east is 18 * 8 = 144 miles.

Since Elvis drove 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, we need to find the net distance from his house. To do this, we subtract the distance he traveled west from the distance he traveled east. Net distance = 144 - 90 = 54 miles.

So, Elvis is 54 miles away from his house now.

"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year and subtract it from the initial value.

Initial value of the boat = $9000

First year depreciation = 30% of $9000 = 0.3 * $9000 = $2700
Value after first year = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Second year depreciation = 30% of $6300 = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890
Value after second year = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Third year depreciation = 20% of $4410 = 0.2 * $4410 = $882
Value after third year = $4410 - $882 = $3528

The final value of the boat after three years is $3528.

"To find the number of pink candies, we need to first find the number of orange and yellow candies. 

We know there are 54 red candies. The problem states that there are twice as many orange candies as red candies. So, the number of orange candies is 2 * 54 = 108.

The problem also states that there are half as many yellow candies as red candies. So, the number of yellow candies is 54 / 2 = 27.

We know the total number of candies is 232. We can find the number of pink candies by subtracting the number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies.

Number of pink candies = Total number of candies - (Number of red candies + Number of orange candies + Number of yellow candies)

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. The original price of each T-shirt is $8. Jake buys 2 T-shirts, but he gets one of them 50% off. So, the cost of the first T-shirt is $8, and the cost of the second T-shirt is $8 * 0.5 = $4. The total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and Jake gets a 40% discount. The discount amount is $40 * 0.4 = $16. So, the cost of the shoes is $40 - $16 = $24.

Now, let's add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store. The total cost is $12 + $24 = $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"To find out how much money Ryan has, we need to calculate his total allowance and subtract the cost of the ice cream cones.

Ryan's allowance is $6 per week, and he did his chores for 3 weeks. So, his total allowance is 6 * 3 = $18.

He bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends at $1.25 each. Since there are 4 people in total, the cost of the ice cream cones is 4 * $1.25 = $5.

Now, let's subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from Ryan's total allowance: $18 - $5 = $13.

The cost of a movie ticket is $6.50. To find out how many tickets Ryan can buy, we need to divide the amount of money he has by the cost of a ticket: $13 ÷ $6.50 = 2.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total amount they spent, we need to add up the cost of all the items they bought.

Ellen bought a pair of leggings for $100 and a photo frame for $5. So, the total amount Ellen spent is $100 + $5 = $105.

Lani bought a pair of sunglasses for $30 and two bathrobes at $100 each. So, the total amount Lani spent on bathrobes is $100 + $100 = $200. Adding the sunglasses, Lani spent $30 + $200 = $230.

Now, we add the total amount Ellen spent to the total amount Lani spent: $105 + $230 = $335.

The final answer is: $335"
"To find the profit, we need to first find the cost of making one jar and then multiply it by 10. 

The cost of passion fruit for one jar is 2 pounds * $6 per pound = $12.
The cost of jackfruit for one jar is 1.5 pounds * $8 per pound = $12.
The cost of honey for one jar is 2 pounds * $10 per pound = $20.
The total cost of making one jar is $12 + $12 + $20 = $44.

Now, we need to find the total cost of making 10 jars. 
The total cost of making 10 jars is $44 * 10 = $440.

The total revenue from selling 10 jars is $50 * 10 = $500.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. 
Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $500 - $440
Profit = $60

The final answer is: $60"
"To find the total dollar amount in the jar, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and add them together.

A quarter is worth $0.25, so 32 quarters are worth 32 x $0.25 = $8.

A dime is worth $0.10, so 95 dimes are worth 95 x $0.10 = $9.50.

A nickel is worth $0.05, so 120 nickels are worth 120 x $0.05 = $6.

A penny is worth $0.01, so 750 pennies are worth 750 x $0.01 = $7.50.

Now, let's add the values together: $8 + $9.50 + $6 + $7.50 = $31.

The total dollar amount in the jar is $31.

The final answer is: $31"
"To find out how much money Janet has left, we need to add up the total amount she spent and subtract that from the amount her parents gave her.

First, let's add up the total amount she spent:

- Ice cream: $3.50
- Movie tickets (2 tickets): $7.50 x 2 = $15
- Bracelet: $8.50
Total spent: $3.50 + $15 + $8.50 = $27

Now, let's subtract the total amount she spent from the amount her parents gave her:

$40 (given by parents) - $27 (total spent) = $13

So, Janet has $13 left. 

13"
"To find out how much Josh makes in 2 weeks, we need to calculate how many days he is open and how many cars he services in that time.

Josh is open every day except Sunday and Wednesday, so he is open 5 days a week. In 2 weeks, he will be open for 5 days/week * 2 weeks = 10 days.

Since Josh services 3 cars a day, in 10 days, he will service 3 cars/day * 10 days = 30 cars.

Josh gets paid $4 per car, so in 2 weeks, he will make 30 cars * $4/car = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Randy starts with 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies. 

He ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor. So, he ate 1 oatmeal cookie, 1 chocolate chip cookie, and 1 sugar cookie. Now, he has:
- 9 - 1 = 8 oatmeal cookies
- 4 - 1 = 3 chocolate chip cookies
- 5 - 1 = 4 sugar cookies

He ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch. Now, he has:
- 8 - 2 = 6 oatmeal cookies
- 3 chocolate chip cookies (no change)
- 4 sugar cookies (no change)

He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends. Now, he has:
- 6 oatmeal cookies (no change)
- 3 chocolate chip cookies (no change)
- 4 - 2 = 2 sugar cookies

He bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner. Now, he has:
- 6 + 4 = 10 oatmeal cookies
- 3 + 4 = 7 chocolate chip cookies
- 2 + 4 = 6 sugar cookies

Now, let's count the total number of cookies Randy has: 10 + 7 + 6 = 23.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we need to calculate the amount he would get for the first half of the collection and the second half separately, then add them together.

Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers, so half of them would be 12 / 2 = 6.

For the first half, he would get $5 per toy, so 6 toys * $5 = $30.

For the second half, he would get $7 per toy, so 6 toys * $7 = $42.

To find the total amount, we add the two amounts together: $30 + $42 = $72.

The final answer is: $72"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many holes the dog digs in total and then subtract the holes that Nate fills in. 

The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes dug is 6 * 14 = 84 holes.

Now, let's find out how many holes Nate fills in per day. He fills in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night. So, the net number of holes Nate fills in per day is 9 - 6 = 3 holes.

To find out how many days it takes Nate to fill in all the holes, we divide the total number of holes by the net number of holes he fills in per day: 84 / 3 = 28 days.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find the number of weeks by dividing the total number of days by 7: 28 / 7 = 4 weeks.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the average enrollment at Butler High School, we need to multiply the average enrollment at Norman High School by 3/4. 

Average enrollment at Norman High School = 4000 students
Average enrollment at Butler High School = 4000 * (3/4) = 3000 students

Now, we need to find the difference in enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School.

Difference in enrollment = Average enrollment at Norman High School - Average enrollment at Butler High School
= 4000 - 3000
= 1000

The final answer is: 1000"
"To find out how many chocolate chip cookies the Adams family has made, we need to subtract the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies they've made.

Total cookies made = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

Chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies made - (Rainbow cookies + Oatmeal cookies)
= 7995 - (2595 + 3075)
= 7995 - 5670
= 2325

The Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies."
"Let's break down the information given:

- Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, which is 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.
- He gathered two more Petri dishes than requested, which is 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.
- He had the correct number of beakers, which is 7 beakers.
- The total number of items on the lab bench is 29.

We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

8 (test tubes) + 16 (Petri dishes) + x (beakers) = 29

Since Igor had the correct number of beakers, we can substitute 7 for x:

8 + 16 + 7 = 31

However, the total number of items is 29, not 31. This means that Igor lost some beakers. To find out how many beakers he lost, we need to find the difference between the total number of items he had (31) and the total number of items he should have had (29).

31 - 29 = 2

So, Igor lost 2 beakers.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws needed for the tables and subtract that from the total number of screws he has.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws, so each table needs 4 x 2 = 8 screws.

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws needed is 8 x 4 = 32 screws.

James has 40 screws, so to find out how many he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the total number of screws he has: 40 - 32 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we need to find the number of eggs in the second basket first. Since there are twice as many eggs in the second basket as in the first basket, and the first basket has 10 eggs, the second basket has 2 x 10 = 20 eggs.

Now, we add the number of eggs in the first basket to the number of eggs in the second basket: 10 + 20 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to find the amount raised by each girl and add them together.

Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, and Alexandra raises $430. So, Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750.

Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, and Sarah raises $300. So, Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, we add up the amounts raised by each girl: $750 (Kim) + $430 (Alexandra) + $700 (Maryam) + $300 (Sarah) = $2180.

The final answer is: $2180"
"Let's break down the information given. 

Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, but Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron. This means that if Aaron runs 1 mile, Vanessa runs 2 miles. 

Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, if Aaron runs 1 mile in x minutes, Vanessa would run 1 mile in 2x minutes. 

We know that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, and since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, we can say that Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes. 

Since Aaron runs 1 mile in x minutes, we can say that 2 miles is 2x minutes. We know that 2 miles is 16 minutes, so we can set up the equation 2x = 16. 

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 2, which gives us x = 8. This means that Aaron runs 1 mile in 8 minutes. 

Since Vanessa runs 1 mile in 2x minutes, and we know that x = 8, we can say that Vanessa runs 1 mile in 2(8) = 16 minutes. 

However, we know that Vanessa ran 4 miles, so we need to multiply the time it takes her to run 1 mile by 4. 16 * 4 = 64 minutes.

The final answer is: 64"
"To find out how much line the caretaker needs, we need to calculate the total amount of line required for the dock. 

First, we need to find out how much line is needed for the existing 200 feet of dock. Since the caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, we multiply 200 feet by 3.

200 feet * 3 feet/foot = 600 feet

Now, we know that the caretaker already has 6 feet of line. To find out how much more line he needs, we subtract the amount he already has from the total amount needed.

600 feet - 6 feet = 594 feet

So, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line.

The final answer is: 594"
"To find out how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to calculate their daily earnings and then multiply it by the number of days they are open.

First, let's calculate their daily earnings. They get 6 reservations a night, and each reservation includes 2 meals that cost $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine. 

Daily earnings = (6 reservations * 2 meals * $5) + (6 reservations * $5)
Daily earnings = (6 * 2 * $5) + (6 * $5)
Daily earnings = $60 + $30
Daily earnings = $90

Now, let's calculate their weekly earnings. They are open 2 days a week.

Weekly earnings = Daily earnings * 2
Weekly earnings = $90 * 2
Weekly earnings = $180

The final answer is: $180"
"To find out how much each watermelon was sold for, we need to first find out the cost price of each watermelon. 

The total cost of 50 watermelons is $80. 

Cost price of 1 watermelon = Total cost / Number of watermelons
Cost price of 1 watermelon = $80 / 50
Cost price of 1 watermelon = $1.60

Now, we need to find the selling price of each watermelon. The profit is 25% of the cost price.

Profit = 25% of $1.60
Profit = 0.25 * $1.60
Profit = $0.40

Selling price of 1 watermelon = Cost price + Profit
Selling price of 1 watermelon = $1.60 + $0.40
Selling price of 1 watermelon = $2

The selling price of each watermelon is $2."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. John had a son James when he was 19, so James is 19 years younger than John.
2. James is now twice as old as his sister Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years. This means that James is 2 * 12 = 24 years old now.
3. Since James is 24 years old now and he is 19 years younger than John, John is 24 + 19 = 43 years old now.
4. John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so the youngest son is 43 - 32 = 11 years old now.
5. In 3 years, the youngest son will be 11 + 3 = 14 years old.

"Let's break this problem down step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many oranges Ana and Jane can peel in an hour. 

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges.

Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

Now, we need to find out how many more oranges Ana has peeled than Jane. To do this, we subtract the number of oranges Jane peeled from the number of oranges Ana peeled: 20 - 15 = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how much Mark paid, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator and the labor cost.

First, let's find the cost of the radiator. The original price is $400, but Mark gets it for 80% off. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by 0.8 (which is the same as 80%).
 
$400 * 0.8 = $320

So, Mark pays $320 for the radiator.

Next, we need to find the labor cost. The mechanic works for 3 hours at $50 an hour. To find the total labor cost, we multiply the number of hours by the hourly rate.

3 hours * $50/hour = $150

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the labor cost to find the total amount Mark paid.

$320 (radiator) + $150 (labor) = $470

The final answer is: $470"
"Let's say the number of chickens is C and the number of cows is 20 - C (since there are 20 animals in total).

Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. We know that the total number of legs is 70. 

We can set up an equation to represent this situation: 2C + 4(20 - C) = 70

Simplifying the equation, we get: 2C + 80 - 4C = 70

Combine like terms: -2C + 80 = 70

Subtract 80 from both sides: -2C = -10

Divide both sides by -2: C = 5

So, there are 5 chickens on the farm. 

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

First, let's find the total number of slices. There are 7 pizzas, and each pizza is cut into 8 slices. 

Total number of slices = 7 pizzas * 8 slices/pizza = 56 slices

Now, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. There are 4 people in total, including Henry and his 3 friends.

Number of slices per person = Total number of slices / Number of people
= 56 slices / 4 people
= 14 slices per person

So, each person can have 14 slices.
