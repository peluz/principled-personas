"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to first determine how many eggs she has left after eating and baking. 

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast and bakes 4 for muffins, so she uses a total of 3 + 4 = 7 eggs. 

To find out how many eggs she has left, we subtract the number of eggs used from the total number of eggs laid: 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.

Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at $2 per egg. To find out how much she makes, we multiply the number of eggs sold by the price per egg: 9 * 2 = 18.

The final answer is: $18"
"To find the total number of bolts required, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber first. Since it's half the amount of blue fiber, and there are 2 bolts of blue fiber, we can calculate the white fiber as follows:

White fiber = 2 bolts (blue fiber) / 2 = 1 bolt

Now, we add the blue fiber and white fiber to get the total number of bolts:

Total bolts = 2 bolts (blue fiber) + 1 bolt (white fiber) = 3 bolts

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the profit Josh made, we first need to determine the increased value of the house after the repairs. 

The original value of the house was $80,000. Josh put in $50,000 in repairs, which increased the value of the house by 150%. 

To find the increased value, we can calculate 150% of the original value and add it to the original value. 

150% of $80,000 is 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000. 

The total value of the house after repairs is $80,000 (original value) + $120,000 (150% increase) = $200,000.

However, Josh only put in $80,000 in total ($80,000 for the house + $50,000 for repairs). To find the profit, we need to subtract the total amount Josh invested from the total value of the house after repairs.

Profit = Total value after repairs - Total amount invested
Profit = $200,000 - $80,000
Profit = $120,000

The final answer is: $120,000"
"To find the total number of meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total meters he runs in one sprint session and then multiply it by the number of sessions he has in a week.

Since James runs 3 sprints in one session, and each sprint is 60 meters, the total meters he runs in one session is:
3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/session

Since James runs 3 sessions a week, the total meters he runs in a week is:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

The final answer is: 540"
"To determine the total amount of feed needed for the final meal, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed given to the chickens throughout the day. 

In the morning, Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups of feed. In the afternoon, she gives them 25 cups of feed. The total amount of feed given so far is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

Since Wendi feeds each chicken 3 cups of feed per meal, and she has 20 chickens, the total amount of feed needed per meal is 3 * 20 = 60 cups.

However, since the total amount of feed given so far is 40 cups, we need to subtract this from the total amount of feed needed per meal to find out how much is left for the final meal. 

60 - 40 = 20 cups.

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining glasses. 

The first glass costs $5. 
The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3. 
The third glass costs 60% of $3, which is 0.6 * $3 = $1.8. 
We can see that the cost of each subsequent glass is 60% of the previous glass. 

The sequence of the cost of the glasses is: $5, $3, $1.8, $1.08, $0.64, $0.384, $0.2304, $0.13824, $0.082944, $0.0497664, $0.02986584, $0.017949504, $0.010794903, $0.00646784128, $0.003863960576, $0.0023281813456, $0.0014005088032.

To find the total cost, we need to sum up the cost of all the glasses. 
Total cost = $5 + $3 + $1.8 + $1.08 + $0.64 + $0.384 + $0.2304 + $0.13824 + $0.082944 + $0.0497664 + $0.02986584 + $0.017949504 + $0.010794903 + $0.00646784128 + $0.003863960576 + $0.0023281813456 + $0.0014005088032.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of sheep in Toulouse and Charleston first. 

Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, and Seattle has 20 sheep, we can calculate the number of sheep in Charleston as follows:
Charleston = 4 * Seattle = 4 * 20 = 80

Now, we know that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. So, we can calculate the number of sheep in Toulouse as follows:
Toulouse = 2 * Charleston = 2 * 80 = 160

Now, we have the number of sheep in Toulouse (160), Charleston (80), and Seattle (20). To find the total number of sheep, we add these numbers together:
Total = Toulouse + Charleston + Seattle = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260

The final answer is: 260"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. Carla downloads 40% of the 200 GB file at a rate of 2 GB/minute. 
   40% of 200 GB is 0.4 * 200 = 80 GB.
   Time taken to download 80 GB = 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

2. After 40 minutes, Windows forces a restart, and Carla has to restart the download from the beginning. 
   The remaining 60% of the file is 0.6 * 200 = 120 GB.
   Time taken to download 120 GB = 120 / 2 = 60 minutes.

3. The total time taken is the sum of the time taken to download the first 80 GB and the time taken to download the remaining 120 GB.
   Total time = 40 minutes + 60 minutes = 100 minutes.

The final answer is: 100"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance John travels to the point where he turns around, and the distance he travels back home.

First, let's calculate the distance John travels to the point where he turns around. He drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph. 

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 mph * 3 hours
Distance = 180 miles

Now, let's calculate the distance John travels back home. He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance during this time. Then, he drives for half an hour at 30 mph, and the remaining 2.5 hours at 80 mph.

Distance covered in the first half-hour = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 mph * 0.5 hours
Distance = 15 miles

Distance covered in the remaining 2.5 hours = Speed * Time
Distance = 80 mph * 2.5 hours
Distance = 200 miles

Total distance covered in the return trip = Distance covered in the first half-hour + Distance covered in the remaining 2.5 hours
Total distance = 15 miles + 200 miles
Total distance = 215 miles

Since John was 180 miles away from home when he turned around, the distance he is from home at the end of those 4 hours is the difference between the total distance covered in the return trip and the distance he was initially away from home.

Distance from home = Total distance covered in the return trip - Distance initially away from home
Distance from home = 215 miles - 180 miles
Distance from home = 35 miles

"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings are:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours, she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours. Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, so her overtime rate is:
$10/hour * 1.2 = $12/hour

Her earnings for the overtime hours are:
5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Total earnings for the week are the sum of her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours:
$400 + $60 = $460

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and then add them together.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, which is 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the downloads were reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which is 54. Then, we subtract 54 from 180 to get 126 downloads in the third month.

Now, we add the downloads for each month together: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

"To determine when Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the total cost and revenue for each year.

Initial cost of planting the tree: $90

Annual cost to water and feed the tree: $3

Annual revenue from selling lemons: 7 lemons/year * $1.5/lemon = $10.5/year

To find the break-even point, we need to calculate the total cost for each year and compare it to the total revenue.

Year 1:
Total cost: $90 (initial cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $93
Total revenue: $10.5
Since the total cost ($93) is greater than the total revenue ($10.5), Carlos is not earning money in the first year.

Year 2:
Total cost: $93 (previous year's cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $96
Total revenue: $10.5 (previous year's revenue) + $10.5 (current year's revenue) = $21
Since the total cost ($96) is greater than the total revenue ($21), Carlos is not earning money in the second year.

Year 3:
Total cost: $96 (previous year's cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $99
Total revenue: $21 (previous year's revenue) + $10.5 (current year's revenue) = $31.5
Since the total cost ($99) is greater than the total revenue ($31.5), Carlos is not earning money in the third year.

Year 4:
Total cost: $99 (previous year's cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $102
Total revenue: $31.5 (previous year's revenue) + $10.5 (current year's revenue) = $42
Since the total cost ($102) is greater than the total revenue ($42), Carlos is not earning money in the fourth year.

Year 5:
Total cost: $102 (previous year's cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $105
Total revenue: $42 (previous year's revenue) + $10.5 (current year's revenue) = $52.5
Since the total cost ($105) is greater than the total revenue ($52.5), Carlos is not earning money in the fifth year.

Year 6:
Total cost: $105 (previous year's cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $108
Total revenue: $52.5 (previous year's revenue) + $10.5 (current year's revenue) = $63
Since the total cost ($108) is greater than the total revenue ($63), Carlos is not earning money in the sixth year.

Year 7:
Total cost: $108 (previous year's cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $111
Total revenue: $63 (previous year's revenue) + $10.5 (current year's revenue) = $73.5
Since the total cost ($111) is greater than the total revenue ($73.5), Carlos is not earning money in the seventh year.

Year 8:
Total cost: $111 (previous year's cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $114
Total revenue: $73.5 (previous year's revenue) + $10.5 (current year's revenue) = $84
Since the total cost ($114) is greater than the total revenue ($84), Carlos is not earning money in the eighth year.

Year 9:
Total cost: $114 (previous year's cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $117
Total revenue: $84 (previous year's revenue) + $10.5 (current year's revenue) = $94.5
Since the total cost ($117) is greater than the total revenue ($94.5), Carlos is not earning money in the ninth year.

Year 10:
Total cost: $117 (previous year's cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $120
Total revenue: $94.5 (previous year's revenue) + $10.5 (current year's revenue) = $105
Since the total cost ($120) is greater than the total revenue ($105), Carlos is not earning money in the tenth year.

Year 11:
Total cost: $120 (previous year's cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $123
Total revenue: $105 (previous year's revenue) + $10.5 (current year's revenue) = $115.5
Since the total cost ($123) is greater than the total revenue ($115.5), Carlos is not earning money in the eleventh year.

Year 12:
Total cost: $123 (previous year's cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $126
Total revenue: $115.5 (previous year's revenue) + $10.5 (current year's revenue) = $126
Since the total cost ($126) is equal to the total revenue ($126), Carlos breaks even in the twelfth year.

However, to find the year when Carlos starts earning money, we need to consider the year after the break-even point.

The final answer is: 13"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume Melanie started with x vacuum cleaners.

At the green house, she sold a third of her vacuum cleaners, which is x/3.

At the red house, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners.

At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, which is (x - x/3 - 2)/2.

We know that after selling at all three houses, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the equation:

x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

To simplify the equation, let's first simplify the fraction (x - x/3 - 2)/2:

(x - x/3 - 2)/2 = (2x/3 - 6)/2 = x/3 - 3

Now, let's rewrite the equation:

x - x/3 - 2 - (x/3 - 3) = 5

Combine like terms:

x - 2x/3 - 2 + x/3 + 3 = 5

Combine like terms:

x - 2x/3 + x/3 + 3 - 2 = 5

Combine like terms:

x - x/3 + 1 = 5

Combine like terms:

(3x - x)/3 + 1 = 5

Combine like terms:

2x/3 + 1 = 5

Subtract 1 from both sides:

2x/3 = 4

Multiply both sides by 3/2:

x = 6

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to find the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance, and then subtract that from the total number of students.

20% of 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance:
20 * 0.2 = 4 students

The remaining students are 20 - 4 = 16 students.

25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:
16 * 0.25 = 4 students

The number of students enrolled in jazz dance is 4, and the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance is 4. So, the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance is 16 - 4 - 4 = 8 students.

To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100:
(8 / 20) * 100 = 40%

"To determine the profit, we need to calculate the potential value of each purchase at the end of the month. 

For the jewelry purchase: 
Initial value = $5,000
Market increase = 2.5%
Value at the end of the month = Initial value + (Initial value * Market increase)
= $5,000 + ($5,000 * 0.025)
= $5,000 + $125
= $5,125

For the electronic gadgets purchase: 
Initial value = $8,000
Market increase = 1.2%
Value at the end of the month = Initial value + (Initial value * Market increase)
= $8,000 + ($8,000 * 0.012)
= $8,000 + $96
= $8,096

Since the merchant wants to maximize profit, we need to choose the option with the higher value at the end of the month. 

$8,096 (electronic gadgets) > $5,125 (jewelry)

The merchant should choose the electronic gadgets. 

To calculate the profit, we need to know the cost of the electronic gadgets, which is $8,000. 

Profit = Value at the end of the month - Initial cost
= $8,096 - $8,000
= $96

The final answer is: $96"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance covered on the first day and the distance covered on the second day.

On the first day, both trains travel 80 miles westward. Since they are traveling in the same direction, they cover the same distance. Therefore, each train covers 80 miles on the first day.

On the second day, they travel northward, covering 150 miles. Again, since they are traveling in the same direction, they cover the same distance. Therefore, each train covers 150 miles on the second day.

To find the total distance covered by each train over the two days, we add the distances covered on each day:

Total distance covered by each train = 80 miles (first day) + 150 miles (second day) = 230 miles

"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:

- Hourly wage: $20
- Hours worked per week: 35
- Weeks worked per year: 50
- Total hours worked per year: 35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year
- Annual earnings from teaching: 1750 hours/year * $20/hour = $35,000/year

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:

- Hourly wage: $30
- Hours worked per week: 15
- Weeks worked per year: 50
- Total hours worked per year: 15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year
- Annual earnings from coaching: 750 hours/year * $30/hour = $22,500/year

Now, let's add her earnings from teaching and coaching to get her total annual salary:

"To find out how many eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in a week and then multiply it by 4.

Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning, so in a week, she eats 3 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 21 eggs/week.

In 4 weeks, she will eat 21 eggs/week * 4 weeks = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens she will eat in 4 weeks.

84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozens.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total time Marissa has taken so far and the total distance she has covered. 

She took 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles and another hour to walk the next 2 miles. So, the total time taken so far is 1 + 1 = 2 hours. 

The total distance covered so far is 4 + 2 = 6 miles.

Since Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail, we can calculate the total time she needs to take to cover the entire trail. 

Total time = Total distance / Average speed
Total time = 12 miles / 4 mph
Total time = 3 hours

Since she has already taken 2 hours, she has 3 - 2 = 1 hour left to cover the remaining distance.

The remaining distance is 12 - 6 = 6 miles.

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance, we can use the formula:

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Speed = 6 mph

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the amount of water in the orange drink, we first need to calculate the amount of water in 9 liters of the orange drink (since 10 liters - 1 liter spilled = 9 liters). 

Two-thirds of 10 liters is 10 * (2/3) = 20/3 = 6.67 liters. 

So, 9 liters of the orange drink is 9 * (2/3) = 6 liters of water.

Next, we need to find the amount of water in the pineapple drink. Three-fifths of 15 liters is 15 * (3/5) = 45/5 = 9 liters.

Now, we add the water from the orange and pineapple drinks: 6 liters + 9 liters = 15 liters.

The total volume of the mixture is 24 liters, so the fraction of water in the mixture is 15 liters / 24 liters.

To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we multiply the fraction of water by the total volume: 15/24 * 24 = 15 liters.

The final answer is: 15"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the age of Raymond when Samantha is 31 years old. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, we can calculate his age as follows:

Samantha's age = 31
Raymond's age = Samantha's age - 6
Raymond's age = 31 - 6
Raymond's age = 25

Now, we know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago his son was born, we need to subtract his age at the time of his son's birth from his current age:

Years since son's birth = Raymond's current age - Age at son's birth
Years since son's birth = 25 - 23
Years since son's birth = 2

Therefore, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago.

"To find the total number of DVDs sold by Billy, we need to calculate the number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers.

The first 3 customers buy one DVD each, so they bought a total of 3 DVDs.

The next 2 customers buy 2 DVDs each, so they bought a total of 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs.

The last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs.

To find the total number of DVDs sold, we add the number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers: 3 + 4 = 7.

Therefore, Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday.

"To find the original price of the book, we need to determine the amount of the discount and add it to the discounted price. 

Let's denote the original price as 'x'. Since Kyle bought the book with a 25% discount, the amount of the discount is 25% of the original price, which is 0.25x.

The discounted price is the original price minus the discount, so it is x - 0.25x = 0.75x.

We are given that the discounted price is $19.50. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

0.75x = 19.50

To solve for x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book was $26.

The final answer is: $26"
"To find the total cost of the items Marie ordered excluding the pizza, we need to calculate the cost of the chicken meal, the milk, and the apples.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3 = $15.
The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6.

The total cost of the items excluding the pizza is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the cost of the pizza boxes is $50 - $33 = $17.

To find the number of boxes of pizza, we need to divide the cost of the pizza by the cost of each box.

Number of boxes of pizza = $17 / $8.50 = 2.

"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream, we need to calculate the total number of cartons she buys and multiply it by the cost per carton.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she will go through 60 servings in 60 days. 

Each carton has 15 servings, so the total number of cartons she buys is 60 / 15 = 4.

The cost per carton is $4.00, so the total amount she spends is 4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00.

The final answer is: $16.00"
"To find the distance traveled between Henry's first and second stops, we need to determine the distance between the two stops. 

Henry's first stop was after 20 miles, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total distance of the trip is 60 miles, we can find the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip by subtracting 15 miles from 60 miles. 

60 miles - 15 miles = 45 miles

Now, we know that the distance from the first stop to the second stop is the difference between the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip and the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip.

Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip = 60 miles
Distance from the second stop to the end of the trip = 45 miles

Distance between the first and second stops = 60 miles - 45 miles
Distance between the first and second stops = 15 miles

However, this is the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip, not the distance between the two stops. To find the distance between the two stops, we need to subtract the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip from the distance from the first stop to the second stop.

Distance from the first stop to the second stop = 20 miles
Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip = 60 miles
Distance from the second stop to the end of the trip = 45 miles

Distance between the first and second stops = Distance from the first stop to the second stop - Distance from the second stop to the end of the trip
Distance between the first and second stops = 20 miles - 45 miles is incorrect, we need to find the distance from the first stop to the second stop.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the cost of the boots as B and the cost of the more expensive pair of heels as H. We know that the less expensive pair of heels costs $33. We also know that the more expensive pair of heels costs twice as much as the less expensive pair, so H = 2 * 33 = 66.

We are given that the two pairs of heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. This can be expressed as an equation: B = H + 33 + 66 - 5. 

Substituting the value of H into the equation, we get B = 66 + 33 + 66 - 5. 

Simplifying the equation, we get B = 160.

The final answer is: $160"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the current ages of Darrell and Allen. 

Let's assume the common ratio is x. Then, Darrell's age is 7x and Allen's age is 11x. 

The total age of Darrell and Allen is 162, so we can set up the equation: 7x + 11x = 162.

Combine like terms: 18x = 162.

Divide both sides by 18: x = 9.

Now that we know x, we can find the current ages of Darrell and Allen. Darrell's age is 7x = 7(9) = 63, and Allen's age is 11x = 11(9) = 99.

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age: 99 + 10 = 109.

The final answer is: 109"
"To find the average guess, we need to calculate the total number of guesses and divide it by the number of friends.

The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first one, which is (80 / 2) + 20 = 60.
The third friend guesses 25% more than the first one, which is 80 + (80 * 0.25) = 100.

Now, let's add up all the guesses: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

There are 3 friends, so we divide the total by 3 to find the average: 240 / 3 = 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the total hours John spends taking care of dogs per week, we need to calculate the total hours he spends per day and then multiply it by 7 (the number of days in a week).

First, let's find the total hours John spends per day: 
10 dogs * 0.5 hours per dog = 5 hours per day

Now, let's multiply the daily hours by 7 to find the total hours per week:
5 hours per day * 7 days per week = 35 hours per week

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of silver coins as S and the number of gold coins as G. We know that G = S + 30, since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We also know that the total number of coins is 110, so S + G = 110.

Substituting G = S + 30 into the second equation, we get S + (S + 30) = 110.

Combine like terms: 2S + 30 = 110.

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2S = 80.

Divide both sides by 2: S = 40.

Now that we know S = 40, we can find G by substituting S into the equation G = S + 30: G = 40 + 30 = 70.

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

The final answer is: 70"
"To find out how many jewels Siobhan has, we need to first determine how many jewels Aaron has. 

Since Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, we need to find half of Raymond's jewels. Raymond has 40 jewels, so half of that is 40 / 2 = 20. 

Now, we know Aaron has 5 more jewels than 20, so Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.

Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, so Siobhan has 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total points scored by Mike, we need to calculate the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes separately, and then add them together.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% of 4 points, we multiply 4 by 0.25, which is 1 point. So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Now, we add the points scored in both periods: 4 + 5 = 9 points.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to calculate the cost of the yogurts per day and then multiply it by 30.

First, let's find the cost of one yogurt. Since Terry eats 2 yogurts a day and they are on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00, we need to divide the total cost by the number of yogurts to find the cost of one yogurt.

Cost of 4 yogurts = $5.00
Cost of 1 yogurt = $5.00 / 4 = $1.25

Now, we know the cost of one yogurt is $1.25. Since Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, the cost of yogurts per day is:

Cost of 2 yogurts per day = 2 * $1.25 = $2.50

To find the total cost over 30 days, we multiply the cost of yogurts per day by 30:

Total cost over 30 days = $2.50 * 30 = $75.00

The final answer is: $75.00"
"To find out how many LEGO sets John still has, we need to determine how much money he made from selling the LEGO sets and then subtract the amount he spent on video games.

John sold 13 LEGO sets for $15 each, so the total amount of money he made is:
13 LEGO sets * $15 per set = $195

He then spent $20 per video game on 8 video games:
8 video games * $20 per game = $160

After buying the video games, he had $5 left, so the amount of money he had after buying the video games is:
$195 - $160 = $35

However, we know that he had $5 left after buying the video games, so the amount of money he had after buying the video games is actually $5 more than the amount he spent on video games. This means that the $35 is the amount he had before buying the video games, and the $5 is the change he got back.

So, the correct calculation is:
$195 - $160 = $35 (initial amount after selling LEGO sets)
$35 + $5 (change) = $40 (amount he had before buying video games)

Now, let's calculate how much money he spent on video games and the change he got back:
$40 (initial amount) - $160 (amount spent on video games) = -$120 (shortage)

However, this is not possible since he had $5 left. The correct calculation is:
$40 (initial amount) - $160 (amount spent on video games) = -$120 (shortage)
$5 (change) + $120 (shortage) = $125 (shortage + change)

Since he had $5 left, the correct calculation is:
$40 (initial amount) - $160 (amount spent on video games) = -$120 (shortage)
$5 (change) + $120 (shortage) = $125 (shortage + change)

However, this is still not correct. Let's re-evaluate the problem:
He had $5 left after buying the video games, so the amount he spent on video games is:
$160 (amount spent on video games) - $5 (change) = $155

Now, let's calculate how much money he made from selling the LEGO sets:
$155 (amount spent on video games) / $20 (price per video game) = 7.75 (number of video games)
Since he bought 8 video games, the amount he spent on video games is correct.

However, the amount he made from selling the LEGO sets is:
$155 (amount spent on video games) + $5 (change) = $160

Now, let's calculate how many LEGO sets he sold:
$160 (amount made from selling LEGO sets) / $15 (price per LEGO set) = 10.67 (number of LEGO sets)

Since he can't sell a fraction of a LEGO set, he must have sold 10 LEGO sets and had $10 left over:
$15 (price per LEGO set) * 10 (number of LEGO sets) = $150
$160 (amount made from selling LEGO sets) - $150 (amount made from 10 LEGO sets) = $10

However, this is not possible since he sold 13 LEGO sets. The correct calculation is:
$160 (amount made from selling LEGO sets) - $150 (amount made from 10 LEGO sets) = $10
$10 (amount left over) / $15 (price per LEGO set) = 0.67 (number of LEGO sets)

Since he can't sell a fraction of a LEGO set, he must have sold 10 LEGO sets and had $10 left over, and then he sold 3 more LEGO sets:
$15 (price per LEGO set) * 3 (number of LEGO sets) = $45
$10 (amount left over) + $45 (amount made from 3 LEGO sets) = $55

However, this is not possible since he made $160 from selling the LEGO sets. The correct calculation is:
$160 (amount made from selling LEGO sets) - $150 (amount made from 10 LEGO sets) = $10
$10 (amount left over) + $15 (price per LEGO set) = $25
$25 (amount left over) + $15 (price per LEGO set) = $40

"To find John's running speed, we need to calculate the total time he spends running in a week and then divide the total distance by that time.

First, let's find the total time John spends running in a week. He runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days. Half of 3 hours is 1.5 hours. So, he runs 1.5 hours on each of the other two days.

Total time spent running in a week = 3 hours (first day) + 1.5 hours (second day) + 1.5 hours (third day)
Total time spent running in a week = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5
Total time spent running in a week = 6 hours

Now, we can find John's running speed by dividing the total distance by the total time.

John's running speed = Total distance / Total time
John's running speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
John's running speed = 10 miles per hour

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine Dana's running and walking speeds. 

Given that Dana can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run, and she can skip at 3 miles per hour, we can calculate her running speed as follows:

Running speed = 2 * Skipping speed
Running speed = 2 * 3 miles per hour
Running speed = 6 miles per hour

Since Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, we can calculate her walking speed as follows:

Walking speed = Running speed / 4
Walking speed = 6 miles per hour / 4
Walking speed = 1.5 miles per hour

Now, we need to calculate the total distance Dana can travel in six hours. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. 

Time spent running = 6 hours * (1/3)
Time spent running = 2 hours
Time spent walking = 6 hours * (2/3)
Time spent walking = 4 hours

Distance traveled running = Speed * Time
Distance traveled running = 6 miles per hour * 2 hours
Distance traveled running = 12 miles

Distance traveled walking = Speed * Time
Distance traveled walking = 1.5 miles per hour * 4 hours
Distance traveled walking = 6 miles

Total distance traveled = Distance traveled running + Distance traveled walking
Total distance traveled = 12 miles + 6 miles
Total distance traveled = 18 miles

The final answer is: 18"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the age of Brandon's iPhone. 

First, we know that Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old. 
Since Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, we can calculate Ben's iPhone age as 2 * 1 = 2 years.

Next, we know that Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. 
So, we can calculate Brandon's iPhone age as 4 * 2 = 8 years.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the distance Polly can throw the javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone and then subtract the dragon's reach from that distance.

When Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone. Since she can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone, she can throw it 3 * 400 = 1200 feet with the gemstone.

The dragon's flames reach 1000 feet. To find the distance outside the dragon's reach where Polly can still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's reach from the distance Polly can throw with the gemstone: 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet.

"To find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we need to subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces initially available.

First, let's calculate the total number of pieces initially available. Since Grandma Jones baked 5 pies and cut each pie into 8 pieces, the total number of pieces is:

5 pies * 8 pieces/pie = 40 pieces

Now, we subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces to find out how many pieces were taken by the guests:

40 pieces (initially available) - 14 pieces (remaining) = 26 pieces

Therefore, the guests took 26 pieces of pie.

The final answer is: 26"
"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we first need to calculate how many calories you have left for the day. 

Your daily calorie target is 2000, and you have already consumed 1800 calories. 

2000 (daily target) - 1800 (calories consumed) = 200 calories left for the day.

Since each serving of chips has 250 calories, we need to find out how many servings you can have within your remaining calorie limit.

200 (calories left) / 250 (calories per serving) = 0.8 servings

Since a 300g bag has 5 servings, we need to find out how many grams are in 0.8 servings.

First, we find the total weight of one serving: 
300g (total weight) / 5 (servings) = 60g per serving

Now, we multiply the weight of one serving by the number of servings you can have:
60g (per serving) * 0.8 (servings) = 48g

"To find Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost.

First, let's calculate the total cost. Since one pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10.00, and Charlie makes 10 candles per pound, the cost per candle is $1.00 ($10.00 / 10 candles). 

For 20 candles, the total cost is 20 candles * $1.00 per candle = $20.00.

Next, let's calculate the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, so for 20 candles, the total revenue is 20 candles * $2.00 per candle = $40.00.

Now, we can calculate the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: $40.00 (revenue) - $20.00 (cost) = $20.00.

The final answer is: $20.00"
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply it by the average time it takes to write an article (4 hours).

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. To find 2/5 of 5, we multiply 5 by 2/5:
5 * (2/5) = 2
So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. To find twice the number of articles, we multiply 7 by 2:
7 * 2 = 14
So, she wrote 14 articles on Wednesday.

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles she wrote in the three days:
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles

Since each article takes 4 hours to write, we multiply the total number of articles by 4:
26 * 4 = 104

The final answer is: 104"
"To find the number of Post-it notes in the package Candice purchased, we need to determine how many Post-it notes she had after buying the package and before placing any on the cups.

Initially, Candice had 80 Post-it notes. After purchasing a package, she had 80 + x Post-it notes, where x is the number of Post-it notes in the package. After placing a Post-it note on each of the 220 cups, she had 80 + x - 220 Post-it notes remaining.

We are given that she had 23 Post-it notes remaining. So, we can set up the equation:

80 + x - 220 = 23

To solve for x, we need to isolate x:

x = 23 + 220 - 80
x = 163

Therefore, the number of Post-it notes in the package Candice purchased is 163.

The final answer is: 163"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of blue ties John bought and the cost of the red ties.

Since John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

Number of blue ties = Total cost of blue ties / Cost per blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is:

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
= 2 * 5
= 10

The cost of the red ties is 50% more than the cost of the blue ties. Since the blue ties cost $40 each, the cost of the red ties is:

Cost of red ties = Cost of blue ties + (50% of cost of blue ties)
= $40 + (0.5 * $40)
= $40 + $20
= $60

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the red ties:

Total cost of red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of red ties
= 10 * $60
= $600

The total amount John spent on ties is the sum of the cost of the blue ties and the cost of the red ties:

Total cost = Cost of blue ties + Total cost of red ties
= $200 + $600
= $800

The final answer is: $800"
"To find the number of pieces Tracy obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches, since the pieces are cut in inches. 

1 foot is equal to 12 inches. 

So, 4 feet is equal to 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Now, we need to divide the total length of the wire (48 inches) by the length of each piece (6 inches) to find the number of pieces.

Number of pieces = Total length / Length of each piece
= 48 / 6
= 8

"To find the total number of units in the building, we need to multiply the number of floors by the number of units per floor. 

Number of floors: 15
Number of units per floor: 8

Total units = Number of floors * Number of units per floor
Total units = 15 * 8
Total units = 120

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we need to find 1/4 of the total units to determine the number of unoccupied units.

1/4 of the total units = (1/4) * Total units
1/4 of the total units = (1/4) * 120
1/4 of the total units = 30

The total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"To find out how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to calculate the total number of eggs produced per week and then multiply it by the price per dozen.

First, let's calculate the total number of eggs produced per week:
252 eggs per day * 7 days per week = 1764 eggs per week

Since Lloyd sells eggs by the dozen, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens:
1764 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 147 dozen eggs per week

Now, let's calculate the total revenue per week:
147 dozen eggs per week * $2 per dozen = $294 per week

"To find the total time it takes for Tom to travel back, we need to first determine the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM. 

Since we don't know the exact distance, let's assume the distance from 1 to 4 PM is 'd' miles. 

The time taken to travel from 1 to 4 PM can be calculated as distance divided by speed. So, the time taken to travel from 1 to 4 PM is d / 10 hours.

The time from 1 to 4 PM is 3 hours. Therefore, d / 10 = 3. This means d = 30 miles.

Now, we know the distance is 30 miles and the speed is 6 mph. The time taken to travel back can be calculated as distance divided by speed. So, the time taken to travel back is 30 / 6 = 5 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he removes 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books removed is:

30 * (1/4) = 30/4 = 7.5 pounds

Since Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds, the remaining weight that needs to be removed from toys is:

15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, the number of toys that need to be removed is:

7.5 / (1/2) = 7.5 * 2 = 15

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the revenue earned by the mechanic on each day, we need to calculate the total revenue from truck tire repairs and car tire repairs separately for both days.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. The revenue from truck tire repairs is 6 * $60 = $360. The revenue from car tire repairs is 4 * $40 = $160. The total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires. The revenue from car tire repairs is 12 * $40 = $480. Since there were no truck tire repairs, the total revenue on Friday is $480.

To find the day with higher revenue, we compare the revenues: $520 (Thursday) and $480 (Friday). Thursday has higher revenue.

Now, to find how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we subtract the lower revenue from the higher revenue: $520 - $480 = $40.

"To find the number of bags Jean can fill, we need to first determine the number of lollipops remaining after Jean eats 2. 

Jean starts with 30 lollipops and eats 2, so the number of lollipops remaining is 30 - 2 = 28.

Since Jean wants to package 2 lollipops in one bag, we need to divide the number of remaining lollipops by 2 to find the number of bags.

28 Ã· 2 = 14

Therefore, Jean can fill 14 bags with the remaining lollipops.

"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to follow the order of operations. 

First, we need to calculate the 25% fee on the final total of $40.00. To do this, we multiply $40.00 by 0.25 (which is the decimal equivalent of 25%).

$40.00 * 0.25 = $10.00

Next, we add the delivery fee of $3.00 to the 25% fee of $10.00.

$10.00 + $3.00 = $13.00

Now, we add the 25% fee and the delivery fee to the original total of $40.00.

$40.00 + $13.00 = $53.00

Finally, we add the $4.00 tip to the new total of $53.00.

"To calculate Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to determine the value of the pension after 30 years and then apply the 5% increase.

Marcy works for 30 years, but she only becomes entitled to the 5% increase after 20 years. So, for the first 20 years, she gets the standard $50,000 annual pension. 

For the next 10 years (years 21-30), she gets 5% of the value of the pension per year. 

First, we need to calculate the value of the pension after 20 years. Since the pension is $50,000 per year, the total value of the pension after 20 years is $50,000 * 20 = $1,000,000.

Now, we need to calculate 5% of the value of the pension, which is $1,000,000. 5% of $1,000,000 is $50,000.

So, for the next 10 years, Marcy gets $50,000 + $50,000 = $100,000 per year.

Therefore, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years will be $100,000.

The final answer is: $100,000."
"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to find the amount she paid for the first half of the year and the second half of the year separately, and then add them together.

The first half of the year is 6 months, and the second half of the year is also 6 months. 

The initial amount charged per month is $140. 

For the first half of the year, Aleena paid 6 * $140 = $840.

For the second half of the year, the company charged her 10% less than the initial amount. To find the amount charged for the second half, we need to calculate 10% of $140 and subtract it from $140.

10% of $140 = 0.1 * $140 = $14.

The amount charged for the second half of the year is $140 - $14 = $126.

The total amount Aleena paid for the second half of the year is 6 * $126 = $756.

The total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $840 + $756 = $1596.

The final answer is: $1596"
"To determine how far Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to find out how many miles she can drive per gallon. We know that she has traveled 100 miles since her last fill-up and that it took 4 gallons to fill up her tank again. 

First, let's find out how many miles she can drive per gallon. We can do this by dividing the total distance she has traveled (100 miles) by the amount of gas she used (4 gallons). 

100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon

Now that we know Sophia's car gets 25 miles per gallon, we can find out how far she can drive on a full tank by multiplying the miles per gallon by the total capacity of her tank (12 gallons).

25 miles per gallon * 12 gallons = 300 miles

Therefore, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas.

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the total time spent on TV and reading, we need to calculate the time spent in one week and then multiply it by 4.

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV. 
He then reads for half as long, which is 2 / 2 = 1 hour.

So, in one day, he spends 2 + 1 = 3 hours on TV and reading.

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total time spent in one week is 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

To find the total time spent in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly time by 4: 9 * 4 = 36 hours.

The final answer is: 36"
"To find the total number of people sent by the schools, we need to calculate the number of students and coaches for both girls' and boys' teams.

Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys'), and each team has 5 players. So, the total number of students from each school is 2 teams * 5 players/team = 10 players.

Each school also has 2 coaches, one for each team. So, the total number of coaches from each school is 2 coaches.

Now, we multiply the number of students and coaches from each school by the total number of schools to find the total number of people sent by all schools.

Total number of students = 10 players/school * 4 schools = 40 players
Total number of coaches = 2 coaches/school * 4 schools = 8 coaches

Total number of people = Total number of students + Total number of coaches = 40 + 8 = 48

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the total number of gems, we need to calculate the number of rubies and emeralds first.

Number of diamonds = 175
Number of rubies = Number of diamonds - 35
= 175 - 35
= 140

Number of emeralds = 2 * Number of rubies
= 2 * 140
= 280

Total number of gems = Number of diamonds + Number of rubies + Number of emeralds
= 175 + 140 + 280

The final answer is: 595"
"To find the number of teachers, we first need to determine the total number of students. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, the number of boys is 2 * 60 = 120. 

The total number of students is the sum of boys and girls, which is 60 + 120 = 180. 

Since there are 5 students to every teacher, we can find the number of teachers by dividing the total number of students by 5. 

Number of teachers = Total number of students / 5
= 180 / 5
= 36

The final answer is: 36"
"To find out how much money Bailey started with, we need to subtract the total amount she received from her weekly allowance from the total amount she has at the end of 8 weeks.

Let's break it down:

- Bailey receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks, so the total amount she received from her allowance is $5 * 8 = $40.
- At the end of 8 weeks, she has a total of $100.

Now, let's subtract the total amount she received from her allowance from the total amount she has:

$100 (total amount) - $40 (total allowance) = $60

So, Bailey started with $60.

The final answer is: $60"
"To calculate Judy's total earnings in a week, we need to calculate her earnings from weekdays and weekends separately and then add them together.

Judy teaches 5 classes per day on weekdays, and there are 5 weekdays in a week. So, she teaches a total of 5 * 5 = 25 classes on weekdays.

On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes.

In total, Judy teaches 25 + 8 = 33 classes in a week.

Each class has 15 students, and she charges $15 per student. So, her total earnings per class are 15 * 15 = $225.

To find Judy's total earnings in a week, we multiply her total classes by her earnings per class: 33 * 225 = $7425.

The final answer is: $7425"
"To find the total number of instructions, we need to add the number of instructions in the first recipe to the number of instructions in the second recipe.

The first recipe has 20 instructions. 
The second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one, so it has 2 * 20 = 40 instructions.

"To calculate the total amount Shiela will pay each month, we need to first calculate the total cost of the cell phones with the interest.

The cost of 5 cell phones at $150 each is 5 x $150 = $750.

A 2% interest will be charged on the total cost of $750. To calculate the interest, we multiply $750 by 2% (or 0.02).

Interest = $750 x 0.02 = $15

The total amount Shiela will pay for the cell phones with interest is $750 (cost) + $15 (interest) = $765.

Since the payment is for 3 months, we need to divide the total amount by 3 to find the monthly payment.

Monthly payment = $765 / 3 = $255

"To find the average square footage of a level, we need to first find the total square footage of the sandcastle and then divide it by the number of levels.

Since each level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can start with the top level and work our way down:

Level 1 (top): 16 square feet
Level 2: 16 / 2 = 8 square feet
Level 3: 8 / 2 = 4 square feet
Level 4 (bottom): 4 / 2 = 2 square feet

Now, we add up the square footage of all levels to find the total square footage:
16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30 square feet

Since there are 4 levels, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels to find the average square footage per level:
30 / 4 = 7.5

The final answer is: 7.5"
"To find the total number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total number of cups of dog food the puppy will eat in the first year and then divide it by the number of cups in a bag.

First, let's calculate the number of cups the puppy will eat in the first 180 days. Since the puppy eats 1 cup of dog food every day for 180 days, the total number of cups is:

1 cup/day * 180 days = 180 cups

Next, let's calculate the number of days in a year. There are 365 days in a year.

Now, let's calculate the number of cups the puppy will eat after the first 180 days. Since the puppy eats 2 cups of dog food every day for the rest of its life, we need to subtract the first 180 days from the total number of days in a year:

365 days - 180 days = 185 days

The puppy will eat 2 cups of dog food every day for 185 days, so the total number of cups is:

2 cups/day * 185 days = 370 cups

Now, let's add the number of cups the puppy will eat in the first 180 days and the number of cups it will eat after the first 180 days:

180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, we can divide the total number of cups by the number of cups in a bag to find the total number of bags:

550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the amount of laundry done by Raymond and David.

Since Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, and she does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can find the amount of laundry done by David by dividing 400 by 4.

David's laundry = 400 / 4 = 100 pounds

Since Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, we can find the amount of laundry done by Raymond by dividing 400 by 2.

Raymond's laundry = 400 / 2 = 200 pounds

Now, we need to find the difference in the amount of laundry done by Raymond and David.

Difference = Raymond's laundry - David's laundry
= 200 - 100
= 100 pounds

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the better price, we need to calculate the cost per flower for each package option.

For the package of 3 flowers for $2.50, the cost per flower is:
$2.50 / 3 flowers = $0.8333 per flower

For the package of 2 flowers for $1, the cost per flower is:
$1 / 2 flowers = $0.50 per flower

Since $0.50 per flower is less than $0.8333 per flower, the package of 2 flowers for $1 is the better option.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price:
18 flowers * $0.50 per flower = $9

To find the cost of buying 18 flowers at the original price, we need to determine which package option to use. Since 18 is not a multiple of 3, we can't buy 18 flowers in packages of 3. However, we can buy 18 flowers in packages of 2 and 6 (6 packages of 3 would be 18 flowers). 

6 packages of 3 flowers for $2.50 each = 6 * $2.50 = $15
6 packages of 3 flowers for $2.50 each = 18 flowers
Cost per flower = $15 / 18 flowers = $0.8333 per flower

However, we can also buy 9 packages of 2 flowers for $1 each = 9 * $1 = $9
9 packages of 2 flowers for $1 each = 18 flowers
Cost per flower = $9 / 18 flowers = $0.50 per flower

Since $0.50 per flower is less than $0.8333 per flower, the package of 2 flowers for $1 is the better option.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of buying 18 flowers at the original price:
9 packages of 2 flowers for $1 each = $9

The amount of money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price is:
$9 (original price) - $9 (better price) = $0"
"To find the cost of the grooming after the discount, we need to calculate 30% of the original price and subtract it from the original price.

"To find the amount of water left, we first need to determine how much water the two girls received. Each girl got 1/6 of 24 liters. 

1/6 of 24 liters is calculated as: (1/6) * 24 = 4 liters. Since there are two girls, they received a total of 2 * 4 = 8 liters.

Now, we subtract the amount of water the girls received from the total amount of water: 24 - 8 = 16 liters.

After that, the boy received 6 liters of water. To find the amount of water left, we subtract the boy's share from the remaining water: 16 - 6 = 10 liters.

Initially, Charlie had 10 stickers.

He bought 21 stickers from a store, so now he has 10 + 21 = 31 stickers.

He got 23 stickers for his birthday, so now he has 31 + 23 = 54 stickers.

Then, he gave 9 stickers to his sister, so now he has 54 - 9 = 45 stickers.

Finally, he used 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card, so now he has 45 - 28 = 17 stickers.

Therefore, Charlie has 17 stickers left.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of games the team lost as 'L' and the number of games they won as 'W'. We know that the total number of games played is 22, so we can write the equation:

L + W = 22

We are also given that the team won 8 more games than they lost, so we can write another equation:

W = L + 8

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first one:

L + (L + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:

2L + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2L = 14

Divide both sides by 2:

L = 7

Now that we know the team lost 7 games, we can find the number of games they won by substituting L into the second equation:

W = L + 8
W = 7 + 8
W = 15

The team won 15 games.

"To determine Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate her salary after the 5th year and then calculate the increase for the next three years.

Initially, Sylvie's salary is $600. 

After 5 years, her salary is increased by 10% of $600 for each year. 
Year 1: $600 * 0.10 = $60, $600 + $60 = $660
Year 2: $660 * 0.10 = $66, $660 + $66 = $726
Year 3: $726 * 0.10 = $72.60, $726 + $72.60 = $798.60
Year 4: $798.60 * 0.10 = $79.86, $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46
Year 5: $878.46 * 0.10 = $87.85, $878.46 + $87.85 = $966.31

Now, for the next three years, her salary will continue to increase by 10% of the current salary.

Year 6: $966.31 * 0.10 = $96.63, $966.31 + $96.63 = $1062.94
Year 7: $1062.94 * 0.10 = $106.29, $1062.94 + $106.29 = $1169.23
Year 8: $1169.23 * 0.10 = $116.92, $1169.23 + $116.92 = $1286.15

Her annual salary after three more years of service is $1286.15."
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as H and the number of copies Marilyn sold as M.

We know that Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so we can write this as:

M = 10H

We also know that they sold 88,000 copies combined, so we can write this as:

M + H = 88,000

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

10H + H = 88,000

Combine like terms:

11H = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:

H = 8,000

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

"To find out how many gift bags Christina needs, we first need to calculate the number of guests she expects to attend. Since 1/4 of the invited guests don't show up, we can find the number of expected attendees by subtracting 1/4 from the total number of invited guests.

Number of invited guests = 16
Number of guests not showing up = 1/4 * 16 = 4
Number of expected attendees = 16 - 4 = 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we multiply the number of expected attendees by 0.75 to find the total number of gift bags needed.

Number of gift bags needed = 12 * 0.75 = 9

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of gift bags needed by the cost per gift bag.

Cost per gift bag = $2
Total cost = 9 * $2 = $18

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it takes Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles before his diet change. Since Lee runs 2 seconds faster than Gerald, we can set up an equation:

Lee's time = Gerald's time + 2

We are given that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds. So, we can substitute this value into the equation:

38 = Gerald's time + 2

To find Gerald's time, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

Gerald's time = 38 - 2
Gerald's time = 36

Now, we know that Gerald's diet improved his speed by 10%. To find his new time, we need to calculate 10% of his original time and subtract it from his original time. 

10% of 36 is 0.1 x 36 = 3.6

Gerald's new time = Original time - (10% of original time)
Gerald's new time = 36 - 3.6
Gerald's new time = 32.4

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of cats, then the number of rabbits, and finally add them up with the number of dogs to get the total number of pets.

Given that there are two cats for every dog, and the number of dogs is 60, we can find the number of cats by multiplying the number of dogs by 2.

Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
= 2 * 60
= 120

Now, we know that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. We can find the combined number of dogs and cats by adding the number of dogs and cats.

Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
= 60 + 120
= 180

Now, we can find the number of rabbits by subtracting 12 from the combined number of dogs and cats.

Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
= 180 - 12
= 168

Finally, we can find the total number of pets in the neighborhood by adding the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits.

Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits

"To find the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we need to first determine the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam. 

We know that 20 cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. Since 5 cars took an exit, we need to subtract these from the total number of cars to find the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam. 

Total number of cars = 30
Cars that took an exit = 5
Cars that drove through the traffic jam = Total number of cars - Cars that took an exit
Cars that drove through the traffic jam = 30 - 5 = 25

Now, we know that 20 cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. To find the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes, we need to subtract 20 from the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam.

On weekends, John drinks 3 glasses of water (one with breakfast, lunch, and one before bed) and 1 glass of soda with dinner. So, he drinks 3 glasses of water on each weekend day. Since there are 2 weekend days, he drinks 3 * 2 = 6 glasses of water on weekends.

Now, we add the total number of glasses of water John drinks on weekdays and weekends: 20 (weekdays) + 6 (weekends) = 26.

The final answer is: 26"
"To find the time it takes for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to determine how many 3-mile sections the city is divided into and then multiply that by the time it takes to cover each section.

The city is 42 miles across, and the fog bank covers 3 miles every 10 minutes. 

To find the number of 3-mile sections, we divide the total distance by the length of each section: 
42 miles / 3 miles per section = 14 sections

Now, we multiply the number of sections by the time it takes to cover each section:
14 sections * 10 minutes per section = 140 minutes

The final answer is: 140"
"To find out how many pieces are left to be placed, we first need to determine how many pieces Poppy and her mom have placed. 

Poppy places a quarter of the 1000 pieces, which is 1000 * 0.25 = 250 pieces. 

Now, there are 1000 - 250 = 750 pieces left. 

Her mom places a third of the remaining 750 pieces, which is 750 * (1/3) = 250 pieces. 

Now, we subtract the pieces her mom placed from the remaining pieces: 750 - 250 = 500 pieces.

So, there are 500 pieces left to be placed. 

The final answer is: 500"
"To find the total number of cookies eaten by both Cody and Amir, we first need to determine how many cookies Cody eats. Since Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir, and Amir eats 5 cookies, we can calculate Cody's cookie consumption as follows:

Cody's cookies = 3 * Amir's cookies
Cody's cookies = 3 * 5
Cody's cookies = 15

Now, to find the total number of cookies eaten by both Cody and Amir, we add their individual cookie consumption:

Total cookies = Cody's cookies + Amir's cookies
Total cookies = 15 + 5
Total cookies = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to find the inner volume of one box and then multiply it by 3.

The dimensions of the box are given as 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches, but the walls are 1 inch thick. This means that the inner dimensions of the box will be (5-2) inches by (6-2) inches by (4-2) inches, since 1 inch is subtracted from each side for the wall thickness.

So, the inner dimensions of the box are 3 inches by 4 inches by 2 inches.

The formula to find the volume of a rectangular prism is length x width x height. 

Inner volume of one box = 3 x 4 x 2 = 24 cubic inches.

Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes = 24 x 3 = 72 cubic inches.

The final answer is: 72"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 2 episodes of a 1-hour show, which is 2 * 1 = 2 hours.

On Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. Let's call the number of episodes x. Since each episode is 30 minutes, the total time he watched on Wednesday is 30x minutes.

On Thursday, he watched 1 hour (60 minutes) and 1 30-minute show, for a total of 90 minutes.

On Friday, he watched 2 episodes of a 1-hour show, which is 2 * 1 = 2 hours.

The total time Frankie watched TV is 7 hours, which is 7 * 60 = 420 minutes.

We can set up an equation to represent the total time Frankie watched TV:

2 + 30x + 90 + 120 = 420

Combine like terms:

30x + 212 = 420

Subtract 212 from both sides:

30x = 208

Divide both sides by 30:

x = 6.93

Since we can't have a fraction of an episode, we'll round down to the nearest whole number, as Frankie can't watch a fraction of an episode. However, in this case, we are looking for the number of 30-minute episodes, and the question does not specify that we must round down. Therefore, we can consider the exact value of x.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as 'x'. Since Henry wants to make twice as many cookies this year, he plans to bake 2x cookies.

However, he actually baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the actual number of cookies he baked is 2x + 15.

After dropping 5 cookies, he has a total of 110 cookies. This can be represented as:

2x + 15 - 5 = 110

Combine like terms:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2x = 100

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 50

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total cost of gas after the cashback rewards, we need to first calculate the total cost of gas without the rewards, and then subtract the cashback amount.

The cost of gas per gallon is $3.00, and the person is buying 10 gallons. 

Total cost of gas = cost per gallon * number of gallons
Total cost of gas = $3.00 * 10
Total cost of gas = $30.00

The cashback reward is $0.20 per gallon, and the person is buying 10 gallons.

Total cashback = cashback per gallon * number of gallons
Total cashback = $0.20 * 10
Total cashback = $2.00

Now, we subtract the total cashback from the total cost of gas to find the final cost.

Final cost = Total cost of gas - Total cashback
Final cost = $30.00 - $2.00
Final cost = $28.00

The final answer is: $28.00"
"To find the total number of fruit roll-ups eaten by each person, we need to multiply the width and length of each roll-up. 

Beatrice's roll-up is 2 roll-ups wide and 24 rolls long, so the total number of roll-ups is 2 * 24 = 48.

Marcell's roll-up is 3 roll-ups wide and 14 rolls long, so the total number of roll-ups is 3 * 14 = 42.

To find the average number of roll-ups eaten, we need to add the total number of roll-ups eaten by each person and divide by 2. 

Total roll-ups eaten = 48 + 42 = 90

Average roll-ups eaten = Total roll-ups eaten / 2 = 90 / 2 = 45

The final answer is: 45"
"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to calculate the rate at which the boat is taking on water and then multiply it by the total time it took to reach the shore.

First, let's find the rate at which the boat is taking on water. It takes 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, and it takes 16 seconds to row 20 feet. 

Since 20 feet is twice 10 feet, the boat will take on twice the amount of water in the same time. So, for 20 feet, the boat takes on 2 * 2 = 4 liters of water in 16 seconds.

Now, we need to find out how many 20-foot intervals are there in 64 seconds. To do this, we divide 64 seconds by 16 seconds: 64 / 16 = 4.

Since there are 4 intervals of 20 feet in 64 seconds, and the boat takes on 4 liters of water in each 20-foot interval, the total amount of water the boat takes on is 4 * 4 = 16 liters.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we need to calculate the total number of lessons and then multiply it by the number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per lesson.

Each teacher has 2 lessons per day, and there are 4 teachers. So, the total number of lessons per day is 4 teachers * 2 lessons/teacher = 8 lessons.

The whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson. Therefore, the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day is 8 lessons * 3 cleanings/lesson = 24 cleanings.

The final answer is: 25"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. If Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, then Brittany's phone can hold 1800 / 6 = 300 photographs.

2. The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Let's denote the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as 'x'. Then, 50x = 300.

3. To find the value of 'x', we need to solve the equation 50x = 300. Dividing both sides by 50, we get x = 300 / 50 = 6.

Therefore, the number of ducks that can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo is 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To calculate Sasha's profit, we need to first calculate the total cost of the lumber and the total selling price. 

The total cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $10 = $100. 
The total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $16 = $80. 
The total cost of all the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since prices have gone up by 50%, the new price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each. 
The new price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 each.

The total selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $15 = $150. 
The total selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $24 = $120. 
The total selling price of all the lumber is $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit is the total selling price minus the total cost, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, we need to determine the total parts in the ratio and then find the fraction of the total that represents the sugar. 

The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, so the total parts in the ratio are 7 + 13 = 20.

Since Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and water, we can set up a proportion to find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar:

(7/20) = x/120

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

7 * 120 = 20x
840 = 20x
x = 840 / 20
x = 42

So, John paid a total of $360."
"To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we first need to determine the total number of vehicles already present at the port before the second day. 

Initially, there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles on the first day is 2 * 5 = 10.

On the second day, the total number of vehicles became 30. To find the number of vehicles brought in on the second day, we subtract the initial number of vehicles from the total number of vehicles on the second day: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we divide the number of vehicles brought in on the second day by 5 to find the number of containers: 20 / 5 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Lylah's original salary and then calculate their salaries four years later.

Let's assume Lylah's original salary is x.

Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can express Adrien's original salary as 1.3x.

We are given that Adrien's original salary was $40000, so we can set up the equation:

1.3x = 40000

To find x, we can divide both sides by 1.3:

x = 40000 / 1.3
x = 30769.23

So, Lylah's original salary was approximately $30769.23.

Now, let's calculate their salaries four years later. We are given that Adrien's salary increased by 40% from four years ago. We can express his new salary as 1.4 times his original salary:

Adrien's new salary = 1.4 * 40000
Adrien's new salary = 56000

Since their salaries increased simultaneously, Lylah's salary also increased by 40% from four years ago. We can express her new salary as 1.4 times her original salary:

Lylah's new salary = 1.4 * 30769.23
Lylah's new salary = 43055.52

Now, we can find the total salary of both Adrien and Lylah four years later:

Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary
Total salary = 56000 + 43055.52
Total salary = 99055.52

Kael brought half the number of oranges as Morisette, so Kael brought 8 / 2 = 4 oranges.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits each person brought:
Morisette: 5 apples + 8 oranges = 13 fruits
Kael: 10 apples + 4 oranges = 14 fruits

The total number of fruits they have is 13 + 14 = 27.

"To find the total number of hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we need to calculate her sleep hours for each day and add them up.

On Monday, Sadie slept 8 hours.

For the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday), she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours each day.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Sunday), she slept 1 hour more than the previous two days, so she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours each day.

Now, let's calculate the total hours for each period:

- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday and Wednesday: 2 days * 6 hours = 12 hours
- Thursday to Sunday: 5 days * 7 hours = 35 hours

Adding up the total hours: 8 + 12 + 35 = 55 hours

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the initial number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. Let's denote the initial number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters as 'x'.

We know that Jennie puts stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, which means she stamps 60 / 3 = 20 letters.

After stamping 20 letters, the total number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters is 30. This is the sum of the initial number of letters in the pile (x) and the 20 letters Jennie stamped.

So, we can set up the equation: x + 20 = 30.

To find the initial number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters, we need to solve for x.

Total number of cars = 20
Number of automatic cars = 12
Number of manual cars = 4

Number of semi-automatic cars = Total number of cars - (Number of automatic cars + Number of manual cars)
= 20 - (12 + 4)
= 20 - 16
= 4

Now, we can find the percentage of semi-automatic cars:
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100
= (4 / 20) * 100
= 0.2 * 100
= 20%

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W.

We are given that there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so B = 2Q.

We are also given that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so W = 2B.

We know that the total number of bees in the hive is 700, so Q + B + W = 700.

Substituting B = 2Q and W = 2B into the equation, we get Q + 2Q + 2(2Q) = 700.

Simplifying the equation, we get Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700, which is 7Q = 700.

Dividing both sides by 7, we get Q = 100.

Now that we know Q = 100, we can find B by substituting Q into the equation B = 2Q, so B = 2(100) = 200.

Finally, we can find W by substituting B into the equation W = 2B, so W = 2(200) = 400.

The final answer is: 400"
"To determine how much money Jordan would earn in one week if he spent his video game time working, we need to calculate the total hours he spends playing video games in a week and then multiply that by his hourly wage.

Since Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day, in a week (7 days), he would spend 2 hours/day * 7 days = 14 hours playing video games.

If he spent this time working instead, he would earn 14 hours * $10/hour = $140.

The final answer is: $140"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to separate the food items from the non-food items and apply the 10% tax to the non-food items.

Food items: 
- Milk: 2 dollars
- Eggs: 3 dollars
Total food cost: 2 + 3 = 5 dollars

Non-food items:
- Light bulbs: 3 dollars
- Cups: 3 dollars
- Roach traps: 4 dollars
Total non-food cost: 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars

Since there is a 10% tax on non-food items, we need to calculate 10% of 10 dollars:
10% of 10 = 0.1 * 10 = 1 dollar

Now, we add the tax to the non-food cost:
10 + 1 = 11 dollars

The total cost of the non-food items is 11 dollars.

Now, we add the food cost and the non-food cost to get the total cost:
5 + 11 = 16 dollars

"To calculate the total profit, we first need to determine the total income and total expenses. 

Kim has 3 current clients and 5 potential clients, making a total of 8 clients. Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. 

Total bottles of bleach needed per week: 8 clients * 2 bottles/client = 16 bottles
Total packs of cloths needed per week: 8 clients * 1 pack/client = 8 packs

The cost of bleach per week: 16 bottles * $2/bottle = $32
The cost of cloths per week: 8 packs * $5/pack = $40

Total expenses per week: $32 (bleach) + $40 (cloths) = $72

Kim's total income per week is given as $92. 

To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income: 
Profit = Total income - Total expenses
Profit = $92 - $72
Profit = $20

"To find the total number of pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to calculate the total number of pineapples per harvest and then multiply it by the number of harvests in a year.

First, let's find the total number of pineapples per hectare: 100 pineapples/hectare.

Since John has 10 hectares, the total number of pineapples per harvest is: 100 pineapples/hectare * 10 hectares = 1000 pineapples.

John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, which means there are 4 harvests in a year (since 12 months / 3 months per harvest = 4 harvests).

Now, let's multiply the total number of pineapples per harvest by the number of harvests in a year: 1000 pineapples/harvest * 4 harvests/year = 4000 pineapples/year.

"To find the total number of blocks Johnny picks up, we need to calculate the number of pieces in each set and add them together.

The first set has 500 pieces.
The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first set, so it has 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces.
The third set has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first set, so it has 500 / 4 = 125 pieces.

Now, we add the number of pieces in each set together: 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of the bees that left in the first 6 hours return. So, 1/2 * 30 = 15 bees return.
3. The number of bees that have left but not returned so far is 30 - 15 = 15 bees.
4. In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees as the ones that left in the first 6 hours fly from the hive and leave. So, 2 * 30 = 60 bees leave.
5. The total number of bees that have left but not returned so far is 15 (from step 3) + 60 (from step 4) = 75 bees.
6. In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive. So, 75 bees return.

"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to determine the total cost of the tickets and then add the change she received.

The cost of the child ticket is $10 and the cost of the adult ticket is $12. 

Total cost = cost of child ticket + cost of adult ticket
Total cost = $10 + $12
Total cost = $22

Since Brittany's mom received $8 in change, we need to add this to the total cost to find out how much she gave the cashier.

Total given = Total cost + Change
Total given = $22 + $8
Total given = $30

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many friends Dorothy has. Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends, we can set up an equation to find Dorothy's number of friends.

Let D be the number of friends Dorothy has. Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, we can write the equation:

3D = 12

To find D, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

D = 12 / 3
D = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find James's number of friends. James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, so we can write the equation:

James's friends = 4 * D
James's friends = 4 * 4
James's friends = 16

"To determine the time it takes for each person to get home, we need to calculate the time it takes for Steve and Tim to cover their respective distances.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet, since the speeds are given in feet per minute. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15,840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10,560 feet

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for each person to get home:

Steve's time: distance / speed = 15,840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: distance / speed = 10,560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 36 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve will be the winner. To find out how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to subtract the winner's time from the loser's time.

Waiting time = Tim's time - Steve's time = 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

"To find the total amount of money Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total cost of inflating all the tires.

First, let's calculate the cost of inflating the bicycle tires. Each bicycle has 2 tires, and there were 5 bicycles. So, the total number of bicycle tires is 5 * 2 = 10. The cost of inflating each tire is 25 cents, so the total cost for the bicycle tires is 10 * 25 cents = 250 cents.

Next, let's calculate the cost of inflating the tricycle tires. Each tricycle has 3 tires, and there were 3 tricycles. So, the total number of tricycle tires is 3 * 3 = 9. The cost of inflating each tire is 25 cents, so the total cost for the tricycle tires is 9 * 25 cents = 225 cents.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of inflating the unicycle tire. A unicycle has 1 tire, and there was 1 unicycle. So, the total number of unicycle tires is 1 * 1 = 1. The cost of inflating each tire is 25 cents, so the total cost for the unicycle tire is 1 * 25 cents = 25 cents.

Now, let's add up the total cost of inflating all the tires: 250 cents + 225 cents + 25 cents = 500 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100: 500 cents / 100 = 5 dollars.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Dave ate 14 french fries initially.
2. The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 french fries.
   Now, the total amount eaten by Dave and the seagull is 14 + 7 = 21 french fries.
3. Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate a total of 3 * 3 = 9 french fries.
   Now, the total amount eaten is 21 + 9 = 30 french fries.
4. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries. Let's denote the initial amount of fries as x. 
   After the seagull and pigeons ate, (x - 30) fries were left. The raccoon stole 2/3 of (x - 30), which is (2/3)(x - 30).
   The remaining amount after the raccoon ate is (x - 30) - (2/3)(x - 30).
   Simplifying this, we get (1/3)(x - 30).
5. After the raccoon ate, ants carried off 1 french fry, leaving 5 behind. 
   So, (1/3)(x - 30) - 1 = 5.
   Solving for x, we get (1/3)(x - 30) = 6.
   Multiplying both sides by 3, we get x - 30 = 18.
   Adding 30 to both sides, we get x = 48.

"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the total length of each type of baked good and then add them together.

First, let's convert the length of the baguettes from feet to inches, since the lengths of the rolls and croissants are given in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so each baguette is 2 * 12 = 24 inches long.

Now, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good:

- Rolls: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches
- Croissants: 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches
- Baguettes: 60 baguettes * 24 inches/baguette = 1440 inches

Now, let's add the total lengths together: 1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 inches.

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot): 3360 / 12 = 280 feet.

"To determine the total number of bananas needed for 2 months, we need to calculate the monthly consumption of all the apes and then multiply it by 2.

The monkeys need 200 bananas per month, the gorillas need 400 bananas per month, and the baboons need 100 bananas per month. 

Total monthly consumption = 200 (monkeys) + 400 (gorillas) + 100 (baboons) = 700 bananas per month.

Since the zookeeper needs to order bananas for 2 months, we multiply the total monthly consumption by 2.

Total bananas needed for 2 months = 700 bananas/month * 2 months = 1400 bananas.

The final answer is: 1400"
"To determine the distance each person runs, we need to calculate the total distance for both Blake and Kelly.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Since he runs back and forth, the total distance he covers is 2 times the length of the field for each run. So, the total distance for Blake is 15 * 2 * 100 = 3000 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, covering 200 yards (2 * 100). Then, she runs to the 40-yard line and back, covering 80 yards each time. She does this 34 times, so the total distance for Kelly is 200 + (2 * 80 * 34) = 200 + 5440 = 5640 yards.

To find out who the winner is, we compare the distances: Blake ran 3000 yards and Kelly ran 5640 yards. Kelly is the winner.

To find out how much farther Kelly ran than Blake, we subtract Blake's distance from Kelly's distance: 5640 - 3000 = 2640 yards.

"To find the depth of the water on Wednesday, we need to first find the depth of the water on Tuesday. 

The depth of the water on Monday is 17 feet. On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water, so the depth of the water on Tuesday is 17 + 7 = 24 feet.

On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. To find two thirds of 24, we multiply 24 by 2/3.

24 * (2/3) = (24 * 2) / 3 = 48 / 3 = 16

So, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet.

"To find the total number of fish caught by Anakin, we need to add the number of starfish, sea horses, and clownfish he caught. 

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. 

Total fish caught by Anakin = 10 + 6 + 3 = 19

Now, let's find the number of fish caught by Locsin. 

Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so he caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.

Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so he caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.

Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so he caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Total fish caught by Locsin = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

Now, let's find the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin.

Total fish caught = Total fish caught by Anakin + Total fish caught by Locsin

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Brooke's current age as B and Seth's current age as S. We are given that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write an equation:

S = 2B

We are also given that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. This means that in 2 years, Seth's age will be S + 2 and Brooke's age will be B + 2. The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write another equation:

S + 2 + B + 2 = 28

Combine like terms:

S + B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

S + B = 24

Now we can substitute the first equation (S = 2B) into this equation:

2B + B = 24

Combine like terms:

3B = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B into the first equation (S = 2B):

S = 2(8)
S = 16

So, Seth is 16 years old.

The cost of the hat is given as $25.

The cost of the jacket is three times as much as the hat, so it is 3 * $25 = $75.

The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. To find the average, we add the costs of the hat and jacket and divide by 2. The average cost of the pants is ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50.

Now, we add the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants together to find the total cost of each uniform: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

The final answer is: $150"
"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the number of legs for each group and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total number of legs for the spiders: 
80 spiders * 8 legs/spider = 640 legs

Next, let's calculate the total number of legs for the insects: 
90 insects * 6 legs/insect = 540 legs

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs for the mutant invertebrates: 
3 mutant invertebrates * 10 legs/invertebrate = 30 legs

Finally, let's add the total number of legs for each group together: 
640 legs + 540 legs + 30 legs = 1210 legs

The final answer is: 1210"
"To find the total age of the four birds, we need to determine the ages of Sally Two, Granny Red, and Sally Four.

We know that Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old, and Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.

Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we can find the total age of the four birds by adding their ages: 8 (Sally Four) + 16 (Granny Red) + 19 (Sally Two) + 8 (Sally Thirtytwo) = 51

The final answer is: 51"
"To find out how much Jessica pays in a year, we need to calculate the total monthly payments and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's calculate the increased minimum payments:

- Student loans: $300 (minimum) * 1.5 (50% increase) = $450
- Credit card: $200 (minimum) * 1.5 (50% increase) = $300
- Mortgage: $500 (minimum) * 1.5 (50% increase) = $750

Now, let's add up the increased minimum payments: $450 + $300 + $750 = $1500

To find the total annual payment, we multiply the monthly payment by 12: $1500 * 12 = $18,000

The final answer is: $18,000"
"To find the total time it takes Billy to peel and cut all the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel one potato and multiply it by the total number of potatoes, and then add the time it takes to cut one potato multiplied by the total number of potatoes.

Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds = 5/60 minutes (converting seconds to minutes)

Total time to peel all potatoes: 60 potatoes * 1.5 minutes/potato = 90 minutes
Total time to cut all potatoes: 60 potatoes * (5/60) minutes/potato = 5 minutes

Total time to peel and cut all potatoes: 90 minutes + 5 minutes = 95 minutes

Therefore, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out the total revenue and the total cost. 

Let's start by finding the total revenue. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. So, the revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10.

Since they made $25 in profit, the total revenue must be $25 + (cost of lemons + cost of sugar). The cost of sugar is $2 per gallon, and the cost of lemons is $3 per gallon. 

Let's denote the number of gallons as 'x'. The total revenue is $10x, and the total cost is $3x + $2x = $5x. 

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, so we can set up the equation: $10x - $5x = $25. 

Simplifying the equation, we get $5x = $25. 

Dividing both sides by $5, we get x = 5. 

Now that we know they made 5 gallons, the cost of lemons is $3 per gallon. So, the total cost of lemons is $3 * 5 = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the number of Chinese participants, we first need to subtract the number of Japanese participants from the total number of participants. 

Total participants = 240
Japanese participants = 80
Chinese participants = Total participants - Japanese participants
Chinese participants = 240 - 80
Chinese participants = 160

Since we know that the number of boys on the Chinese team was 60, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants.

Number of girls on the Chinese team = Chinese participants - Number of boys
Number of girls on the Chinese team = 160 - 60
Number of girls on the Chinese team = 100

The final answer is: 100"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations and calculate the expenses step by step.

1. Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent: 
   1/4 of 6000 = 6000 * 1/4 = 1500

2. He spends 1/3 on car fuel:
   1/3 of 6000 = 6000 * 1/3 = 2000

3. The remaining amount after rent and car fuel is:
   6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500

4. He donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity:
   Half of 2500 = 2500 * 1/2 = 1250

5. The remaining amount after donation is:
   2500 - 1250 = 1250

6. He gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$:
   Total given away = 200 + 700 = 900

7. The remaining amount after giving money to his daughter and wife is:
   1250 - 900 = 350

Therefore, Zaid will still have 350 dollars after all these expenses and donations.

The final answer is: $350"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of crabs each person has. 

Since Bo has 40 crabs, and Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, we can calculate Monic's crabs as follows:
Monic's crabs = Bo's crabs - 4
Monic's crabs = 40 - 4
Monic's crabs = 36

Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so we can calculate Rani's crabs as follows:
Rani's crabs = Monic's crabs + 10
Rani's crabs = 36 + 10
Rani's crabs = 46

Now, we can calculate the total number of crabs the three have together by adding the number of crabs each person has:
Total crabs = Bo's crabs + Monic's crabs + Rani's crabs
Total crabs = 40 + 36 + 46
Total crabs = 122

The final answer is: 122"
"To find out how much Lloyd earned for the first two weeks, we need to calculate his earnings for each week and then add them together.

For the first week, Lloyd tutored 5 hours at $10 per hour, so his earnings for the first week are:
5 hours * $10/hour = $50

For the second week, Lloyd tutored 8 hours at $10 per hour, so his earnings for the second week are:
8 hours * $10/hour = $80

Now, we add his earnings for both weeks to find the total:
$50 (first week) + $80 (second week) = $130

The final answer is: $130"
"To find the number of votes the loser got, we first need to find the total number of votes the winner got. Since the winner got 3/4 of the votes, we can calculate this as follows:

Total votes = 80
Winner's votes = 3/4 * Total votes
Winner's votes = 3/4 * 80
Winner's votes = 60

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser got can be found by subtracting the winner's votes from the total votes:

Loser's votes = Total votes - Winner's votes
Loser's votes = 80 - 60
Loser's votes = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of white carnations and then calculate the number of red roses.

Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. According to the problem, Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations. This can be expressed as:

200 = 5x

To find the value of 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we know the number of white carnations is 40, we can find the number of red roses. According to the problem, Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. This can be expressed as:

Number of red roses = 4x
Number of red roses = 4 * 40
Number of red roses = 160

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jean is two years older than Mark.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age.
3. Jan is 30 years old.

From point 3, we know Jan's current age is 30. 

Two years ago, Jan's age would have been 30 - 2 = 28.

From point 2, we know that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. Half of Jan's age two years ago would be 28 / 2 = 14. 

So, two years ago, Mark's age would have been 14 + 5 = 19.

Since Mark's age two years ago was 19, his current age would be 19 + 2 = 21.

From point 1, we know Jean is two years older than Mark. Therefore, Jean's current age would be 21 + 2 = 23.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total time for each team, we need to calculate the time for each runner and add them together.

The well-rounded team's total time is 4 x 55 seconds = 220 seconds.

The less well-rounded team's first runner runs 60 seconds. The second runner is 3 seconds faster, so they run 60 - 3 = 57 seconds. The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so they run 57 - 3 = 54 seconds. The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so they run 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

The less well-rounded team's total time is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 162 seconds.

The difference in time between the two teams is 220 - 162 = 58 seconds.

The faster team will win by 58 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, and then find the difference between the two probabilities.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die is the probability of rolling a 4, 5, or 6. There are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, 6) out of 6 possible outcomes, so the probability is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5 or 50%.

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5, since there are 3 even numbers (2, 4, 6) out of 6 possible outcomes. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 = 0.25 or 25%.

To find the difference in probability, we subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3: 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 or 25%.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how many apples Jenna picked, we need to determine half of the number of apples her mom picked. Since her mom picked 20 apples, half of that would be 20 / 2 = 10 apples. 

Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, and her mom picked 20 apples, Jenna picked 10 apples. 

To find the total number of apples they both picked, we need to add the number of apples Jenna picked to the number of apples her mom picked. 

20 (mom's apples) + 10 (Jenna's apples) = 30 apples.

The final answer is: 30"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of small rodents (rats and hamsters) and the total number of straw pieces distributed among them. 

Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as 'r'. Since there are 3 cages of rats, the total number of rats is 3r. 

The total number of hamsters is 10. 

The total number of straw pieces distributed among the rats is 3r * 6 = 18r. 

The total number of straw pieces distributed among the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50. 

The total number of straw pieces distributed among the small rodents is 160. 

We can set up the equation: 18r + 50 = 160.

Now, let's solve for 'r':

18r = 160 - 50
18r = 110
r = 110 / 18

"To calculate the total amount Mandy should pay, we need to calculate the interest for 3 months and add it to the principal amount.

The monthly interest rate is 2%, which is 0.02 as a decimal. 

The principal amount is $100.

The interest for 1 month is $100 * 0.02 = $2.

The interest for 3 months is $2 * 3 = $6.

The total amount Mandy should pay is the principal amount plus the interest, which is $100 + $6 = $106.

The final numerical answer is: $106"
"To find the number of bags sold, we need to first calculate the total cost and total revenue.

Let's denote the number of bags as 'x'. 

The total cost of buying the bags is $20x (since each bag costs $20).
The total cost of transportation is $2x (since each bag costs $2 to transport).
The total cost is the sum of the cost of buying and transportation: $20x + $2x = $22x.

The total revenue from selling the bags is $30x (since each bag is sold at $30).

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost: $30x - $22x = $8x.

We are given that the profit is $400, so we can set up the equation: $8x = $400.

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 8: x = $400 / $8 = 50.

Therefore, the trader sold 50 bags.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the tickets, the cost of the food, and the cost of the rides, then add them together.

The cost of the tickets is $20.25 for 3 tickets. To find the cost per ticket, we divide the total cost by the number of tickets: $20.25 / 3 = $6.75 per ticket.

The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets. So, the cost of the food is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.

The cost of the rides is 2 rides at $33 each: 2 * $33 = $66.

Now, we add the costs together: $20.25 (tickets) + $15.75 (food) + $66 (rides) = $102.

To find out how much each friend paid, we divide the total cost by the number of friends: $102 / 3 = $34.

The final answer is: $34"
"To find the total number of peaches John collects, we need to calculate the total minutes he collects peaches and then multiply it by the number of peaches he collects per minute.

John collects peaches for 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 3 hours by 60 minutes:

3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Now, we know John collects 2 peaches per minute. To find the total number of peaches, we multiply the total minutes by the peaches collected per minute:

180 minutes * 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches

The final answer is: 360"
"To find the total amount of insects needed per day for the flock of ducks, we first need to calculate the total amount of insects needed per week for the flock. 

Since each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week, and there are ten ducks, the total amount of insects needed per week is 3.5 pounds/duck * 10 ducks = 35 pounds.

To find the amount of insects needed per day, we divide the total weekly amount by 7 (the number of days in a week). 

35 pounds/week / 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of trees Tom has after 10 years, considering the trees he plants, chops down, and the ones that die.

Initially, Tom has 50 trees.

Each year, he plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees. So, the net increase in trees per year is 10 - 2 = 8 trees.

Over 10 years, the net increase in trees is 8 * 10 = 80 trees.

So, the total number of trees after 10 years is 50 (initial trees) + 80 (net increase) = 130 trees.

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find the number of trees that die, we calculate 30% of 130, which is 0.3 * 130 = 39 trees.

The number of trees left after 30% die is 130 - 39 = 91 trees.

The final answer is: 91"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there were 18 pink plastic flamingos on Sue's front yard.

On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. They painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back on Sue's front yard. So, now there are 6 white flamingos and 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos.

On Sunday morning, the neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection. Now, there are 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos.

The total number of flamingos on Sue's front yard is 30 pink + 6 white = 36 flamingos.

To find out how many more pink plastic flamingos were out than white plastic flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find out how much change Violetta will get, we need to calculate the total cost of the crayons and subtract that from the amount she has prepared.

Since Violetta needs 5 crayons and each crayon costs $2, the total cost of the crayons will be:
5 crayons * $2/crayon = $10

Violetta has prepared $20 for the purchase. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount she has:
$20 - $10 = $10

So, Violetta will get $10 as change."
"To find the cost of a pen, we need to add the cost of a pencil and an eraser, since a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined.

Cost of a pencil = $1.20
Cost of an eraser = $0.30
Cost of a pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser = $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50

Now, we need to find the cost of 8 pens.

Cost of 8 pens = Cost of a pen * 8 = $1.50 * 8 = $12.00

"To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we first need to calculate the total pounds of carrots that will be distributed to the restaurants. 

Each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants. 

Total pounds of carrots distributed = Number of restaurants * Pounds per restaurant
Total pounds of carrots distributed = 40 * 2
Total pounds of carrots distributed = 80 pounds

Now, we need to subtract the total pounds of carrots distributed from the total pounds of carrots available to find out how many pounds will not be used.

Pounds of carrots not used = Total pounds of carrots available - Total pounds of carrots distributed
Pounds of carrots not used = 200 - 80
Pounds of carrots not used = 120

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.
2. After a month, she collected three times that number, which is 3 * 20 = 60 cards. So, she now has 20 + 60 = 80 cards.
3. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month, which is 60 - 20 = 40 cards. So, she now has 80 + 40 = 120 cards.
4. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months. The combined number is 60 + 40 = 100. Twice that number is 2 * 100 = 200 cards. So, she now has 120 + 200 = 320 cards.

"To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we need to determine how many sentences he edits for each publisher and their respective payments.

Let's denote the number of sentences Mark edits for Publisher A as 'x'. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, the number of sentences for Publisher B is also 'x'. 

We know that the total number of sentences Mark edits is 1000, so we can set up the equation: x + x = 1000. 

Solving for x, we get 2x = 1000, which means x = 500. 

Since Mark edits 500 sentences for Publisher A, and Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, the total payment from Publisher A is 500 * 5 = 2500 cents.

We are given that Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, so the payment from Publisher B is 2 * 2500 = 5000 cents.

The total payment Mark receives in a week is the sum of the payments from both publishers: 2500 + 5000 = 7500 cents.

The final answer is: 7500"

"To calculate John's total earnings for the year, we need to consider the one-time monetary reward and the 5% raise in salary.

First, let's calculate the total amount John earns from his weekly salary for the year. Since he earns $2000 per week and works every week of the year (52 weeks), his total earnings from his salary would be:

2000 * 52 = 104,000

Next, let's calculate the 5% raise in salary. A 5% raise on $2000 would be:

2000 * 0.05 = 100

So, his new weekly salary would be:

2000 + 100 = 2100

Now, let's calculate his total earnings from his new salary for the year:

2100 * 52 = 109,200

Adding the one-time monetary reward of $5000 to his total earnings from his salary, we get:

109,200 + 5000 = 114,200

Therefore, John's total earnings for the year would be $114,200.

The final answer is: $114,200"

"To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the slices used for sandwiches, omelets, and the macaroni and cheese dish separately and then add them together.

1. Slices used for sandwiches: 
- Number of days Carl ate sandwiches: 7 (since it's a week)
- Slices of cheese per sandwich: 2
- Total slices used for sandwiches: 7 * 2 = 14

2. Slices used for omelets: 
- Number of days Carl ate omelets: 3
- Slices of cheese per omelet: 2 + 1 (since he used one more slice per omelet than per sandwich) = 3
- Total slices used for omelets: 3 * 3 = 9

3. Slices used for macaroni and cheese: 
- Number of slices used: 8

Now, let's add the slices used for each meal together: 
14 (sandwiches) + 9 (omelets) + 8 (macaroni and cheese) = 31

"To find the total number of pens Janet has now, we need to calculate the number of blue and red pens she bought and add them to her initial number of pens.

Janet initially had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, so she had a total of 22 + 10 = 32 pens.

She bought 6 bags of blue pens, with 9 pens in each bag, so she bought 6 x 9 = 54 blue pens.

She bought 2 bags of red pens, with 6 pens in each bag, so she bought 2 x 6 = 12 red pens.

Now, we add the number of blue and red pens she bought to her initial number of pens: 32 (initial pens) + 54 (blue pens) + 12 (red pens) = 98 pens.

Janet now has 98 pens.

"To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we first need to find the total score she needs for the semester. Since Mr. Bert allows the students to remove the lowest score, we will first arrange the scores in ascending order: 71, 86, 89, 92, 100. 

The lowest score is 71, so we will remove it from the total. The remaining scores are 86, 89, 92, 100. 

Now, we will add these scores: 86 + 89 + 92 + 100 = 267.

Since there are 4 remaining scores, we will divide the total by 4 to get the average: 267 / 4 = 66.75.

Since Brinley wants an average of 93, we will multiply 93 by 6 (the total number of tests) to get the total score she needs: 93 * 6 = 558.

Now, we will subtract the total score she has so far (267) from the total score she needs (558) to find the score she needs on the sixth test: 558 - 267 = 291.

"To find the total weight of the bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the weight of the chocolate bars. Since there are 25 chocolate bars and each weighs 40g, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:

25 * 40g = 1000g

Next, let's find the weight of the candied apples. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, the weight of each candied apple is:

40g / 2 = 20g

Now, we can find the total weight of the candied apples:

80 * 20g = 1600g

Finally, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag of candy:

1000g + 1600g = 2600g

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total cost of half a dozen plates. 

Half a dozen plates cost 6 * $6000 = $36,000.

Now, we know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, the total cost of twenty dozen cups is $36,000 - $1200 = $34,800.

Since twenty dozen cups is equal to 20 * 12 = 240 cups, we can find the cost of each cup by dividing the total cost by the number of cups.

Cost of each cup = Total cost of twenty dozen cups / Number of cups
= $34,800 / 240

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy and the total amount of money she has earned from babysitting. 

The total cost of the items is the cost of the jacket plus the cost of 2 pairs of shoes: 
$30 (jacket) + 2 * $20 (shoes) = $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved before she started babysitting. She earns $5 each time she babysits the neighbor's kids. To find out how much more money she needs, we subtract the amount she already has from the total cost of the items:
$70 (total cost) - $10 (initial savings) = $60.

Since Sara earns $5 each time she babysits, we need to find out how many times she needs to babysit to earn $60:
$60 (amount needed) / $5 (babysitting pay) = 12 times.

However, we also need to consider the money she earns from mowing the lawn. Her parents pay her $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn, we subtract the amount she earns from babysitting from the total amount needed:
$60 (amount needed) - $60 (babysitting earnings) = $0.

Since she already earns enough from babysitting, she doesn't need to mow the lawn at all.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of red chickens as 'r' and the number of white chickens as 'w'. We know that w = r + 2.

We also know that the total number of eggs collected is 42. Since each red chicken produces 3 eggs and each white chicken produces 5 eggs, we can set up the following equation:

3r + 5w = 42

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

"To find the time Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park since he walks around the edge. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the dimensions of the park, l = 6 miles and w = 1.5 miles, we can substitute these values into the formula:

P = 2(6 + 1.5)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles/hour, we can find the time he spends walking by dividing the perimeter by his speed:

Time = Perimeter / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of customers Sloane counted on the first day, then add 50 to that number to find the number of customers on the second day, and finally add the number of customers on the second day to the number of customers on the third day to find the total.

Let's denote the number of customers on the first day as x. 

The number of customers on the second day is x + 50.

The total number of customers by the third day is x + (x + 50) = 500.

Combine like terms: 2x + 50 = 500.

Subtract 50 from both sides: 2x = 450.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 225.

So, the number of customers on the first day is 225. 

The number of customers on the second day is 225 + 50 = 275.

The number of customers on the third day is 500 - (225 + 275) = 500 - 500 = 0 is incorrect, we need to recalculate the third day customers by adding the first and second day customers to the third day customers. The correct way to calculate the third day customers is to subtract the first day customers from the total customers and add the second day customers to that result. 

The correct calculation is: 500 - 225 = 275, then 275 + 275 = 550.

"Let's denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as 'x' gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the initial amount of water in the big pool is 2x gallons.

Since both pools leak at 4 gallons/minute, the rate of water loss for both pools is 8 gallons/minute (4 gallons/minute each).

In 4 minutes, the total amount of water lost from both pools is 8 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 32 gallons.

The initial total amount of water in both pools is x + 2x = 3x gallons.

Since the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool, we can set up the equation: 2x - 32 = 4(x - 32).

Simplifying the equation: 
2x - 32 = 4x - 128
32 + 128 = 4x - 2x
160 = 2x
x = 80

The initial amount of water in the small pool is 80 gallons. Since 32 gallons were lost in 4 minutes, the amount of water in the small pool now is 80 - 8 = 72 gallons.

Total cost = $352.00

Since Lori earns $8.00 per hour, we can divide the total cost by her hourly wage to find out how many hours she needs to work.

Hours worked = Total cost / Hourly wage
Hours worked = $352.00 / $8.00

Benji's banana boat raft rental cost: $18/hour * 5 hours = $90

Total cost: $90 (Carlos) + $90 (Benji) = $180

The final answer is: $180"
"To find the total number of days Andrew will travel, we need to calculate the time it takes for each leg of the trip and add them together.

The time it takes to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus is 6 days.

The time it takes to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by car is half of 6 days, which is 6 / 2 = 3 days.

The time it takes to travel from Rochester to New Jersey by car is the same as the time it takes to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by car, which is 3 days.

The time it takes to travel from Rochester to New Jersey by bus is the same as the time it takes to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus, which is 6 days.

So, the total number of days Andrew will travel is 6 (bus to Rochester) + 3 (car to Rochester) + 3 (car to New Jersey) + 6 (bus to New Jersey) = 18 days.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we first need to determine the total number of cards James has after the changes. 

Initially, James has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards. 

After losing 8 water type cards, he has 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards.

After buying 14 grass type cards, he has 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards.

The total number of cards James has is 30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96 cards.

The probability of picking a water type card is the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards, which is 32/96.

To find the percentage, we multiply by 100: (32/96) * 100 = 33.333...

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33."
"To calculate the total amount Chad owes, we need to add up the cost of the base burrito, extra meat, extra cheese, avocado, sauces, and the upgrade. 

The base burrito costs $6.50. 
Extra meat costs $2.00. 
Extra cheese costs $1.00. 
Avocado costs $1.00. 
Two sauces cost $0.25 each, so 2 * $0.25 = $0.50. 
The upgrade costs $3.00.

The total cost of the items is $6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 + $3.00 = $13.00.

Chad has a gift card for $5.00, so we subtract this from the total cost: $13.00 - $5.00 = $8.00.

Therefore, Chad still owes $8.00. 

The final answer is: $8.00"
"To find the total number of pieces Kalinda and her mom can place per minute, we need to determine how many pieces her mom can place per minute. Since her mom can place half as many pieces as Kalinda, and Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute, her mom can place 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute.

The total number of pieces they can place per minute is 4 (Kalinda) + 2 (her mom) = 6 pieces per minute.

To find the total time it will take to complete the puzzle, we need to divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they can place per minute. 

360 pieces / 6 pieces per minute = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time from minutes to hours by dividing by 60.

60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Therefore, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the number of melons not ready to be harvested after two weeks, we need to calculate the number of melons harvested in the second trip and subtract that from the total number of melons remaining after the first trip.

Initially, 30% of 120 melons were harvested in the first trip. 
30% of 120 = 0.3 * 120 = 36 melons.

So, the number of melons remaining after the first trip is 120 - 36 = 84 melons.

In the second trip, 3/4 of the remaining melons were harvested. 
3/4 of 84 = 0.75 * 84 = 63 melons.

The number of melons not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is the total number of melons remaining after the first trip minus the number of melons harvested in the second trip.
84 - 63 = 21 melons.

The final answer is: 21"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total cost of the cars, the tax on the cars, and the registration fees.

1. Total cost of the cars: 12 cars * $20,000 per car = $240,000
2. Tax on the cars: 10% of $240,000 = 0.10 * $240,000 = $24,000
3. Registration fees: 12 cars * $1000 per car = $12,000

Now, we add the total cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees to find the total cost.

Total cost = $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000

The final answer is: $276,000"
"To find out how many shells Kylie collects on Tuesday, we first need to determine how many shells she collected on Monday. 

On Monday, Robert collects 20 shells. Since Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, we can calculate Kylie's Monday collection as follows: 
Kylie's Monday collection = Robert's Monday collection + 5
Kylie's Monday collection = 20 + 5
Kylie's Monday collection = 25

On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. 
Kylie's Tuesday collection = 2 * Kylie's Monday collection
Kylie's Tuesday collection = 2 * 25
Kylie's Tuesday collection = 50

"To find the total number of insects in the garden, we first need to determine the number of bugs. Since Dax found half as many bugs as ants, and there were 50 ants, we can calculate the number of bugs as follows:

Number of bugs = Number of ants / 2
Number of bugs = 50 / 2
Number of bugs = 25

Now, to find the total number of insects in the garden, we add the number of ants and bugs:

Total number of insects = Number of ants + Number of bugs
Total number of insects = 50 + 25
Total number of insects = 75

"To find the number of penguins left sunbathing, we first need to determine how many penguins are leaving the sunbathing area. 

One-third of the penguins jump in and swim in the ocean, which is 36 / 3 = 12 penguins. 

Another one-third go inside the cave to eat their dinner, which is also 36 / 3 = 12 penguins.

In total, 12 + 12 = 24 penguins leave the sunbathing area.

To find the number of penguins left sunbathing, we subtract the number of penguins that left from the total number of penguins: 36 - 24 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To determine the number of vines Steve needs, we first need to calculate how many tomatoes he eats per week. Since Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, we multiply this by 7 to get the weekly consumption:

6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, we can assume his girlfriend eats half as much as Steve. Therefore, his girlfriend eats:

42 tomatoes/week / 2 = 21 tomatoes/week

The total number of tomatoes they eat per week is the sum of what Steve and his girlfriend eat:

42 tomatoes/week (Steve) + 21 tomatoes/week (girlfriend) = 63 tomatoes/week

Each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week. To find out how many vines are needed, we divide the total number of tomatoes they eat per week by the number of tomatoes each vine produces per week:

63 tomatoes/week / 3 tomatoes/vine/week = 21 vines

Therefore, Steve needs 21 vines to meet their weekly tomato consumption. 

The final answer is: 21"
"To determine the number of pizzas John needs to order, we need to calculate the total number of slices required and then divide that by the number of slices per pizza.

First, we calculate the total number of slices required: 
20 friends * 4 slices per friend = 80 slices

Since pizzas are sold in 8 slices, we need to divide the total number of slices required by the number of slices per pizza:
80 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 10 pizzas

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas to ensure each of his 20 friends can have 4 slices. 

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of pens Ram has after using the pens he bought to make new ones.

Initially, Ram buys 25 pens. 

When the ink runs low, he uses 5 empty pens to make 1 new pen. This means that for every 5 empty pens, he gets 1 new pen. 

So, for 25 pens, he can make 25 / 5 = 5 new pens. 

However, these 5 new pens are made from the 5 empty pens he used, so we need to subtract those 5 pens from the total. 

Therefore, the total number of pens Ram gets to have is 25 (initial pens) - 5 (empty pens used) + 5 (new pens made) = 25.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the final amount of money Johnny had after a year, we need to follow the steps of the problem.

1. Johnny started with an allowance of $20 and added an extra $10 to it. So, the initial amount of money he had is $20 + $10 = $30.

2. He then invested this sum of money, which tripled in a year. This means the amount of money he had after a year is 3 times the initial amount. 

3. To find the final amount, we multiply the initial amount by 3: $30 * 3 = $90.

Therefore, the final amount of money Johnny had after a year is $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the sum of the ages of the three girls, we need to determine the ages of Mary and Joan first.

Since Jessa is 20 years old, and Joan is five years older than Jessa, we can calculate Joan's age as follows:
Joan's age = Jessa's age + 5
Joan's age = 20 + 5
Joan's age = 25

Now, we know that Mary is two years younger than Joan. So, we can calculate Mary's age as follows:
Mary's age = Joan's age - 2
Mary's age = 25 - 2
Mary's age = 23

Now that we have the ages of all three girls, we can find the sum of their ages:
Sum of ages = Jessa's age + Joan's age + Mary's age
Sum of ages = 20 + 25 + 23
Sum of ages = 68

The final answer is: 68"
"To find the number of students who went out through exit C, we first need to calculate the number of students who went out through exit A and exit B.

Initially, there were 1000 students. 30% of them went out through exit A. 

30% of 1000 = 0.3 * 1000 = 300 students went out through exit A.

Now, the remaining students are 1000 - 300 = 700.

3/5 of the remaining 700 students went out through exit B.

3/5 of 700 = (3/5) * 700 = 420 students went out through exit B.

Now, the remaining students are 700 - 420 = 280.

The rest of the students went out through exit C. 

Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280.

The final answer is: 280"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many candies Robert has. Since John has twice as many candies as Robert and John has 54 candies, we can divide 54 by 2 to find out how many candies Robert has.

Robert's candies = John's candies / 2
Robert's candies = 54 / 2
Robert's candies = 27

Now, we know that James has 6 more candies than Robert. So, we can add 6 to Robert's candies to find out how many candies James has.

James' candies = Robert's candies + 6
James' candies = 27 + 6
James' candies = 33

To find out how many more candies John has than James, we need to subtract James' candies from John's candies.

Difference = John's candies - James' candies
Difference = 54 - 33
Difference = 21

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Dolly has 2 books and Pandora has 1 book. 

Dolly will read her own 2 books and Pandora's 1 book, so Dolly will read a total of 3 books.

Pandora will read her own 1 book and Dolly's 2 books, so Pandora will read a total of 3 books.

In total, they will read 3 (Dolly's total) + 3 (Pandora's total) = 6 books.

However, this counts the books they read from each other twice. To correct this, we need to subtract the 2 books they read from each other once.

So, the total number of books they will collectively read is 6 - 2 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total number of hours Mike spends writing a week, we need to calculate the total number of letters he writes and then multiply it by the time it takes to write each letter.

First, let's find the total number of letters Mike writes. He has 3 pen pals left, and each of them sends 2 letters a week. So, the total number of letters he receives is 3 * 2 = 6 letters.

Since he responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters a week.

Now, let's find the total number of pages he writes. Each letter is 5 pages long, so the total number of pages is 6 (letters received) + 6 (letters sent) = 12 pages.

Since Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time he spends writing a week is 12 pages * 6 minutes/page = 72 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). So, 72 minutes / 60 = 1.2 hours.

Therefore, Mike spends 1.2 hours writing a week.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1.2}$"

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Griffin had 24 fries.

Kyle took 5 fries from Griffin. So, Griffin was left with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.

Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, which is 2 * 5 = 10 fries. So, Griffin was left with 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

Ginger gave Griffin some fries, and then Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had taken, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. 

After Colby took 2 fries, Griffin was left with 9 - 2 = 7 fries.

However, we know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. This means that Ginger gave Griffin 27 - 7 = 20 fries.

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28.

According to the problem, this difference is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums, so we can set up the equation:

28 = 2(2x)

Now, let's simplify the equation:

28 = 4x

To find the value of x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 4:

x = 28 / 4
x = 7

Since x represents the number of fish in each aquarium, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total amount Jean paid, we need to calculate the total hours worked, the total cost before the discount, and then apply the discount.

1. Total hours worked: 6 hours/day * 4 days/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours
2. Total cost before discount: 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000
3. Discount amount: 10% of $30,000 = 0.10 * $30,000 = $3,000
4. Total amount paid after discount: $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000

"To find out how many calories Sue consumed, we first need to determine how many cookies she ate. 

On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 5 cookies, so Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday.

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 13 cookies, so Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.

In total, Sue ate 20 + 26 = 46 cookies. 

Her sister ate 5 + 13 = 18 cookies.

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, Sue consumed 46 * 200 = 9200 calories and her sister consumed 18 * 200 = 3600 calories.

The difference in calories consumed is 9200 - 3600 = 5600.

"To find the number of boys in the third class, we first need to determine the total number of girls in the school. 

Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, and there are 3 classes with 20 students each, the total number of students in the school is 3 * 20 = 60.

The total number of girls in the school is 50% of 60, which is 0.5 * 60 = 30.

We already know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27.

The number of girls in the third class can be found by subtracting the total number of girls in the first two classes from the total number of girls in the school: 30 - 27 = 3.

Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, the total number of boys in the school is also 30. 

The total number of boys in the first two classes is 60 - 27 = 33 (since there are 60 students in total and 27 are girls). 

The number of boys in the third class can be found by subtracting the total number of boys in the first two classes from the total number of boys in the school: 30 - 33 is incorrect, we need to find the boys in the third class, so we need to find the boys in the first two classes first. 

The number of boys in the first class is 20 - 15 = 5. 
The number of boys in the second class is 20 - 12 = 8. 

The total number of boys in the first two classes is 5 + 8 = 13. 

The number of boys in the third class is 30 - 13 = 17.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's identify the information given:

- Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars.
- Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars, and three fewer cougars than the previous night.

Let's denote the number of cougars killed today as 'x'. Since Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, the number of cougars killed today is 15 - 3 = 12.

Since Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars today, the number of wolves killed today is 3 * 12 = 36.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals killed by Rick:

- Last night: 10 wolves + 15 cougars = 25 animals
- Today: 36 wolves + 12 cougars = 48 animals

The total number of animals killed by Rick is 25 + 48 = 73.

"To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we first need to determine how many times Anne went down the slide. 

Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we need to calculate 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30. 

30% of 30 is 0.3 x 30 = 9. 

So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne, so we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4.

21 x 4 = 84.

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we first need to determine the total number of cows Mr. Sylas added to the stalls. Since he bought 40 cows and divided them equally among the 10 stalls, we can calculate the number of cows added to each stall as follows:

40 cows / 10 stalls = 4 cows per stall

Since Mr. Sylas added 4 cows to each stall, the total number of cows in each stall now is the original 20 cows plus the 4 new cows:

20 (original cows) + 4 (new cows) = 24 cows per stall

Now, we need to find the total number of cows in 8 of the stalls. We can multiply the number of cows per stall by the number of stalls:

24 cows per stall * 8 stalls = 192 cows

"To find the total weight of the redwood tree, we need to calculate the total number of 10-foot sections and then multiply it by the weight of each section. 

The redwood is 200 feet tall, so we divide 200 by 10 to get the total number of sections: 200 / 10 = 20 sections.

Each section weighs 400 pounds, so we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section: 20 * 400 = 8000 pounds.

However, the termites ate 30% of the wood, so we need to subtract 30% of the total weight from the total weight. To find 30% of 8000, we multiply 8000 by 0.3: 8000 * 0.3 = 2400.

Now, we subtract 2400 from the total weight: 8000 - 2400 = 5600 pounds.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Let's denote the number of apples Andrea has as A, the number of bananas Andrea has as B, and the number of bananas Jamal has as J.

2. We know that Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, so we can write an equation: A = J + 8.

3. We also know that Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so we can write another equation: B = J/2.

4. We are given that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so we can write a third equation: J = A + 4.

5. We are also given that Andrea has 52 apples, so we can substitute this value into the first equation: 52 = J + 8.

6. Now we can solve for J: J = 52 - 8 = 44.

7. Now that we know J, we can find B: B = J/2 = 44/2 = 22.

"To determine the total amount of flour needed, we need to calculate the amount needed for each day and then add them together.

For today, Carla is making 36 cookies. Since two cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many cups are needed for 36 cookies. 

First, we find out how many dozens are in 36 cookies: 36 / 12 = 3. 

Since 2 cups of flour are needed for 12 cookies, we multiply the number of dozens by the amount of flour needed per dozen: 3 * 2 = 6 cups of flour needed for today.

For tomorrow, Carla is making 30 cookies. Again, we find out how many dozens are in 30 cookies: 30 / 12 = 2.5.

Since 2 cups of flour are needed for 12 cookies, we multiply the number of dozens by the amount of flour needed per dozen: 2.5 * 2 = 5 cups of flour needed for tomorrow.

Now, we add the amount of flour needed for today and tomorrow: 6 + 5 = 11 cups of flour.

Two-thirds of 9,300 can be calculated as (2/3) * 9,300.

To find the dollar amount, we need to convert the number of pennies to dollars. Since 1 dollar is equal to 100 pennies, we can divide the number of pennies by 100 to get the dollar amount.

First, let's calculate two-thirds of 9,300:
(2/3) * 9,300 = 6,200

Now, let's convert the number of pennies to dollars:

   So, Ferdinand has 6 / 2 = 3 trees.
3. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has.
   First, we find twice the number of trees Ferdinand has: 2 * 3 = 6.
   Then, we add 5 to this number: 6 + 5 = 11.
   So, Harry has 11 trees.

Now, we need to find the difference in the number of trees between Harry's yard and Ferdinand's yard.
The difference is 11 - 3 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total amount of money the three girls have combined, we need to calculate the amount each girl has and then add them together.

Carmen has $100.
Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so Samantha has $100 + $25 = $125.
Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so Daisy has $125 + $50 = $175.

Now, let's add the amounts together: $100 + $125 + $175 = $300.

The final answer is: $300"
"To find the total price of the house, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and the transfer fee, and then add them to the selling price.

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, which is 0.05 x $350,000 = $17,500.

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price, which is 0.12 x $350,000 = $42,000.

The total price of the house is the sum of the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee: $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

To find out how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we subtract her budget from the total price: $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500.

The final answer is: $9,500"
"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to calculate the total amount he paid in fees and subtract that from the selling price, then subtract the remaining loan amount.

First, let's calculate the transfer fees: 3% of $400,000 = 0.03 x $400,000 = $12,000.

Next, let's calculate the brokerage fee: 5% of $400,000 = 0.05 x $400,000 = $20,000.

The total amount paid in fees is $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000.

Now, let's subtract the total fees from the selling price: $400,000 - $32,000 = $368,000.

Finally, let's subtract the remaining loan amount: $368,000 - $250,000 = $118,000.

The final answer is: $118,000."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. It takes 20 minutes for the oil to heat up to 300 degrees.
2. It then takes 40% longer for the oil to heat up to 400 degrees. 
   40% of 20 minutes is 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes.
   So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat up to 400 degrees.
3. After warming the oil, it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil.
   It took 28 minutes to warm up the oil, so it takes 28 - 5 = 23 minutes to cook.

The total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is the sum of the time it took to warm up the oil and the time it took to cook.
Total time = 28 minutes (to warm up the oil) + 23 minutes (to cook) = 51 minutes.

"To find the total number of M&Ms Mary got, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and add them together.

The first bag has 300 M&Ms.

The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.

The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, we add the number of M&Ms in each bag together: 300 + 312 + 150 = 762.

The final answer is: 762"
"To find the total number of windows, we need to calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows in each house.

Each house has 3 bedrooms with 2 windows each, so the total number of windows in the bedrooms of one house is 3 * 2 = 6. Since there are 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms is 6 * 2 = 12.

Each house has 4 additional windows not connected to bedrooms. Since there are 2 houses, the total number of additional windows is 4 * 2 = 8.

The total number of windows in one house is 12 (from bedrooms) + 8 (additional) = 20. Since there are 2 houses, the total number of windows is 20 * 2 = 40.

"To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we first need to determine the total number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette. 

The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches, which is 900 * 0.1 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 90 * 2 = 180 stitches.

The total number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette is 90 + 180 = 270 stitches.

Since the total number of stitches for the sweater is 1800, the number of stitches for the sleeves is 1800 - 270 = 1530 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, the number of stitches for each sleeve is 1530 / 2 = 765 stitches.

"To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the lines for each scene and the song, and then add them together.

The solo song has 54 lines.

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. However, only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has (4/5) * 60 = 48 lines from the second scene.

To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

"To find the number of cards with the letter D, we need to calculate the number of cards that do not have the letter A, B, or C.

First, we find the number of cards with the letter A: 2/5 of 80 is (2/5) * 80 = 32.

Next, we find the number of cards with the letter B. The remaining cards after A are 80 - 32 = 48. 1/2 of 48 is (1/2) * 48 = 24.

Now, we find the number of cards with the letter C. The remaining cards after A and B are 48 - 24 = 24. 5/8 of 24 is (5/8) * 24 = 15.

The number of cards with the letter D is the total number of cards minus the number of cards with A, B, and C: 80 - 32 - 24 - 15 = 9.

"To find the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we first need to determine their current ages. Since the sum of their ages is 20, we can represent their ages as x and 20 - x.

In 10 years, Mico's age will be x + 10 and Marco's age will be (20 - x) + 10.

The sum of their ages in 10 years will be (x + 10) + ((20 - x) + 10).

Simplifying the expression, we get: 
x + 10 + 20 - x + 10 
= 30 + 10 
= 40

So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Ruby's current age as R and Sam's current age as S.

From the first statement, we know that Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, so we can write an equation:

R = 6S

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9, and Sam's age will be S + 9. According to the second statement, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can write another equation:

R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Now, let's simplify the second equation:

R + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtract 9 from both sides:

R = 3S + 18

Now we have two equations:

R = 6S
R = 3S + 18

Since both equations are equal to R, we can set them equal to each other:

6S = 3S + 18

Subtract 3S from both sides:

3S = 18

Divide both sides by 3:

S = 6

So, Sam is 6 years old now.

The final answer is: 6"

"To find the total number of spots on the cobras, we need to multiply the number of cobras by the number of spots on each cobra. 

Number of cobras: 40
Number of spots per cobra: 70
Total spots on cobras: 40 * 70 = 2800

Since the cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, the number of spots on a mamba is half the number of spots on a cobra.

Number of spots per mamba: 70 / 2 = 35
Total number of mambas: 60
Total spots on mambas: 60 * 35 = 2100

Total spots on all snakes: 2800 + 2100 = 4900

Half the number of spots: 4900 / 2 = 2450

"To find the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace, we first need to calculate the total space occupied by the topaz gemstones and the remaining space that will be filled by the sterling silver beads.

Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and there are 8 gemstones per necklace. So, the total space occupied by the gemstones is 8 inches.

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches. To find the remaining space for the sterling silver beads, we subtract the space occupied by the gemstones from the total length of the necklace:

25 inches (total length) - 8 inches (space occupied by gemstones) = 17 inches

Each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long. To find the number of beads that can fit in the remaining space, we divide the remaining space by the length of each bead:

17 inches / (1/4 inch) = 17 / 0.25 = 68

So, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

Total stories in the first week = 20 + 40 + 60 = 120

In the second week, each of them doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week. 

Alani doubled her 20 stories to 20 * 2 = 40 stories.
Braylen doubled his 40 stories to 40 * 2 = 80 stories.
Margot doubled her 60 stories to 60 * 2 = 120 stories.

Total stories in the second week = 40 + 80 + 120 = 240

"To find the number of rows of 5-star stars, we first need to determine the total number of stars and then subtract the number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows.

The total number of stars in the 8-star rows is 3 * 8 = 24.
The total number of stars in the 6-star rows is 2 * 6 = 12.

The total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows is 24 + 12 = 36.

Since the flag has 76 stars in total, the number of stars in the 5-star rows is 76 - 36 = 40.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the speed of the car in the slow lane. Since it's traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, we can calculate its speed as follows:

Speed of car in the fast lane = 60 miles/hour
Speed of car in the slow lane = 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour

Now, we know the distance covered by both cars is the same, which is 480 miles. We can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

For the car in the fast lane:
Time = 480 miles / 60 miles/hour = 8 hours

Since the car in the slow lane travels at half the speed, it will take twice as long to cover the same distance. Therefore, the time taken by the car in the slow lane is:

Time = 8 hours * 2 = 16 hours

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Ali has 22 medals.
2. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.
3. Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.
4. They have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting, which means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have together.
5. Let's represent the total number of medals given out as 'x'. Then, we can write the equation: 39 = x / 10.
6. To solve for 'x', we multiply both sides of the equation by 10: x = 39 * 10.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of chocolate bars available. Since each packet contains 5 chocolate bars and there are 8 packets, the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

We know that each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, and there are 4 adults. So, the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 * 6 = 24.

Now, we need to find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children. This can be calculated by subtracting the number of chocolate bars given to adults from the total number of chocolate bars: 40 - 24 = 16.

Since there are 8 children, and the remaining chocolate bars are to be shared equally among them, we divide the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children: 16 / 8 = 2.

Therefore, each child will get 2 chocolate bars.

"To calculate Susan's earnings, we need to determine the total time she worked and then multiply it by her hourly wage.

First, let's find the total time she worked. She worked from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. However, she also paused for half an hour (0.5 hours) in between. 

Total time worked = 3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to convert her hourly wage to a per-minute wage. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

Per-minute wage = $5 / 10 minutes = $0.5 per minute

Now, we can calculate her total earnings by multiplying the total time worked (in minutes) by her per-minute wage.

Total time worked in minutes = 2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Total earnings = Total time worked in minutes * Per-minute wage
Total earnings = 150 minutes * $0.5/minute
Total earnings = $75

"To find the total points of all three players after the extra points had been distributed, we need to first calculate their points after the fourth round.

Initially, Mike has 21 points. 
Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

After the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. 
Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point. Now Mike has 21 + 1 = 22 points.
Jim has 18 points, so he does not get an extra point. Jim still has 18 points.
Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point. Now Tony has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

Now, let's calculate the total points of all three players after the extra points had been distributed:
Mike has 22 points, Jim has 18 points, and Tony has 43 points.
Total points = 22 + 18 + 43 = 83

"To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we first need to determine how many oranges the sons washed. 

The oldest son is 8 years old, and he washes as many oranges as he is years old, so he washes 8 oranges. 

The youngest son is half as old as the oldest son, which means he is 8 / 2 = 4 years old. He also washes as many oranges as he is years old, so he washes 4 oranges.

In total, the sons wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day and then divide the total amount of rice available by that amount.

First, let's calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day. Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 3 meals per day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner). Since 5 members of the household eat rice every lunch and dinner, we can assume they also eat it for breakfast. So, the total number of people eating rice per day is 5.

Total rice consumed per person per day = 0.2 kg/meal * 3 meals = 0.6 kg/day
Total rice consumed by 5 people per day = 0.6 kg/day * 5 people = 3 kg/day

Now, let's calculate how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last:

Total rice available = 42 kg
Total rice consumed per day = 3 kg

Number of days a 42 kg bag of rice will last = Total rice available / Total rice consumed per day
= 42 kg / 3 kg/day
= 14 days

Since we want to know how many weeks the rice will last, we need to convert the number of days to weeks:

Number of weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last = 14 days / 7 days/week
= 2 weeks

He sold 20 crates over the weekend, 15 crates on Tuesday, 12 crates on Wednesday, and 18 crates on Thursday. 

Total crates sold = 20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65 crates.

Since Sam's target was 120 crates, we subtract the total crates sold from the target to find out how many crates he was off from his target.

120 - 65 = 55

Sam was 55 crates off from his target for the week.

"To calculate the total cost, we need to calculate the total miles driven, the total cost of driving, and the total bonus paid.

1. Total miles driven: Since John goes to work and back each day, the total miles driven per day is 2 * 30 = 60 miles. He goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year, so the total miles driven per year is 60 * 5 * 50 = 15,000 miles.

2. Total cost of driving: John is charged $2 per mile driven, so the total cost of driving per year is 15,000 * $2 = $30,000.

3. Total bonus paid: John gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus paid per year is $150 * 12 = $1,800.

4. Total cost: The total cost is the sum of the total cost of driving and the total bonus paid, which is $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

"To determine the number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider the folding process. 

When a piece of paper is folded vertically, it creates two layers: the front and the back. 

For a 32-page tabloid, we need to have 32 pages in total. Since each piece of paper can be used to create two pages (front and back), we can calculate the number of pieces of paper needed by dividing the total number of pages by 2.

However, we also need to consider that the first and last pages (pages 1 and 32) will be on the outside of the fold, and the remaining pages will be on the inside. Since the first and last pages are on the outside, they will be on separate pieces of paper. The remaining 30 pages will be on the inside, and since they are paired, we can divide by 2.

So, the calculation would be: (1 for the first page) + (1 for the last page) + (30 / 2) = 1 + 1 + 15 = 16

Therefore, 16 pieces of paper would be used in a 32-page tabloid.

So, the total amount she spent is $25 (food and snacks) + $10 (rides) = $35.

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount she brought: $50 (initial amount) - $35 (total spent) = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to first determine how many books she sold in the first year and the second year.

We know that Elise sold 45 books this year. 

Since she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, the number of books she sold in the first year is 2 * 45 = 90.

We also know that there are 50 unsold books left, and the total number of books is 250. So, the total number of books sold is 250 - 50 = 200.

We can now find the number of books sold in the second year by subtracting the number of books sold in the first year and the current year from the total number of books sold: 200 - 90 - 45 = 65.

The total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is the number of books sold in the second year multiplied by the price of each book, which is 65 * 20 = 1300.

The final answer is: $1300"
"To calculate Watson's total earnings for April, we need to calculate his regular earnings and the bonus.

Watson works 5 days a week, and April has 4 weeks. So, he works a total of 5 days/week * 4 weeks = 20 days in April.

His regular earnings are calculated by multiplying the number of hours he works in a day by his hourly wage and the number of days he works in April. Since he works 10 hours a day, his regular earnings are 10 hours/day * $10/hour * 20 days = $2000.

Additionally, he gets a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well. Since April has 4 weeks, he gets a total bonus of $300/week * 4 weeks = $1200.

His total earnings for April are the sum of his regular earnings and the bonus: $2000 + $1200 = $3200.

The final answer is: $3200"
"To find out how many people John lost to, we need to calculate 20% of 20, since he beat 80% of the people he arm wrestled.

20% of 20 is calculated as 0.20 * 20 = 4.

So, John lost to 4 people. 

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many loaves are sold in the afternoon, we first need to determine how many loaves are left after the morning sales. 

The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. 

Two-thirds of 60 is calculated as (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves. 

So, 40 loaves are sold in the morning. 

This leaves 60 - 40 = 20 loaves. 

Half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening. 

Half of 20 is 20 / 2 = 10 loaves. 

Since the remaining loaves are divided equally between the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much weight Joey loses per week and then calculate how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight.

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. To find out how much weight Joey loses per week, we divide the total weight lost by the number of weeks:

Weight lost per week = Total weight lost / Number of weeks
Weight lost per week = 8 pounds / 4 weeks
Weight lost per week = 2 pounds per week

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, we can multiply the number of weeks it takes Joey to lose the weight by 4:

Number of weeks for Sandy = 4 weeks (Joey's time) * 4
Number of weeks for Sandy = 16 weeks

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total savings, we need to calculate the savings on the tubs of ice cream and the packets of milk separately and then add them together.

The original price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $13 = $26. The discounted price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $11 = $22. The savings on 2 tubs of ice cream is $26 - $22 = $4.

The original price of 4 packets of milk is 4 x $1 = $4. The discounted price of 4 packets of milk is 4 x ($1 - $0.5) = 4 x $0.5 = $2. The savings on 4 packets of milk is $4 - $2 = $2.

The total savings is $4 + $2 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of new arms and legs grown by the person after 15 days.

The person grows an extra arm every 3 days. To find out how many arms are grown in 15 days, we divide 15 by 3. 

15 / 3 = 5

So, the person will grow 5 extra arms.

The person grows an extra leg every 5 days. To find out how many legs are grown in 15 days, we divide 15 by 5.

15 / 5 = 3

So, the person will grow 3 extra legs.

To find the total number of new limbs, we add the number of new arms and legs.

5 (new arms) + 3 (new legs) = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount spent by Theo on the business suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket, and then subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount he had, and then subtract the amount he wishes to save.

1. Calculate the cost of the business suits: 6 suits * $100 each = $600
2. Calculate the cost of the suitcases: 3 suitcases * $50 each = $150
3. Calculate the cost of the flight ticket: The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. The cost of a business suit is $100, so 5 times that is $500. $700 more than that is $1200.
4. Calculate the total amount spent on the business suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket: $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950
5. Calculate the total amount left after subtracting the total amount spent from the initial amount: $6000 - $1950 = $4050
6. Calculate the amount left after subtracting the amount he wishes to save: $4050 - $2000 = $2050

The amount he has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa is $2050."
"To find the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we need to first calculate the number of eggs consumed by each group per day and then multiply it by 7 (the number of days in a week).

Three people eat 3 eggs each day, so the total number of eggs consumed by this group per day is 3 * 3 = 9 eggs.

The rest of the family members are 5 - 3 = 2. They eat 2 eggs each day, so the total number of eggs consumed by this group per day is 2 * 2 = 4 eggs.

The total number of eggs consumed by the family per day is 9 + 4 = 13 eggs.

To find the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7: 13 * 7 = 91 eggs.

The final answer is: 91"
"To find Trent's age, we need to determine Jane's age first, and then add 5 to it. 

Since Quinn is 30 and Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, Jane's age can be calculated as follows:
Jane's age = Quinn's age - 3
Jane's age = 30 - 3
Jane's age = 27

Now, since Trent is 5 years older than Jane, Trent's age can be calculated as follows:
Trent's age = Jane's age + 5
Trent's age = 27 + 5
Trent's age = 32

The final answer is: 32"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. Let's denote Noah's current age as N. Since Cera is 46 years old, six years ago, Cera's age was 40. According to the problem, six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so we can write the equation:

N - 6 = 0.5 * (40)

2. Solve for N:

N - 6 = 20
N = 26

So, Noah is currently 26 years old.

3. The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah, which is 26 * 3000 = 78,000.

4. The problem states that the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now. Let's denote the current population of Chile as P. Then, the population six years ago was P/2. We can write the equation:

P/2 = 78,000

5. Solve for P:

P = 78,000 * 2
P = 156,000

The final answer is: 156,000"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of players on the defense as D. 

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2D.

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is D/2.

We know that the total number of players on the team is 105. Therefore, the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams is equal to 105.

We can write the equation as follows:

2D + D + D/2 = 105

To simplify the equation, we can multiply all terms by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

4D + 2D + D = 210

Combine like terms:

7D = 210

Now, divide both sides by 7:

D = 210 / 7
D = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total number of people invited, we first need to calculate the number of people from the 2 families with 6 people and the 3 families with 4 people.

For the 2 families with 6 people, the total number of people is 2 * 6 = 12.
For the 3 families with 4 people, the total number of people is 3 * 4 = 12.
The total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.

However, 8 people couldn't come due to illness. So, we subtract 8 from the total number of people invited: 24 - 8 = 16.

Then, 1/4 of the people who couldn't come due to illness had previous commitments. 1/4 of 8 is 2. So, we subtract 2 from the number of people who couldn't come due to illness: 8 - 2 = 6.

Now, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come due to illness and previous commitments from the total number of people invited: 16 - 6 = 10.

"To find the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store, we need to calculate the total number of marbles first.

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and added them to a store that had 50. So, the total number of marbles in the store after buying from Johanna is 20 + 50 = 70.

His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna, his father gave him 2/5 * 20 = 8 marbles.

Now, the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store is 70 (initial marbles) + 20 (bought from Johanna) + 8 (given by his father) = 98 marbles.

Since each marble weighs 2kgs, the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store is 98 * 2 = 196 kgs.

"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (such as the pool) is length x width x height.

Given dimensions:
- Length (L) = 6 feet
- Width (W) = 4 feet
- Height (H) = 5 feet

Volume (V) = L x W x H = 6 x 4 x 5 = 120 cubic feet

Now, we need to find the cost to fill the pool. The cost is given as $0.1 per cubic foot.

Cost = Volume x Cost per cubic foot
= 120 cubic feet x $0.1/cubic foot

"To find the total number of children in the classroom, we need to calculate the number of girls, nongendered children, and then add them to the number of boys.

Given that there are 30 boys, and the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, the number of girls can be calculated as:
Girls = 3 * Boys = 3 * 30 = 90

The classroom has 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, so the number of nongendered children can be calculated as:
Nongendered children = (1/10) * Boys = (1/10) * 30 = 3

Now, we can find the total number of children by adding the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
Total children = Boys + Girls + Nongendered children = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123

The final answer is: 123"
"To find the total number of electric poles required, we need to use the given ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This means that for every 3 electric wires, there is 1 electric pole.

Given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles:

1 (electric pole) / 3 (electric wires) = x (electric poles) / 45 (electric wires)

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

1 * 45 = 3x
45 = 3x

Now, divide both sides by 3 to find x:

x = 45 / 3
x = 15

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of people who left the party. 

Initially, there were 25 men and 15 women, so the total number of people is 25 + 15 = 40.

1/4 of the total number of people left, so the number of people who left is 1/4 * 40 = 10.

Since 22 men stayed at the party, the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3.

Now, we know that 10 people left in total, and 3 of them were men. So, the number of women who left is 10 - 3 = 7.

Initially, there were 15 women, and 7 left. So, the number of women left is 15 - 7 = 8.

"To find the total number of pencils Jam has, we know she has 3 boxes and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils. We can set up an equation to represent this: 

3x + 2 = 26, where x is the number of pencils in each box.

To solve for x, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: 
3x = 26 - 2
3x = 24

Then, we divide both sides by 3 to find the value of x:
x = 24 / 3
x = 8

So, each box contains 8 pencils. 

Now, we know Jam has 3 boxes with 8 pencils each, which is 3 * 8 = 24 pencils. We also know Meg has 46 pencils. To find the total number of pencils, we add the pencils Jam and Meg have: 
24 (Jam's pencils) + 46 (Meg's pencils) = 70 pencils.

Since each box contains 8 pencils, we need to divide the total number of pencils by 8 to find the total number of boxes needed: 
70 / 8 = 8.75

Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we round up to the nearest whole number to ensure all pencils are stored. Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

The final answer is: 9"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total weakening effect of the ice cubes and the added cream.

First, let's calculate the number of ice cubes needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, we can divide 65 by 13 to get the number of ice cubes:

65 / 13 = 5

Since each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, 5 ice cubes will make it 5 x 12 = 60 milliliters weaker.

Next, we need to add the weakening effect of the 15 milliliters of cream. The total weakening effect is the sum of the weakening effects of the ice cubes and the cream:

60 + 15 = 75 milliliters

Therefore, Shannon's iced coffee will be 75 milliliters weaker.

The final answer is: 75"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the trade ratio. The given ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record. This means that for every 2 old records, 1 new record is given.

Since 5 people come in and leave with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of new records as 7. However, we need to find out how many old records were traded for these new records.

Let's use the ratio to set up an equation. If 2 old records are traded for 1 new record, then the total number of old records traded for 7 new records can be calculated as follows:

2 old records / 1 new record = x old records / 7 new records

To find the value of x, we can cross-multiply:

2 * 7 = 1 * x
14 = x

However, this is the number of old records traded for 1 new record. Since there are 5 people, and each person is trading, we need to multiply this number by 5 to get the total number of old records brought in:

14 * 5 = 70

Therefore, the 5 people brought in a total of 70 old records.

The final answer is: 70"
"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to calculate the total amount paid to junior programmers and senior programmers separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of junior programmers. The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, which is 100. 

Number of junior programmers = (2/5) * 100 = 40

Since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, the salary of a senior programmer is $2000 + $400 = $2400.

The number of senior programmers is the total number of employees minus the number of junior programmers, which is 100 - 40 = 60.

Now, let's calculate the total amount paid to junior programmers and senior programmers separately.

Total amount paid to junior programmers = Number of junior programmers * Salary of junior programmers
= 40 * $2000
= $80000

Total amount paid to senior programmers = Number of senior programmers * Salary of senior programmers
= 60 * $2400
= $144000

Now, let's add the total amount paid to junior programmers and senior programmers to find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month.

Total amount paid to all programmers = Total amount paid to junior programmers + Total amount paid to senior programmers
= $80000 + $144000
= $208000

The final answer is: $208000"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as 'x'.

Initially, there were x people on the bus.

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the total number of people became x + 5.

At the second bus stop, 7 people got down, so the total number of people became (x + 5) - 7 = x - 2.

Then, 8 more people got in, so the total number of people became (x - 2) + 8 = x + 6.

We are given that the total number of people heading to the third stop is 20, so we can set up the equation:

x + 6 = 20

To solve for x, we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:

x = 20 - 6
x = 14

3. He passes 14 out to his friends, so he has 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops left.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.
5. He eats 3 more that night, so he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops left.
6. He eats 2 more in the morning, so he has 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops left.

"To find the time it takes to fully charge the phone, we need to first determine how many percentage points are left to charge. Since the phone is already at 60% charged, it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more to be fully charged.

Given that the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time it takes to charge the remaining 40% as follows:

Time = Total percentage points left / Rate of charge per minute
Time = 40 / (1/3)
Time = 40 * 3
Time = 120 minutes

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

Time = 120 / 60
Time = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

"To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we need to first calculate the total number of lollipops she has after her mother gives her 10 more. 

Erin initially has 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her 10 more, so Erin now has 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops.

Then, Erin gives 3 lollipops to Ella. To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we subtract 3 from 17: 17 - 3 = 14.

So, Erin has 14 lollipops left.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. The customer spent $80 on their last shopping trip, which earned them $4 in rewards (since $80 / $20 = 4). 
2. The customer used these rewards on their current shopping trip, which means they had $4 off their current purchase.
3. The customer also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. Since the rewards were $4, the coupon took 2 * $4 = $8 off the price.
4. The customer spent $43 on this shopping trip. To find out how much they paid, we need to subtract the rewards and the coupon discount from the original price. However, since the coupon discount is twice the rewards, we should subtract the rewards first and then subtract the coupon discount from the remaining amount.

First, subtract the rewards from the original price: $43 - $4 = $39.
Then, subtract the coupon discount from the remaining amount: $39 - $8 = $31.

The customer paid $31 on this shopping trip.

"To determine which job pays more, we need to calculate the net pay for each job.

For Job A:
- Gross income: $15/hour * 2000 hours/year = $30,000/year
- Total tax: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net income: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

For Job B:
- Gross income: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income before tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Total tax: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net income: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Since $32,400 is greater than $24,000, Job B pays more. 

To find the difference in net pay between the two jobs, we subtract the net income of Job A from the net income of Job B:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

"To find the final value of Maria's shares, we need to calculate the value after the price increase and then the decrease.

Initially, Maria buys 8 shares for $8 each, so the total cost is 8 * 8 = $64.

The stock price increases by 50% in the first year. To find the new price, we multiply the original price by 1.5 (100% + 50% = 150%, or 1 + 0.5 = 1.5).

New price = $8 * 1.5 = $12 per share.

The total value of Maria's shares after the price increase is 8 * $12 = $96.

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. To find the new price, we multiply the previous price by 0.75 (100% - 25% = 75%, or 1 - 0.25 = 0.75).

New price = $12 * 0.75 = $9 per share.

The total value of Maria's shares after the price decrease is 8 * $9 = $72.

The final value of Maria's shares is $72.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume the number of students in the two equal groups is x. Since the last group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the last group is x - 10.

We know that the total number of students in the class is 200. Since the two equal groups have x students each, and the last group has x - 10 students, we can set up the equation:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 70

Since x represents the number of students in each of the two equal groups, the number of students in the last group is x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60.

Now that we know there are 20 cows, we can find the number of chickens:

Number of chickens = 2c = 2(20) = 40

Since cows have 4 legs and chickens have 2 legs, we can calculate the total number of legs:

Total legs of cows = 20 * 4 = 80
Total legs of chickens = 40 * 2 = 80

Total legs of all animals = 80 + 80 = 160

The final answer is: 160"
"To find out how many balls Josh is juggling at the end, we need to determine how many balls he had before the incident and then subtract the balls that were lost.

Initially, Josh starts with 3 balls. He adds 1 ball each week for 4 weeks, so he adds 4 balls. 

3 (initial balls) + 4 (added balls) = 7 balls

However, Josh drops 3 balls, but 2 are caught by the crowd. So, only 1 ball is lost.

7 (total balls) - 1 (lost ball) = 6 balls

Josh starts juggling with 6 balls on stage. 

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the weights of the blue beetle, green toad, yellow snake, and red bird.

Since the pink frog weighs 50 pounds and it weighs the same as the blue beetle and the green toad, we can conclude that the blue beetle and the green toad also weigh 50 pounds.

The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.

The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal by adding the weights of the animals and the container: 50 (pink frog) + 50 (blue beetle) + 50 (green toad) + 60 (yellow snake) + 30 (red bird) + 20 (container) = 260 pounds.

The final answer is: 260"
"To find the total number of outfits Laurel has for her baby, we need to add up the outfits she received from her friend, the new outfits she received at the baby shower, and the outfits her mom gifted her.

Laurel's friend gave her 24 outfits.
At the baby shower, she received twice the amount of new outfits, which is 2 * 24 = 48 outfits.
Her mom gifted her 15 outfits.

Now, let's add up the total number of outfits: 24 + 48 + 15 = 87.

The final answer is: 87"
"To find the total distance Tyson covered in June, we first need to calculate the new daily distance he needs to run based on his coach's advice. 

The coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters in a day. This means he needs to run 5000 + (1/5 * 5000) meters per day. 

1/5 of 5000 is 1000, so the new daily distance is 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters.

Since there are 30 days in June, the total distance covered in June is 6000 * 30.

6000 * 30 = 180,000

The final answer is: 180,000"
"To find the price difference between Juice Box C and Juice Box B, we first need to determine the prices of Juice Box B and Juice Box C.

Juice Box A is 4 dollars.
Juice Box B is 5 dollars more than Juice Box A, so Juice Box B is 4 + 5 = 9 dollars.
Juice Box C is 7 dollars more than Juice Box A, so Juice Box C is 4 + 7 = 11 dollars.

Now, we need to find the difference between Juice Box C and Juice Box B. 
The difference is 11 - 9 = 2 dollars.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the total number of legs from the tables with 4 legs and the tables with 3 legs separately and then add them together.

The tables with 4 legs have a total of 40 * 4 = 160 legs.

The tables with 3 legs have a total of 50 * 3 = 150 legs.

Now, we add the total number of legs from both types of tables: 160 + 150 = 310.

The final answer is: 310"
"To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we need to calculate the total number of cookies consumed by her son and her husband, and then subtract that from the total number of cookies in a bag.

Jenny's son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, so he eats 4 * 5 = 20 cookies per week.

Jenny's husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so he eats 1 * 7 = 7 cookies per week.

The total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband is 20 + 7 = 27 cookies per week.

Since there are 36 cookies in a bag, and 27 are consumed by her son and husband, Jenny eats the remaining cookies. 

36 (total cookies) - 27 (cookies consumed by son and husband) = 9 cookies.

Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"To find the total amount Davos paid for the 2 shirts, we need to calculate the discount amount first. 

The original price of 2 shirts is 2 * $30 = $60. 

The discount is 40% of $60, which is 0.4 * $60 = $24.

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the final amount paid: $60 - $24 = $36.

Therefore, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts.

The final answer is: $36"
"To find the percentage increase in the amount of money the factory is making per day, we need to first calculate the difference in the amount of money they are making per day now and the amount they used to make.

The factory used to make $100 per tractor and sold 10 tractors a day, so they made $100 * 10 = $1000 per day.

Now, they make $220 per silo and sell 5 silos a day, so they make $220 * 5 = $1100 per day.

The difference in the amount of money they are making per day now and the amount they used to make is $1100 - $1000 = $100.

To find the percentage increase, we divide the difference by the original amount and multiply by 100:

($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%

So, the factory is making 10% more per day now.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total amount Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to calculate the monthly expenses and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's calculate the monthly expenses:

- Food costs $25 per week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the monthly food cost is $25 * 4 = $100.
- Treats cost $20 per month.
- Medicine costs $100 per month.

Total monthly expenses = $100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine) = $220.

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total annual expenses are:
$220 (monthly expenses) * 12 (months) = $2640.

"To find out how many plant pots April has left over, we first need to determine the total number of plant pots she needs for the school garden. 

The school needs 30 plant pots for the daisies. Since they need twice as many for the roses, they need 2 * 30 = 60 plant pots for the roses. 

In total, the school needs 30 + 60 = 90 plant pots.

April had already bought 100 plant pots from the garden center. To find out how many she has left over, we subtract the total number of plant pots needed from the total number of plant pots she bought: 100 - 90 = 10.

"To find the total time John spent, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and then add them up.

John spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours swimming. 

He watched 3 shows, each 2 hours long, so the total time spent watching shows is 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

The total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows is 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours.

We are given that watching shows was 30% of the total time, so we can set up the equation: 30% of total time = 15 hours. 

To find the total time, we can convert 30% to a decimal by dividing by 100: 30 / 100 = 0.3. 

Now we can solve for the total time: 0.3 * total time = 15 hours. 

Divide both sides by 0.3 to find the total time: total time = 15 / 0.3 = 50 hours.

We are also given that John spent 40% of his time sightseeing. To find the time spent sightseeing, we can convert 40% to a decimal by dividing by 100: 40 / 100 = 0.4.

Now we can multiply the total time by 0.4 to find the time spent sightseeing: time spent sightseeing = 0.4 * 50 = 20 hours.

"To determine how much money Annabelle still needs to save, we need to calculate her total earnings from both jobs and subtract the amount she already has in savings.

First, let's calculate her earnings from the first job:

Earnings from first job = Hourly wage * Number of hours worked
Earnings from first job = $10/hour * 20 hours
Earnings from first job = $200

Next, let's calculate her earnings from the second job:

Earnings from second job = Hourly wage * Number of hours worked
Earnings from second job = $5/hour * 15 hours
Earnings from second job = $75

Now, let's calculate her total earnings from both jobs:

Total earnings = Earnings from first job + Earnings from second job
Total earnings = $200 + $75
Total earnings = $275

Finally, let's subtract the amount she already has in savings from her total earnings to determine how much more she needs to save:

Amount still needed to save = Total earnings - Amount already saved
Amount still needed to save = $275 - $80
Amount still needed to save = $195

So, the height of the second tree is 6 + 5 = 11 feet.

Next, we need to find the combined height of the two shorter trees. The shortest tree is 6 feet, and the second tree is 11 feet. 

So, the combined height of the two shorter trees is 6 + 11 = 17 feet.

According to the problem, the height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined. 

So, the height of the tallest tree is 2 * 17 = 34 feet.

"To find out how much money Dean has left, we need to calculate the total amount of money he spent and then add the extra $10 his mother gave him.

First, let's calculate the total amount Dean spent on toy cars: 6 toy cars * $2 per toy car = $12.

Next, let's calculate the total amount Dean spent on teddy bears: 5 teddy bears * $1 per teddy bear = $5.

Now, let's add the total amount spent on toy cars and teddy bears: $12 + $5 = $17.

Dean initially had $28. After spending $17, he had $28 - $17 = $11 left.

His mother then gave him an extra $10, so we add that to the $11 he had left: $11 + $10 = $21.

Therefore, Dean has $21 left.

The final answer is: $21"
"To find out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to first calculate the total cost of the activities. 

The cost of mini-golf for Morgan and her friends is $5 per round. Since there are 'x' friends, the total cost for mini-golf will be 5 * (x + 1), where 'x' is the number of friends. 

The cost of go-karts for Morgan and her friends is $10 per ride. Since they will ride twice, the total cost for go-karts will be 10 * 2 * (x + 1).

The cost of arcade tokens is $5.

The total cost of the activities is the sum of the costs of mini-golf, go-karts, and arcade tokens. 

Total cost = 5 * (x + 1) + 10 * 2 * (x + 1) + 5

Combine like terms:
Total cost = 5x + 5 + 20x + 20 + 5
Total cost = 25x + 30

Morgan has a budget of $90. We can set up an equation to represent this:

25x + 30 = 90

Subtract 30 from both sides:
25x = 60

Divide both sides by 25:
x = 2.4

Since Morgan cannot invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number.

"To find out how much money Marisa saves in her piggy bank, we need to calculate the total amount she spends on lollipops and subtract that from the total amount she receives as pocket money.

Marisa receives $5 as pocket money every day. 

She buys 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each, so the total amount she spends on lollipops per day is 4 * 0.25 = $1.

The change she saves per day is $5 - $1 = $4.

Since she saves for 5 days, the total amount she saves is 5 * $4 = $20.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. First, let's find out how much change Billy got after buying the candy. Since he spent $1.5 per pound and he had $10, we can set up an equation to find the number of pounds of candy he bought. Let's call the number of pounds 'x'. The equation would be 1.5x = 10, because the total cost of the candy is equal to the amount of money he had.

2. Solving for x, we get x = 10 / 1.5 = 6.67 pounds. However, since we can't buy a fraction of a pound, we'll round down to 6 pounds for practical purposes.

3. Now, let's find out how much change Billy got after buying the candy. The total cost of the candy is 1.5 * 6 = $9. So, the change he got is $10 - $9 = $1.

4. Billy then takes half of his change, which is $1 / 2 = $0.5, and spends it on gumballs.

5. Since each gumball costs $0.05, the number of gumballs he bought is $0.5 / $0.05 = 10.

However, we are given that he bought 40 gumballs, which means our previous calculation was incorrect. Let's recalculate the change he got after buying the candy. 

6. If he bought 40 gumballs for $0.05 each, the total cost of the gumballs is 40 * $0.05 = $2. 

7. Since he spent $2 on gumballs, the change he got after buying the candy is $10 - $9 = $1, but he only used half of this change to buy gumballs. So, the amount he used to buy gumballs is $1 / 2 = $0.5, which is correct.

8. The amount he used to buy the candy is $10 - $2 = $8. 

9. Now, we can find the number of pounds of candy he bought by dividing the amount he used to buy the candy by the cost per pound. The number of pounds of candy he bought is $8 / $1.5 = 5.33 pounds. 

Since we can't buy a fraction of a pound, we'll round down to 5 pounds for practical purposes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To find the age of Carver's son, we need to first express the relationship between their ages as an equation. Let's denote Carver's age as C and his son's age as S.

We are given that Carver is 45 years old, so C = 45. We are also given that Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son, which can be expressed as C = 2S - 5.

Now, we can substitute the value of C into the second equation: 45 = 2S - 5.

To solve for S, we need to isolate S on one side of the equation. First, we add 5 to both sides: 45 + 5 = 2S - 5 + 5, which simplifies to 50 = 2S.

Next, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for S: 50 / 2 = 2S / 2, which simplifies to 25 = S.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the total distance the train travels in one trip, we need to add the distances between the three cities. 

Distance from the first city to the second city = 75 miles
Distance from the second city to the third city = 100 miles
Distance from the third city to the first city = 100 - 50 = 50 miles (since it's 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs)

Total distance in one trip = 75 + 100 + 50 = 225 miles

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day = 225 * 3 = 675 miles

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we need to divide the total distance it can travel before needing service by the distance it travels in a day.

Days between services = 18,000 / 675 = 26.67

Since the number of days must be a whole number, we round down to the nearest whole number, as the train cannot travel a fraction of a day.

The average amount of stuffing for a collie bed is (8 + 2) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for the chihuahua beds: 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.

Next, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for the collie beds: 3 * 5 = 15 pounds.

Finally, we add the total amount of stuffing needed for the chihuahua beds and the collie beds: 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

"To find the total time taken for the trip, we need to calculate the time taken for each part of the trip and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time taken for the trip to his friend's house:

Distance = 200 miles
Speed = 70 mph
Time = Distance / Speed = 200 / 70 = 2.857 hours (approximately)

However, he took a detour that added 10 miles to his trip. So, the actual distance traveled to his friend's house is 200 + 10 = 210 miles.

Time taken for the detour = 10 miles / 70 mph = 0.143 hours (approximately)

Total time taken to reach his friend's house = 2.857 + 0.143 = 3 hours

Now, let's calculate the time taken for the trip back home:

Distance = 240 miles
Speed = 80 mph
Time = Distance / Speed = 240 / 80 = 3 hours

Total time taken for the trip = Time taken to reach his friend's house + Time taken to return home
= 3 + 3

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as M, the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting as S, and the number of customers kicked out for physical violence as V.

We are given that:
1. M = 3
2. S = 4M - 5
3. V = 3S
4. M + S + V = 50

Now, let's substitute the values of S and V in terms of M into the equation M + S + V = 50.

M + (4M - 5) + 3(4M - 5) = 50

Combine like terms:
M + 4M - 5 + 12M - 15 = 50

Combine like terms:
17M - 20 = 50

Add 20 to both sides:
17M = 70

Divide both sides by 17:
M = 4.12 (round down to 4 since we can't have a fraction of a person)

Now that we have the value of M, we can find S and V:
S = 4M - 5 = 4(4) - 5 = 16 - 5 = 11
V = 3S = 3(11) = 33

Now, let's find the number of people kicked out for other reasons:

Let's denote the number of points Erin had before scoring 14 points as x. After scoring 14 points, Erin's total points will be x + 14. Since Erin now has three times more points than Sara, we can set up the equation:

x + 14 = 3 * 8

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 14 = 24

Subtracting 14 from both sides of the equation, we get:

x = 10

However, this is the number of points Erin had before scoring 14 points. To find the total number of points Erin has now, we add 14 to x:

x + 14 = 10 + 14 = 24

"To find the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we first need to calculate the materials cost. Since Ethan saved 20% by making it himself, we can assume that the materials cost is 80% of the market price.

The market price of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400. 

To find 80% of $400, we multiply $400 by 0.8 (since 100% - 20% = 80%).

Materials cost = $400 * 0.8 = $320

This is the cost of the materials. However, the question asks for the total cost, which includes the cost of materials and any other expenses. Since the question does not specify any other expenses, we can assume that the total cost is the same as the materials cost.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the amount they did the day before, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six people returned their pairs because they didn't fit, so we need to subtract those from the total number of shoes sold on Sunday. 14 - 6 = 8 pairs.

Now, let's add up the total number of shoes sold: 14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 8 (Sunday) = 50 pairs.

1. Half of the class likes blue: 40 / 2 = 20 pupils like blue.
2. One-fourth of the remaining likes green: The remaining pupils are 40 - 20 = 20. One-fourth of 20 is 20 / 4 = 5 pupils who like green.
3. The rest likes yellow: The number of pupils who like yellow is the total number of pupils minus the number of pupils who like blue and green. So, 40 - 20 - 5 = 15 pupils like yellow.

"To find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we need to calculate the number of apples picked each day and then add them together.

On Monday, we don't know the number of apples picked, but we know that Lucy sold them all for $56 at $4 per apple. So, we can find the number of apples picked on Monday by dividing the total amount earned by the price per apple:

$56 / $4 = 14 apples

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she did the previous day, which is 2 * 12 = 24 apples.

Now, we can add the number of apples picked each day to find the total:

14 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 24 (Wednesday) = 50 apples

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how many socks Lindsay has missed, we first need to determine the total number of socks she has washed. 

She washed 10 pairs of socks, and since each pair consists of 2 socks, she washed 10 * 2 = 20 socks from the pairs. 

Additionally, she washed 15 loose socks. 

So, the total number of socks she washed is 20 (from pairs) + 15 (loose socks) = 35 socks.

Since there were originally 50 socks that needed washing, we subtract the number of socks she washed from the total to find out how many she missed: 50 - 35 = 15.

Therefore, Lindsay has missed 15 socks.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how many cookies are left for Rachel, we need to start with the initial number of cookies she bought, which is 23. Then, we add the number of cookies Janet gave her, which is 42. 

23 (initial cookies) + 42 (cookies from Janet) = 65 cookies

After that, we need to subtract the number of cookies her brother ate, which is 44.

65 (total cookies) - 44 (cookies eaten) = 21 cookies

So, there are 21 cookies left for Rachel. 

21"
"To find the monthly payment, we need to calculate the total interest paid over the five months and then divide it by the number of months. 

First, we calculate the total interest paid over the five months. The formula for simple interest is:

Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

Here, Principal = $3,650, Rate = 10% or 0.10, and Time = 5 months.

Interest = $3,650 * 0.10 * 5
Interest = $1,825

Now, we add the interest to the principal to find the total amount Karan needs to pay:

Total Amount = Principal + Interest
Total Amount = $3,650 + $1,825
Total Amount = $5,475

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month, we divide the total amount by the number of months:

Monthly Payment = Total Amount / Number of Months
Monthly Payment = $5,475 / 5
Monthly Payment = $1,095

The final answer is: $1,095"
"To find out how many kilometers Cho hiked, we need to multiply the speed by the time. 

Cho's distance = 14 km/h * 8 h = 112 km

To find out how many kilometers Chloe hiked, we need to multiply her speed by the time she hiked.

Chloe's distance = 9 km/h * 5 h = 45 km

Now, we need to find the difference between Cho's distance and Chloe's distance to determine how many kilometers farther Cho hiked.

Difference = Cho's distance - Chloe's distance
= 112 km - 45 km
= 67 km

"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to calculate the total number of silver pesos and gold pesos they have separately and then add them together.

Axel has 50 silver pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so Anna has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos.

Axel has 80 gold pesos. Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so Anna has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

Now, let's add the total number of silver pesos and gold pesos they have together:

Total silver pesos = 50 (Axel's silver pesos) + 100 (Anna's silver pesos) = 150
Total gold pesos = 80 (Axel's gold pesos) + 120 (Anna's gold pesos) = 200

The total number of pesos they have together is the sum of the total silver pesos and total gold pesos:
Total pesos = Total silver pesos + Total gold pesos = 150 + 200 = 350

The final answer is: 350"
"To find the total profit per hour, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost.

First, let's find the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make with the supplies she bought. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups and she bought enough supplies to make 3 pitchers, she can make 3 * 12 = 36 cups of lemonade.

Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue will be the number of cups sold multiplied by the price per cup. However, we need to know how many hours she operates the stand to find the total revenue. Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, and she has 36 cups, she will sell all of the lemonade in 36 / 4 = 9 hours.

The total revenue will be 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

Now, let's find the total cost. Millie spent $18 to buy the supplies.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. So, the profit per hour will be the total profit divided by the number of hours she operates the stand.

Total profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Total profit = $36 - $18
Total profit = $18

Since she operates the stand for 9 hours, the profit per hour will be:
Profit per hour = Total profit / Number of hours
Profit per hour = $18 / 9
Profit per hour = $2

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the initial amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the initial amount of land as 'x' hectares.

Since Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land, he was left with 2/5 of his initial land. We are given that he had 12.8 hectares left.

We can set up the equation as follows:

2/5 * x = 12.8

To solve for 'x', we can multiply both sides of the equation by 5/2 to isolate 'x':

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther initially had 32 hectares of land.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the number of female members in the choir, we first need to calculate 50% of the total members. 

50% of 52 = 0.5 * 52 = 26

Since there are 26 female members, and half of them can't make it to the show, we need to find half of 26.

Half of 26 = 26 / 2 = 13

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them. To find the total number of people who sang in the performance, we add the number of female members who made it to the show and the number of teachers.

Total number of people who sang = 13 + 3 = 16

"To find Wilson's current math grade, we need to calculate the average of his 5 test scores. 

First, we add up all the scores: 
65 + 94 = 159
159 + 81 = 240
240 + 86 = 326
326 + 74 = 400

Next, we divide the sum by the number of tests to find the average:
400 / 5 = 80

Wilson's current math grade is 80, which meets the requirement for him to have the car for the weekend.

Now, we add the cost of erasers and pencils together: $12 + $24 = $36.

The final numerical answer is: $36"
"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to calculate the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu and add it to the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson.

First, let's find the number of messages James delivers to Mr. Yu. Since he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can multiply the number of messages to Ms. Thompson by 1/3.

Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * Messages to Ms. Thompson
Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * 66
Messages to Mr. Yu = 22

Now, we add the number of messages to Mr. Yu to the number of messages to Ms. Thompson to find the total number of messages James delivers.

Total messages = Messages to Ms. Thompson + Messages to Mr. Yu
Total messages = 66 + 22
Total messages = 88

"To determine how much money David saves, we need to calculate the cost of the rides for Dasha and compare it to the cost of the ride bracelet for David.

Each ride costs 2 tickets at $2 per ticket, so the cost of one ride is 2 * $2 = $4.

Since they ride all 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha to buy tickets for all 9 rides is 9 * $4 = $36.

David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides. This means he doesn't need to buy any additional tickets.

The difference in cost between Dasha's ticket purchases and David's ride bracelet is $36 - $30 = $6.

Therefore, David saves $6 by buying a ride bracelet instead of tickets.

The final answer is: $6"
"To find out how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we need to first determine the total number of gifts she needs to wrap and then divide the total amount of ribbon by that number.

Total gifts = 6 (family) + 4 (friends) + 2 (teachers) = 12 gifts

Since Monica wants to make a bow for each gift, she will need to use the same amount of ribbon for each gift. To find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each gift, we need to divide the total amount of ribbon by the total number of gifts.

Total ribbon = 144 inches
Total gifts = 12

Ribbon per gift = Total ribbon / Total gifts
Ribbon per gift = 144 / 12
Ribbon per gift = 12

"To find the number of popsicles each person has, we need to divide the total number of popsicles by the sum of the ratio parts (5+6=11). 

The total number of popsicles is 165. 

165 / 11 = 15. 

Since the ratio of Betty's popsicles is 5, we multiply 15 by 5 to find the number of popsicles Betty has: 15 * 5 = 75.

Since the ratio of Sam's popsicles is 6, we multiply 15 by 6 to find the number of popsicles Sam has: 15 * 6 = 90.

To find the difference in the number of popsicles between Sam and Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has: 90 - 75 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total cost of the streaming services, we need to calculate the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus. 

The normal cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 each, so together they cost $20. However, Tim saves 20% by bundling, which means he pays 80% of the total cost. 

To find 80% of $20, we multiply $20 by 0.8. 

$20 * 0.8 = $16

So, the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $16. 

Now, we add the cost of Netflix to find the total cost of the streaming services. 

$16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) + $10 (Netflix) = $26

To find the amount of money Tim saves by cancelling his cable package, we subtract the total cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package. 

$60 (cable package) - $26 (streaming services) = $34

The final answer is: $34"
"To find the total time spent on the song, we need to add up the time spent writing, recording, and editing. 

Time spent writing: 4 hours
Time spent recording: 4 hours / 2 = 2 hours
Time spent editing: 90 minutes = 1.5 hours

Total time spent = 4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5 hours

Now, to find the percentage of time spent editing, we need to divide the time spent editing by the total time and multiply by 100.

Percentage of time spent editing = (1.5 / 7.5) * 100 = 20%

"To find the total number of books Wendy needs to carry, we first need to determine the total number of books in the shelving system. Since it has 6 rows and 6 columns, we can multiply the number of rows by the number of columns to find the total number of spaces for books.

6 rows * 6 columns = 36 spaces

However, Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books in the system. To find the number of books she wants to place, we first need to double the number of spaces available.

36 spaces * 2 = 72 books

Then, we add 20 more books to this total.

72 books + 20 books = 92 books

Wendy will need to carry 92 books to complete her task.

The final answer is: 92"
"To find out how many Valentine's Day cards Erica has now, we need to calculate the total number of cards she initially had, added to the cards her dad brought, and then subtract the cards she passed out and add the cards she received.

Initially, Erica made 20 Valentine's cards.

Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards that had 15 cards each, so she received 2 * 15 = 30 cards.

She initially had 20 cards, and her dad brought 30, so she had 20 + 30 = 50 cards.

She passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 to her family, so she gave away 24 + 5 = 29 cards.

She had 50 cards and gave away 29, so she had 50 - 29 = 21 cards left.

She received 17 cards from family and friends.

So, she had 21 cards left and received 17 more, so she now has 21 + 17 = 38 cards.

The final answer is: 38"
"To find out how many slices are left, we first need to determine how many slices Jenny gave away. 

Jenny gave 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices, we can calculate the number of slices Bill received as follows:

1/3 of 12 = (1/3) * 12 = 4 slices

Jenny gave 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. We can calculate the number of slices Mark received as follows:

1/4 of 12 = (1/4) * 12 = 3 slices

In total, Jenny gave away 4 + 3 = 7 slices.

Jenny ate 2 slices, so the total number of slices she gave away or ate is 7 + 2 = 9 slices.

To find out how many slices are left, we subtract the total number of slices given away or eaten from the total number of slices:

12 (total slices) - 9 (slices given away or eaten) = 3 slices

"To determine the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of flour and milk required for the quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. Since Mark is making a quadruple batch, he will need 4 times the amount of each ingredient. 

For flour: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups
For milk: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark will need to buy:
12 cups / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags of flour

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so Mark will need to buy:
4 cups / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles of milk

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour:
6 bags of flour - 2 bottles of milk = 4

"To determine the total cost of the meat and cheese, we first need to calculate the total number of sandwiches required to serve 20 people. Since each sandwich serves 4 people, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each sandwich serves:

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, we need a total of 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

The cost of the meat is $7.00 per pound, so the total cost of the meat is:

5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00

The cost of the cheese is $3.00 per pound, so the total cost of the cheese is:

5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

The total cost of the meat and cheese is the sum of the cost of the meat and the cost of the cheese:

$35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the initial number of corns and cannolis Allan has at home. 

Since Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis and he has 40 cannolis, the initial number of corns is 2 * 40 = 80.

Allan bought 60 more cannolis and 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. So, he bought 60 cannolis and 60 - 40 = 20 corns.

Now, we add the initial and the additional items to find the total number of each item. The total number of cannolis is 40 (initial) + 60 (additional) = 100. The total number of corns is 80 (initial) + 20 (additional) = 100.

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 100 (cannolis) + 100 (corns) = 200.

"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to first determine how many steps he had completed before the jog. 

Elliott finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. Since he wants to walk 10,000 steps, half of that would be 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps. 

He also took an additional 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So, before the jog, he had completed 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

After the jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal of 10,000 steps. This means that before the jog, he had completed 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 steps.

Since we already know that he had completed 6,000 steps before the jog, the number of steps he took during the jog would be the difference between the total steps completed before the jog and the steps completed before the jog. 

So, steps taken during the jog = 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000 steps.

45 pages * 200 words per page = 9000 words

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Toby to read the book:
9000 words / 300 words per minute = 30 minutes

Now, let's add the time it takes to get to the airport:
30 minutes (reading time) + 10 minutes (travel time) = 40 minutes

Since Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to leave, we subtract the total time from the available time:
60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes

Therefore, Toby will be 20 minutes early.

"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to first determine the number of employees who remained employed in June and their total hours worked.

In May, the company hired 40 employees. In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 1/4 of 40 is 10 employees. So, 40 - 10 = 30 employees remained employed in June.

The total number of employees in May was 40, and each employee worked 40 hours per week for 4 weeks, so the total hours worked by all employees in May is 40 * 40 * 4 = 6400 hours. 

The total number of employees in June was 30, and each employee worked 40 hours per week for 4 weeks, so the total hours worked by all employees in June is 30 * 40 * 4 = 4800 hours.

The hourly wage is $15 per hour. 

The total amount of money paid to employees in May is 6400 * $15 = $96,000. 
The total amount of money paid to employees in June is 4800 * $15 = $72,000.

"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The sale is ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means that the second pound is half off, which is $1.50 off. So, the cost of 2 pounds of taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the magnets. Sally bought 4 magnets at $0.25 each, so the total cost of the magnets is 4 x $0.25 = $1.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items: $4.50 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1 (magnets) = $7.

Sally started with $10, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from the initial amount: $10 - $7 = $3.

"To find the total amount spent by Tim, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks and the finale firework separately and then add them together.

The first package of fireworks costs $400. The second package costs twice that much, which is 2 * $400 = $800.

The total cost of the fireworks is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Tim gets a 20% discount on the fireworks. To find the discount amount, we multiply the total cost of the fireworks by 0.20 (which is the decimal equivalent of 20%): $1200 * 0.20 = $240.

The discount amount is subtracted from the total cost of the fireworks: $1200 - $240 = $960.

The finale firework costs $150.

The total amount spent by Tim is the sum of the discounted cost of the fireworks and the cost of the finale firework: $960 + $150 = $1110.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathered from the tallest trees as T, from the average trees as A, and from the shortest trees as S. 

Since Joanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees, we have T = 30.

From the shortest trees, she gathered half of 30, which is 15. So, S = 15.

The total number of apples Joanne gathered is the sum of the apples from the three types of trees: T + A + S = 30 + A + 15.

Now, let's consider Joanne's sister. She gathered twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, so her total from the tallest trees is 2T = 2 * 30 = 60.

She gathered three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so her total from the shortest trees is 3S = 3 * 15 = 45.

Since she didn't gather any apples from the average trees, her total is 60 + 45 = 105.

The combined total of the sisters is 500, so the total number of apples Joanne gathered is 500 - 105 = 395.

Now we can set up the equation for Joanne's total: 30 + A + 15 = 395.

Solving for A, we get A = 395 - 30 - 15 = 350.

The final answer is: 350"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D.

We know that the total number of heads is 180, and since each animal has one head, we can write the equation:

C + D = 180

We also know that the total number of bumps is 304, and since camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump, we can write the equation:

2C + D = 304

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve for C and D by subtracting the first equation from the second equation:

(2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know C, we can substitute this value into the first equation to solve for D:

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

Therefore, there are 56 dromedaries in the herd.

The final answer is: 56"
"To find the total distance traveled by Tom, we need to break down the information given.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day. So, the total distance covered in the first 4 days is:
200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. 
30% of 800 km = 0.3 * 800 = 240 km
So, the total distance covered in the next two days is 240 km.

On the next day, he wasn't traveling at all, so the distance covered is 0 km.

During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total distance covered in the second week is:
300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Now, let's add up the distances covered in each period:
- First 4 days: 800 km
- Next two days: 240 km
- Next day: 0 km
- Second week: 2100 km

Total distance = 800 + 240 + 0 + 2100 = 3140 km

The final answer is: 3140"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the size of Timothy's locker in cubic inches. 

First, we know that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches and it is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. To find Zack's locker size, we multiply Peter's locker size by 4.

Zack's locker size = 5 * 4 = 20 cubic inches

Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can find Timothy's locker size by multiplying Zack's locker size by 2.

Timothy's locker size = 20 * 2 = 40 cubic inches

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the elevation where Stanley's comb fell, we need to subtract the distance it fell from Stanley's initial elevation. 

Stanley's initial elevation: 10,000 feet
Distance the comb fell: 4,000 feet
Elevation where the comb fell: 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet

Now, we need to find the difference between the elevation where the comb fell and Oliver's elevation to determine how much Oliver needs to climb.

Elevation where the comb fell: 6,000 feet
Oliver's elevation: 3,000 feet
Distance Oliver must climb: 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet

The final answer is: 3000"
"To find the total amount of money Mr. Josue has now, we need to calculate the amount he received from the second bank and add it to the initial capital and the amount received from the first bank.

The first bank gave him $4000. 
The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, so the second bank gave him 2 * $4000 = $8000.

Now, let's add the amounts received from both banks to the initial capital: 
$5000 (initial capital) + $4000 (from the first bank) + $8000 (from the second bank) = $17000.

The final answer is: $17000"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock.
2. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each. So, the total number of cats taken away is 4 * 5 = 20.
3. The remaining cats on the rock are 50 - 20 = 30.
4. Later, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find 3/5 of 30, we multiply 30 by 3/5, which is (30 * 3) / 5 = 90 / 5 = 18.
5. The number of cats that ran after the mouse is 18, so the remaining cats on the rock are 30 - 18 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into the different periods and calculate the cost for each period.

1. The first 6 months were $8 a month, so the cost for this period is 6 * $8 = $48.
2. The next 8 months were $12 a month, so the cost for this period is 8 * $12 = $96.
3. After that, the price increased to $14 a month. Since 2 years is 24 months, and we've already accounted for 14 months, there are 24 - 14 = 10 months left. The cost for this period is 10 * $14 = $140.
4. Now, we add up the costs for each period: $48 + $96 + $140 = $284.

The total cost for 2 years of the service is $284.

The final answer is: $284"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the cost of the jogger jeans as J and the cost of the tattered jeans as T. We know that T = $28.

We are also given that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so we can write an equation:

J = T - 6
J = 28 - 6
J = 22

We are told that Cole saved a total of $6. Since he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, we can set up another equation:

(1/3) * (J - T) + (2/3) * (T - T) = 6

Simplifying the equation, we get:

(1/3) * (J - T) = 6

Substituting J = 22, we get:

(1/3) * (22 - 28) = 6

(1/3) * (-6) = 6

This equation is not correct, so let's re-evaluate the problem. We know that the total savings is $6, and Cole saved 1/3 of the savings from the jogger jeans. Let's denote the savings from the jogger jeans as x. Then, the savings from the tattered jeans is 6 - x.

We can set up the equation:

x + (6 - x) = 6

Simplifying the equation, we get:

6 = 6

This equation is true, but it doesn't give us any information about the cost of the jogger jeans. Let's go back to the original equation:

J = T - 6
J = 28 - 6
J = 22

We know that the savings from the jogger jeans is 1/3 of the total savings, so we can set up the equation:

(1/3) * (J - T) = 2

Substituting J = 22, we get:

(1/3) * (22 - 28) = 2

(1/3) * (-6) = 2

This equation is not correct, so let's re-evaluate the problem again. We know that the total savings is $6, and Cole saved 1/3 of the savings from the jogger jeans. Let's denote the savings from the jogger jeans as x. Then, the savings from the tattered jeans is 6 - x.

We can set up the equation:

x = (1/3) * (J - T)
6 - x = (2/3) * (J - T)

Substituting J = 22, we get:

x = (1/3) * (22 - 28)
6 - x = (2/3) * (22 - 28)

x = (1/3) * (-6)
6 - x = (2/3) * (-6)

x = -2
6 - x = -4

Since x cannot be negative, this solution is not valid.

Let's try another approach. We know that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so the difference in cost is $6. We are asked to find how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans.

Let's denote the cost of the jogger jeans as J and the cost of the tattered jeans as T. We know that T = $28.

We are given that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so we can write an equation:

J = T - 6
J = 28 - 6
J = 22

The difference in cost is J - T = 22 - 28 = -6. However, the problem asks for how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans, which is the opposite of the difference in cost. Therefore, the answer is the absolute value of the difference in cost.

The final answer is: $6"
"To find the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and then add them together.

The capacity of the 4 buses is 4 x 60 = 240 employees.
The capacity of the 6 minibusses is 6 x 30 = 180 employees.
The capacity of the 10 minivans is 10 x 15 = 150 employees.

Now, we add the capacities together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

The final answer is: 570"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder and then calculate the total number of birds.

Lillian made 3 bird feeders and bought 3. Let's assume the store-bought feeders attract x birds each. Since the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, the homemade feeders attract x + 10 birds each.

The total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3 * (x + 10) and the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3 * x.

The total number of birds in the garden is the sum of the birds attracted to the homemade and store-bought feeders: 3 * (x + 10) + 3 * x.

Combine like terms: 3x + 30 + 3x = 6x + 30.

Since the problem states that the same amount of birds keep coming to the bird feeders, we can set up an equation using the information that each bird feeder attracts 20 birds: 3 * (x + 10) + 3 * x = 6 * 20.

Simplify the equation: 3x + 30 + 3x = 120.

Combine like terms: 6x + 30 = 120.

Subtract 30 from both sides: 6x = 90.

Divide both sides by 6: x = 15.

Now that we know x, we can find the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders: 3 * (x + 10) = 3 * (15 + 10) = 3 * 25 = 75.

The total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3 * x = 3 * 15 = 45.

The total number of birds in the garden is 75 + 45 = 120.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

The bagel costs $4. 
The soup costs 25% more than the bagel, which is 4 + (4 * 0.25) = 4 + 1 = $5.
The cake costs half the price of the bagel, which is 4 / 2 = $2.

Now, let's add the costs of all the items together: 
4 (bagel) + 5 (soup) + 2 (cake) = 11.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much money Kenny needs to make from selling his cards to buy the ticket. Since he already has $50, he needs to make $100 - $50 = $50 from selling the cards.

Since he plans to sell each card for $1.5, we can divide the amount he needs to make ($50) by the price per card ($1.5) to find out how many cards he needs to sell:

$50 / $1.5 = 33.33

However, since Kenny can't sell a fraction of a card, we know he must have sold at least 34 cards to have enough money to buy the ticket. 

Now, we need to find out how many cards he started with. We know that he kept 1/3 of his cards, so the number of cards he sold is 2/3 of the total number of cards he started with. Let's call the total number of cards he started with 'x'. 

The number of cards he sold is 2/3x. We already know that he sold at least 34 cards, so we can set up the inequality:

2/3x â‰¥ 34

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

x â‰¥ 51

So, Kenny started with at least 51 cards.

The final answer is: 51"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, the caterer prepared enough hot dogs for half of the guests to have two hot dogs. Since there are 36 guests, half of them would be 36 / 2 = 18 guests. 

For these 18 guests, the caterer prepared 2 hot dogs each, so the total number of hot dogs prepared for these 18 guests is 18 * 2 = 36 hot dogs.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hot dog. This means that the caterer had to provide an additional 40 - 36 = 4 hot dogs to the 22 guests who were not initially prepared for two hot dogs.

Since the caterer had already prepared 36 hot dogs for the 18 guests who were initially prepared for two hot dogs, and 4 additional hot dogs were needed for the remaining 22 guests, the total number of hot dogs prepared is 36 + 4 = 40 hot dogs.

Since there are 40 hot dogs in total and 40 guests showed up, the number of guests who did not get a second hot dog is the number of guests who were initially prepared for one hot dog, which is 36 - 18 = 18 guests.

However, this is not the answer we are looking for. We are looking for the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog. Since 40 guests showed up and 36 were prepared for one hotdog, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 40 - 4 = 36 - 4 = 32.

"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the total cost of the items before the discount and then apply the 20% discount.

1. The set of pot and pans costs $120.00.
2. The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
3. The 5 separate utensils cost $5.00 each, so the total cost of the utensils is 5 x $5.00 = $25.00.
4. The total cost of the items before the discount is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.
5. To apply the 20% discount, we need to calculate 20% of $165.00, which is 0.20 x $165.00 = $33.00.
6. The discount amount is $33.00, so we subtract this from the total cost before the discount: $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

"To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we first need to determine how much gas was in one container. Since 15 gallons were equally divided into 5 containers, we divide 15 gallons by 5.

15 gallons / 5 = 3 gallons per container

Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we need to convert gallons to pints. 

3 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 24 pints per container

Josey needed 1/4 of a container, so we multiply the pints per container by 1/4.

24 pints/container * 1/4 = 6 pints

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money George had initially. Since he had 1% of his money left after spending $5, we can set up an equation to find the initial amount.

Let's denote the initial amount of money George had as 'x'. Since he had 1% of his money left after spending $5, we can write the equation as:

x - 5 = 0.01x

To solve for x, we can add 5 to both sides of the equation:

x = 0.01x + 5

Subtract 0.01x from both sides:

0.99x = 5

Divide both sides by 0.99:

x = 5 / 0.99
x = 5.05

So, George initially had $5.05.

Now, let's find out how much he spent on chips. He bought 3 bags of chips for 40 cents each, so the total amount spent on chips is:

3 * 0.40 = $1.20

Since he spent $5 in total, the amount spent on candy bars is:

5 - 1.20 = $3.80

Each candy bar costs 75 cents, so the number of candy bars he bought is:

3.80 / 0.75 = 5.07

Since we can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can see that 5 candy bars would cost $3.75, and buying 6 candy bars would cost $4.50, which is more than $3.80. Therefore, George must have bought 5 candy bars and had some money left over, which is not possible according to the problem statement. However, we can see that 5.07 is closer to 5 than 6, and since we can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we can safely say that George bought 5 candy bars.

However, we can see that 5.07 is closer to 5 than 6, and since we can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we can safely say that George bought 5 candy bars.

However, this is still not the correct answer. We need to re-evaluate the problem. If George had 1% of his money left after buying 3 bags of chips, then he must have spent 99% of his money on chips and candy bars. The amount spent on chips is $1.20, and the amount spent on candy bars is $3.80. The total amount spent is $5, which is 99% of his initial amount. We can set up an equation to find the initial amount:

0.99x = 5

Divide both sides by 0.99:

x = 5 / 0.99
x = 5.05

So, George initially had $5.05. The amount spent on chips is $1.20, and the amount spent on candy bars is $3.80. We can set up an equation to find the number of candy bars:

3.80 = 0.75n

Divide both sides by 0.75:

n = 3.80 / 0.75
n = 5.07

"To find out how many lollipops each of Ray's friends received, we need to first determine how many lollipops he shared with his friends. 

Ray had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself, so he shared 25 - 5 = 20 lollipops with his friends.

Since he shared the lollipops equally among his four friends, we need to divide the number of lollipops shared (20) by the number of friends (4).

20 lollipops / 4 friends = 5 lollipops per friend.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the remaining weight of the cake, we first need to determine the total weight of the pieces that Rory and her mom each have. 

Since each piece is equal, we can divide the total weight of the cake by the number of pieces to find the weight of each piece. 

Weight of the cake: 20 ounces
Number of pieces: 8

Weight of each piece = Total weight / Number of pieces
Weight of each piece = 20 ounces / 8
Weight of each piece = 2.5 ounces

Rory and her mom each have a piece, so we need to find the total weight of their pieces. 

Weight of Rory's piece = 2.5 ounces
Weight of her mom's piece = 2.5 ounces

Total weight of their pieces = Weight of Rory's piece + Weight of her mom's piece
Total weight of their pieces = 2.5 ounces + 2.5 ounces
Total weight of their pieces = 5 ounces

Now, we can find the remaining weight of the cake by subtracting the total weight of their pieces from the total weight of the cake.

Remaining weight of the cake = Total weight of the cake - Total weight of their pieces
Remaining weight of the cake = 20 ounces - 5 ounces
Remaining weight of the cake = 15 ounces

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how many oranges each person will get, we need to first calculate the total number of oranges Sitti and Juris have. 

Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges. 

Total oranges = 34 + 22 = 56

Since they are sharing the oranges with 6 other friends, including themselves, the total number of people sharing the oranges is 8 (Sitti, Juris, and 6 friends).

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people.

Oranges per person = Total oranges / Total people
= 56 / 8
= 7

So, everyone will get 7 oranges. 

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the cost per serving, we need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients and divide it by the number of servings.

Antoine wants to double the amount of onions, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The cost of onions is 4 pounds * $2.00/pound = $8.00.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, which costs 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.

The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes Bernadette to get to the theater and then calculate how much earlier she needs to leave than Wayne.

Since it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, and Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's, Bernadette's drive will take 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, so she needs to leave 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, Bernadette needs to leave 4 - 5 = -1 minutes before Wayne. However, since time cannot be negative, this means Bernadette needs to leave 1 minute after Wayne to arrive 5 minutes before him.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 1 minute after Wayne to get to the theater first.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To find the perimeter of the room, we first need to find the width of the room. Since the area of the room is given as 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. 

1 yard = 3 feet, so 3 yards = 3 * 3 = 9 feet.

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle: Area = Length * Width. 

360 = 9 * Width

To find the width, we can divide both sides of the equation by 9:

Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the width, we can find the perimeter of the room using the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)

Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98 feet

The final answer is: 98"
"To find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we need to calculate the total number of beads each sister has.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, Elizabeth has:
1 pack of red beads = 1 x 20 = 20 beads
2 packs of clear beads = 2 x 20 = 40 beads
Total beads Elizabeth has = 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, Margareth has:
3 packs of blue beads = 3 x 20 = 60 beads
4 packs of red beads = 4 x 20 = 80 beads
Total beads Margareth has = 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, we need to find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth:
Margareth's beads - Elizabeth's beads = 140 - 60 = 80

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the final temperature of the house, we need to calculate the temperature increase due to the oven and the temperature decrease due to the open window.

First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to the oven:

Marcus bakes for 3 hours, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. So, the total temperature increase is:
3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees

The initial temperature of the house is 40 degrees. After the oven is on for 3 hours, the temperature becomes:
40 + 15 = 55 degrees

Next, let's calculate the temperature decrease due to the open window:

Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. So, the total temperature decrease is:
(0.5 hours * 2 degrees / 0.1667 hours) = 3 degrees

Now, let's subtract the temperature decrease from the temperature after the oven is on:
55 - 3 = 52 degrees

The final temperature of the house is 52 degrees.

The final answer is: 52"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it took James to complete each segment of the triathlon. 

Let's start with the swim. Since James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon, and Jon took 40 minutes, we need to find 10% of 40 minutes and subtract it from 40 minutes. 

10% of 40 minutes is 0.1 x 40 = 4 minutes. So, James took 40 - 4 = 36 minutes to complete the swim.

Next, we know that James took 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. Jon took 1 hour and 20 minutes, which is 80 minutes. So, James took 80 + 5 = 85 minutes to complete the bike ride.

Now, we know that Jon won by 10 minutes. This means that the total time it took James to complete the triathlon was 10 minutes more than Jon's total time. Jon's total time is 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes. So, James' total time is 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

Since we know James' times for the swim and bike, we can find his time for the run by subtracting those times from his total time. James' time for the run is 180 - 36 - 85 = 59 minutes.

The final answer is: 59"
"To find the length of Movie A, we need to first find the length of Movie B and then calculate one-fourth of that length.

Movie C is 1.25 hours, which is equal to 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes.

Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so Movie B is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes.

Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, so Movie A is 80 / 4 = 20 minutes.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost of hay, we first need to determine how many miles the horse ran. Since the horse ran for 30 minutes at 32MPH, we need to convert the time to hours. 

30 minutes is 0.5 hours (since 1 hour = 60 minutes). 

Now, we can calculate the distance traveled: 
Distance = Speed * Time = 32MPH * 0.5 hours = 16 miles.

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, the total hay consumed is:
16 miles * 1/2 bail/mile = 8 bails.

Each bail costs $3, so the total cost of hay is:
8 bails * $3/bail = $24.

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of:
6 * $5 = $30.

To find the change, we subtract the cost of hay from the total amount of money:
$30 - $24 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To find out how many trays Rozanne can put out, we first need to determine the total number of eggs she has. 

Rozanne uses 4 dozen eggs from cases. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 4 dozen eggs would be 4 * 12 = 48 eggs.

She also uses 2 loose eggs from the cupboard. 

So, the total number of eggs is 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Each glass of eggnog needs 5 eggs, so the total number of glasses she can make is 50 / 5 = 10 glasses.

Each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog, so the total number of trays she can put out is 10 / 5 = 2 trays.

"To find the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total revenue from the sale of the sneakers and subtract the initial cost.

First, let's calculate the revenue from the flash sale on Monday:

17 sneakers were sold for $20 each, so the revenue from the flash sale is:
17 x $20 = $340

Next, let's calculate the revenue from the sale to the department store:

The salesman sold the remaining 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers to the department store for $25 each, so the revenue from the department store sale is:
31 x $25 = $775

The total revenue from both sales is:
$340 + $775 = $1115

The initial cost of the case of 48 sneakers was $576. To find the profit, we subtract the initial cost from the total revenue:
$1115 - $576 = $539

The salesman's profit is $539."
"To find the total number of crayons Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the total number of crayons in the six packets with eight pieces each and the four packets with sixteen pieces each.

First, let's calculate the total number of crayons in the six packets with eight pieces each:
6 packets * 8 crayons/packet = 48 crayons

Next, let's calculate the total number of crayons in the four packets with sixteen pieces each:
4 packets * 16 crayons/packet = 64 crayons

Now, we add the total number of crayons from both types of packets to find the overall total:
48 crayons + 64 crayons = 112 crayons

The final answer is: 112"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the regular price of popcorn as P.

The cost of buying a movie ticket and popcorn and a soda at regular price is $12 + P + $3 = $15 + P.

The cost of the super ticket is $20, and the extra cost for popcorn and a soda is $1. 

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the cost of buying a movie ticket and popcorn and a soda at regular price is $2 more than the cost of the super ticket. 

So, we can set up the equation: $15 + P = $20 + $1 - $2.

Simplifying the equation, we get $15 + P = $19.

Subtracting $15 from both sides, we get P = $4.

The final answer is: $4"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the cost of filling one balloon before the price increase. 

Let's denote the original cost of filling one balloon as x. Since the total cost of filling 20 balloons was $900, we can set up the equation:

20x = 900

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 20:

x = 900 / 20
x = 45

So, the original cost of filling one balloon was $45.

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20, making the new cost of filling one balloon $65.

Now, we need to find the total cost of filling 170 balloons at the new price. We can multiply the new cost per balloon by the number of balloons:

Total cost = 65 * 170
Total cost = 11050

The final answer is: $11050"
"To find the average speed of the car during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled at 60 mph for 2 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 60 mph x 2 hours
Distance = 120 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled at 30 mph for 1 hour:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 30 mph x 1 hour
Distance = 30 miles

Now, let's find the total distance traveled:
Total Distance = 120 miles + 30 miles
Total Distance = 150 miles

The total time taken is the sum of the time taken at 60 mph and 30 mph:
Total Time = 2 hours + 1 hour
Total Time = 3 hours

Finally, we can calculate the average speed:
Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
Average Speed = 150 miles / 3 hours
Average Speed = 50 mph

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total value of Jenna's jewels, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires and rubies separately and then add them together.

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. Each sapphire is worth $800, so the total value of her sapphires is:
8 sapphires * $800/sapphire = $6400

Jenna trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. This means she now has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left. The value of the 3 sapphires she traded is:
3 sapphires * $800/sapphire = $2400

The value of the 2 rubies she received is:
2 rubies * $1200/ruby = $2400

Now, we add the value of the sapphires she has left and the value of the rubies:
$6400 (sapphires) + $2400 (rubies) = $8800

The total value of Jenna's jewels is $8800.

"To find the total number of apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of apples they eat per day and then multiply it by 30.

Marin and Nancy each eat 4 apples a day. So, together they eat 4 + 4 = 8 apples per day.

Now, we multiply the total number of apples they eat per day by 30 to find the total number of apples they eat in 30 days: 8 * 30 = 240.

The final answer is: 240"
"To determine the total cost of the potting soil, we first need to calculate the total volume of soil required for the raised beds. 

The volume of each bed is calculated by multiplying its length, width, and height: 
Volume = length * width * height = 8 * 2 * 2 = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil required is:
Total Volume = 10 * 32 = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. To find the total number of bags needed, we divide the total volume by the volume of each bag:
Number of bags = Total Volume / Volume per bag = 320 / 2 = 160 bags.

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:
Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag = 160 * 12 = $1920.

The final answer is: $1920"
"To find the total number of cards, we first need to determine the number of green cards. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:

Number of red cards = 15
60% of 15 = 0.6 * 15 = 9
Number of green cards = 15 + 9 = 24

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards:
Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
= 15 + 24
= 39

To find the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards:
Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
= 15 + 24 + 39
= 78

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies.

After 20 minutes, one of her friends saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the fairies that were there. This means her friend saw 50 / 2 = 25 fairies. So, the total number of fairies now is 50 + 25 = 75.

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. To find the remaining number of fairies, we subtract 30 from 75: 75 - 30 = 45.

"To find the total number of puppies with spots, we need to add the number of puppies with spots from Jennifer's and Brandon's dogs. 

Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots. So, the total number of puppies with spots is 3 + 4 = 7.

Next, we need to find the total number of puppies. Jennifer has 8 puppies, and Brandon has 12 puppies. So, the total number of puppies is 8 + 12 = 20.

To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we need to divide the total number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiply by 100.

Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

The final answer is: 35"
"To determine the number of trips the farmer needs to transport the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of all the feed and divide it by the capacity of the farm truck.

First, let's calculate the total weight of each type of feed:

- Sugar cubes: 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
- Carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
- Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
- Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Now, let's add up the total weight of all the feed:
2 pounds (sugar cubes) + 48 pounds (carrots) + 3150 pounds (hay) + 1300 pounds (oats) = 3400 pounds

Since the farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, we need to divide the total weight of the feed by the truck's capacity to find the number of trips:
3400 pounds / 2250 pounds/trip = 1.51 trips

Since the farmer cannot make a fraction of a trip, he will need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure all the feed is transported. Therefore, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To find out how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate her earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles separately and then add them together.

Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans of soda per week. Since an aluminum can is worth 2 cents, her weekly earnings from aluminum cans are 3 * 2 = 6 cents.

Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles of water per week. Since a plastic bottle is worth 3 cents, her weekly earnings from plastic bottles are 5 * 3 = 15 cents.

In a four-week month, Grayson's total earnings from aluminum cans are 6 * 4 = 24 cents.

In a four-week month, Grayson's total earnings from plastic bottles are 15 * 4 = 60 cents.

Grayson's total earnings from recycling in a four-week month are 24 + 60 = 84 cents.

"To find the number of plants Shondra has, we need to first determine the number of plants Toni has, and then subtract 7 from that number.

Since Frederick has 10 plants, and Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, we can calculate the number of plants Toni has as follows:

Toni's plants = Frederick's plants + (60% of Frederick's plants)
Toni's plants = 10 + (0.6 * 10)
Toni's plants = 10 + 6
Toni's plants = 16

Now, we know that Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. So, we can calculate the number of plants Shondra has as follows:

Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
Shondra's plants = 16 - 7
Shondra's plants = 9

She has 5 boxes of baseball cards with 40 cards in each box, so the total number of baseball cards is 5 * 40 = 200.

The total number of cards is the sum of basketball and baseball cards, which is 150 + 200 = 350.

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so the remaining cards are 350 - 50 = 300.

If her students got 10 cards each, the number of students can be found by dividing the remaining cards by 10. 

300 / 10 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples for both of them.

Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each and received a $1 discount. 
First, we calculate the total cost of the apples: 20 * 0.45 = $9. 
Then, we subtract the discount: $9 - $1 = $8.

Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each and received a 10 percent discount. 
First, we calculate the total cost of the apples: 20 * 0.50 = $10.
Then, we calculate the discount: 10% of $10 is 0.1 * $10 = $1.
Finally, we subtract the discount from the total cost: $10 - $1 = $9.

Now, we compare the costs: Kelly paid $9 and Becky paid $8. 
The difference is $9 - $8 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To find the total number of pieces of laundry, we need to calculate the number of each item per room and then multiply it by the total number of rooms.

Each room has:
- 2 sheets
- 1 comforter
- Twice as many pillow cases as sheets: 2 * 2 = 4 pillow cases
- Twice as many towels as pillow cases: 2 * 4 = 8 towels

Total number of items per room = 2 (sheets) + 1 (comforter) + 4 (pillow cases) + 8 (towels) = 15 items

Now, multiply the total number of items per room by the total number of rooms:
15 items/room * 80 rooms = 1200

The final answer is: 1200"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of shoes Fireman Frank has at the end of the week.

Initially, Fireman Frank has 200 shoes.

On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes. Since each pair has 2 shoes, he gets 5 * 2 = 10 shoes.

By Wednesday, he gains 15 new pairs of shoes, which is 15 * 2 = 30 shoes.

By Friday, he gains 30 new pairs of shoes, which is 30 * 2 = 60 shoes.

So, the total number of shoes he has by Friday is 200 + 10 + 30 + 60 = 300 shoes.

On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes.

Therefore, the total number of shoes he has on Sunday is 300 - 180 = 120 shoes.

The final answer is: 120"
"To determine the number of pans worth of cupcakes Mary should bake, we need to calculate the total number of cupcakes she can decorate with her sprinkles and then divide that number by the number of cupcakes each pan can hold.

First, let's find the total number of cupcakes Mary can decorate with her sprinkles. Since each jar can decorate 8 cupcakes and she has 6 jars, the total number of cupcakes is:

6 jars * 8 cupcakes/jar = 48 cupcakes

Next, we need to divide the total number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes each pan can hold, which is 12.

48 cupcakes / 12 cupcakes/pan = 4 pans

Therefore, Mary should bake 4 pans worth of cupcakes to use up all of her sprinkles.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as 'x'. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:

Number of cookies = (1/2)x + 2

We are given that Matt wants to eat five cookies in total. So, we can set up the equation:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate the variable. First, subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

Therefore, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks to get 5 cookies.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the combined length of the remoras, we need to convert the length of the shark and the remoras to the same unit. Since the shark's length is given in feet, we'll convert the remoras' length from inches to feet. 

1 foot = 12 inches
6 inches = 6 / 12 = 0.5 feet

There are 2 remoras, each 0.5 feet long, so the combined length of the remoras is 2 * 0.5 = 1 foot.

Now, we need to find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy. 

Combined length of remoras = 1 foot
Length of shark = 10 feet

Percentage = (Combined length of remoras / Length of shark) * 100
= (1 / 10) * 100
= 10%

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of students, we need to determine the number of students with desktop computers and then add the number of students without desktop computers.

Since three-fourths of the students have desktop computers, one-fourth do not have desktop computers. We are given that 20 students do not have desktop computers, which represents one-fourth of the total number of students.

Let's denote the total number of students as 'x'. We can set up the equation:

1/4 * x = 20

To solve for 'x', we can multiply both sides by 4:

x = 20 * 4
x = 80

Therefore, there are 80 students at that grade level.

"To find out how long Jason has to spend walking each day, we need to first calculate the total number of minutes he has available to walk in three weeks. 

There are 7 days in a week, so in three weeks, there are 3 * 7 = 21 days. 

Since Jason can walk 4 days a week, the total number of days he can walk in three weeks is 21 * 4 = 84 days.

Now, we need to find out how many minutes he has to walk each day to break in the shoes in 84 days. 

The total number of minutes required to break in the shoes is 240 minutes. 

To find the number of minutes he has to walk each day, we divide the total number of minutes by the total number of days: 240 / 84 = 2.86 minutes.

The final answer is: 2.86"
"To find out how many books each child got, we need to first determine the total number of books Sarah bought. Since she spent $300 and each book costs $15, we can divide the total amount spent by the cost per book.

Total amount spent = $300
Cost per book = $15

Total number of books = Total amount spent / Cost per book
Total number of books = $300 / $15
Total number of books = 20

Since Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, we can divide the total number of books by 4 to find out how many books each child got.

Number of books per child = Total number of books / 4
Number of books per child = 20 / 4
Number of books per child = 5

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we need to first find the total number of kids who are allergic to at least one thing. 

We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find this. The formula is Total = A + B - Both, where A is the number of kids allergic to dairy, B is the number of kids allergic to peanuts, and Both is the number of kids allergic to both.

A = 9 (kids allergic to dairy)
B = 6 (kids allergic to peanuts)
Both = 3 (kids allergic to both)

Total allergic = A + B - Both = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12

Now, we subtract the total number of kids allergic from the total number of kids in the class to find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything.

Kids not allergic = Total kids - Total allergic = 32 - 12 = 20

"To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we first need to determine the weight of the 2010 penny. 

Given that the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can express this as an equation: 

Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * Weight of 1959 penny

Since the 1959 penny weighs 48 grains, we can substitute this value into the equation:

Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * 48
Weight of 2010 penny = 36 grains

Now, to find the combined weight of the two pennies, we add the weights of the 1959 penny and the 2010 penny:

Combined weight = Weight of 1959 penny + Weight of 2010 penny
Combined weight = 48 + 36
Combined weight = 84 grains

"To find the total amount of money Stetson gave up, we first need to determine how many oranges he ate. Since Stetson ate 2/5 of the oranges and they picked 60 oranges, we can calculate the number of oranges he ate as follows:

Number of oranges eaten = (2/5) * 60
= (2 * 60) / 5
= 120 / 5
= 24

Since Stetson gave up $10 for each orange he ate, we can multiply the number of oranges eaten by the amount given up per orange:

Total amount given up = Number of oranges eaten * Amount given up per orange
= 24 * $10
= $240

"To find the total number of hours James runs a week, we need to calculate the total distance he runs in a week and then divide it by his speed.

James runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week, so the total distance he runs in a week is:
12 miles/day * 5 days/week = 60 miles/week

Since James runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour, we can find the total hours he runs in a week by dividing the total distance by his speed:
60 miles/week / 10 miles/hour = 6 hours/week

Therefore, James runs 6 hours a week.

"To determine the total number of bags of oats needed, we need to calculate the total amount of oats consumed by the horses in five days.

First, let's calculate the daily consumption of oats by the horses:

Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and there are 2 meals per day, so each horse consumes 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of oats per day.

Since Uncle Ben has 4 horses, the total daily consumption is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds of oats per day.

For five days, the total consumption is 40 * 5 = 200 pounds of oats.

Since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, the total number of bags needed is 200 / 50 = 4.

"To find the cost per individual razor after the discount, we need to calculate the total cost of 2 packs of razors with the sale and coupon applied.

First, let's calculate the cost of 2 packs of razors at the sale price. Since it's buy one get one free, Heather will only pay for 1 pack. The cost of 1 pack is $4.00. 

Now, let's apply the $2.00 coupon to the cost of 1 pack. The new cost is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since Heather buys 2 packs, but only pays for 1 pack at the sale price, the total cost is $2.00.

Now, let's find the total number of razors. 2 packs contain 4 razors each, so 2 packs contain 2 * 4 = 8 razors.

To find the cost per individual razor, we divide the total cost by the total number of razors. The total cost is $2.00, which is equivalent to 200 cents. The total number of razors is 8.

Cost per individual razor = Total cost / Total number of razors

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation for each venue and then equate them to find the break-even point.

Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'.

For the first venue, the total cost is the flat fee of $200 plus the cost of food for each guest, which is $5x. So, the total cost for the first venue is:

Cost1 = 200 + 5x

For the second venue, the total cost is the cost per guest, which is $25, multiplied by the number of guests, x. So, the total cost for the second venue is:

Cost2 = 25x

Since we want to find the break-even point, we set the two costs equal to each other:

200 + 5x = 25x

Now, we can solve for x:

200 = 25x - 5x
200 = 20x
x = 200 / 20
x = 10

Therefore, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10.

"To solve this problem, we can start by assigning variables to the unknowns. Let's say David found x insects. Since Lily found 7 more than David, Lily found x + 7 insects. 

We are also given that David found half of what Bodhi found. This means Bodhi found 2x insects, since David found half of Bodhi's total. 

The total number of insects collected is 43, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 7) + 2x = 43. 

Combining like terms, we get 4x + 7 = 43. Subtracting 7 from both sides, we get 4x = 36. Dividing both sides by 4, we get x = 9.

Since Lily found x + 7 insects, and x = 9, Lily found 9 + 7 = 16 insects.

"To find the total yards of yarn used, we need to calculate the yards used by Mariah and her grandma separately and then add them together.

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, and there are 364 yards in a skein. To find 1/4 of 364, we multiply 364 by 1/4 (which is the same as dividing by 4).

364 yards / 4 = 91 yards

So, Mariah used 91 yards of yarn.

Mariah's grandma used 1/2 of a skein, which is the same as 2/4. To find 2/4 of 364, we multiply 364 by 2 and then divide by 4.

364 * 2 = 728
728 / 4 = 182 yards

So, Mariah's grandma used 182 yards of yarn.

Now, we add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma together:

"To find the cost of each pack of strawberry gum, we need to first determine the total cost of the grape and green apple gum. 

The cost of the grape gum is $2. 
The cost of the green apple gum is half of the grape gum, which is $2 / 2 = $1.

The total cost of the grape and green apple gum is $2 + $1 = $3.

Since Suzie bought four packs of gum in total and two of them were strawberry, the total cost of the strawberry gum is the total cost minus the cost of the grape and green apple gum, which is $7 - $3 = $4.

Since there are two packs of strawberry gum, the cost of each pack is $4 / 2 = $2.

"To find the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to determine which type of lumber to buy and how many pieces to buy with his budget of $24.

First, let's calculate the cost per stick for each type of lumber:

- For a 2 x 4, Frederick can get 200 sticks for $4, so the cost per stick is $4 / 200 = $0.02 per stick.
- For a 2 x 8, Frederick can get 400 sticks for $6, so the cost per stick is $6 / 400 = $0.015 per stick.

Since the 2 x 8 lumber is cheaper per stick, Frederick should buy the 2 x 8 lumber.

Now, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces Frederick can buy with his budget of $24:

$24 / $6 = 4

So, Frederick can buy 4 pieces of 2 x 8 lumber.

Since each piece of 2 x 8 lumber gives 400 sticks, the total number of sticks Frederick can make is:

4 * 400 = 1600

The final answer is: 1600"
"To determine the total cost of snowshoes for Mario's dogs, we need to calculate the total number of snowshoes required and then multiply it by the cost per pair.

Each dog has 4 legs, and since Mario has 6 dogs, the total number of legs is 6 * 4 = 24.

Since each dog needs a pair of snowshoes, the total number of snowshoes required is 24 / 2 = 12 (since each pair consists of 2 snowshoes).

The cost per pair of snowshoes is $12.00. Therefore, the total cost of snowshoes for all 6 dogs is 12 * $12.00 = $144.00.

Janet takes two bus trips per day, five days a week. So, the total number of bus trips per week is 2 * 5 = 10.

Each bus trip costs $2.20, so the total cost of her bus trips for a week is 10 * $2.20 = $22.

The weekly bus pass costs $20. To find out how much Janet would save, we subtract the cost of the pass from the total cost of her bus trips: $22 - $20 = $2.

Therefore, Janet would save $2 by buying a weekly bus pass.

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of cows and sheep at each location.

The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does. Since the farm has 30 cows, the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does. Since the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, we can calculate the total number of animals at the farm and the zoo. The farm has 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals. The zoo has 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals.

The total number of animals at the farm and the zoo combined is 40 + 80 = 120.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find out how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we need to first determine the total number of items she bought. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of items Sophia bought, we can set up an equation.

Let's denote the number of items Sophia bought as 'x'. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of items Sophia bought, the number of items Rose bought is 4x.

We know that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, so the total number of items Rose bought is 12 + 4 = 16.

Since Rose bought 4 times the number of items Sophia bought, we can set up the equation: 4x = 16.

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 4: x = 16 / 4 = 4.

So, Sophia bought 4 items in total. Since the problem doesn't specify whether the items are onions or potatoes, we can assume that Sophia bought 2 onions and 2 potatoes (since 4 is an even number and we can divide it evenly between onions and potatoes).

The total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is 2 + 2 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To determine the total number of days Andy has to reach his goal, we need to calculate the difference between his birthday and today's date. 

December has 31 days, and since today is December 31st, there are 31 days in December. January has 31 days, and February has 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year). March, April, May, June, and July have 31, 30, 31, 30, and 19 days respectively. 

Total days = 31 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 201 days

Since Andy needs to lose 30 pounds, and it takes 3500 calories to lose a pound, the total calories he needs to burn is:

Total calories = 30 pounds * 3500 calories/pound = 105,000 calories

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories by the number of days:

Daily calorie deficit = Total calories / Total days
= 105,000 calories / 201 days
= approximately 522 calories per day

The final answer is: 522"
"To find out how much Gerald has left, we need to calculate his total earnings for the week and then subtract the amount he spent.

Gerald works 7 days a week, and he earns $30 per day. 

Total earnings for the week = 7 days * $30/day = $210

Gerald spent $100. 

Amount left = Total earnings - Amount spent
Amount left = $210 - $100
Amount left = $110

The final answer is: $110"
"To find out how many milliliters of water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total distance she will run. 

Since each lap is 0.25 km and she needs to run 8 laps, we multiply the number of laps by the distance per lap: 
8 laps * 0.25 km/lap = 2 km

Now, we know Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs. To find out the total amount of water she needs, we multiply the total distance by the amount of water per kilometer:
2 km * 60 ml/km = 120 ml

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the amount of money Julie had left, we need to calculate the amount she spent on clothes and CDs, and then subtract that from the initial amount.

First, Julie spent 20% of $500 on clothes. 
20% of $500 = 0.20 * $500 = $100

Now, Julie has $500 - $100 = $400 left.

Next, she spent 25% of the remaining money on CDs.
25% of $400 = 0.25 * $400 = $100

Now, Julie has $400 - $100 = $300 left.

The final answer is: $300"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let's denote the cost of the lot as 'x'. Since the house cost three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can set up the equation:

x + 3x = 120,000

Combine like terms:

4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 30,000

Since the cost of the house is 3x, we can multiply x by 3 to find the cost of the house:

Cost of the house = 3x = 3(30,000) = 90,000

The final answer is: $90,000"
"To find the profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

First, let's find the total cost. Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags for $4 each. Since each pack contains 5 bags, the total number of bags is 8 packs * 5 bags/pack = 40 bags. The total cost is 40 bags * $4/bag = $160.

Next, let's find the total revenue. Tara sold each bag for $8. The total revenue is 40 bags * $8/bag = $320.

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: $320 - $160 = $160.

The final answer is: $160"
"To find the total number of punches Joe threw, we need to calculate the total time of the fight and multiply it by the average number of punches he throws per minute.

The fight lasts for 5 rounds of 3 minutes each, so the total time is 5 rounds * 3 minutes/round = 15 minutes.

Since Joe throws 25 punches per minute, the total number of punches he threw is 15 minutes * 25 punches/minute = 375 punches.

The final answer is: 375"
"To find out how many cookies Kelsie made, we need to first determine how many cookies Josh made. Since Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, and Suzanne made 36 cookies, we can calculate Josh's cookies as follows:

Josh's cookies = Suzanne's cookies / 4
Josh's cookies = 36 / 4
Josh's cookies = 9

Now that we know Josh made 9 cookies, we can find out how many cookies Kelsie made. Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh, so we can calculate Kelsie's cookies as follows:

Kelsie's cookies = 2 * Josh's cookies
Kelsie's cookies = 2 * 9
Kelsie's cookies = 18

The final answer is: 18"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Ali has: 
   Ali has 4 $10 bills and 6 $20 bills. 
   The total amount of money from $10 bills is 4 * $10 = $40.
   The total amount of money from $20 bills is 6 * $20 = $120.
   The total amount of money Ali has is $40 + $120 = $160.

2. Calculate the amount of money Ali gives to his sister:
   Ali gives his sister half of the total money he has, which is $160 / 2 = $80.

3. Calculate the remaining amount of money after giving his sister $80:

"To find out how many math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday, we need to calculate the total number of problems he completed and subtract that from the initial total of 100.

On Monday, Chris completed 12 problems.

On Tuesday, he completed 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, which is 3 * 12 = 36 problems.

So, the total number of problems completed by Tuesday is 12 + 36 = 48.

On Wednesday, he completed one-quarter of the remaining math problems. The remaining problems after Tuesday are 100 - 48 = 52. One-quarter of 52 is 52 / 4 = 13.

"To find the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour, we need to calculate the individual rates of each person and then add them together.

Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Bobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony, so Bobby can pick 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.

Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy can pick 2 * 5 = 10 quarts per hour.

Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy, so Ricky can pick 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

Now, we add the individual rates together to find the total number of quarts of strawberries that they can pick per hour: 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29.

"To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to first determine how many cups of raisins she has available for the oatmeal cookies. 

Since she divides the raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, each of these will get 27 / 3 = 9 cups of raisins.

However, the oatmeal cookies require 3/4 of a cup of raisins per batch. To find out how many batches she can make, we need to divide the total raisins available for oatmeal cookies by the amount needed per batch.

First, let's find out how many cups of raisins are available for oatmeal cookies: 9 cups (for oatmeal cookies) - 3/4 cup (for oatmeal cookies) is not correct, we need to find out how many cups of raisins are available for oatmeal cookies. Since she divides the raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, each of these will get 9 cups of raisins. So, the total raisins available for oatmeal cookies is 9 cups. 

Now, we need to find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies she can make with 9 cups of raisins. 

To do this, we need to divide 9 cups by 3/4 cup (the amount needed per batch). 

To divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal. So, 9 / (3/4) = 9 * (4/3) = 12.

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we first need to calculate her daily and weekly electric consumption before and after adding the new device.

Before adding the new device, Ada's daily electric consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. Since there are 24 hours in a day, her daily consumption is 12 * 24 = 288 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per day.

After adding the new device, her daily electric consumption will be 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour. Her daily consumption will be 14 * 24 = 336 kWh per day.

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7. 

Before adding the new device, Ada's weekly consumption is 288 * 7 = 2016 kWh.
After adding the new device, Ada's weekly consumption is 336 * 7 = 2352 kWh.

The cost of electricity is $1.50 per kWh. So, the weekly cost before adding the new device is 2016 * $1.50 = $3024.
The weekly cost after adding the new device is 2352 * $1.50 = $3528.

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is $3528 - $3024 = $504.

The final answer is: $504"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how long it would take one person to paint a whole house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, it would take them 10 days to paint a whole house (since it would take twice as long to paint the entire house).

Next, we need to calculate how many hours it would take for one person to paint a whole house. There are 24 hours in a day, so 10 days would be 10 x 24 = 240 hours.

Now, we need to determine how long it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house. If one person can paint a whole house in 240 hours, 5 people can paint a whole house in 240 / 5 = 48 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of chairs Ophelia and Jenna have. 

Since Ophelia has 20 sofas and she has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, we can set up an equation to find the number of chairs Ophelia has. Let's denote the number of chairs Ophelia has as 'x'. Then, the number of sofas she has is x - 2. We know that the number of sofas Ophelia has is 20, so we can set up the equation x - 2 = 20.

Solving for x, we get x = 22. This means Ophelia has 22 chairs.

Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.

Now, we know that Ophelia has 20 sofas and Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. So, Jenna has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

To find the total number of sofas and chairs, we add the number of sofas and chairs Ophelia and Jenna have: 20 + 22 + 64 + 66 = 152.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off. So, the number of passengers left on the bus is:
48 - 8 = 40

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get into the bus. So, the number of new passengers is:
8 * 5 = 40

Now, the total number of passengers on the bus is:
40 (remaining) + 40 (new) = 80

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off. So, the number of passengers left on the bus is:
80 - 21 = 59

Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on. Since 3 times fewer means 1/3 of the number of passengers who got off, we need to find 1/3 of 21:
21 / 3 = 7

Now, the total number of passengers on the bus is:
59 (remaining) + 7 (new) = 66

The final answer is: 66"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, so his current age is 27 - 5 = 22 years.
2. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. 
   Let's denote Jame's age in 8 years as J8 and his cousin's age in 8 years as C8. 
   We know that C8 = 2 * J8 - 5.
3. Since Jame's age in 8 years will be 22 + 8 = 30, we can substitute J8 = 30 into the equation from step 2.
   C8 = 2 * 30 - 5 = 55.
4. Now, we need to find Jame's cousin's current age. Since his age in 8 years will be 55, his current age is 55 - 8 = 47.
5. The difference in their ages is 47 - 22 = 25.

"To find the cost of one monitor, we first need to determine the cost of the printer. Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, and the computer cost $1,100, the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700.

The total cost of the computer and the printer is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800. 

Since Errol bought 2 monitors, the cost of the two monitors is the total cost minus the cost of the computer and the printer: $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.

To find the cost of one monitor, we divide the total cost of the monitors by 2: $600 / 2 = $300.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of shells brought by the boys and then calculate the number of shells brought by the girls.

Since there are 10 boys (half of 20 kids) and each boy brought 60 shells, the total number of shells brought by the boys is 10 * 60 = 600.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 600 + 4 * 60 shells.

First, calculate four times the number of shells brought by the boys: 4 * 60 = 240.

Then, add the number of shells brought by the boys to this amount: 600 + 240 = 840.

Since there are 10 girls (half of 20 kids), the number of shells brought by each girl is 840 / 10 = 84.

Alyana's age = Chenny's age - 4
Alyana's age = 10 - 4
Alyana's age = 6

Now that we know Alyana's age, we can find Anne's age by adding 2 to Alyana's age.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, $18 is shared among 3 boys. This means each boy gets $18 / 3 = $6.

The eldest boy added $5 to his share, so he now has $6 + $5 = $11.

The following day, he added another $10, so he now has $11 + $10 = $21.

He then spent $8, so he has $21 - $8 = $13 left.

After saving some more, he tripled the amount he had left after spending the $8. This means he now has 3 * $13 = $39.

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total savings for the first half of the month. Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half, we can set up an equation to represent the situation.

Let's assume the number of days in the first half of the month is x. Then, the number of days in the second half of the month is also x (since the month has an even number of days). 

Let's denote the daily savings in the first half as y. Then, the total savings for the first half is xy.

In the second half, Elvis wants to save twice as much daily, so his daily savings is 2y. The total savings for the second half is 2xy.

The total savings for the month is the sum of the savings in the first and second half, which is equal to the target savings of $1125. We can set up the equation:

xy + 2xy = 1125

Combine like terms:

3xy = 1125

Divide both sides by 3:

xy = 375

Now, we need to find the value of y. Since x is the number of days in the first half, and we know that the total number of days in the month is 30 (assuming April has 30 days), we can set up the equation:

x + x = 30

Combine like terms:

2x = 30

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 15

Now that we know x, we can find y:

xy = 375
15y = 375

Divide both sides by 15:

y = 25

So, Elvis saves $25 per day in the first half of the month.

Since he wants to save twice as much in the second half, his daily savings in the second half is 2y = 2(25) = 50.

The final answer is: $50"

"To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let's represent the amount Brad gets as 'x'. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff's share can be represented as 4x.

We know that the total amount they are dividing is $100. So, the sum of their shares should equal $100. We can write this as an equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms:

5x = 100

Now, divide both sides by 5 to solve for x:

x = 100 / 5
x = 20

Since x represents the amount Brad gets, and Jeff gets 4 times as much, we can find Jeff's share by multiplying x by 4:

Jeff's share = 4x
= 4 * 20

1. Elise writes the alphabet in full twice, which means she writes 26 letters each time. So, she writes 26 x 2 = 52 letters.

2. Then, she writes half of the alphabet once. Half of the alphabet is 26 / 2 = 13 letters.

3. So, she writes 13 letters.

4. Now, she re-writes everything she has already written. This means she re-writes 52 + 13 = 65 letters.

5. To find the total number of letters Elise has written, we add the letters from the first two steps (52 + 13) and the letters from the last step (65). 

Total letters = 52 + 13 + 65 = 130

The final answer is: 130"
"This problem can be solved using a geometric progression. 

In the first round, 3 families are notified directly by Ali. 

In the second round, each of the 3 families notifies 3 other families, resulting in 3 * 3 = 9 new families notified. 

In the third round, each of the 9 families notifies 3 other families, resulting in 9 * 3 = 27 new families notified.

In the fourth round, each of the 27 families notifies 3 other families, resulting in 27 * 3 = 81 new families notified.

The total number of families notified in the fourth round is 81."
"To find Mark's initial weight, we need to calculate the total weight he lost and then add that to his final weight.

Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, so the total weight he lost is:
10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds

Since Mark's final weight is 70 pounds, we can find his initial weight by adding the weight he lost to his final weight:
Initial weight = Final weight + Weight lost
Initial weight = 70 pounds + 30 pounds
Initial weight = 100 pounds

The final answer is: 100"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of toys in the larger play set that Jonathan wants to have. Since James's play set has 80 toys and Jonathan wants a play set five times larger, we can calculate the total number of toys in Jonathan's desired play set as follows:

5 * 80 = 400 toys

Since Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to reach this total, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

x + 2 = 400

where x is the number of toys Jonathan currently has.

To solve for x, we can subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

x = 400 - 2
x = 398

Therefore, Jonathan currently has 398 toys. 

The final answer is: 398"
"To find the total cost of the items Daniel wants to buy, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then apply the 10% discount.

The cost of 5 notebooks at $1.50 each is 5 x $1.50 = $7.50.
The cost of 2 pens at $0.25 each is 2 x $0.25 = $0.50.
The cost of 1 calculator at $12 is $12.
The cost of 1 geometry set at $10 is $10.

The total cost of all the items before the discount is $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30.

To apply the 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of $30, which is 0.10 x $30 = $3.
The total cost after the discount is $30 - $3 = $27.

Therefore, Daniel has to spend $27 on all the items he wants to buy.

The final answer is: $27"
"To find the total cost of the items, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of five hamburgers at $4 each is 5 x $4 = $20.
The cost of ten packs of potato fries at $0.30 each is 10 x $0.30 = $3.
The cost of five cans of fruit drinks at $2 each is 5 x $2 = $10.

The total cost of the items is $20 + $3 + $10 = $33.

Carly gives a $50 bill, so the change she gets back is $50 - $33 = $17.

"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we need to break down her sales into two parts: the first $1000 and the sales above $1000.

For the first $1000, Antonella earns a 30% commission:
$1000 * 0.30 = $300

For the sales above $1000, which is $2500 - $1000 = $1500, she earns an additional 10% commission:
$1500 * 0.10 = $150

Now, we add the two commissions together to find Antonella's total earnings:
$300 + $150 = $450

The final answer is: $450"
"To determine how many additional bottles of water Bill needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles he already has and the total number of bottles he needs.

Bill started with 2 cases of water, each containing 24 bottles. So, the total number of bottles he has is 2 * 24 = 48.

He wants to have 2 bottles of water for each of his 70 guests. Therefore, the total number of bottles he needs is 70 * 2 = 140.

To find out how many additional bottles he needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the number of bottles he needs: 140 - 48 = 92.

So, Bill needs to buy 92 additional bottles of water.

The final answer is: 92"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. 

When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold. Since it takes Ray 16 minutes to swim a mile in cold water, twice that time is 2 * 16 = 32 minutes. Adding 2 minutes to that gives us 32 + 2 = 34 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water. 

In cold water, it takes Ray 16 minutes to swim a mile, so to swim 3 miles it will take him 3 * 16 = 48 minutes.

In warm water, it takes Ray 34 minutes to swim a mile, so to swim 3 miles it will take him 3 * 34 = 102 minutes.

The difference in time between swimming 3 miles in warm water and cold water is 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many cups of coffee Juan currently drinks. Since Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks, and Octavia drinks half the daily recommended amount, we need to know the daily recommended amount of coffee.

Let's assume the daily recommended amount of coffee is x cups. Then, Octavia drinks x/2 cups, and Juan drinks 10 * (x/2) = 5x cups.

We are given that Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. To find out how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we need to subtract the recommended amount from his current intake:

5x - 4 = ?

Since we don't know the value of x, we can express the answer in terms of x. However, we can also express the answer as a multiple of the daily recommended amount. 

The daily recommended amount is 4 cups, and Juan currently drinks 5x cups. To reduce his intake to the daily recommendation, he needs to reduce his intake by 5x - 4 cups.

However, we can simplify this by expressing the reduction as a multiple of the daily recommended amount. Since Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks, and Octavia drinks half the daily recommended amount, we can say that Juan drinks 10 * (1/2) = 5 times the daily recommended amount. 

To reduce his intake to the daily recommendation, he needs to reduce his intake by 5 - 1 = 4 times the daily recommended amount.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To find the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we need to calculate the number of hamsters and guinea pigs separately and then add them together.

The pet shop has 3 cages with 10 hamsters each, so the total number of hamsters is 3 * 10 = 30.

The pet shop has 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each, so the total number of guinea pigs is 3 * 5 = 15.

Now, we add the total number of hamsters and guinea pigs to find the total number of rodents: 30 + 15 = 45.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the average weight of the 3 friends, we need to first find their individual weights. 

Mark's weight is given as 150 pounds. 
Susan's weight is 20 pounds less than Mark's, so Susan's weight is 150 - 20 = 130 pounds. 
Bob's weight is twice as much as Susan's, so Bob's weight is 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, we need to find the average weight of the 3 friends. To do this, we add their weights and divide by 3. 
Average weight = (Mark's weight + Susan's weight + Bob's weight) / 3 
Average weight = (150 + 130 + 260) / 3 
Average weight = 540 / 3 
Average weight = 180

"To find the final angle from the ground to the sun, we need to calculate the total angle the sun moves in 10 hours. 

The sun moves 5 degrees per hour, so in 10 hours, it will move 5 * 10 = 50 degrees.

Since the pyramid is initially at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground, we need to add the angle the sun moves to this initial angle.

The final angle from the ground to the sun will be 32 + 50 = 82 degrees.

The final answer is: 82"
"To determine the total number of candles James needs, we first need to find the total number of candles required for both sons. 

Since one son is 12 years old and the other is 4 years younger, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Typically, birthday candles are needed for the number of years the child has lived, so James will need 12 candles for the 12-year-old and 8 candles for the 8-year-old.

Total candles needed = 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we need to find out how many packs James needs to buy. 

20 candles / 5 candles per pack = 4 packs.

The cost of 4 packs of candles = 4 packs * $3 per pack = $12.

Therefore, James spends $12 on candles.

The final answer is: $12"
"To find out how many pages Judy read in the first week, we need to calculate the total minutes she read in the first week and then convert that to pages. 

In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night. Since there are 7 nights in a week, she read for a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes in the first week.

Given that Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we can calculate the number of pages she read in the first week as follows: 
(105 minutes / 1.5 minutes per 2 pages) * 2 pages = 140 pages.

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

To find the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we add the pages read in the first week and the second week: 
140 pages + 100 pages = 240 pages.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find out how many sandwiches are left, we need to calculate the number of sandwiches each person ate and subtract that from the total.

Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, which is 1/3 of 12. To find 1/3 of 12, we multiply 12 by 1/3, which is the same as dividing 12 by 3. 

12 / 3 = 4

So, Cody ate 4 sandwiches.

Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches, which is 1/4 of 12. To find 1/4 of 12, we multiply 12 by 1/4, which is the same as dividing 12 by 4.

12 / 4 = 3

So, Trevor ate 3 sandwiches.

Now, we add the number of sandwiches Cody and Trevor ate to find the total number of sandwiches eaten.

4 (Cody) + 3 (Trevor) = 7

To find the number of sandwiches left, we subtract the total number of sandwiches eaten from the initial total.

12 (initial total) - 7 (total eaten) = 5

The number of sandwiches left is 5."
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote Shiloh's nephew's current age as 'x'. 

In 7 years, Shiloh will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old. At that time, his nephew will be x + 7 years old. According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. This can be expressed as:

51 = 3(x + 7)

Now, we can solve for 'x':

51 = 3x + 21

Subtract 21 from both sides:

30 = 3x

Divide both sides by 3:

10 = x

So, Shiloh's nephew is 10 years old today.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. The tooth fairy left $5.00 for the first tooth.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy left $1.00 each, so that's 3 x $1.00 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy left half the amount of money per tooth as Sharon had received for each of the previous three teeth. Since she received $1.00 for each of the previous three teeth, half of that is $0.50. So, for the last two teeth, the tooth fairy left 2 x $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon:

$5.00 (first tooth) + $3.00 (next three teeth) + $1.00 (last two teeth) = $9.00

The final answer is: $9.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many goals Mark and Anna scored. 

Let's start with Anna's goals. We know that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, and Richie scored 80 goals. So, we can set up an equation to find Anna's goals:

Richie's goals - 45 = Anna's goals
80 - 45 = Anna's goals
Anna's goals = 35

Now, we know that Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark. We can set up another equation to find Mark's goals:

Richie's goals - 20 = Mark's goals
80 - 20 = Mark's goals
Mark's goals = 60

Now that we know the number of goals each teenager scored, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three:

Total goals = Richie's goals + Mark's goals + Anna's goals
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35
Total goals = 175

The final answer is: 175"
"To find out how much more money Mitchell made than Liam, we need to calculate the total amount of money each of them made and then subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings.

Liam made $63 in total.

Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 apiece, so his total earnings are 21 * $4 = $84.

To find out how much more Mitchell made than Liam, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings: $84 - $63 = $21.

"To find the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate how much he spent on each type of action figure and then determine how many of each type he can buy.

First, let's calculate how much Peter spent on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday. He spent $5 each day for 4 days (Sunday to Wednesday), so the total amount spent on wooden action figures is:

$5/day * 4 days = $20

Since Peter has $70 initially, he has $70 - $20 = $50 left for the rest of the week.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. He has $50 left, so he can buy:

$50 / $2 = 25 plastic action figures

In total, Peter bought 4 wooden action figures and 25 plastic action figures.

"To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we first need to calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week and then per month.

The total number of roses ordered per week is 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered per month is 65 * 4 = 260 roses.

Ford grows 40 roses every week, so the total number of roses he grows per month is 40 * 4 = 160 roses.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the total number of roses he grows per month from the total number of roses ordered per month: 260 - 160 = 100 roses.

"To calculate the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost.

Total revenue = Number of sandwiches sold * Price per sandwich
Total revenue = 10 sandwiches * $7.00/sandwich = $70.00

Now, let's calculate the total cost. 

Cost of bread per sandwich = $3.00 / 10 sandwiches = $0.30 per sandwich
Cost of cheese and condiments per sandwich = $30.00 / 10 sandwiches = $3.00 per sandwich
Total cost per sandwich = $0.30 + $3.00 = $3.30 per sandwich
Total cost = Total cost per sandwich * Number of sandwiches sold
Total cost = $3.30 per sandwich * 10 sandwiches = $33.00

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00
Net profit = $37.00

"To find out how much money Kate can make, we need to determine the total number of muffin crayons she can make and then multiply that by the price per muffin crayon.

First, let's find the total number of crayon pieces. Since there are 3 boxes of 64 crayons each, we multiply 3 by 64 to get the total number of crayon pieces:

3 boxes * 64 crayons/box = 192 crayon pieces

Since Kate melts 8 small pieces of crayons together to make one muffin crayon, we divide the total number of crayon pieces by 8 to find the total number of muffin crayons:

192 crayon pieces / 8 pieces/muffin crayon = 24 muffin crayons

Now, we multiply the total number of muffin crayons by the price per muffin crayon to find the total amount of money Kate can make:

24 muffin crayons * $1.50/muffin crayon = $36

"To calculate the total cost, we need to find the area of the bedroom and then calculate the costs for the new carpet, padding, and installation.

The area of the bedroom is 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet.

The cost of the new carpet is $12 per square foot, so the total cost for the carpet is 216 * $12 = $2592.

The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot, so the total cost for the padding is 216 * $2 = $432.

The cost of removing the old carpet is $4 per square foot, so the total cost for removal is 216 * $4 = $864.

The cost of installing the new carpet is $34 per square foot, so the total cost for installation is 216 * $34 = $7344.

The total cost to replace the carpet is the sum of the costs for the carpet, padding, removal, and installation: $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344 = $11332.

"To find the percentage by which the oven is off, we need to calculate the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature, and then divide it by the set temperature.

The difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature is 468 - 450 = 18.

The percentage by which the oven is off is (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%.

Since the oven is off by 4% for any recipe, we need to find the temperature that is 4% higher than 520 degrees.

First, we need to calculate 4% of 520: 0.04 * 520 = 20.8.

Now, we add this value to 520 to get the actual temperature: 520 + 20.8 = 540.8.

However, since we can't set a temperature to a decimal, we round it to the nearest whole number. In this case, we round 540.8 to 541.

Therefore, Maggie should set her oven to 541 degrees to achieve the desired temperature of 520 degrees, considering the oven's malfunction.

"To find the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the time of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time as follows:
1 hour = 60 minutes
Adding the 30 minutes, we get:
60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting the time as follows:
2 hours = 2 x 60 minutes = 120 minutes
Adding the 5 minutes, we get:
120 minutes + 5 minutes = 125 minutes

"To find the total number of utensils brought by Judy and her friend, we first need to determine the number of cups and dishes each of them brought.

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of cups brought by Judy and her friend is 12 + 40 = 52 cups. The total number of dishes brought by Judy and her friend is 24 + 44 = 68 dishes.

"To find the cost per pair of contacts, we first need to determine the total number of contacts and the total cost of the boxes.

Since 90 contacts last Pete 45 days, we can calculate the number of contacts he uses per day:

90 contacts / 45 days = 2 contacts per day

Since Pete buys 2 boxes, the total number of contacts will be:

90 contacts/box * 2 boxes = 180 contacts

The total cost of the boxes with a 10% discount is:

$100.00 * 2 boxes = $200.00
10% discount = $200.00 * 0.10 = $20.00
Total cost after discount = $200.00 - $20.00 = $180.00

Now, we can calculate the cost per pair of contacts:

Total cost = $180.00
Total number of contacts = 180
Cost per pair of contacts = Total cost / Total number of contacts
Cost per pair of contacts = $180.00 / 90
Cost per pair of contacts = $2.00

"To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we need to calculate their individual earnings first.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, for a total of 3 hours. Her hourly wage is $10, so her total earnings are 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 hours. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, which is 3 * 1 = 3 hours. So, John worked a total of 4 + 3 = 7 hours. His total earnings are 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find out how much water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total calories she burns during her activities. 

She spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories/hour. So, the total calories burned from aerobics is 2 * 500 = 1000 calories.

She also spends 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories/hour. So, the total calories burned from running is 1 * 600 = 600 calories.

The total calories burned is the sum of calories burned from aerobics and running, which is 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns, we need to divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many times she needs to drink 100 ml of water.

Total calories burned / 200 = 1600 / 200 = 8

So, Hannah needs to drink 8 * 100 ml of water.

The final answer is: 800"
"To solve this problem, let's assume the number of blue jelly beans is x. 

Since there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans, the number of red jelly beans is 0.99x.

Since there are 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans, the number of green jelly beans is 1.01x.

The total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can set up the equation:

x + 0.99x + 1.01x = 4500

Combine like terms:

2.99x = 4500

Divide both sides by 2.99:

x = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

Red jelly beans: 0.99x = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
Green jelly beans: 1.01x = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

To find the difference between the number of green and red jelly beans, subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

1515 - 1485 = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the average of the three measurements, we need to first find the third measurement. 

Jared's initial typing speed is 47 WPM. After the first increase, it becomes 52 WPM. The second increase is 5 WPM, so the third measurement will be 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

Now, we have the three measurements: 47, 52, and 57. To find the average, we add them up and divide by 3.

Average = (47 + 52 + 57) / 3
Average = 156 / 3
Average = 52

The final answer is: 52"
"To find the difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks, we need to calculate the weight change for each option and then subtract the weight change for the first option from the weight change for the second option.

For the first option (eating Cheerios), Martin loses 1.25 pounds/week. After 5 weeks, he will lose 1.25 * 5 = 6.25 pounds.

For the second option (eating donuts), Martin gains 1.75 pounds/week. After 5 weeks, he will gain 1.75 * 5 = 8.75 pounds.

The difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks is the weight gain for the second option minus the weight loss for the first option: 8.75 - 6.25 = 2.5 pounds.

The final answer is: 2.5"
"To determine the total number of people attending, we need to calculate the number of people invited via email, the number of friends Alex's friends will bring, and the number of Alex's friends and their spouses.

First, let's calculate the number of people invited via email. Each of the 100 people invited will bring 2 friends, so the total number of people invited via email is 100 + (100 * 2) = 300.

Next, Alex calls 10 friends and 8 of them will bring their spouses, so the total number of Alex's friends and their spouses is 10 + 8 = 18.

Now, we add the number of people invited via email and the number of Alex's friends and their spouses to get the total number of people attending. 

Total number of people = 300 (via email) + 18 (Alex's friends and their spouses) = 318.

However, we also need to consider Alex herself, so we add 1 to the total number of people.

Total number of people = 318 + 1 = 319.

Therefore, Alex will need 319 seats.

The final answer is: 319"
"To find the weight of the Mastiff, we need to start from the Papillon's weight and work our way back. 

The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund. If the Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, then the Dachshund's weight is 2 * 10 pounds = 20 pounds. 

Since the Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, the Papillon's weight is 20 pounds / 4 = 5 pounds.

The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff's weight is 44 * 5 pounds = 220 pounds.

The final answer is: 220"
"To find the total cost of the boots on eBay, we need to add the cost of the boots and the shipping cost. 

The cost of the boots on eBay is $13. 
The shipping cost on eBay is twice as much as on Amazon, which is $4 * 2 = $8.

So, the total cost of the boots on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

The total cost of the boots on Amazon is $16 + $4 = $20.

To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we subtract the cost on Amazon from the cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many days it will take for the beanstalk to reach or exceed 20 feet, given that it starts at 4 feet and doubles in height every day.

Day 1: 4 feet
Day 2: 4 * 2 = 8 feet
Day 3: 8 * 2 = 16 feet
Day 4: 16 * 2 = 32 feet

Since the beanstalk reaches 20 feet on the third day, but exceeds it on the fourth day, it will take 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to first calculate how many grams of protein he gets per day. 

Since a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein, we can find the protein content per gram of mushroom by dividing the protein content by the weight of the mushroom: 3 grams / 100 grams = 0.03 grams of protein per gram of mushroom.

Now, we know John eats 200 grams of mushrooms per day. To find out how many grams of protein he gets per day, we multiply the weight of mushrooms he eats per day by the protein content per gram of mushroom: 200 grams * 0.03 grams/gram = 6 grams of protein per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7 to find the weekly protein intake: 6 grams/day * 7 days/week = 42 grams of protein per week.

The final answer is: 42"
"To solve this problem, let's denote Jerry's current age as 'x'. According to the given information, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. This can be expressed as:

x = 2(x - 5)

Simplifying the equation:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting 2x from both sides:

-x = -10

Dividing both sides by -1:

x = 10

So, Jerry's current age is 10 years. 

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

Jerry's age in 3 years = 10 + 3 = 13

"To determine how many hours George needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the dental work. 

George needs 2 implants, each with a base price of $2000. So, the total cost for the implants is 2 * $2000 = $4000. 

One of the implants requires a porcelain crown, which costs an extra $500. So, the total cost for the implants with the crown is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already put down a deposit of $600. Therefore, the remaining amount he needs to pay is $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since George makes $15 per hour at work, we can calculate the number of hours he needs to work to pay for the remaining amount by dividing the remaining amount by his hourly wage: $3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

The final answer is: 260"
"To solve this problem, we can start by assigning variables to the angles. Let's call the smallest angle x. Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, it can be represented as 2x. The other angle is three times the smallest angle, so it can be represented as 3x.

We know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the value of x, we can find the other angles. The smallest angle is x, which is 30 degrees. The angle that is twice the smallest angle is 2x, which is 60 degrees. The angle that is three times the smallest angle is 3x, which is 90 degrees.

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: 90"
"To determine how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has in cents. 

First, let's convert the coins to cents:
- 8 quarters = 8 * 25 = 200 cents
- 6 dimes = 6 * 10 = 60 cents
- 14 nickels = 14 * 5 = 70 cents
- 15 pennies = 15 * 1 = 15 cents

Now, let's add up the total amount of money Colby has:
200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs a nickel (5 cents), we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball:
345 / 5 = 69

Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

"To find the rate at which the plane travels, we need to divide the distance it traveled by the time it took. 

Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Rate = 400 miles per hour

Now, we need to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this rate.

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

Since the question asks for the additional hours it would take, we need to subtract the initial 3 hours from the total time.

Additional hours = Total time - Initial time
Additional hours = 5 hours - 3 hours
Additional hours = 2 hours

"To find out how much money Joe will have left after the purchase, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he wants to buy and then subtract that from the initial amount of money he has.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount. The shirt costs $25 and the shorts cost $35, so the total cost is $25 + $35 = $60.

Since there is a 30% off sale, we need to calculate the discount amount. To do this, we multiply the total cost by the discount percentage (30% or 0.3). The discount amount is $60 * 0.3 = $18.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final cost of the items. $60 - $18 = $42.

Since sales tax is included, we don't need to add any additional tax to the final cost. Joe will pay $42 for the items.

To find out how much money Joe will have left, we subtract the final cost from the initial amount of money he has. $50 - $42 = $8.

"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial funding for the first 5 months and the additional funding for the remaining 45 months.

Initial funding for the first 5 months: $100,000

Since the research took 10 times longer than expected, it lasted for 50 months (10 * 5 months). The first 5 months are already accounted for, so we need to calculate the funding for the remaining 45 months.

Each month after the first 5 months took 50% more funding than the initial $100,000. To calculate the increased funding, we need to find 50% of $100,000 and add it to the initial amount.

50% of $100,000 = 0.5 * $100,000 = $50,000
Increased funding per month = $100,000 + $50,000 = $150,000

Now, we need to calculate the total funding for the remaining 45 months:

Total funding for the remaining 45 months = $150,000 * 45 = $6,750,000

He also chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner, so he chews 2 more pieces.

In total, Jim chews 4 + 2 = 6 pieces of gum during the day.

Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

However, he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. Half of 14 is 7, so he gives 7 pieces to his sister.

To find the number of pieces Jim has left, we subtract the number he gave to his sister from the remaining pieces: 14 - 7 = 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find Charmaine's age 4 years from now, we need to first determine her current age. Since she will be 16 years old in 12 years, we subtract 12 from 16 to find her current age.

16 (future age) - 12 (years until future age) = 4 (current age)

Now, we add 4 years to her current age to find her age 4 years from now.

4 (current age) + 4 (years) = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach, we need to calculate the total amount spent by each coach and then find the difference.

The baseball coach bought 9 new baseballs for $3 each, so the total amount spent by the baseball coach is:
9 x $3 = $27

The basketball coach bought 8 new basketballs for $14 each, so the total amount spent by the basketball coach is:
8 x $14 = $112

Now, let's find the difference between the amounts spent by the two coaches:
$112 (basketball coach) - $27 (baseball coach) = $85

The final answer is: $85"
"To find the total number of flowers that have bloomed, we need to first calculate the total number of flowers in the garden and then multiply it by the fraction that have bloomed.

The total number of flowers in the garden is the product of the number of rows and the number of flowers in each row: 10 rows * 20 flowers/row = 200 flowers.

Since only 4/5 of the flowers have bloomed, we multiply the total number of flowers by 4/5: 200 flowers * 4/5 = 160 flowers.

The final answer is: 160"
"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to first convert her speed from kb/s to Mb/s and then multiply it by the number of seconds in an hour.

1 Mb = 1000 kb
Ashley's speed in kb/s = 20 kb/s

To convert kb/s to Mb/s, we divide by 1000:
20 kb/s / 1000 = 0.02 Mb/s

There are 3600 seconds in an hour. To find Ashley's speed in Mb/h, we multiply her speed in Mb/s by the number of seconds in an hour:
0.02 Mb/s * 3600 s/h = 72 Mb/h

The final answer is: 72"
"To find the total number of cars towed, we need to calculate the number of cars towed in the first three days and the remaining days separately and then add them together.

In the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day. So, the total number of cars towed in the first three days is 3 * 10 = 30.

In the remaining days of the week, there are 4 days (7 - 3 = 4). The tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars each day, so it pulled 10 - 4 = 6 cars per day. The total number of cars towed in the remaining days is 4 * 6 = 24.

Now, we add the total number of cars towed in the first three days and the remaining days: 30 + 24 = 54.

The final answer is: 54"
"To determine the number of years until Adam is tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to calculate the difference between the required height (4 feet) and Adam's current height (40 inches), and then divide that by his annual growth rate (2 inches).

First, we need to convert the required height from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the required height is:

4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Now, we can calculate the difference between the required height and Adam's current height:

48 inches (required height) - 40 inches (current height) = 8 inches

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we can divide the difference by his annual growth rate to find the number of years until he is tall enough:

8 inches / 2 inches/year = 4 years

Therefore, Adam will be tall enough to ride the roller coaster in 4 years.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how much James made, we need to calculate the profit from selling the cars, then apply his commission.

First, let's find the total cost of the cars: 10 cars * $25,000 = $250,000.

The company paid 30% of the cost to acquire the cars, so the amount they paid is 0.3 * $250,000 = $75,000.

The profit from selling the cars is the selling price minus the cost to acquire them: $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.

James gets a 10% commission on the profit, so his commission is 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

Therefore, James made $17,500."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that 25% of the 100 riders can stay upright on the wave. To find the number of riders who can stay upright, we multiply 100 by 0.25 (which is 25% expressed as a decimal).

100 * 0.25 = 25

So, 25 riders can stay upright on the wave.

Next, we are told that 60% of these 25 riders are women. To find the number of women who can stay upright, we multiply 25 by 0.6 (which is 60% expressed as a decimal).

25 * 0.6 = 15

Since the remaining riders who can stay upright are men, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright.

25 - 15 = 10

Therefore, 10 men can stay upright on the wave.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total price for all three jewels, we need to first find the prices of the gold and silver jewels.

Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, and the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond jewel, we can calculate the price of the gold jewel as follows:

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * Price of diamond jewel
= (4/5) * $2000
= $1600

The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold, so we can calculate the price of the silver jewel as follows:

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
= $1600 - $400
= $1200

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

The final answer is: $4800"
"To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to determine the number of each type of stamp and add them together.

Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.

He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

To find the total number of stamps, we add the number of each type of stamp together: 16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45.

The final answer is: 45"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the relative speed between Bob and Tom, and then use that to calculate the time it will take for Tom to catch up.

Since Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour and Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour, the relative speed between them is the difference in their speeds, which is 70 - 55 = 15 miles per hour.

The distance between them is 75 miles. To find the time it will take for Tom to catch up, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Relative Speed

Plugging in the values, we get:

Time = 75 miles / 15 miles per hour

Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob. 

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many fish Darren caught. Since Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish, we can calculate Darren's catch by subtracting 6 from Naomi's total.

Darren's catch = Naomi's catch - 6
Darren's catch = 17 - 6
Darren's catch = 11

Now that we know Darren caught 11 fish, we can calculate Tommy's catch by adding 3 to Darren's total.

Tommy's catch = Darren's catch + 3
Tommy's catch = 11 + 3
Tommy's catch = 14

The final answer is: 14"
"To find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to determine the maximum number of classes he can attend without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Let's assume the cost per class is $10. If Manny attends all 10 classes, the total cost would be 10 classes * $10 per class = $100. However, Manny signed up for classes for $60, so he has a remaining balance of $40.

Since Manny's parents are concerned about the cost exceeding $10 per class, we need to find out how many classes he can miss to stay within the $60 budget. 

Let's subtract the remaining balance from the total cost per class to find the maximum number of classes he can attend: $10 per class - $0.40 per class (since he has a remaining balance of $40 for 10 classes) = $9.60 per class.

Now, let's divide the remaining balance by the new cost per class: $40 / $9.60 per class = 4.17 classes.

Since Manny can't miss a fraction of a class, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Manny can miss 4 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we first need to determine their individual daily production and then multiply it by 7 (the number of days in a week).

Jewel processes 50 customers per day. Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, Julie's daily production is 2 * 50 = 100 customers.

The total daily production for both Julie and Jewel is 50 + 100 = 150 customers.

To find the total weekly production, we multiply the daily production by 7: 150 * 7 = 1050.

The final answer is: 1050"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Paisley ran 4 miles.
2. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so Reggie ran 5 * 4 = 20 miles.
3. Reggie also ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, so Lynn ran 20 - 3 = 17 miles.

"To find the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges, we need to first find the cost of one apple and one orange. 

The cost of 4 apples is $5.20, so the cost of one apple is $5.20 / 4 = $1.30. 

The cost of 3 oranges is $3.30, so the cost of one orange is $3.30 / 3 = $1.10.

Now, we can find the cost of 5 apples: 5 apples * $1.30/apple = $6.50.

Next, we can find the cost of 5 oranges: 5 oranges * $1.10/orange = $5.50.

Finally, we can find the total cost by adding the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges: $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To find the volume of the hole, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth. 

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Since it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we can multiply the volume by the time it takes to shovel one cubic foot.

Total time = Volume * time per cubic foot
Total time = 72 * 3
Total time = 216 seconds

Therefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add them to the base price.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade costs $7,500.

The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of the leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of the running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs:

Base price: $30,000
King cab upgrade: $7,500
Leather seats: $2,500
Running boards: $2,000
Upgraded exterior light package: $1,500

"To find the total amount Tim will make in a year, we need to calculate his new monthly salary and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's calculate the 5% raise on his monthly salary:
5% of $20,000 = 0.05 * $20,000 = $1,000
New monthly salary = $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000

Next, let's calculate the bonus:
Bonus = half a month's salary = $20,000 / 2 = $10,000

Now, let's calculate the total monthly income:
Total monthly income = new monthly salary + bonus = $21,000 + $10,000 = $31,000

Finally, let's calculate the total annual income:
Total annual income = total monthly income * 12 = $31,000 * 12 = $372,000

"To find the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley, we need to calculate the distance each of them biked and then add them together.

Alisa biked at 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours. To find the distance she biked, we multiply her speed by the time:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 12 miles/hour x 4.5 hours
Distance = 54 miles

Stanley biked at 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours. To find the distance he biked, we multiply his speed by the time:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour x 2.5 hours
Distance = 25 miles

"To find the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay, then add those times together.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil. Bill can dig 4 feet/hour through soil, and he needs to dig 24 feet of soil. 

Time to dig through soil = Total soil depth / Rate of digging through soil
Time to dig through soil = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour
Time to dig through soil = 6 hours

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the clay. Bill can dig half as fast through clay as he can through soil, so his rate of digging through clay is 4 / 2 = 2 feet/hour. He needs to dig 8 feet of clay.

Time to dig through clay = Total clay depth / Rate of digging through clay
Time to dig through clay = 8 feet / 2 feet/hour
Time to dig through clay = 4 hours

Now, we add the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay to find the total time.

Total time = Time to dig through soil + Time to dig through clay
Total time = 6 hours + 4 hours
Total time = 10 hours

"To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost of the pomegranates on each day and then subtract the two amounts.

On the first day, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, but she got a $2 discount. So, the total cost is:

20 pomegranates * $20 = $400
Discount: $2
Total cost = $400 - $2 = $398

On the second day, the price of each pomegranate is $30, and there's a 10% discount on the total cost. So, the total cost is:

20 pomegranates * $30 = $600
Discount: 10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
Total cost = $600 - $60 = $540

Now, let's find the difference between the two total costs:

Difference = $398 - $540 = -$142

However, since we are looking for the difference in the final prices paid, we need to consider the absolute value of the difference, as a negative value doesn't make sense in this context.

Absolute difference = $142"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find the total sales from green hats in the first month. Since the sales from red hats were half the total amount she earned from selling green hats, let's denote the total sales from green hats as 'x'. Then, the sales from red hats would be x/2.

We are given that the sales from red hats were $400, so we can set up the equation:

x/2 = 400

To find the value of 'x', we multiply both sides by 2:

x = 400 * 2
x = 800

So, the total sales from green hats in the first month were $800.

Now, let's find the total sales in the first month. The total sales would be the sum of sales from red hats and green hats:

Total sales in the first month = 400 + 800
Total sales in the first month = 1200

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. To find the sales in the second month, we multiply the total sales in the first month by 3/4:

Sales in the second month = (3/4) * 1200
Sales in the second month = 900

Now, let's find the total sales in two months. We add the sales from the first month and the second month:

Total sales in two months = 1200 + 900
Total sales in two months = 2100

Since her bank account now holds $420 and it initially held $200, the amount she received from her wage is $420 - $200 = $220.

Now, we subtract the amount she received from the total amount she should have received to find the amount withheld: $300 - $220 = $80.

The amount withheld from Sally's wage is $80."
"To determine the number of eggs Lori needs, we first need to calculate the total number of deviled egg halves she needs to serve. Since each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves, and she is inviting 16 guests, the total number of deviled egg halves needed is:

16 guests * 3 deviled egg halves per guest = 48 deviled egg halves

Since Lori needs 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves, we need to calculate how many eggs are needed to make 48 deviled egg halves. 

48 deviled egg halves / 2 deviled egg halves per egg = 24 eggs

To find the number of dozens of eggs needed, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 (since 1 dozen = 12 eggs):

"To find the total cost of the plane for the first year, we need to calculate the cost of the plane itself, the cost of renting the hanger, and the cost of fuel.

The cost of the plane is $150,000.

The cost of renting the hanger is $5000 per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total cost of renting the hanger for the first year is $5000 * 12 = $60,000.

The cost of fuel is twice the cost of renting the hanger, which is $5000 * 2 = $10,000 per month. The total cost of fuel for the first year is $10,000 * 12 = $120,000.

The total cost of getting and maintaining the plane for the first year is the sum of the cost of the plane, the cost of renting the hanger, and the cost of fuel: $150,000 + $60,000 + $120,000 = $330,000.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the cooking time for pork and beans. 

Given that it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice, and it took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, we can calculate the cooking time for pork as follows:

Cooking time for pork = Cooking time for rice + 20 minutes
Cooking time for pork = 30 minutes + 20 minutes
Cooking time for pork = 50 minutes

Now, we know that beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is 30 minutes (rice) + 50 minutes (pork) = 80 minutes. 

Cooking time for beans = (Combined cooking time of pork and rice) / 2
Cooking time for beans = 80 minutes / 2
Cooking time for beans = 40 minutes

Now, we have the cooking times for all three foods: rice (30 minutes), pork (50 minutes), and beans (40 minutes). To find the total cooking time, we add these times together:

Total cooking time = Cooking time for rice + Cooking time for pork + Cooking time for beans
Total cooking time = 30 minutes + 50 minutes + 40 minutes
Total cooking time = 120 minutes

"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of sheep as S and the number of geese as G.

Since sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs, the total number of legs can be represented as:

4S + 2G = 70

We are also given that the total number of animal heads is 20. Since sheep and geese both have one head, we can represent this as:

S + G = 20

Now we have a system of two equations:

1) 4S + 2G = 70
2) S + G = 20

We can solve this system of equations by multiplying the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of G in both equations the same:

2(S + G) = 2(20)
2S + 2G = 40

Now we can subtract this new equation from the first equation to eliminate G:

(4S + 2G) - (2S + 2G) = 70 - 40
2S = 30

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee and the cost of the donut.

The normal brand of coffee costs $5 per pound. Since Roger buys a more expensive brand that costs 20% more, we need to calculate the cost of the more expensive brand. 

20% of $5 is 0.2 * $5 = $1. 
So, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

Roger buys a week's worth of coffee, which is 7 pounds (since he uses 1 pound per day). The cost of the more expensive coffee is 7 * $6 = $42.

The cost of the donut is $2.

The total cost is $42 (coffee) + $2 (donut) = $44.

The final answer is: $44"
"To find the cost of the apple pie, we need to subtract the total cost of the items Gus bought from the total amount he spent. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Gus bought:

2 bags of chips for $2.00 each = 2 x $2.00 = $4.00
Adding the cost of the bucket of fried chicken: $4.00 + $8.00 = $12.00
Adding the cost of the bottle of soda: $12.00 + $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's subtract the total cost of the items from the total amount Gus spent:

Total amount spent = $20.00
Total cost of items = $13.00
Cost of the apple pie = Total amount spent - Total cost of items = $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

The cost of the apple pie is $7.00.

$7.00"
"To find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers delivered.

Total newspapers delivered = 600
Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers delivered - (Newspapers delivered to District A + Newspapers delivered to District C)
= 600 - (198 + 209)
= 600 - 407
= 193

The final answer is: 193"
"To find the total number of hours John spends in the class, we need to multiply the number of hours per class by the number of classes per week and then multiply that by the number of weeks.

Hours per class: 2
Classes per week: 4
Weeks: 6

Total hours per week: 2 * 4 = 8 hours
Total hours for 6 weeks: 8 * 6 = 48 hours

Since John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time, we need to divide the total hours by 1.5 to find the number of recipes he learns.

Total hours: 48
Recipes per hour: 1.5

Number of recipes: 48 / 1.5 = 32

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the number of math teachers, we first need to find the number of history teachers and then subtract that from the total number of teachers. 

60% of 150 teachers are history teachers. To find 60% of 150, we multiply 150 by 0.6. 

150 * 0.6 = 90

So, there are 90 history teachers. To find the number of math teachers, we subtract the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers.

150 - 90 = 60

There are 60 math teachers. 

Each math teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. To find the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day, we multiply the number of math teachers by the number of hours they sleep per day.

60 * 6 = 360

The final answer is: 360"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the amount of money Kassidy and Rayna have. 

First, we know Aurelia has $120. Since Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, we can calculate Kassidy's amount by multiplying Aurelia's amount by 3/4.

Kassidy's money = 3/4 * 120 = 90 dollars

Now, we know Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy. So, we can calculate Rayna's amount by adding 60 to Kassidy's amount.

Rayna's money = 90 + 60 = 150 dollars

Now that we have the amounts for all three, we can add them together and divide by 3 to find the total amount they would have if they shared it equally.

Total money = 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 dollars

Now, we divide the total money by 3 to find the amount each would have if they shared it equally.

Amount each would have = 360 / 3 = 120 dollars

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To find the total length of the game, we need to calculate the length of the regular game and then add the extra time played in the extended quarter.

The regular game consists of 4 quarters, each 12 minutes long. So, the total length of the regular game is:
4 quarters * 12 minutes/quarter = 48 minutes

Since the game was extended for 5 minutes, we need to add this to the total length of the regular game:
48 minutes + 5 minutes = 53 minutes

Therefore, the entire game lasted 53 minutes. 

The final answer is: 53"
"To find the number of employees who oversee the company, we need to first find the number of management employees and then find 30% of that number.

First, let's find the number of management employees. 20% of 50 employees are management, so we multiply 50 by 0.2.

Number of management employees = 50 * 0.2 = 10

Now, we need to find 30% of the management employees. 30% of 10 is 0.3 * 10 = 3.

Therefore, 3 employees oversee the company.

"To find the total amount of dry ingredients needed, we need to calculate the total amount of flour, sugar, and salt required for 16 muffins.

For flour, Svetlana needs 5 tablespoons per muffin, so for 16 muffins, she needs 5 * 16 = 80 tablespoons of flour.

For sugar, Svetlana needs 3 tablespoons per muffin, so for 16 muffins, she needs 3 * 16 = 48 tablespoons of sugar.

For salt, Svetlana needs 0.25 tablespoons per muffin, so for 16 muffins, she needs 0.25 * 16 = 4 tablespoons of salt.

Now, we add up the total amount of dry ingredients: 80 (flour) + 48 (sugar) + 4 (salt) = 132 tablespoons.

"To find out how much candy each person would have after sharing equally, we need to first find the total amount of candy they have together. 

Robert had 3 pounds of candy, Cindy had 5 pounds of candy, and Aaron had 4 pounds of candy. 

Total candy = 3 + 5 + 4 = 12 pounds

Since they are sharing the candy equally among themselves, we need to divide the total amount of candy by the number of people. 

Number of people = 3 (Robert, Cindy, and Aaron)

Candy per person = Total candy / Number of people
= 12 / 3
= 4

So, each of them would have 4 pounds of candy after sharing equally. 

The final answer is: 4"

Since Adam paid the cashier $15, the change he got is $15 - $11 = $4.

The final answer is: $4"
"To find the number of good days left in the month, we need to first determine the total number of good days recorded by Christina. We know that she had 12 good days in the first 30 days. However, we also know that her first 8 days were good, her second 8 days were bad, and her third 8 days were neutral. This means that the good days in the first 30 days are only the first 8 days.

So, the total number of good days in the first 30 days is 8. 

We are also given that the next 3 days were good, neutral, and good. We need to add these 3 days to the total number of good days. 

The total number of good days left in the month is 8 (initial good days) + 3 (additional good days) = 11.

"To find out how many books Sally has, we need to work backwards from the information given. We know that Janey has 21 books and that she has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has.

Let's represent the number of books Sally has as 'x'. According to the information, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has, so we can write an equation:

Janey's books = 2 * Sally's books + 3
21 = 2x + 3

Now, we need to solve for 'x'. To do this, we'll subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

21 - 3 = 2x + 3 - 3
18 = 2x

Next, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 2 to isolate 'x':

18 / 2 = 2x / 2
9 = x

So, Sally has 9 books. 

9"
"To find the number of days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches, we need to first convert the initial height from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now, we know the bamboo grows 30 inches a day and starts at 240 inches. To find the number of days it will take to reach 600 inches, we can subtract the initial height from the target height and divide by the daily growth rate:

600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

The final answer is: 12"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs. This means each dog has 1 toy. When 8 more dogs arrive, James needs 8 more toys to bring the total to 12 dogs with 1 toy each. So, he buys 8 more toys.

Now, there are 12 dogs, and James goes back to find that there are twice as many more dogs, which means there are 24 dogs in total (12 + 12). Since each dog needs 1 toy, James needs 24 toys. However, he already has 12 toys from the previous purchase. So, he needs 24 - 12 = 12 more toys.

When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs those toys. This means he needs 24 - 3 = 21 toys in total.

However, we need to consider the initial 4 toys James had. So, the total number of toys James needs is 21 (for the 21 dogs) + 4 (initial toys) = 25 toys.

"To find out how many signatures the sisters need to collect, we first need to determine how many signatures they currently have in total. Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44 signatures. 

Total signatures currently = 20 (Carol's signatures) + 44 (Jennifer's signatures) = 64 signatures

Since they want to reach a total of 100 signatures by the end of the summer, we need to find out how many signatures they still need to collect.

Signatures needed = Total signatures desired - Total signatures currently
= 100 - 64
= 36

The sisters need to collect 36 signatures to reach their goal."
"To find out how much Karen earns in two days, we first need to determine her hourly wage. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen's hourly wage is 2 * $10 = $20.

Next, we need to calculate how much Karen earns in one day. Since she works 3 hours per day, her daily earnings are $20 * 3 = $60.

Finally, to find out how much Karen earns in two days, we multiply her daily earnings by 2: $60 * 2 = $120.

"To find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes, we need to determine the ratio of potatoes to hash browns. 

Given that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, we can calculate the ratio as follows:

6 potatoes / 36 hash browns = 1 potato / 6 hash browns

Now, we can use this ratio to find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes:

96 potatoes * (6 hash browns / 1 potato) = 96 * 6
= 576 hash browns

Therefore, 96 potatoes can make 576 hash browns.

"To find the total weight of the 9 adults, we need to multiply the average weight of an adult by the number of adults. 

Total weight = Average weight of an adult * Number of adults
Total weight = 80 kg * 9
Total weight = 720 kg

Since the elevator supports a maximum load of 700 kg, we need to find the excess weight by subtracting the maximum load from the total weight.

Excess weight = Total weight - Maximum load
Excess weight = 720 kg - 700 kg
Excess weight = 20 kg

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of cookies Max and Summer have. 

Since Katarina has 68 cookies and she has 5 less than Max, Max must have 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.

Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, but we don't know how many cookies the Cookie Monster has. However, we can express the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has as x. Then, Max has x + 12 cookies.

Since we already know Max has 73 cookies, we can set up the equation x + 12 = 73. Solving for x, we get x = 73 - 12 = 61. So, the Cookie Monster has 61 cookies.

Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, and we know Max has 73 cookies. Therefore, Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Now, we can find the total number of cookies by adding the number of cookies Katarina, Max, and Summer have: 68 + 73 + 96 = 237.

The final answer is: 237"
"To find the original length of the dress, we need to work backwards from the final design length. 

Let's denote the original length of the dress as 'x'. 

The dress is extended by 50% of its original length, which means it is extended by 0.5x. 

The final length is 140cm, which includes the original length plus the extension (0.5x) and the additional 20cm of lace trim. 

So, we can write the equation as: x + 0.5x + 20 = 140.

Combine like terms: 1.5x + 20 = 140.

Subtract 20 from both sides: 1.5x = 120.

Divide both sides by 1.5: x = 80.

The original length of the dress is 80cm.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes to mow half the lawn in each mode and then add those times together.

First, let's find the time it takes to mow half the lawn in turtle mode. Since it takes 1 hour to mow the entire lawn in turtle mode, it will take 0.5 hours to mow half the lawn. We need to convert 0.5 hours to minutes: 0.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 30 minutes.

Next, let's find the time it takes to mow half the lawn in rabbit mode. Since it takes 40 minutes to mow the entire lawn in rabbit mode, it will take 20 minutes to mow half the lawn (40 minutes / 2 = 20 minutes).

Now, we add the times together: 30 minutes (turtle mode) + 20 minutes (rabbit mode) = 50 minutes.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the age of one of the twins as T and the age of one of the triplets as T'. 

Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, we can express the age of the other twin as T + 7. 

The combined ages of the twins and the triplets are 44. We can set up the equation: 2T + 3T' = 44.

We also know that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so we can express the age of the triplet as T - 7.

Substituting T - 7 for T' in the equation 2T + 3T' = 44, we get 2T + 3(T - 7) = 44.

Expanding the equation, we get 2T + 3T - 21 = 44.

Combining like terms, we get 5T - 21 = 44.

Adding 21 to both sides of the equation, we get 5T = 65.

Dividing both sides of the equation by 5, we get T = 13.

Therefore, one of the twins is 13 years old.

"To find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we first need to find the cost of one candy. 

We know that Manolo bought 5 lollipops and 4 candies for $3.20. The cost of 5 lollipops is 5 * $0.40 = $2. 

Now, we subtract the cost of 5 lollipops from the total cost to find the cost of 4 candies: $3.20 - $2 = $1.20. 

The cost of one candy is $1.20 / 4 = $0.30.

Now, we can find the total cost of 10 lollipops: 10 * $0.40 = $4.

The total cost of 10 candies is 10 * $0.30 = $3.

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $4 + $3 = $7.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of coins Rong and Neil have saved over 10 years.

Rong saves 20 coins per month. In 10 years, there are 12 months in a year, so the total number of months is 10 * 12 = 120 months. 

Rong's total savings = 20 coins/month * 120 months = 2400 coins.

Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, which is 20 + (2/5 * 20) = 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Neil's total savings = 28 coins/month * 120 months = 3360 coins.

The total number of coins they have is the sum of their individual savings: 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins.

"To find the total bill, we first need to calculate the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check. 

The cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40. 

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, but we don't know the total bill yet. Let's call the total bill 'x'. The heartworm check is 0.6x.

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check: x = $40 + 0.6x.

To find the value of x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Subtract 0.6x from both sides: 0.4x = $40.

Now, divide both sides by 0.4: x = $100.

So, the total bill is $100. The heartworm check is 60% of $100, which is 0.6 * $100 = $60.

The total amount John paid is $100 (bill) + $60 (heartworm check) = $160.

John brought $125 with him, so he leaves with $125 - $160 = -$35. 

However, since you cannot leave with a negative amount of money, this means John does not have enough money to pay the total bill.

Hannah's house is at the right angle to see 40% of the city's fireworks. To find 40% of 300, we multiply 300 by 0.4:
300 * 0.4 = 120 fireworks

The total number of fireworks Hannah will see is the sum of the fireworks set off by the city that she can see and the fireworks set off in her backyard:
120 + 15 = 135 fireworks

The final answer is: 135"
"To find the total amount spent on snacks and drinks, we first need to determine the total number of people, the total number of drinks, and the total number of snacks.

Aiden and his 12 friends make 13 people. When they meet up with 7 more friends, the total number of people becomes 13 + 7 = 20.

Since each seat can hold one person, two drinks, and three snacks, the total number of drinks and snacks is equal to the total number of people. Therefore, the total number of drinks is 20 and the total number of snacks is 20.

The cost of each drink and snack is $2. To find the total cost, we multiply the total number of drinks and snacks by the cost per item: 

Total cost = (20 drinks * $2) + (20 snacks * $2)
Total cost = $40 + $40
Total cost = $80

The final answer is: $80"
"To find out how many pounds of gravel Gary's truck can carry, we need to first determine how much Gordy's truck can carry. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, and Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds, Gordy's truck can carry 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.

Now, we know that the combined capacity of all three trucks is 11,600 pounds. We already know that Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds and Gordy's truck can carry 4,800 pounds. To find out how much Gary's truck can carry, we subtract the combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity of all three trucks.

Gary's truck capacity = Total capacity - (Gissela's capacity + Gordy's capacity)
Gary's truck capacity = 11,600 - (4,000 + 4,800)
Gary's truck capacity = 11,600 - 8,800
Gary's truck capacity = 2,800

The final answer is: 2800"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of dumplings each male ate and then add the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry.

First, let's find out how many dumplings the females ate in total. Since there are 6 females and each female ate 3 dumplings, the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.

Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32.

The total number of dumplings eaten by both males and females is 18 (females) + 32 (males) = 50.

Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is equal to the total number of dumplings eaten. Therefore, Larry cooked 50 dumplings.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how much money Gerald had initially, we need to determine the total parts of the ratio and Gerald's share. The ratio is 3:2, which means there are 3 + 2 = 5 parts in total. Gerald's share is 3 out of 5 parts.

Since the total amount of money is $100, we can find Gerald's initial share by multiplying the total amount by the fraction of the ratio that represents his share: 

Gerald's initial share = (3/5) * $100 = $60

After spending $10 on a book, Gerald is left with:

Gerald's remaining money = $60 - $10 = $50

The final answer is: $50"
"To find the speed of the turtle, we need to divide the speed of the cat by 5, since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle. 

Speed of the cat = 15 feet/second
Speed of the turtle = Speed of the cat / 5
Speed of the turtle = 15 / 5
Speed of the turtle = 3 feet/second

Now, we need to find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. 

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = Speed of the turtle x 40 seconds
Distance = 3 x 40
Distance = 120 feet

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total number of hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we need to first determine how much they need to raise per hour to reach their goal. 

The total amount they need to raise is $6300, and they have already raised $2100 in 3 hours. 

The amount they need to raise in total is $6300 - $2100 = $4200.

Since they need to raise $4200 in the remaining time, and they raise an equal amount in every hour, we can divide the remaining amount by the number of hours they have already worked to find the hourly rate.

However, since we don't know the total number of hours they need to work, we can set up an equation to solve for the total number of hours. Let's call the total number of hours 'x'. 

The amount they raise in 'x' hours is equal to the amount they need to raise, which is $4200. Since they raise an equal amount in every hour, we can set up the equation:

3 hours * (hourly rate) = $2100
x hours * (hourly rate) = $4200

Since the hourly rate is the same in both cases, we can set up a proportion to solve for 'x':

(3 hours) / (x hours) = ($2100) / ($4200)

To solve for 'x', we can cross-multiply:

3 * $4200 = $2100 * x
$12600 = $2100x

Now, we can divide both sides by $2100 to solve for 'x':

x = $12600 / $2100
x = 6

So, the firefighters need to fundraise for 6 more hours to reach their goal. 

The total number of hours they need to fundraise is 3 (hours already worked) + 6 (hours needed to reach goal) = 9 hours.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to first find the percentage of water used by the city and then subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes.

The city uses 40% of the river's water. 

80% of the water used by the city is used for industrial purposes, so the percentage of water used for industrial purposes is 0.8 * 0.4 = 0.32 or 32%.

To find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes from the total percentage used by the city: 0.4 - 0.32 = 0.08 or 8%.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total amount Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring, we need to first calculate the total number of days in 2 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, 2 weeks would have 7 * 2 = 14 days.

Next, we need to multiply the total number of days by the daily rate of $12 to find the total amount charged.

Total amount = Total number of days * Daily rate
Total amount = 14 * $12
Total amount = $168

The final answer is: $168"
"To find the total number of quarts made in 48 hours, we need to calculate the production rate of each type of ice cream and then add them together.

The factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours. To find the production rate per hour, we divide 100 quarts by 2 hours:

100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts per hour (chocolate)

The factory makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours. To find the production rate per hour, we divide 50 quarts by 4 hours:

50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts per hour (vanilla)

Now, we need to find the total production rate per hour for both types of ice cream:

50 quarts per hour (chocolate) + 12.5 quarts per hour (vanilla) = 62.5 quarts per hour

To find the total number of quarts made in 48 hours, we multiply the total production rate per hour by 48:

62.5 quarts per hour * 48 hours = 3000 quarts

The final answer is: 3000"
"To find Marcus' total bill, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he ordered and then apply the 10% discount.

First, let's calculate the total cost of each item:

- 5 croissants at $3.00 apiece: 5 x $3.00 = $15.00
- 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each: 4 x $2.50 = $10.00
- 3 mini quiches at $4.00 apiece: 3 x $4.00 = $12.00
- 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 apiece: 13 x $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items: $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Since Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him 10% off his purchase, we need to calculate the discount amount: 10% of $50.00 = 0.10 x $50.00 = $5.00

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total cost: $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

The final answer is: $45.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many scoops Erin can buy with her $6.00, considering the deal of buy 2 scoops and get 1 free.

First, let's calculate the cost of 2 scoops of ice cream: 2 * $1.50 = $3.00.

Since Erin gets 1 scoop free for every 2 scoops she buys, the effective cost per 3 scoops is $3.00.

Now, let's divide Erin's total budget by the effective cost per 3 scoops: $6.00 / $3.00 = 2.

This means Erin can buy 2 sets of 3 scoops, which is a total of 6 scoops.

However, we need to consider the deal, which states that Erin gets 1 scoop free for every 2 scoops she buys. So, for every 2 scoops she buys, she gets 3 scoops. 

Since Erin can buy 2 sets of 3 scoops, she will get 2 sets of 1 free scoop, making it a total of 6 scoops + 2 free scoops = 8 scoops.

Therefore, Erin should buy 6 scoops of ice cream to get 2 free scoops.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how much more candy Amy has after two weeks, we need to calculate the total amount of candy each person eats in two weeks and subtract the difference from the initial amount.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces.

Initially, both Ginger and Amy had 100 pieces of candy. After two weeks, Ginger has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces, and Amy has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces.

The difference in the amount of candy Amy has compared to Ginger is 58 - 44 = 14 pieces.

"To find the total number of tiles needed, we first need to calculate the area of two-thirds of the bathroom. 

The area of the entire bathroom is 36 sq ft. To find two-thirds of this area, we multiply 36 by 2/3.

36 * (2/3) = 36 * 2 / 3 = 72 / 3 = 24

So, two-thirds of the bathroom is 24 sq ft. 

Since Mr. Boarden needs 24 tiles per square foot, we multiply the area of two-thirds of the bathroom by 24.

24 * 24 = 576

Therefore, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two-thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom.

576"
"To find out how much James saved, we need to calculate the cost of buying the blueberries at the store and compare it to the cost of picking them.

First, let's calculate the cost of picking the blueberries:

Cost of picking = $20 (initial cost) + ($1.5 per pound * 30 pounds)
Cost of picking = $20 + $45
Cost of picking = $65

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying the blueberries at the store:

Cost of buying at the store = $2.5 per pound * 30 pounds
Cost of buying at the store = $75

To find out how much James saved, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying at the store:

Amount saved = Cost of buying at the store - Cost of picking
Amount saved = $75 - $65
Amount saved = $10

The final answer is: $10"
"To find the total amount of money the company paid, we first need to calculate the new price of each computer. 

The original price of each computer was $700. Since the price increased by 10%, we need to find 10% of $700 and add it to the original price.

10% of $700 = 0.1 * $700 = $70

New price of each computer = Original price + Increase in price
= $700 + $70
= $770

Now, we can find the total amount of money the company paid by multiplying the new price of each computer by the number of computers they bought.

Total amount = New price of each computer * Number of computers
= $770 * 500

2 oz of cheese * 120 calories per oz = 240 calories
2 oz of ham * 40 calories per oz = 80 calories
Total calories from cheese and ham = 240 + 80 = 320 calories

Now, let's add the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham to get the total calories in the omelet:
450 (eggs) + 320 (cheese and ham) = 770 calories

The total calories in the omelet is 770.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of slices eaten and subtract it from the total number of slices available.

First, let's find out how many slices Bryce and two friends ate. Since there are 5 people in total, and 3 of them ate 2/3 of their pizzas, we can calculate the total number of slices they ate as follows:

3 people * 2/3 * 12 slices/person = 8 slices/person * 3 people = 24 slices

However, this is not the total number of slices eaten, as the two remaining friends also ate some. We need to calculate the number of slices they ate as well.

The two remaining friends ate Â¾ of their pizzas, which is equivalent to 6/4 or 1.5 pizzas. Since each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices they ate is:

2 friends * 1.5 pizzas/friend * 12 slices/pizza = 36 slices

Now, we can find the total number of slices eaten by adding the slices eaten by Bryce and his friends to the slices eaten by the two remaining friends:

24 slices + 36 slices = 60 slices

Since there are 5 friends in total, and each ordered 1 pizza, the total number of slices available is:

5 friends * 12 slices/friend = 60 slices

Now, we can find the number of slices left by subtracting the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices available:

60 slices - 60 slices = 0 slices

"To find the average time the cat and dog take to eat the sausages, we first need to determine the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages.

The cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes. Since the dog eats the same number of sausages in 2/3 the amount of time the cat takes, we can calculate the dog's time as follows:

Dog's time = (2/3) * Cat's time
Dog's time = (2/3) * 30 minutes
Dog's time = 20 minutes

Now, we have the time taken by both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages:

Cat's time = 30 minutes
Dog's time = 20 minutes

To find the average time, we add the times taken by both the cat and the dog and divide by 2:

Average time = (Cat's time + Dog's time) / 2
Average time = (30 + 20) / 2
Average time = 50 / 2
Average time = 25 minutes

"To solve this problem, we need to first convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

8 feet * 12 inches/foot = 96 inches
Adding the 4 inches, we get:
96 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 100 inches, and it is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's represent the length of one of Bobby's shoes as 'x'. Then, we can write the equation:

100 = 9x + 10

Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation gives us:

90 = 9x

"To find the total number of windows smashed by Hannah, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed from students' cars and teachers' cars separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of windows smashed from students' cars. There are 64 students' cars with 4 windows each. A quarter of the students' cars' windows are smashed, which is 1/4 * 64 = 16 cars. Since each car has 4 windows, the total number of windows smashed from students' cars is 16 * 4 = 64.

Next, let's find the number of windows smashed from teachers' cars. There are 32 teachers' cars with 2 windows each. Three-fourths of the teachers' cars' windows are smashed, which is 3/4 * 32 = 24 cars. Since each car has 2 windows, the total number of windows smashed from teachers' cars is 24 * 2 = 48.

Now, let's add the number of windows smashed from students' cars and teachers' cars to find the total number of windows smashed by Hannah. 64 (students' cars) + 48 (teachers' cars) = 112.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the ages of Dora's father and mother.

Given that Dora is 15 years old, we can find her father's age by using the information that her father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. 

Let's denote Dora's father's age as F and Dora's age as D. We have the equation: F = 2D + 8. Since Dora is 15 years old, we can substitute D = 15 into the equation to find F.

F = 2(15) + 8
F = 30 + 8
F = 38

Now that we know Dora's father is 38 years old, we can find her mother's age. We are given that Dora's mother is four years younger than her father. 

Let's denote Dora's mother's age as M. We have the equation: M = F - 4. Since F = 38, we can substitute F into the equation to find M.

M = 38 - 4
M = 34

Now that we know Dora's age (15), her father's age (38), and her mother's age (34), we can calculate the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother.

Total combined age = D + F + M
Total combined age = 15 + 38 + 34
Total combined age = 87

Beck's initial apples = 77

Now, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. So, Beck's new number of apples is:

Beck's new apples = Beck's initial apples + 10
Beck's new apples = 77 + 10
Beck's new apples = 87

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris. Boris still has 100 apples, and Beck has 87 apples. So, the difference is:

Difference = Boris's apples - Beck's new apples
Difference = 100 - 87
Difference = 13

Therefore, Beck has 13 fewer apples than Boris now.

"To find out how many ounces of water Peter has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and then subtract that from the total amount of water available (32 ounces).

For giant cubes: 3 cubes * 4 ounces/cube = 12 ounces
For medium cubes: 7 cubes * 2 ounces/cube = 14 ounces
For small cubes: 8 cubes * 0.5 ounces/cube = 4 ounces

Total water used = 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces

Now, subtract the total water used from the total amount of water available: 
32 ounces - 30 ounces = 2 ounces

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many books Steven has. Since Clara has two times as many books as Steven and Clara has 20 books, we can set up the equation:

2 * Steven's books = 20

To find Steven's books, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

Steven's books = 20 / 2
Steven's books = 10

Now that we know Steven has 10 books, we can find out how many books Alice has. Since Alice has 6 more books than Steven, we add 6 to Steven's books:

Alice's books = Steven's books + 6
Alice's books = 10 + 6
Alice's books = 16

Now that we know Alice has 16 books and Clara has 20 books, we can find out how many more books Clara has than Alice:

Difference = Clara's books - Alice's books
Difference = 20 - 16
Difference = 4

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of students who like to play music. We are given that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number who like to play basketball. Since 5 students like to play basketball, the number of students who like to play music is 2 * 5 = 10.

We know that the total number of students is 50, and 10 like to bake, 5 like to play basketball, and 10 like to play music. To find the number of students who like to play video games, we need to subtract the number of students who like to bake, play basketball, and play music from the total number of students.

Number of students who like to play video games = Total number of students - (Number of students who like to bake + Number of students who like to play basketball + Number of students who like to play music)
= 50 - (10 + 5 + 10)
= 50 - 25

"To find the number of boys in each class, we first need to determine the total number of girls in both classes. Since 40% of the students in each class are girls, and there are 80 students in total, we can set up an equation to find the number of students in each class.

Let x be the number of students in each class. Since there are two classes, the total number of students is 2x. We know that 40% of the students in each class are girls, so the number of girls in each class is 0.4x. Since there are two classes, the total number of girls is 2(0.4x) = 0.8x.

We know that the total number of students is 80, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 80

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 2:

x = 80 / 2
x = 40

So, there are 40 students in each class. Now, we can find the number of boys in each class. Since 40% of the students are girls, 60% are boys. The number of boys in each class is 0.6x = 0.6(40) = 24.

The final answer is: 24"

"To calculate Mark's profit, we need to first determine the total cost of the packs and the total value of the cards he obtained.

The total cost of the packs is 3 packs * $1800 per pack = $5400.

The total value of the cards he obtained is $4000 (1 card) + $1000 (1 card) + (30 cards * $50 per card) = $4000 + $1000 + $1500 = $6500.

The total value of the cards is greater than the cost of the packs, so Mark made a profit. To find the profit, we subtract the cost of the packs from the total value of the cards: $6500 - $5400 = $1100.

"To find out how much money the tomato vendor saves a week, we need to first calculate the daily savings and then multiply it by 7.

The vendor used to buy 500 tomatoes a day at $.5 each, so his daily cost was 500 * $.5 = $250.

With the new vendor, he buys the same 500 tomatoes at $.4 each, so his new daily cost is 500 * $.4 = $200.

The daily savings is the difference between the old cost and the new cost: $250 - $200 = $50.

To find the weekly savings, we multiply the daily savings by 7: $50 * 7 = $350.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 

90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers. Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons from trading her small stickers.

2. Now, Lorraine has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

3. She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers. Since each large sticker is worth a large button, she gets 20 large buttons from trading her large stickers.

4. Now, Lorraine has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

5. She trades the rest of her large stickers (20) for small buttons. Since each large sticker is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons from trading her large stickers.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house as x. Since the first house needs 1/2 of the second house, the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house is x/2.

We are given that the third house needs double the first house, so the number of cases of shingles needed for the third house is 2 * (x/2) = x.

We know that the total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x/2 + x + x = 250

Combine like terms:

(3x)/2 = 250

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

3x = 500

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 500/3
x = 166.67

Since x represents the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house, we can find the number of cases of shingles needed for the third house by substituting x into the expression we derived earlier: x = x. However, we know that the third house needs double the first house, which is x/2. So the third house needs 2 * (x/2) = x. Since x = 166.67, the third house needs 166.67 * 2 = 333.33. However, since we can't have a fraction of a case of shingles, we round down to the nearest whole number.

Since Mike can buy these movies for $6 each, the cost of the movies in series is:

Cost of movies in series = 200 * $6 = $1200

Next, let's find the number of older movies. 40% of the remaining movies (after removing the movies in series) are older movies. The number of remaining movies is:

Number of remaining movies = 600 - 200 = 400

Number of older movies = 40% of 400 = 0.4 * 400 = 160

The cost of the older movies is:

Cost of older movies = 160 * $5 = $800

Now, let's find the number of remaining movies that are not in series and not older movies. This is:

Number of remaining movies = 400 - 160 = 240

The cost of these movies is:

Cost of remaining movies = 240 * $10 = $2400

The total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection is the sum of the cost of the movies in series, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the remaining movies:

Total cost = $1200 + $800 + $2400 = $4400

The final answer is: $4400"

"To find the distance to the vacation spot, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by the Llesis family. 

First, let's find the speed at which they hiked. They drove at an average of 50 miles per hour. Half of that speed is 50 / 2 = 25 miles per hour. Since they hiked 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed, their hiking speed is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

Now, let's calculate the distance they drove. They drove for 6 hours at 50 miles per hour, so the distance driven is 6 * 50 = 300 miles.

Next, let's calculate the distance they hiked. They hiked for 1.5 hours at 20 miles per hour, so the distance hiked is 1.5 * 20 = 30 miles.

The total distance to the vacation spot is the sum of the distance driven and the distance hiked, which is 300 + 30 = 330 miles.

The final answer is: 330"
"To find the difference in their scores, we need to calculate the points each of them earns from enemies, berries, and the timer.

Let's assume Emma's score from enemies is x. Since Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, Ava's score from enemies will be x + 8.

Emma's score from berries is 3 (since she collects 3 berries), and Ava collects 3 + 3 = 6 berries.

Now, let's consider the timer. The points from the timer are calculated as 30 points per second. If Emma finishes the level 4 seconds faster than Ava, Ava will have 4 fewer seconds on the timer. Let's assume Emma finishes the level in t seconds. Then, Ava finishes the level in t + 4 seconds.

Emma's score from the timer is 30t, and Ava's score from the timer is 30(t + 4).

The total score for Emma is x + 3 + 30t, and the total score for Ava is x + 8 + 6 + 30(t + 4).

Since we want to find the difference between their scores, we can simplify the expression:

Difference = (x + 8 + 6 + 30(t + 4)) - (x + 3 + 30t)
Difference = 14 + 30t + 120 - 30t
Difference = 134

The final answer is: $\boxed{134}$"
"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we first need to determine the total cost of the two pizzas that are already known. 

The two pizzas that cost 30 dollars each will be 2 x 30 = 60 dollars.

Now, we subtract the cost of these two pizzas from the total cost of all four pizzas to find the cost of the other two pizzas. 

Total cost of all four pizzas = 64 dollars
Cost of the two known pizzas = 60 dollars
Cost of the other two pizzas = Total cost of all four pizzas - Cost of the two known pizzas
Cost of the other two pizzas = 64 - 60
Cost of the other two pizzas = 4 dollars

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the total cost of the other two pizzas by 2 to find the cost of each pizza.

Cost of each pizza = Cost of the other two pizzas / 2
Cost of each pizza = 4 / 2
Cost of each pizza = 2 dollars

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes on usual days and the two extra days.

On usual days, they ride thrice a day for 5 days. So, the total number of times they ride on usual days is 3 * 5 = 15.

On the two extra days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, which is 2 * 3 = 6 times per day. Since there are two extra days, the total number of times they ride on these days is 6 * 2 = 12.

Now, we add the total number of times they ride on usual days and the two extra days to get the total number of times they ride in a week. 

15 (usual days) + 12 (extra days) = 27

The final answer is: 27"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Bob had 7 fish in his pond, with 3 being orange and 4 being white.

Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as 'x'. Since he bought a total of 17 fish, the number of orange fish he bought is 17 - x.

After adding the new fish to his pond, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. This means the total number of orange fish is 2 times the total number of white fish.

The total number of orange fish in the pond is the sum of the initial orange fish (3) and the orange fish Bob bought (17 - x). This can be expressed as 3 + (17 - x).

The total number of white fish in the pond is the sum of the initial white fish (4) and the white fish Bob bought (x). This can be expressed as 4 + x.

Since Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up the equation:

3 + (17 - x) = 2(4 + x)

Simplifying the equation:

3 + 17 - x = 8 + 2x

Combine like terms:

20 - x = 8 + 2x

Add x to both sides:

20 = 8 + 3x

Subtract 8 from both sides:

12 = 3x

Divide both sides by 3:

4 = x

So, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

The final answer is: 4"
"To calculate the weekly fuel consumption, we need to determine the total miles driven per week and then divide it by the car's fuel efficiency.

The one-way distance between home and office is 5 miles, and Andy drives to and from work, so the total distance per day is 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles.

Since Andy drives to work from Monday to Friday, the total miles driven per week is 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.

Now, we can calculate the fuel consumption per week by dividing the total miles driven by the car's fuel efficiency: 50 miles/week / 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week.

The price of regular gas is $3/gallon, so the weekly fuel cost is 5 gallons/week * $3/gallon = $15/week.

The final answer is: $15"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Carrie received and then subtract the amount she spent.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie received:

- 10 twenties = 10 x $20 = $200
- 140 quarters = 140 x $0.25 = $35

Total amount of money = $200 + $35 = $235

Carrie spent all the quarters, which is $35, and 3/5 of the twenties. To find 3/5 of the twenties, we multiply $200 by 3/5:

3/5 x $200 = (3 x $200) / 5 = $600 / 5 = $120

Carrie spent $120 from the twenties and $35 from the quarters, for a total of:

$120 + $35 = $155

The total amount of money Carrie paid for lunch is $155.

The final answer is: $155"

"To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we first need to determine the total percentage of smart TVs and analog TVs sold. 

One-fourth of the TVs are smart TVs, which is 1/4 or 25%. One-eighth of the TVs are analog TVs, which is 1/8 or 12.5%. 

The total percentage of smart TVs and analog TVs sold is 25% + 12.5% = 37.5%. 

Since the rest of the TVs are OLED, we subtract the total percentage of smart and analog TVs from 100% to find the percentage of OLED TVs: 100% - 37.5% = 62.5%.

Now, we can find the number of OLED TVs sold by multiplying the total number of TVs sold (40) by the percentage of OLED TVs (62.5% or 0.625): 40 * 0.625 = 25.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how much money John is missing, we need to first determine how much the school will cover and then subtract that from the total cost of the trip. 

The school will cover half the cost of the trip, which is $300 / 2 = $150. 

Since John already has $50, we need to subtract the amount the school will cover and the amount John has from the total cost of the trip to find out how much more money he needs. 

$300 (total cost) - $150 (school's contribution) - $50 (John's contribution) = $100.

John is missing $100.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the temperature at night and then calculate how many logs Carson needs to burn to raise the temperature to 32 degrees.

First, let's find the temperature at night: 
Temperature at night = Temperature during the day - 33 degrees
Temperature at night = 45 - 33
Temperature at night = 12 degrees

Since the pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees, Carson needs to raise the temperature from 12 degrees to 32 degrees. 
Temperature to be raised = 32 - 12
Temperature to be raised = 20 degrees

Each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees. To find the number of logs needed, we divide the temperature to be raised by the temperature increase per log:
Number of logs = Temperature to be raised / Temperature increase per log
Number of logs = 20 / 5
Number of logs = 4

"To find the total number of seashells brought back, we first need to determine the number of groups formed and then calculate the number of groups that brought back seashells.

Since 90 people were split into 9-person groups, we can find the number of groups by dividing 90 by 9.

Number of groups = 90 / 9 = 10

Now, we know that 3/5 of the groups brought back seashells. To find the number of groups that brought back seashells, we multiply the total number of groups by 3/5.

Number of groups with seashells = 10 * (3/5) = 6

Each group that brought back seashells had 2 seashells. To find the total number of seashells, we multiply the number of groups with seashells by 2.

Total seashells = 6 * 2 = 12

"To find out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we need to calculate their total earnings for 20 hours of work.

Billy's initial hourly wage was $10. After 2 months, he got a raise of $0.50 per hour, making his new hourly wage $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. On his first anniversary, he got another raise of $1.00 per hour, making his final hourly wage $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50.

Billy's total earnings for 20 hours of work at $11.50 per hour is 20 * $11.50 = $230.

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary, which was $10. So, Sally's starting salary is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. 

Sally's total earnings for 20 hours of work at $10.50 per hour is 20 * $10.50 = $210.

"To find the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of stuffed animals she currently has. 

Bubbles has 3 stuffed puppies, 5 stuffed koalas, 2 stuffed zebras, and 4 stuffed frogs. 

Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Now, we need to find 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. 

30% of 14 = 0.3 * 14 = 4.2

Since Bubbles can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, we round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we are looking for the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy to reach 30% of the total, so we will round down to the nearest whole number. 

However, since 4.2 is closer to 4 than 5, we will round down to 4. 

But, we need to find out how many stuffed goats she needs to buy to make 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. 

Let's assume the number of stuffed goats she buys is x. 

The total number of stuffed animals after buying x stuffed goats will be 14 + x. 

We want 30% of the total number of stuffed animals to be x, so we can set up the equation: 

0.3(14 + x) = x

Now, we can solve for x: 

0.3(14 + x) = x
4.2 + 0.3x = x
4.2 = x - 0.3x
4.2 = 0.7x
x = 4.2 / 0.7
x = 6

So, Bubbles needs to buy 6 stuffed goats to make 30% of her stuffed animals.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total hours Kris has played and subtract that from the total hours required for the achievement.

First, let's calculate the hours Kris played in the first 2 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, 2 weeks is 2 * 7 = 14 days. If Kris plays for half an hour every day, she plays 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours in the first 2 weeks.

Next, let's calculate the hours Kris played in the next week. If Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week, she plays 7 * 2 = 14 hours in the next week.

Now, let's add the hours Kris played in both periods: 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours.

Since Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement, we subtract the hours she has already played from the total hours required: 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

Therefore, Kris still needs to play 9 hours to earn the achievement.

The final answer is: 9"

"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school.

First, let's find the number of students who passed in each grade:

- Third grade: 340 students passed
- Fourth grade: 40 students passed
- Fifth grade: Since the pass rate for the fifth grade is twice the pass rate of the fourth grade, and the fourth grade has a pass rate of 40/100, the fifth grade's pass rate is 2 * (40/100) = 80/100. Therefore, the number of students who passed in the fifth grade is 80/100 * 400 = 320 students.

Now, let's find the total number of students who passed: 340 + 40 + 320 = 700 students.

Next, let's find the total number of students in the school: 500 (third grade) + 100 (fourth grade) + 400 (fifth grade) = 1000 students.

"To find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we first need to determine how many square inches of mosaic he can make with the glass chips he has. 

Since it takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic, and each bag holds 72 chips, we need to find out how many chips Milo has in total. 

Milo has 2 bags of glass chips, so he has 2 * 72 = 144 chips.

Since it takes 12 chips to make 1 square inch, we can divide the total number of chips by 12 to find out how many square inches Milo can make: 144 / 12 = 12 square inches.

Since Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall, and he can make 12 square inches of mosaic, we can find the length of the mosaic by dividing the total square inches by the height: 12 square inches / 3 inches = 4 inches.

Therefore, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long.

"To find the total amount of tea consumed, we need to calculate the amount of tea each group of students drank and add them together.

Four students drank 1.5 quarts each, so the total amount of tea they drank is 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts.

16 students drank 2 quarts each, so the total amount of tea they drank is 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

The total amount of tea consumed is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 10 quarts of tea left, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is 38 + 10 = 48 quarts.

To convert quarts to gallons, we know that 1 gallon is equal to 4 quarts. 

So, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party in gallons is 48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

Additionally, they dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground, so the total number of marshmallows used or dropped is 18 + 3 = 21.

The initial number of marshmallows in the bag was 35. To find the number of marshmallows left, we subtract the total number of marshmallows used or dropped from the initial number: 35 - 21 = 14.

Since there are 14 marshmallows left, and there are two kids, we need to divide the remaining marshmallows by 2 to find out how many each kid can have: 14 / 2 = 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time each person plays and then determine how many quarters are used.

Jack plays for 4 hours, which is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes. Since he can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter, he uses 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.

One of his friends is significantly worse and can play for half as long as Jack, so they play for 240 / 2 = 120 minutes. This friend uses 120 / 20 = 6 quarters.

The other two friends are significantly better and can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they play for 240 * 1.5 = 360 minutes. Each of them uses 360 / 20 = 18 quarters.

Since there are two friends who play for 360 minutes, they use a total of 2 * 18 = 36 quarters.

The total number of quarters used is 12 (by Jack) + 6 (by the worse friend) + 36 (by the better friends) = 54 quarters.

The final answer is: 54"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote the amount of citrus zest as Z, the amount of fragrance as F, the amount of salt as S, the amount of sugar as S (since it's the same as salt), and the amount of oil as O.

We know that Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, so F = Z.

We also know that she uses twice as much salt as zest, so S = 2Z.

Since she uses twice as much oil as salt, O = 2S.

Substituting S = 2Z into O = 2S, we get O = 2(2Z) = 4Z.

We know that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, and it's made up of Z + F + S + S + O. Since F = Z and S = 2Z, we can substitute these values in:

Z + Z + 2Z + 2Z + 4Z = 10

Combine like terms:

10Z = 10

Divide both sides by 10:

Z = 1

Now that we know Z = 1, we can find O = 4Z:

O = 4(1) = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total amount of money John spent, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows separately and then add them together.

The cost of the goats is 3 * $500 = $1500.
The cost of the cows is 2 * $1500 = $3000.

Now, we add the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows together: $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

The final answer is: $4500"
"To find out how many more cupcakes Paul needs to buy, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs.

Total cupcakes needed = 63
Cupcakes already have = 8 (chocolate) + 40 (toffee) = 48

Now, subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs:
63 - 48 = 15

Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

2. Joe sells 20% of his cars. 20% of 40 is 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars.

3. Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

4. In total, Joe sold 8 cars and gave away 16 cars. So, he gave away a total of 8 + 16 = 24 cars.

5. To find out how many cars Joe has left, we subtract the total number of cars he gave away from his initial number of cars: 40 - 24 = 16.

Therefore, Joe remains with 16 cars after selling and giving some to his mother.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to first determine the total amount raised by the students. Since the charity raised a total of $175,000 and $50,000 came from organizations, the amount raised by the students is $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000.

Now, we know that there are 20 students and they all raised the same amount. To find out how much each student raised, we divide the total amount raised by the number of students: $125,000 / 20 = $6,250.

The final answer is: $6,250"
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the first day and the second day, and then add them together.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. 

On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she walked on the first day, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

To find the total time in minutes, we need to convert the hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes
4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes

Total time = 480 minutes + 240 minutes = 720 minutes

The final answer is: 720"
"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to first determine the total number of cars in the parking lot after the first break. 

Initially, there were 50 cars. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, so the total number of cars after the first break is 50 + 20 = 70.

When Hunter got out of class for the lunch break, he realized that 1/2 the number of cars in the parking lot had gone. This means that 1/2 of 70 cars left, and the remaining 1/2 stayed. 

To find the number of cars that left, we multiply 70 by 1/2: 70 * 1/2 = 35. 

Since 1/2 of the cars left, the remaining 1/2 stayed. Therefore, the number of cars that stayed is also 35.

Now, to find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to add the number of cars that left and the number of cars that stayed. However, the question asks for the total number of cars he counted during the lunch break, which is the number of cars that stayed plus the number of cars that left. 

So, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is 35 (cars that stayed) + 35 (cars that left) = 70.

The final answer is: 70"
"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of tasks he completes in a day and then multiply it by the number of days he works in a week.

John does 30 cycles of work a day, and each cycle has 5 different tasks. So, the total number of tasks he completes in a day is:
30 cycles/day * 5 tasks/cycle = 150 tasks/day

Since each task pays $1.20, the total amount John makes in a day is:
150 tasks/day * $1.20/task = $180/day

John works a full 7-day week, so the total amount he makes in a week is:
$180/day * 7 days/week = $1260/week

"To find the total points scored by Sasha, we need to calculate her points in both games. 

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. 

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points in the first game. 

Now, we know Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game, so Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

To find the total points scored by Sasha, we add her points from both games: 14 (first game) + 4 (second game) = 18 points.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the total number of tins of cat food, we multiply the number of packages of cat food by the number of tins per package: 8 * 11 = 88 tins of cat food.

To find the total number of tins of dog food, we multiply the number of packages of dog food by the number of tins per package: 6 * 6 = 36 tins of dog food.

To find the difference between the number of tins of cat food and dog food, we subtract the number of tins of dog food from the number of tins of cat food: 88 - 36 = 52.

"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as 'x'. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know that the total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find the number of cards Smendrick has:

Smendrick has 3x = 3 * 47 = 141 cards

And Becca has 12 more than Smendrick:

Becca has 141 + 12 = 153 cards

"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color of eggs and then add them together.

Cindy had 5 green eggs.

She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.

She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.

She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had (1/3) * 9 = 3 yellow eggs.

To find the total number of eggs, we add the number of each color together: 5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27.

"To calculate the total cost of shipping, we need to calculate the cost per pound and the cost per mile, then multiply them by their respective weights and distances. 

The cost per pound is $0.35, and the book weighs 4 pounds, so the cost for the weight is 4 * $0.35 = $1.40. 

The cost per mile is $0.08, and the distance is 20 miles, so the cost for the distance is 20 * $0.08 = $1.60.

The total shipping cost is $1.40 + $1.60 = $2.00.

The refund for the book is 75% of the purchase price, which is 0.75 * $32 = $24.

Milly will lose the shipping cost minus the refund, which is $2.00 - $24 = -$22.00. However, since you can't lose a negative amount of money, we need to recalculate the loss by taking the absolute value of the refund and adding it to the shipping cost. 

The loss is $2.00 + $8.00 = $10.00.

The final answer is: $10."
"To find out how much money Mulan has left, we need to calculate the total amount of money she spent and subtract it from the initial amount she had, including the money her father gave her.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Mulan had initially: $40 (initial money) + $100 (money from her father) = $140.

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money she spent: 2 pairs of jeans at $30 each = 2 x $30 = $60, and a bag for $20. So, the total amount spent is $60 + $20 = $80.

Now, let's subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $140 - $80 = $60.

"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the production for the first three weeks and then determine the pattern.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.

In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.

In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Now, let's calculate the total production for the first three weeks: 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in a month, we can find out how much he produces in the fourth week by subtracting the total production of the first three weeks from the total monthly production: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000.

"To calculate the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends per week and then multiply it by 4.

First, let's calculate the time Britany spends on TikTok per week:

- She records 18 videos, each taking 4 minutes. So, the total time spent recording videos per week is 18 * 4 = 72 minutes.
- She spends 2 hours (120 minutes) writing amateur songs per week.
- She spends 15 minutes per day, 6 days a week, doing her makeup. So, the total time spent on makeup per week is 15 * 6 = 90 minutes.

Total time spent on TikTok per week = 72 + 120 + 90 = 282 minutes.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total time spent on TikTok in a month is:
282 * 4 = 1128 minutes.

"To calculate the total cost, we need to first determine the cost of the initial installation and then add the cost of the additional items.

The initial installation includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. However, Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures that she needs installed. Since the initial installation already includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, and 1 chandelier, we only need to consider the additional items.

Angela has 6 - 4 = 2 additional mirrors, 2 - 1 = 1 additional chandelier, and 20 - 10 = 10 additional pictures.

The cost of the additional items is 2 mirrors * $15.00 = $30.00, 1 chandelier * $15.00 = $15.00, and 10 pictures * $15.00 = $150.00.

The total cost of the additional items is $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00.

The initial installation cost is $129.00. Therefore, the total cost for Angela is $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00.

1. Eva has saved $20.00.
2. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, so Anthony has saved $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.
3. Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we multiply $30.00 by 0.40, which is $12.00.
4. To find Roy's total savings, we add the 40% more to Anthony's savings: $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the ratio of Naruto's lifting ability to Pompei's lifting ability. 

First, we know that Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift 12 * 1 = 12 inches.

Next, we know that Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Then, we know that Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches). 

480 / 12 = 40 feet.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the time it takes for one kangaroo to travel across the highway. Since three kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, one kangaroo would take 18 hours multiplied by 3, which equals 54 hours.

Now, we know that the turtles travel at half the speed of a kangaroo. Therefore, if one kangaroo takes 54 hours to travel across the highway, four turtles traveling at half the speed would take 54 hours multiplied by 2, which equals 108 hours.

However, since there are four turtles, we need to divide the total time by 4 to get the time it takes for one turtle to travel across the highway. But in this case, we are looking for the total time it takes for four turtles to travel, not the time it takes for one turtle. So, the total time for four turtles is 108 hours.

"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has after receiving her payment and her mom's contribution, and then subtract the amount she still needs to buy the laptop.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Erika has after receiving her payment and her mom's contribution: $150 (payment) + $80 (mom's contribution) = $230.

Since the price of the new laptop is reduced by $200 when she trades in her old laptop, the new price of the laptop is $600 - $200 = $400.

Erika now only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, so we can set up the equation: $230 (total money) + $50 (extra money needed) = $400 (new price of the laptop).

Now, let's solve for the extra money needed: $50 = $400 - $230. 

However, we are looking for the total money Erika has in her purse, not the extra money needed. We can set up the equation as follows: $X (total money in purse) + $230 (total money received) = $400 (new price of the laptop) - $200 (discount) = $200.

Now, let's solve for X: $X + $230 = $200. 

$X = $200 - $230. 

$X = -$30. 

However, this is not possible since Erika cannot have a negative amount of money in her purse. This means that the initial calculation of the total money received is incorrect.

Let's recalculate the total money Erika has after receiving her payment and her mom's contribution: $230 (total money received) - $50 (extra money needed) = $180.

Since the price of the new laptop is reduced by $200 when she trades in her old laptop, the new price of the laptop is $600 - $200 = $400.

Erika now only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, so we can set up the equation: $X (total money in purse) + $180 (total money received) = $400 (new price of the laptop).

Now, let's solve for X: $X + $180 = $400.

$X = $400 - $180.

$X = $220.

"To determine how many cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to calculate the total amount of milk the farmer currently produces. 

The farmer extracts 5 liters of milk a day from each cow, and he has 3 cows. 

Current milk production = 5 liters/cow * 3 cows = 15 liters/day

Since the farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we need to find out how many more cows are required to reach this goal.

Additional milk needed = 25 liters/day - 15 liters/day = 10 liters/day

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, we need to find out how many cows are required to produce 10 liters of milk a day.

Number of additional cows needed = 10 liters/day / 5 liters/cow = 2 cows

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the unused portion of each glue stick and add them together.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, which means 5/6 is used. Since the original length is 12 mm, the used portion is (5/6) * 12 = 10 mm. The unused portion is 12 - 10 = 2 mm.

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, which means 1/3 is used. The used portion is (1/3) * 12 = 4 mm. The unused portion is 12 - 4 = 8 mm.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, which means 1/2 is used. The used portion is (1/2) * 12 = 6 mm. The unused portion is 12 - 6 = 6 mm.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of socks and dishes each person has. 

Let's start with Jack. We know that Jack collected 60 dishes. Since Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, we can find the number of socks Jack has by dividing the number of dishes by 2.

Number of socks Jack has = 60 / 2 = 30

Now, we know that Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. So, the number of socks Peter has is:

Number of socks Peter has = 2 * 30 = 60

We also know that Peter has half as many dishes as Jack. So, the number of dishes Peter has is:

Number of dishes Peter has = 60 / 2 = 30

Now, we can find the total number of socks and dishes they have together by adding the number of socks and dishes each person has.

Total number of socks = 30 (Jack) + 60 (Peter) = 90
Total number of dishes = 60 (Jack) + 30 (Peter) = 90

The total number of socks and dishes they have together is 90 + 90 = 180."
"To find the number of students good at math, we need to consider the total number of students and the number of students good at both subjects. 

Let's denote the number of students good at both math and English as x. We know that the total number of students is 20, and the number of students good at math only is 5, and the number of students good at English only is 8.

We can set up the equation: 5 (math only) + 8 (English only) + x (both) = 20 (total)

Simplifying the equation, we get: 13 + x = 20

Subtracting 13 from both sides, we get: x = 7

This means that 7 students are good at both math and English. To find the total number of students good at math, we need to add the number of students good at math only (5) and the number of students good at both subjects (7).

Total number of students good at math = 5 (math only) + 7 (both) = 12

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that half of the white shirts have collars. Since there are 40 white shirts, half of them would be 40 / 2 = 20 white shirts with collars. This means that the remaining white shirts without collars would be 40 - 20 = 20.

Next, we are given that 20 of the floral shirts have buttons. Since there are 50 floral shirts in total, the number of floral shirts without buttons would be 50 - 20 = 30.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of floral shirts without buttons and the number of white shirts without collars. The difference would be 30 (floral shirts without buttons) - 20 (white shirts without collars) = 10.

From Farm Y, he sold twice as many goats as from Farm X, which is 2 * 10 = 20 goats.

Now, let's calculate the number of goats left in each farm:
- Farm X: 55 - 10 = 45 goats
- Farm Y: 45 - 20 = 25 goats

To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the number of goats in Farm X and Farm Y:
45 (Farm X) + 25 (Farm Y) = 70 goats

The final answer is: 70"
"To find the average cost of each pair of shoes, we need to divide the total amount spent on shoes per year by the number of pairs purchased per year.

First, let's calculate the number of pairs James buys per year: 2 pairs/month * 12 months/year = 24 pairs/year.

Now, let's divide the total amount spent on shoes per year by the number of pairs purchased per year: $2640/year Ã· 24 pairs/year = $110/pair.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food, then subtract the discount for the red baskets.

The cost of 3 baskets of green food is 3 x $25 = $75.

The cost of 3 baskets of red food is 3 x $18 = $54.

The total cost before discount is $75 + $54 = $129.

Since you get $2 off for each basket of red food, the total discount is 3 x $2 = $6.

The total cost after discount is $129 - $6 = $123.

The final numerical answer is: $123"
"To find the time it takes to clean one-half of the rooms, we first need to determine the number of rooms that is half of 90. 

90 / 2 = 45 rooms

Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, we multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room.

45 rooms * 20 minutes/room = 900 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total number of homes built over the next three years, we need to calculate the number of homes built in each year and then add them together.

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will count the total number of homes built in the first two years and double it. The total number of homes built in the first two years is 12 + 36 = 48. Doubling this amount gives 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

Now, we add the number of homes built in each year: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144.

The final answer is: 144"
"Let's denote my age as 'x'. Since I am three years younger than my brother, my brother's age is 'x + 3'. My sister is 2 years younger than me, so her age is 'x - 2'.

My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, which can be expressed as 3(x + 3) - 1.

The sum of all our ages is 87, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + 3(x + 3) - 1 = 87.

Combine like terms: 5x + 10 + 3x - 1 = 87.

Combine the x terms: 8x + 9 = 87.

Subtract 9 from both sides: 8x = 78.

Divide both sides by 8: x = 9.75.

Since age cannot be a fraction, we need to find the closest integer that satisfies the given conditions. We can test the ages of the family members with x = 10.

If x = 10, then my brother's age is 13, my sister's age is 8, and my mom's age is 38.

10 + 13 + 8 + 38 = 69, which is less than 87.

If x = 11, then my brother's age is 14, my sister's age is 9, and my mom's age is 41.

11 + 14 + 9 + 41 = 75, which is still less than 87.

If x = 12, then my brother's age is 15, my sister's age is 10, and my mom's age is 44.

12 + 15 + 10 + 44 = 81, which is still less than 87.

If x = 13, then my brother's age is 16, my sister's age is 11, and my mom's age is 47.

13 + 16 + 11 + 47 = 87.

Therefore, I am 13 years old.

"To determine the number of packs Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of glue sticks required and then divide that by the number of glue sticks per pack.

Total number of students: 27
Number of glue sticks per student: 2
Total number of glue sticks required: 27 * 2 = 54

Since glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks required by 8 to find the number of packs needed.

Number of packs required: 54 / 8 = 6.75

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he will need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure every student gets 2 glue sticks. Therefore, he will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

"To find the total amount of money Rafaela received, we need to multiply the number of customers by the tip amount each customer gave. 

Number of customers = 40
Tip amount per customer = $20

Total amount Rafaela received = Number of customers * Tip amount per customer
Total amount Rafaela received = 40 * $20
Total amount Rafaela received = $800

Julieta received 10% less money than Rafaela. To find the amount Julieta received, we need to calculate 10% of Rafaela's total and subtract it from Rafaela's total.

10% of Rafaela's total = 0.1 * $800
10% of Rafaela's total = $80

Amount Julieta received = Rafaela's total - 10% of Rafaela's total
Amount Julieta received = $800 - $80
Amount Julieta received = $720

Total amount both received = Rafaela's total + Julieta's total

"To find out how many oranges Jennifer remained with, we need to calculate the total number of oranges given to her children and subtract that from the initial number of oranges she bought.

Jennifer bought 12 oranges. 

She gave her three daughters 2 oranges each, so 3 daughters * 2 oranges = 6 oranges given to daughters.

Her only boy got 3 oranges.

Total oranges given to children = 6 (daughters) + 3 (boy) = 9 oranges.

Now, subtract the total oranges given to children from the initial number of oranges: 12 (initial oranges) - 9 (oranges given to children) = 3 oranges.

Jennifer remained with 3 oranges."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Claire earns 1 badge per month. 
2. Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge than Claire, so Amber earns 1/2 badge per month.
3. Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so Wendy earns 3 badges per month.
4. In a 1-year time frame (12 months), Claire will earn 1 * 12 = 12 badges.
5. Amber will earn 1/2 * 12 = 6 badges in the same time frame.
6. Wendy will earn 3 * 12 = 36 badges in the same time frame.
7. To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns: 36 - 6 = 30.

"To find out how much Paige raised, we need to calculate the total number of slices she baked and sold. 

First, let's find out how many hours she baked. She baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is 5 hours.

Since she can bake 2 loaves per hour, and each hour she baked for 5 hours, she baked a total of 2 * 5 = 10 loaves.

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices is 10 * 8 = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, and there are 80 slices. To find the total amount raised, we multiply the number of slices by the price per slice: 80 * 0.5 = 40 dollars.

"To find the total number of coins Gretchen has, we need to determine the number of silver coins first. 

Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, and Gretchen has 70 gold coins, we can set up an equation to represent the relationship between the number of gold and silver coins. Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. 

The equation would be: x + (x + 30) = 70 (since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, and the total number of gold coins is 70)

Combine like terms: 2x + 30 = 70

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2: x = 20

Now that we know Gretchen has 20 silver coins, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of gold coins and silver coins: 70 (gold coins) + 20 (silver coins) = 90

"To find the number of yellow cars, we need to first determine the number of green and blue cars. 

Let's start with the number of green cars, which is 2 fewer than the number of red cars. Since there are 12 red cars, the number of green cars is 12 - 2 = 10.

Next, we know that the number of blue cars is 3 times the number of green cars. So, the number of blue cars is 3 * 10 = 30.

Now, we know the total number of red, green, and blue cars: 12 (red) + 10 (green) + 30 (blue) = 52.

Since the rink has 75 cars in total, the number of yellow cars can be found by subtracting the total number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars: 75 - 52 = 23.

"To solve this problem, let's start by assigning variables to the number of books each person has. Let's say Anne has x books. Since Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, Sofie has x + 25 books. Since Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, Fawn has x + 12 books.

We know that together, Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have 85 books. We can write an equation to represent this:

x + (x + 25) + (x + 12) = 85

Combine like terms:

3x + 37 = 85

Subtract 37 from both sides:

3x = 48

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 16

Since x represents the number of books Anne has, and Fawn has x + 12 books, Fawn has 16 + 12 = 28 books.

"To find out how many pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he ate on each day and add them together.

On the first day, he ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces. To find 2/5 of 60, we multiply 60 by 2 and divide by 5:
(60 * 2) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

So, on the first day, he ate 24 pieces.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces. To find the remaining pieces after the first two days, we subtract the pieces eaten on the first two days from the total:
60 - 24 - 10 = 26

Now, we need to find 7/13 of 26:
(26 * 7) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14

So, on the third day, he ate 14 pieces.

To find the total number of pieces eaten, we add the pieces eaten on each day:
24 + 10 + 14 = 48

The cost of each bolt is $0.03, and David wants to buy 16 bolts. 

Total cost of bolts = Number of bolts * Cost per bolt
Total cost of bolts = 16 * $0.03
Total cost of bolts = $0.48

Now, we subtract the total cost of the bolts from the initial amount of money David has:

Initial amount of money = $12.48
Total cost of bolts = $0.48
Amount of money left = Initial amount of money - Total cost of bolts
Amount of money left = $12.48 - $0.48
Amount of money left = $12.00

"To find out how much money Isaias bought the chickens for, we first need to determine how many chickens he plans to sell. Since he plans to sell 3/5 of the 300 chickens, we can calculate this as:

3/5 * 300 = 180 chickens

Next, we know that he needs to make a profit of $2000 by selling these chickens at $50 each. To find the total revenue, we multiply the number of chickens by the selling price:

180 chickens * $50/chicken = $9000

Since he wants to make a profit of $2000, we can set up the equation:

Total Revenue - Total Cost = Profit
$9000 - Total Cost = $2000

To find the total cost, we can rearrange the equation:

Total Cost = $9000 - $2000
Total Cost = $7000

Therefore, Isaias bought the chickens for $7000.

"To find out how much money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope, we need to calculate the total amount of money she will receive from selling the rope and then subtract the cost of the new rope.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Sarah will receive from selling the rope:

Length of the rope = 20 meters
Price per meter = $2
Total amount of money = Length of the rope * Price per meter
Total amount of money = 20 * $2
Total amount of money = $40

Next, let's calculate the cost of the new rope:

Length of the new rope = 20 meters (assuming Sarah wants to buy a rope of the same length)
Price per meter of the new rope = $1.5
Cost of the new rope = Length of the new rope * Price per meter of the new rope
Cost of the new rope = 20 * $1.5

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine Melanie's current age. Since in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old, we can subtract 10 from 18 to find her current age.

Current age = 18 - 10 = 8 years

Now, we need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her present age. Let's assume the number of years is 'x'. 

In 'x' years, Melanie's age will be her current age + 'x'. This should be equal to three times her current age.

Current age + x = 3 * Current age

8 + x = 3 * 8

8 + x = 24

"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's find the cost of the chicken. Since each pack of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, and the 5 packs of bacon cost $10, the cost of one pack of bacon is $10 / 5 = $2. Therefore, the cost of one pack of chicken is $2 * 2 = $4. Since Kelly has 6 packs of chicken, the total cost of the chicken is 6 * $4 = $24.

Next, let's find the cost of the strawberries. Each pack of strawberries costs $4, and Kelly has 3 packs, so the total cost of the strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.

Now, let's find the cost of the apples. Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is $4 / 2 = $2. Since Kelly has 7 packs of apples, the total cost of the apples is 7 * $2 = $14.

The total cost of all the items in Kelly's cart is $10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60.

Kelly's budget is $65, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget: $65 - $60 = $5.

"To find the runtime of Elaina's usual concerts, we need to first determine the total runtime of the final concert without the encore. Since the encore is 15 minutes, we subtract that from the total runtime of the final concert.

Total runtime of the final concert = 65 minutes
Runtime of the encore = 15 minutes
Runtime of the final concert without the encore = Total runtime of the final concert - Runtime of the encore
= 65 - 15
= 50 minutes

Since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship:

Runtime of the final concert without the encore = 2 * Runtime of the usual concert
50 = 2 * Runtime of the usual concert
To find the runtime of the usual concert, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

Runtime of the usual concert = 50 / 2
= 25 minutes

First, Jerry counts 6 birds nesting in the bushes.

Next, 2/3rd of 6 birds are flying overhead. To find 2/3rd of 6, we multiply 6 by 2 and divide by 3: (6 * 2) / 3 = 12 / 3 = 4. So, 4 birds are flying overhead.

Then, Jerry sees 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. To find the total number of birds in these groups, we multiply 8 by 3: 8 * 3 = 24.

Now, we add the number of birds in each group together: 6 (nesting) + 4 (flying) + 24 (feeding) = 34.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find out how many cookies were in each jar, we need to subtract the number of cookies Lani ate from the total number of cookies she baked, and then divide the result by the number of jars.

First, subtract the number of cookies Lani ate from the total number of cookies: 
55 (total cookies) - 5 (cookies eaten) = 50 cookies

Next, divide the remaining cookies by the number of jars:
50 cookies / 5 jars = 10 cookies per jar

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of petals on the orchids, we multiply the number of orchids by the number of petals per orchid: 5 orchids * 5 petals/orchid = 25 petals.

To find the total number of petals on the daisies, we multiply the number of daisies by the number of petals per daisy: 4 daisies * 10 petals/daisy = 40 petals.

Now, we subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies to find the difference: 40 petals (daisies) - 25 petals (orchids) = 15 petals.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the percentage of flowering plants, we first need to determine the number of flowering plants. 

There are 100 plants in total. One-fourth of them are indoor plants, which is 100 * (1/4) = 25 plants. 

The remaining plants are 100 - 25 = 75 plants. Two-thirds of these remaining plants are outdoor plants, which is 75 * (2/3) = 50 plants. 

The rest of the remaining plants are flowering plants, which is 75 - 50 = 25 plants.

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100: (25/100) * 100 = 25%.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to determine the speed of the thingamabob first. Since the whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob, and the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, we can calculate the speed of the thingamabob as follows:

Speed of whatchamacallit = 121 meters/second
Speed of thingamabob = Speed of whatchamacallit / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 121 / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 11 meters/second

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig, which is five times the speed of the thingamabob:

Speed of whirligig = 5 * Speed of thingamabob
Speed of whirligig = 5 * 11
Speed of whirligig = 55 meters/second

The final answer is: 55"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the price of one carrot as 'c'. Since the yogurt is half the price of the salad, the price of the yogurt is $6 / 2 = $3.

Ellen eats two carrots every day, so the total cost of carrots is 2c.

The total cost of the salad and yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9.

Since Ellen pays a total of $11 for her goods, the cost of the carrots can be found by subtracting the cost of the salad and yogurt from the total cost: 2c = $11 - $9 = $2.

To find the price of one carrot, we divide the total cost of carrots by 2: c = $2 / 2 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To find out how much Mark makes a week, we need to calculate his new hourly wage and then multiply it by the number of hours he works in a week.

Mark's new hourly wage is $10 (old wage) + $2 (raise) = $12 per hour.

He works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so the total number of hours he works in a week is 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week.

Now, we multiply his new hourly wage by the total number of hours he works in a week: $12/hour * 40 hours/week = $480/week.

The final answer is: $480"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn. Let's denote the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. 

Since she mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as Joe's, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times. 

The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.

The total number of lawns she mowed is the sum of the lawns she mowed for Kamala, Joe, and Alba, which is 3x + x + 5x = 9x.

We know that she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn, and since she mowed Joe's lawn 'x' times, the total amount she made from mowing lawns is 6x.

We also know that she made a total of $80 from both lemonade sales and mowing lawns. So, the amount she made from lemonade sales is 80 - 6x.

Since we don't know the value of 'x', we need to find a way to determine it. However, we can use the information that she mowed a total of 9x lawns. We also know that she mowed Joe's lawn once, Kamala's lawn three times, and Alba's lawn five times. This means that the total number of lawns she mowed is 1 + 3 + 5 = 9.

Since 9x = 9, we can solve for 'x' by dividing both sides by 9, which gives us x = 1.

Now that we know 'x' is 1, we can find the amount she made from lemonade sales by substituting x into the equation 80 - 6x. This gives us 80 - 6(1) = 80 - 6 = 74.

The final answer is: $74"
"To find Harry's weight, we need to determine Christian's weight first, then subtract 5 kg from it.

Martin's weight is 55 kg. 
Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so Carl's weight is 55 + 16 = 71 kg.
Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight is 71 + 8 = 79 kg.
Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight is 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

"To calculate John's profit, we need to first calculate his total income from renting out his car and then subtract his car payment.

John rents his car out 10 times a month for 3 hours each time, so the total hours he rents his car out per month is 10 * 3 = 30 hours.

His hourly rate is $25, so his total income from renting out his car is 30 hours * $25/hour = $750.

His car payment is $500, so his profit is $750 - $500 = $250.

The final answer is: $250"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many notebooks Martha had initially. Since she bought 5 more notebooks to reach a total of 7, we can set up an equation to find her initial number of notebooks.

Let's denote Martha's initial number of notebooks as M. We know that after buying 5 more, she had 7 notebooks. So, we can write the equation:

M + 5 = 7

Subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation gives us:

M = 2

Now that we know Martha had 2 notebooks initially, we can find out how many notebooks Joseph had. We are told that Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha. So, we can write:

Joseph's notebooks = 3 * Martha's notebooks
= 3 * 2
= 6

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph. We can do this by subtracting Joseph's number of notebooks from Martha's number of notebooks:

Martha's notebooks - Joseph's notebooks = 7 - 6
= 1

So, Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph."
"To find the total distance rowed by Dijana and Anis, we first need to determine the distance rowed by Anis. 

Dijana rowed 50 miles. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. To find 1/5 of Dijana's distance, we multiply 50 by 1/5, which is 10 miles. 

Since Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, we add the 1/5 of Dijana's distance to Dijana's distance. So, Anis rowed 50 + 10 = 60 miles.

Now, we add the distances rowed by Dijana and Anis to find the total distance. The total distance is 50 + 60 = 110 miles.

The final answer is: 110"
"To find out how many cookies each of Susan's nephews will get, we first need to determine the total number of cookies available after her husband took some. 

Initially, Susan had 100 cookies. Her husband took 4 cookies, so the remaining number of cookies is 100 - 4 = 96.

Since Susan wants to divide the cookies equally among her 6 nephews, we need to divide the remaining cookies by 6. 

96 Ã· 6 = 16

So, each of Susan's nephews will get 16 cookies. 

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we need to calculate the total number of pages each of them read.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. 

Today, Denise read 5 more than as many pages as Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read 5 + 13 = 18 pages today.

So, Denise's total pages read is 10 (yesterday) + 18 (today) = 28 pages.

Daniel's total pages read is 13 (yesterday) + 0 (today) = 13 pages.

The difference in the number of pages read by Denise and Daniel is 28 - 13 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of bowls that can be filled with the leftover soup and then divide that number by the number of child-sized bowls.

Since the pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls, and there are 3 adults (Calvin, his wife, and himself), the total number of adult bowls that can be filled is 3. 

Since 4 adult bowls equal 8 child bowls, 3 adult bowls will equal 6 child bowls (3 * 2 = 6). 

This means the pot can fill 6 child bowls. 

Since there are 2 children, and each child will eat one bowl at dinner, there will be 4 child bowls left over (6 - 2 = 4).

Each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch 4 times from the leftover soup. 

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total amount William spent, we need to calculate the cost of the notebooks and the cost of the ballpen, then add them together.

The cost of the notebooks is 5 x $1.50 = $7.50.

"To determine the amount of material needed, we need to calculate the total amount of material required for small and large masks separately and then add them together.

For small masks: 
- Each small mask requires 2 yards of material.
- Jo needs to make 20 small masks.
- Total material needed for small masks = 20 * 2 = 40 yards.

For large masks: 
- Each large mask requires 2.25 yards of material.
- Jo needs to make 8 large masks.
- Total material needed for large masks = 8 * 2.25 = 18 yards.

Total material needed = material for small masks + material for large masks = 40 + 18 = 58 yards.

"To find the average price Deepa paid per ticket, we need to first find the total number of tickets she bought and the total amount she spent.

Since Deepa saw each of the 9 movies three times, the total number of tickets she bought is 9 movies * 3 showings per movie = 27 tickets.

The total amount she spent is given as $216.

To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets: $216 / 27 tickets.

$216 / 27 tickets = $8 per ticket.

"To find Harold's free time, we need to calculate the total hours in a day and subtract the time he spends sleeping, working, and walking his dog.

There are 24 hours in a day. 

Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night. 
He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours a day.
He walks his dog for 1 hour a day.

Total time spent = 10 (sleep) + 8 (work) + 1 (walking dog) = 19 hours

Free time = Total hours in a day - Total time spent
Free time = 24 - 19
Free time = 5 hours

So, Tim used 3 red shoeboxes for fishing.

Now, let's find out how many blue shoeboxes are left. 
Total blue shoeboxes = 7
Blue shoeboxes used = 3
Blue shoeboxes left = 7 - 3 = 4

Now, let's find out how many red shoeboxes are left.

"To find out how many books Joseph had initially, we need to determine the number of books Sarah has and then double it. Sarah has 9 books. 

Joseph had twice the number of Sarah's books, so he initially had 2 * 9 = 18 books.

However, Joseph lost 2 books. To find out how many books Joseph currently has, we need to subtract the number of lost books from his initial number of books. 

Joseph currently has 18 - 2 = 16 books.

"To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we need to first calculate how many marbles he gave away. 

Dean gives 1/5 of his marbles to Jamie. Since Dean has 30 marbles, 1/5 of 30 is 30 * (1/5) = 6 marbles. 

So, Dean gave away 6 marbles to Jamie. 

Then, he gave 10 marbles to Donald. 

In total, Dean gave away 6 + 10 = 16 marbles.

To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we subtract the marbles he gave away from the total number of marbles he had: 30 - 16 = 14.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote Adam's age four years ago as 'x'. Since Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, we can write an equation:

Duncan's age eight years ago = 2 * Adam's age four years ago
Duncan's age eight years ago = 2x

We know that Duncan's current age is 60. To find his age eight years ago, we subtract 8 from his current age:

Duncan's age eight years ago = 60 - 8
Duncan's age eight years ago = 52

Now we can equate this to 2x:

52 = 2x

To find x, we divide both sides by 2:

x = 52 / 2
x = 26

This means Adam's age four years ago was 26. To find Adam's current age, we add 4 to x:

Adam's current age = 26 + 4
Adam's current age = 30

Finally, to find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8
Adam's age in 8 years = 38

"To find out how much Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday, we need to calculate the total number of packages he completes in that time and then multiply it by his hourly wage.

First, let's find out how many packages Colby completes in an hour. He completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, so he completes 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

Now, let's calculate the total number of packages he completes in an eight-hour workday: 40 packages/hour * 8 hours = 320 packages.

Since Colby gets paid $0.20 for every package he completes, we can multiply the total number of packages by his hourly wage to find his total earnings: 320 packages * $0.20/package = $64.

"To find out how many bottles of water John drinks, we need to calculate the time it takes to solve the extreme sudoku and then divide it by the time it takes to drink one bottle of water.

A normal sudoku takes 45 minutes, and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long, so the time to solve an extreme sudoku is 45 * 4 = 180 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we need to convert the time to solve the extreme sudoku to hours and then divide by 0.5 (since there are 2 half hours in an hour). 

180 minutes is equal to 3 hours. 

Now, we divide 3 hours by 0.5 to get the number of half hours, which is 6. 

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, he drinks 6 bottles of water in 3 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many pieces of bologna were thrown at the red balloons and then subtract that from the total number of bologna pieces to find out how many were thrown at the yellow balloons.

Since Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and there are 20 red balloons, the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons is 2 * 20 = 40.

Now, we know that Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna at the bundle of balloons. To find out how many pieces were thrown at the yellow balloons, we subtract the number of pieces thrown at the red balloons from the total: 58 - 40 = 18.

Since Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, we can find the number of yellow balloons by dividing the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons by 3: 18 / 3 = 6.

"To determine the number of tune-ups Jon needs, we need to calculate the total miles driven in 30 days and then divide that by the interval at which he needs a tune-up.

Jon drives 100 miles a day for 30 days, so the total miles driven is:
100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles

Since Jon needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we can divide the total miles driven by 1000 to find the number of tune-ups needed:
3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3

Therefore, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in that time.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount of money Julia and Nadine had, and then divide it by 2 to find out how much each of them received as allowance.

First, let's calculate the cost of the balloons. 1 dozen balloons is equal to 12 balloons. Since 2 balloons cost $0.5, 12 balloons will cost 12 * $0.5 / 2 = $3.

The total cost of the cake and the balloons is $11 + $3 = $14.

The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is $7 * 2 = $14.

The total cost of the cake, balloons, and ice cream is $14 + $14 = $28.

Since the total cost of the items is $28, and Julia and Nadine had the same amount of allowance, the total amount of allowance they had is also $28.

To find out how much each of them received, we divide the total allowance by 2: $28 / 2 = $14.

"To find the total profit made by the class, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

First, let's calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class. Since each student sold 10 lollipops on average, and there are 30 students, the total number of lollipops sold is:

Total lollipops sold = 10 lollipops/student * 30 students = 300 lollipops

Next, let's calculate the total revenue. Each lollipop was sold for $0.8, so the total revenue is:

Total revenue = 300 lollipops * $0.8/lollipop = $240

Now, let's calculate the total cost. The class bought the lollipops for $0.5 each, so the total cost is:

Total cost = 300 lollipops * $0.5/lollipop = $150

Finally, let's calculate the total profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

Total profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $240 - $150 = $90

3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 * 7 = 21 fish.
5. He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

Now, let's add up the number of each type of pet:

"To find the number of shells Martha has collected by her 10th birthday, we need to calculate the total number of months she has been collecting shells. Since she started collecting shells at 5 years old and we want to know the total by her 10th birthday, we need to consider the months from her 5th birthday to her 10th birthday.

There are 12 months in a year. From her 5th birthday to her 10th birthday, Martha would have been 5 years old for 1 year, 6 years old for 1 year, 7 years old for 1 year, 8 years old for 1 year, and 9 years old for 1 year. 

So, the total number of months is 5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months.

Since Martha collects one shell per month, the total number of shells she has collected by her 10th birthday is 60 shells.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many cups of tea are in each row. Since Lana divides the 27 cups into 3 rows, we can divide 27 by 3 to get the number of cups in each row.

27 cups / 3 rows = 9 cups per row

Since Lana creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, the total number of mint tea cups in each row is half of the total cups in each row.

9 cups per row / 2 = 4.5 cups of mint tea per row

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a cup, we can assume that Lana must have made a whole number of cups of mint tea in each row. This means that the 4.5 cups of mint tea per row must be rounded down to 4 cups of mint tea per row, as she cannot make a fraction of a cup.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip. 

Let's break down the problem:

- The sloth has 8 hours to collect 24 berries.
- Each trip down, up, and back takes 4 hours, so the sloth can make 8 / 4 = 2 trips in 8 hours.
- Since the sloth picks the same number of berries on each trip, let's call the number of berries picked per trip 'x'.
- The total number of berries picked in 2 trips is 2x.
- We want to find the minimum value of 'x' such that 2x = 24.

To find the minimum value of 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

2x = 24
x = 24 / 2
x = 12

So, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip is 12.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the initial amount of water in the tank and then calculate the remaining water after 6 days.

First, Anthony and his father fill the tank with half the amount of water in the pool. Since there are 10,000 gallons of water in the pool, half of that is 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 gallons.

Next, we need to calculate the amount of water used from the tank over 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so over 6 days, the total amount of water used is 500 * 6 = 3,000 gallons.

To find the remaining water in the tank, we subtract the amount used from the initial amount: 5,000 - 3,000 = 2,000 gallons.

"To find the total calories of the pastries, we first need to calculate the calories of each mini pastry. 

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, so the calories of a mini cinnamon roll are 600 * 1/3 = 200 calories.

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, so the calories of a mini blueberry muffin are 450 * 1/3 = 150 calories.

Now, we can calculate the total calories of the mini cinnamon rolls: 200 mini rolls * 200 calories per roll = 40,000 calories.

Next, we calculate the total calories of the mini blueberry muffins: 300 muffins * 150 calories per muffin = 45,000 calories.

Finally, we add the total calories of the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins to get the total calories of all the pastries: 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories.

On Tuesday, she removed twice as many as Monday, so 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs.
On Wednesday, she removed twice as many as Tuesday, so 2 * 78 = 156 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 78 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 378

There are 5 days in total. 

Average number of Junebugs removed per day = Total Junebugs removed / Number of days
= 378 / 5
= 75.6

The final answer is: 75.6"
"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by both the bus and the car.

The bus travels at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours. To find the total distance traveled by the bus, we multiply the speed by the time: 60 miles/hour * 5 hours = 300 miles.

The car travels at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours. To find the total distance traveled by the car, we multiply the speed by the time: 30 miles/hour * 8 hours = 240 miles.

Now, we need to find the difference between the distance traveled by the bus and the car: 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles.

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find the number of bouncy balls, we need to subtract the total number of toys Sophie had before buying the bouncy balls from the total number of toys she has now. 

The total number of toys before buying the bouncy balls is the sum of the blocks, stuffed animals, and stacking rings. 

Total number of toys before = 31 (blocks) + 8 (stuffed animals) + 9 (stacking rings) = 48

Now, we subtract this from the total number of toys after buying the bouncy balls to find the number of bouncy balls.

Number of bouncy balls = Total number of toys after - Total number of toys before
= 62 - 48
= 14

The final answer is: 14"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the ages of Peter, Paul, and John. 

Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as p, and John's age as j.

We are given that Paul is 10 years older than John, so we can write an equation: p = j + 10.

We are also given that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age: P = p + j.

Since the combined age of Peter, Paul, and John is 100 years old, we can write another equation: P + p + j = 100.

Now we can substitute the first equation (p = j + 10) into the second equation (P = p + j) to get P = (j + 10) + j, which simplifies to P = 2j + 10.

Now we can substitute the expression for P (2j + 10) into the third equation (P + p + j = 100) to get (2j + 10) + (j + 10) + j = 100.

Combine like terms: 4j + 20 = 100.

Subtract 20 from both sides: 4j = 80.

Divide both sides by 4: j = 20.

Now that we know John's age (j = 20), we can find Paul's age using the equation p = j + 10: p = 20 + 10 = 30.

Finally, we can find Peter's age using the equation P = p + j: P = 30 + 20 = 50.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total number of balloons, we need to calculate the initial number of balloons and add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, Maria had 1 water balloon, and her 4 friends had 2 balloons each. So, the total initial number of balloons is:
1 (Maria's balloon) + (4 friends * 2 balloons per friend) = 1 + 8 = 9 balloons

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional balloons is:
5 people * 3 balloons per person = 15 balloons

Now, we add the initial number of balloons to the additional balloons:
9 (initial balloons) + 15 (additional balloons) = 24 balloons

The final answer is: 24"
"To find out how many tables the charity group needs, we first need to calculate the total number of boxes of stuff they have. 

They have 10 people donating 5 boxes each, so they have 10 * 5 = 50 boxes from donations. 
They also have 10 boxes already, so the total number of boxes is 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

Since they can fit 2 boxes per table, they will need 60 / 2 = 30 tables.

However, they already own 15 tables. To find out how many more tables they need, we subtract the number of tables they own from the total number of tables needed: 30 - 15 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the average total distance spat, we need to calculate the total distance spat by each person and then divide it by the total number of seeds spat.

Zoey spits 40 seeds, each 10 feet, so the total distance spat by Zoey is 40 * 10 = 400 feet.

Sydney spits 35 seeds, each 12 feet, so the total distance spat by Sydney is 35 * 12 = 420 feet.

The total distance spat by both is 400 + 420 = 820 feet.

The total number of seeds spat is 40 + 35 = 75.

The average total distance spat is 820 / 75 = 10.93 (rounded to two decimal places).

"To determine how much money Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his stay with the two options and then find the difference.

Option 1: 24-hour stay - The hotel charges 1600 pesos for a 24-hour stay.

Option 2: 12-hour stay + additional hours - Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours. The 12-hour stay costs 1000 pesos, and the additional 5 hours (17 - 12 = 5) will cost 5 * 70 = 350 pesos. So, the total cost for this option is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

Now, let's calculate the amount of money Cameron would save by choosing the second option: 
Savings = Cost of Option 1 - Cost of Option 2
Savings = 1600 - 1350
Savings = 250 pesos

The final answer is: $250"
"To find the total amount of hay needed, we first need to calculate the amount each sheep needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds and each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, we can calculate the amount each sheep needs as follows:

Each goat needs 5 pounds, so twice that amount is 5 * 2 = 10 pounds. 
3 pounds less than 10 pounds is 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep separately:

For the goats: 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds
For the sheep: 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds

To find the total amount of hay needed, we add the amount needed for the goats and the sheep:

75 pounds (goats) + 84 pounds (sheep) = 159 pounds

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate John's total earnings, subtract his expenses, and then determine how much money he has left to spend on pens and pencils.

1. Calculate John's total earnings: 
   John earns 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are 50 * 6 = 300 dollars.

2. Calculate John's expenses:
   John spends 50 dollars on gas and buys 5 pencils at 10 dollars each, so the total cost of pencils is 5 * 10 = 50 dollars. His total expenses are 50 (gas) + 50 (pencils) = 100 dollars.

3. Calculate John's remaining money:
   John's remaining money is his total earnings minus his expenses, which is 300 - 100 = 200 dollars.

4. Calculate how many 25 dollar pens John can buy:
   John can buy 200 / 25 = 8 pens.

"To find the total number of letters in the words Craig spelled, we multiply the number of words by the number of letters in each word: 20 * 15 = 300.

Since Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig, we add 50 to the total number of letters Craig spelled: 300 + 50 = 350.

However, this is not the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds. We need to add the total number of letters Craig's brother spelled. Since Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig, and Craig spelled 300 letters, Craig's brother must have spelled 300 + 50 = 350 letters.

Now, we add the total number of letters Craig spelled and the total number of letters Craig's brother spelled: 300 + 350 = 650.

"To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has left, we first need to determine the total number of bottles she has initially and then subtract the number of bottles given to the students.

The teacher has 9 coupons, each redeemable for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles she has initially is 9 * 100 = 900 bottles.

Each of the 29 students receives 2 bottles of apple juice, so the total number of bottles given to the students is 29 * 2 = 58 bottles.

To find out how many bottles the teacher has left, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles she initially had: 900 - 58 = 842.

"To find out how much James spent on the CDs, we need to calculate the original price and then subtract the amount he got back from selling 5 of them.

First, let's find the original price of the CDs. James bought 10 CDs at $15 each, so the original price is 10 * $15 = $150.

Since he got a 40% discount, he paid 60% of the original price. To find 60% of $150, we multiply $150 by 0.6, which is $90.

Now, let's calculate how much James got back from selling 5 CDs. He sold them for $40 each, so he got 5 * $40 = $200.

To find out how much money James was out, we subtract the amount he paid from the amount he got back: $200 - $90 = $110.

The final answer is: $110"

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. First, we need to find the time it took James to swim 60% of the distance. 
   Distance = 20 miles, 
   Speed = 2 miles per hour, 
   Time = Distance / Speed = 20 / 2 = 10 hours.
   60% of the distance is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles.
   Time taken to swim 12 miles = 12 / 2 = 6 hours.

2. Since he rests for half as long as the swimming time, he rests for 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

3. The remaining distance is 20 - 12 = 8 miles.
   He swims at half the speed, so his new speed is 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour.
   Time taken to swim the remaining 8 miles = 8 / 1 = 8 hours.

4. Total time taken = Time taken to swim 12 miles + Time taken to rest + Time taken to swim the remaining 8 miles
   Total time taken = 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.

"To find out how many points Azibo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Bahati and Dinar. 

Let's denote the points scored by Dinar as x. Since Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, Bahati's points can be represented as x + 10. 

We are also given that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo. So, Azibo's points can be represented as (x + 10) - 20 = x - 10.

The total points scored by the team is 45, which is the sum of the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar. Therefore, we can write the equation as:

x + (x + 10) + (x - 10) = 45

Combine like terms:
3x = 45

Divide both sides by 3:
x = 15

Now that we know Dinar scored 15 points, we can find Azibo's points:
Azibo's points = x - 10

"To find out how many minutes Kim slept on her bed, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m., which is a total of 8 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she usually sleeps for 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, that day she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 5:55 a.m. instead of 6 a.m. This means she slept from 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m., which is a total of 7 hours and 55 minutes. Converting this to minutes, we get 7 * 60 + 55 = 455 minutes.

Now, we need to subtract the time she was sleepwalking, which was from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. This is a total of 23 minutes.

"To find the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we need to first calculate the number of occupied beds and then subtract that from the total capacity.

The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 of them are occupied. 

1/5 of 1000 is 100. So, the number of occupied beds is 100.

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, we need to calculate the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks is 14 days.

The total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks is 50 * 14 = 700.

Now, we add the initial number of occupied beds (100) to the number of patients admitted in 2 weeks (700) to get the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks.

Total occupied beds = 100 + 700 = 800

Now, we subtract the total number of occupied beds from the total capacity to get the number of unoccupied beds.

Total unoccupied beds = 1000 - 800 = 200

20% of 100 is 20. 

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 100 - 20 = 80% of the number reported by Courtney.

Since Courtney reported 48 people, 80% of 48 is 0.8 * 48 = 38.4.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day. 

The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day, 13 holes on the second day, and 8 holes on the third day. However, they filled in 2 holes on the third day. So, the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29.

The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 4 * 10 = 40.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of corn chips that Amora and Lainey got as 'x'. Since Collins got 15 more corn chips than the others, Collins got x + 15 corn chips.

We are given that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, so we can set up the equation:

x = 70

Since Collins got x + 15 corn chips, we can set up the equation for Collins as well:

x + 15 = 70 + 15 (since Amora and Lainey got 70 each)

Simplifying the equation for Collins, we get:

x + 15 = 85

Now, we can solve for x by subtracting 15 from both sides:

x = 85 - 15
x = 70

This confirms that Amora and Lainey indeed got 70 corn chips each. Now, we can find the total number of corn chips by adding the number of corn chips each person got:

Total corn chips = 2 * 70 (for Amora and Lainey) + (70 + 15) (for Collins)
Total corn chips = 140 + 85
Total corn chips = 225

"To find the cost of travel, we need to determine the total cost of supplies and then calculate 50% more than that amount.

The total cost of supplies is $400. 

To find 50% of $400, we multiply $400 by 0.5 (since 50% is equivalent to 0.5). 
$400 * 0.5 = $200

Now, we add the 50% more to the original cost of supplies to find the total cost of travel.
$400 + $200 = $600

The cost of travel is $600."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of PokÃ©mon caught by Adelwolfe as A, Stan as S, and Alex as X.

We know that together they have caught 339 PokÃ©mon, so we can write the equation:
A + S + X = 339

We also know that Alex has caught 5 more PokÃ©mon than Stan, so we can write:
X = S + 5

We also know that Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, so we can write:
S = 4A - 13

Now we can substitute the expression for S from the second equation into the first equation:
A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 13 + 5) = 339

Combine like terms:
A + 4A - 13 + 4A - 8 = 339
Combine like terms:
9A - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:
9A = 360

Divide both sides by 9:
A = 40

Now that we know A, we can find S:
S = 4A - 13
S = 4(40) - 13
S = 160 - 13
S = 147

"To find the total number of episodes, we need to determine the number of episodes that is half the length of a single episode. Since each episode is 20 minutes long, half of that would be 20 / 2 = 10 minutes. However, this is the length of a single episode, not the number of episodes. 

Since the number of episodes is half the length of a single episode, we need to divide the length of a single episode by 2 to get the number of episodes. But we are looking for the number of episodes, not the length of a single episode. So, we need to divide the length of a single episode by 2 to get the number of episodes. 

The number of episodes is 20 / 2 = 10. 

Now, to find the total time John will spend watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode: 10 episodes * 20 minutes per episode = 200 minutes.

Distance = 18 miles/hour x 2 hours
Distance = 36 miles

Now, let's calculate the distance traveled in the final southerly direction:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 22 miles/hour x 5 hours
Distance = 110 miles

Since the bird traveled 300 miles in the initial southerly direction, and then 36 miles in the northerly direction, we subtract the northerly distance from the initial southerly distance:

300 miles - 36 miles = 264 miles

However, the bird then traveled an additional 110 miles in the southerly direction. To find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we add this distance to the previous result:

264 miles + 110 miles = 374 miles

The final answer is: 374"
"To find the total number of brownies Greta had left over, we need to calculate the total number of brownies she received and subtract the number of brownies eaten.

Greta made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies for herself, which is 12 brownies. 

At her office, they sent her home with 1/2 a dozen brownies, which is 6 brownies. 

Her friends had 4 dozen brownies waiting at home, which is 48 brownies.

So, the total number of brownies Greta received is 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies.

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies.

To find the number of brownies Greta had left over, we subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies she received: 66 - 18 = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the total age of all three family members, we need to calculate the age of Nani's brother and sister first.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 2 * 8 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means her age is 75% of Nani's age. To find 75% of Nani's age, we multiply his age by 0.75: 8 * 0.75 = 6 years.

Now, we add up the ages of all three family members: Nani's age (8 years) + his brother's age (16 years) + his sister's age (6 years) = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time it takes for each type of stringing and then add them together.

For synthetic gut: 3 racquets * 15 minutes/racquet = 45 minutes
For polyester string: 5 racquets * 22 minutes/racquet = 110 minutes
For hybrid sets: 4 racquets * 18 minutes/racquet = 72 minutes

Now, we add the time for each type of stringing together: 45 minutes + 110 minutes + 72 minutes = 227 minutes

The final answer is: 227"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first two phones and the cost of the remaining phones.

The first two phones cost the full price of $600 each, so the total cost for the first two phones is 2 * $600 = $1200.

The remaining phones are 2 (for the kids and the wife), and each of these phones is half price, which is $600 / 2 = $300.

The total cost for the remaining phones is 2 * $300 = $600.

The total cost for all phones is the sum of the cost of the first two phones and the cost of the remaining phones: $1200 + $600 = $1800.

The final answer is: $1800"
"To find the total number of players in both teams, we first need to determine the number of players on Zeke's team. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, and Carlton's team has 13 players, we can calculate the number of players on Zeke's team by adding 7 to 13.

Zeke's team = Carlton's team + 7
Zeke's team = 13 + 7
Zeke's team = 20

Now, to find the total number of players in both teams, we add the number of players on Zeke's team to the number of players on Carlton's team.

Total players = Zeke's team + Carlton's team
Total players = 20 + 13
Total players = 33

The final answer is: 33"
"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the length (l) is 15 feet and the width (w) is 10 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

Perimeter = 2(l + w)
Perimeter = 2(15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2(25)
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

Total slats needed = Perimeter * 2
Total slats needed = 50 * 2
Total slats needed = 100

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we need to first determine how many oranges she had initially and then subtract the number of oranges she kept and gave away.

Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges, and each box contains 20 oranges. So, the total number of oranges she bought is 12 * 20 = 240.

She gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes each, which is a total of 4 boxes. Since each box contains 20 oranges, she gave away 4 * 20 = 80 oranges.

She kept 1/4 of the oranges. To find out how many oranges she kept, we need to calculate 1/4 of the total number of oranges she had initially, which is 1/4 * 240 = 60 oranges.

Now, we subtract the number of oranges she kept and gave away from the total number of oranges she had initially to find out how many oranges she sold: 240 - 60 - 80 = 100.

The final answer is: 100"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of states in the USA and India. 

The USA has 50 states. 

Half of 50 is 25. 

India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, so it has 25 + 4 = 29 states.

To find the total number of states in both countries, we add the number of states in the USA and India: 50 + 29 = 79.

The final answer is: 79"
"To determine how many hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books. 

The total cost of the books is the sum of the cost of the dictionary, the dinosaur book, and the children's cookbook. 

Total cost = $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39

Since Tyler has already saved $14 from his allowance, we need to subtract this from the total cost to find out how much more he needs to earn.

Amount needed to earn = Total cost - Amount saved = $39 - $14 = $25

Tyler earns $5 per hour, so to find out how many hours he needs to work, we divide the amount he needs to earn by his hourly wage.

Hours needed to work = Amount needed to earn / Hourly wage = $25 / $5 = 5 hours

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many cherries Richard and Jerry have. 

Since Robert has 30 cherries and has 10 more than Richard, we can set up an equation to find out how many cherries Richard has. Let's denote the number of cherries Richard has as R. Then, we can write the equation as R + 10 = 30. 

Solving for R, we get R = 30 - 10 = 20. 

Now that we know Richard has 20 cherries, we can find out how many cherries Jerry has. Since the total number of cherries is 60, and Robert and Richard have 30 and 20 cherries respectively, Jerry must have 60 - (30 + 20) = 10 cherries.

Now, we can find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry. Robert has 30 cherries, and Jerry has 10 cherries. The difference is 30 - 10 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how much Sunny earned, we need to calculate the total number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie he sold on both days and then multiply the total number of each item by its respective price.

Let's denote the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday as G. Since he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie on Saturday than on Sunday, the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday is 15 - 4 = 11.

On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday is G + 5. The number of boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday is given as 15.

The total number of boxes of gingerbread sold over the two days is G + (G + 5) = 2G + 5. The total number of boxes of apple pie sold is 11 + 15 = 26.

The total earnings from gingerbread is (2G + 5) * 6, and the total earnings from apple pie is 26 * 15.

We know that the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday is 10. So, G = 10.

Now, we can calculate the total earnings: 
Total earnings from gingerbread = (2 * 10 + 5) * 6 = 25 * 6 = 150
Total earnings from apple pie = 26 * 15 = 390

Total earnings = 150 + 390 = 540

The final answer is: 540"
"To determine the total number of bottles Pamela will need, we need to calculate the total amount of sunscreen she will use and divide it by the amount in each bottle.

Pamela will be outside for 4 hours a day for 8 days, so she will be outside for a total of 4 * 8 = 32 hours.

Since she reapplies sunscreen every hour, she will use 32 ounces of sunscreen.

Each bottle contains 8 ounces, so to find out how many bottles she will need, we divide the total amount of sunscreen she will use (32 ounces) by the amount in each bottle (8 ounces):

32 ounces / 8 ounces per bottle = 4 bottles

Therefore, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen. 

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the price of the red car, we need to calculate 40% of the price of the blue car and subtract it from the price of the blue car.

First, let's find 40% of the price of the blue car:
40% of $100 = 0.4 * $100 = $40

Now, subtract $40 from the price of the blue car to find the price of the red car:
$100 - $40 = $60

So, the price of the red car is $60.

To find the total cost of both cars, add the prices of the red and blue cars:
$60 + $100 = $160

The final numerical answer is: $160"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote Emil's current age as E, his dad's current age as D, and his brother's current age as B.

We know that Emil is 19 years old now, so E = 19.

When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad, so we can write the equation: 24 = 0.5D.

We can solve for D by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2: D = 24 * 2 = 48.

Now, we know that when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother. So, we can write the equation: 24 = 2B.

We can solve for B by dividing both sides of the equation by 2: B = 24 / 2 = 12.

Now that we have the ages of Emil's dad and brother when Emil turns 24, we need to find their current ages. Since Emil is 19 now, we need to subtract 5 years from their ages to find their current ages.

Dad's current age = D - 5 = 48 - 5 = 43.
Brother's current age = B - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7.

The sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now is: 43 + 7 = 50.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to calculate the number of beads she received from her mother, sister, and friend, and then add them together.

Adrianne's mother gave her 20 beads.
Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the beads together: 20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the total amount of crawfish Joe caught, we need to calculate the amount he caught each day and add them together.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.

On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, we add the amount he caught each day: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we divide the total amount by 3 to find the number of servings: 21 / 3 = 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the number of students leaving early, we first need to find the number of football players, and then add the number of cheerleaders or band members.

First, let's find the number of football players. 20% of 30 students are football players. 

20% of 30 = 0.20 * 30 = 6

So, there are 6 football players.

Next, we need to find the number of remaining students. Since 6 students are football players, the remaining students are 30 - 6 = 24.

Now, 25% of the remaining 24 students are cheerleaders or band members.

25% of 24 = 0.25 * 24 = 6

So, there are 6 cheerleaders or band members.

The total number of students leaving early is the sum of football players and cheerleaders or band members.

6 (football players) + 6 (cheerleaders or band members) = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we need to first find the total size of their shoes and then divide it by 2.

Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie's boots are size 5, Charlie's boots are 5 * 5 = 25.

The total size of their shoes is 5 (Sophie's size) + 25 (Charlie's size) = 30.

To find the average size, we divide the total size by 2: 30 / 2 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To determine the total number of flowers Pat needs, we first need to calculate the total space available in the flower bed in feet. Since Pat's flower bed is 111 feet long, we can use this as the total space.

However, we need to convert the width of the flowers and the space between them to feet. Pat's flowers grow 12 inches wide, which is 1 foot. The space between each plant is 1.5 feet.

To find the total space required for each plant, we add the width of the flower and the space between it: 1 foot (flower width) + 1.5 feet (space between) = 2.5 feet.

Now, we divide the total length of the flower bed by the space required for each plant to find the total number of plants that can fit: 111 feet / 2.5 feet = 44.4. Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we round down to 44 plants.

However, Pat already owns 17 flowers, so we subtract this from the total number of plants needed: 44 - 17 = 27.

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of plants needed by the cost per plant: 27 * $6 = $162.

The final answer is: $162"
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day, we need to calculate 1/2 of the number of pretzels Edgar eats in a day. 

Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day. 
1/2 of 18 is 18 / 2 = 9 pretzels.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we need to multiply the number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day by 7.

9 pretzels/day * 7 days = 63 pretzels

"To find out how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we first need to determine how much soil is left after planting the sunflowers and carnations.

First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:

- 4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds
- 10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds
- Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations = 12 pounds + 15 pounds = 27 pounds

Now, let's subtract the amount of soil used from the total amount of soil:

- Total soil available = 30 pounds
- Soil used for sunflowers and carnations = 27 pounds
- Soil left for roses = 30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, we can plant 3 roses with the remaining soil.

"To find out how many shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we first need to calculate how much she sets aside each month for shoes. 

Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month and sets 25% of her paycheck aside for shoes. To find 25% of $2,000.00, we multiply $2,000.00 by 0.25 (since 25% is equivalent to 0.25).

$2,000.00 * 0.25 = $500.00

So, Jessica sets aside $500.00 each month for shoes.

Next, we need to find out how many months are in a year. There are 12 months in a year.

Now, we need to calculate how much Jessica can save in a year for shoes. We multiply the monthly savings by the number of months in a year.

$500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00

Since each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, we can find out how many pairs she can buy by dividing the total savings by the cost of one pair.

$6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two separate tasks: peeling and cooking. 

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp. Emily can peel 6 shrimp a minute, so to peel 90 shrimp, it will take her 90 / 6 = 15 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp. Emily can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, so to cook 90 shrimp, it will take her 90 / 30 * 10 = 30 minutes.

However, since these tasks are not done sequentially, but rather in parallel, we need to find the maximum time between the two tasks. In this case, peeling takes 15 minutes and cooking takes 30 minutes, so the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp is 30 minutes.

The final answer is: 30"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net change in temperature after the air conditioner has been running and turned off.

First, let's calculate the temperature change when the air conditioner is running on low for 3 hours:

Temperature change on low = 2 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 6 degrees

Then, let's calculate the temperature change when the air conditioner is running on high for 4 hours:

Temperature change on high = 3 degrees/hour * 4 hours = 12 degrees

The net temperature change when the air conditioner is running is the difference between the temperature change on high and the temperature change on low:

Net temperature change when running = Temperature change on high - Temperature change on low = 12 - 6 = 6 degrees

However, we also need to consider the temperature change when the air conditioner is turned off for 2 hours. Since the room warms up at 2 degrees an hour, the temperature change when the air conditioner is turned off is:

Temperature change when off = 2 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 4 degrees

The net temperature change after the air conditioner has been running and turned off is the sum of the net temperature change when running and the temperature change when off:

Net temperature change = Net temperature change when running - Temperature change when off = 6 - 4 = 2 degrees

Since the air conditioner cools the room, the final temperature is 2 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the age of Bill's father when Bill saw the comet for the second time. 

Let's denote the age of Bill's father when he saw the comet as 'x'. Since Bill saw the comet when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet, Bill's age at that time is 3x.

We are given that Bill saw the comet for the second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, the time elapsed between the two sightings is 75 years.

We can set up the equation: 3x - x = 75, since the age difference between the two sightings is 75 years.

Simplifying the equation, we get 2x = 75.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 37.5.

Now, we know that Bill's father was 37.5 years old when he saw the comet. Since Bill was 30 years old when his father saw the comet, we can find Bill's age when his father was 37.5 years old by subtracting 37.5 from 30, but that would be incorrect because that is the age of Bill's father, not Bill. 

However, we know that the time elapsed between the two sightings is 75 years. So, we can find Bill's age when his father was 37.5 years old by adding 75 to 30. 

Bill's age when his father was 37.5 years old is 30 + 75 = 105.

However, this is the age of Bill when his father was 37.5 years old. We need to find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time. 

Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, the time elapsed between the two sightings is 75 years. So, we can find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time by subtracting 75 from 105.

"To find the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks for each category and then add them together.

1. Checks for the electric bill: 1 check per month, so 12 checks per year.
2. Checks for the gas bill: 1 check per month, so 12 checks per year.
3. Checks to the church: 2 checks per month, so 24 checks per year.
4. Checks to the pest and lawn service: 1 check every 3 months, so 4 checks per year.

Now, let's add the total number of checks: 
12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52

The final answer is: 52"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the total number of flights made by the first plane as 'x'. Since the second plane makes half the number of flights as the first plane, the total number of flights made by the second plane is 'x/2'.

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, which is (3/4)x. The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of flights to France is (1/4)x.

We are given that the second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. So, we can set up the equation:

x/2 = 44

To find the total number of flights made by the first plane, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 88

Now that we know the total number of flights made by the first plane, we can find the number of flights to France:

Flights to France = (1/4)x
= (1/4)(88)
= 22

The final answer is: 22"
"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the individual howling times and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we add the individual howling times together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents and subtract that from the cost of the trousers.

Adam's mother gave him $6.
His father gave him twice as much as his mother, so his father gave him 2 * $6 = $12.

The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Since the trousers cost $30, we subtract the amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers to find out how much he had to contribute from his savings:

$30 (cost of trousers) - $18 (amount received from parents) = $12

Therefore, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings. 

The final answer is: $12"
"To find the age of Wilfred, we first need to find the average age of the group. We know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. Let's denote the average age as 'x'. 

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age, Helene's age is 2x. 

The total age of the children is 20, and we know the ages of Akbar and Alessandro. We can set up an equation to represent the total age of the group:

x + 2x + 3 + 4 = 20

Combine like terms:

3x + 7 = 20

Subtract 7 from both sides:

3x = 13

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 13/3

Now that we have the average age, we can find Helene's age:

Helene's age = 2x = 2 * (13/3) = 26/3

We know the total age of the group is 20, and we have the ages of Akbar and Alessandro. We can find Wilfred's age by subtracting the sum of their ages from the total age:

Wilfred's age = 20 - (3 + 4 + 26/3)

First, convert the whole numbers to fractions with a denominator of 3:

Wilfred's age = 20 - (9/3 + 4/3 + 26/3)

Combine the fractions:

Wilfred's age = 20 - 39/3

Convert 20 to a fraction with a denominator of 3:

Wilfred's age = 60/3 - 39/3

Subtract the fractions:

Wilfred's age = 21/3

To find the age of Wilfred in years, divide the numerator by the denominator:

Wilfred's age = 21/3 = 7

"To find out how much Walter's lawyer will contribute, we need to calculate the total amount collected from Walter's neighbors and the online fund, and then multiply it by 3.

Walter collects $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. 

Total amount collected = $500 + $1500 = $2000

Walter's friend donates $200, but this is not included in the amount that the lawyer will base his donation on. 

The lawyer will donate three times the amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund, which is $2000. 

Lawyer's contribution = 3 * $2000 = $6000

"To find the total number of cookies, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies brought by the guests. Since each guest brought 15 cookies and there were 100 guests, the total number of cookies is 100 * 15 = 1500.

The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door. So, the number of cookies given to the church is 1/2 * 1500 = 750.

Since each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, we can find the number of people in the church by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received. 

Number of people in the church = Total cookies given to the church / Cookies per person
= 750 / 15
= 50

"To solve this problem, let's assume the total number of slices of the watermelon is 'x'. Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of people is 6. 

Let's denote the number of slices each kid gets as 'k'. Since each adult gets twice as big a slice as each kid, the number of slices each adult gets is '2k'.

The total number of slices given to the kids is 4k (4 kids * k slices per kid), and the total number of slices given to the adults is 2 * 2k = 4k (2 adults * 2k slices per adult).

The total number of slices given to all the family members is 4k + 4k = 8k.

Since the total number of slices is 'x', we can set up the equation: 8k = x.

Now, the total number of slices given to the adults is 4k. To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to divide the number of slices each adult gets by the total number of slices and multiply by 100.

The percentage of the watermelon each adult gets is (4k / x) * 100.

Since 8k = x, we can substitute x with 8k in the above equation:

(4k / 8k) * 100 = 50%

So, each adult gets 50% of the watermelon.

The final answer is: 50"
"To determine the total time spent by Doctor Jones on rounds and appointments, we need to calculate the time spent on rounds and appointments separately and then add them together.

Time spent on rounds: 
- Number of inpatients: 9
- Time per inpatient: 20 minutes
- Total time spent on rounds: 9 * 20 = 180 minutes

Time spent on appointments: 
- Number of appointments: 10
- Time per appointment: 30 minutes
- Total time spent on appointments: 10 * 30 = 300 minutes

Total time spent on rounds and appointments: 180 + 300 = 480 minutes

Since Doctor Jones works for 9 hours at the clinic, we need to convert the total time spent on rounds and appointments from minutes to hours. 
- 1 hour = 60 minutes
- Total time spent in hours: 480 / 60 = 8 hours

Now, we subtract the total time spent from the total working hours to find the time left for updating records.
- Time left for updating records: 9 - 8 = 1 hour

The final answer is: 1"
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake, including cooling and frosting.

1. Making the cake batter: 20 minutes
2. Baking the cake: 30 minutes
3. Cooling the cake: 2 hours (120 minutes)
4. Frosting the cake: 10 minutes

Total time required: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 180 minutes to hours and minutes: 180 minutes = 3 hours.

To be ready to serve the cake at 5:00 pm, Jordan needs to finish making the cake by 5:00 pm. We need to subtract the total time required from the desired serving time to find the latest start time.

5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we need to first determine the total number of boxes sold by both Lisa and Peter, and then divide the total number of chocolate bars sold by that number.

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as 'x'. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, so she sold 3.5x chocolate bars. 
Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so he sold 4.5x chocolate bars.

Together, they sold 3.5x + 4.5x = 8x chocolate bars.

We know that they sold 64 chocolate bars together, so we can set up the equation: 
8x = 64

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 8:
x = 64 / 8
x = 8

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box. 

The final answer is: 8"
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to first calculate the daily earnings and then multiply it by the number of days in a month.

The daily earnings can be calculated as follows:

- Cost to rent the studio: $25 per session
- Cost per student: $1.50 per student per session
- Number of students: 10
- Number of sessions per week: 3

Daily earnings = (Cost to rent the studio + (Cost per student * Number of students)) * Number of sessions per week
Daily earnings = ($25 + ($1.50 * 10)) * 3
Daily earnings = ($25 + $15) * 3
Daily earnings = $40 * 3
Daily earnings = $120

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, the total earnings for a month can be calculated as follows:

Total earnings = Daily earnings * Number of weeks in a month
Total earnings = $120 * 4
Total earnings = $480

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is $480. 

The final answer is: $480"
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box for both Peter and Martha, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes.

For Peter: 64 chocolate bars / 4 boxes = 16 chocolate bars per box
For Martha: 56 chocolate bars / 7 boxes = 8 chocolate bars per box

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter and Martha. 

Difference = 16 (Peter's chocolate bars per box) - 8 (Martha's chocolate bars per box) = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the number of female porcupines, we need to calculate 3/5 of the total population. 

3/5 * 50 = 30

So, there are 30 female porcupines. 

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

30 * 4 * 12 = 1440

However, these babies are not yet part of the population at the beginning of the year. To find the total population after a year, we need to add the initial population to the number of babies born.

Initial population: 50
Babies born in a year: 1440
Total population after a year: 50 + 1440 = 1490

The final answer is: 1490"
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth of the pool. 

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the number of gallons needed, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. There are 7.48 gallons in a cubic foot, so:

Volume in gallons = 1400 * 7.48
Volume in gallons = 10472 gallons

Now, we multiply the volume in gallons by 5.9 to get the total gallons needed:
Total gallons = 10472 * 5.9
Total gallons = 61851.28 gallons

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon, so we multiply the total gallons by the cost per gallon:
Cost = 61851.28 * 0.10
Cost = 6185.128

Rounding to two decimal places, the cost to fill the pool is approximately $6185.13.

The final answer is: $6185.13"
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to determine the number of each color and add them together.

We know there are 9 red sticks. 
There are 5 more blue sticks than red, so the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14.
The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is 14 - 3 = 11.

Now, we add the number of sticks of each color together: 9 (red) + 14 (blue) + 11 (yellow) = 34.

5. Students under 16: 3000 / 2 = 1500
6. Male students under 16: 1500 / 2 = 750
7. Female students under 16: 1500 - 750 = 750

"To find the number of laps each person can run, we need to calculate their individual lap counts.

Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.

Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.

Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.

Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

To find the difference in the number of laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract Quinn's lap count from Bethany's lap count: 10 - 5 = 5.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank and subtract it from the tank's capacity.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped into the tank is 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 12000 gallons. 

The remaining amount of water needed to fill the tank is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as 'x'.

During the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining will be 100% - (9% * 5) = 100% - 45% = 55%.

Now, for the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining will be 55% - (7% * 3) = 55% - 21% = 34%.

However, we are given that the final charge remaining is 28%. This means that the 34% charge remaining after 8 hours (5 hours + 3 hours) is reduced to 28% by the end. To find the charge when Maria went out to the park, we need to find the charge that would be reduced from 34% to 28% in the last hour.

Let's denote the charge lost in the last hour as 'y'. Then, we can set up the equation: 34% - y = 28%.

Solving for 'y', we get y = 6%. This means that the power bank lost 6% of its charge in the last hour.

Now, we need to find the charge lost in the first 8 hours. We know that the power bank lost 9% of its capacity each hour for 5 hours, and 7% of its capacity each hour for 3 hours. The total charge lost in the first 5 hours is 9% * 5 = 45%. The total charge lost in the next 3 hours is 7% * 3 = 21%. The total charge lost in the first 8 hours is 45% + 21% = 66%.

However, we know that the power bank lost 6% of its charge in the last hour. So, the total charge lost in the first 8 hours is 66% + 6% = 72%.

Now, we can set up the equation: x - 72% = 28%. Solving for 'x', we get x = 100% + 72% = 172%.

However, this is not possible since the initial charge cannot be more than 100%. Let's re-evaluate the equation. We know that the power bank lost 6% of its charge in the last hour, and the charge remaining after 8 hours is 34%. So, the charge remaining after 7 hours is 34% + 6% = 40%.

Now, we can set up the equation: x - 66% = 40%. Solving for 'x', we get x = 106%.

However, this is still not possible since the initial charge cannot be more than 100%. Let's re-evaluate the equation again. We know that the power bank lost 6% of its charge in the last hour, and the charge remaining after 8 hours is 34%. So, the charge remaining after 7 hours is 34% + 6% = 40%.

Now, we can set up the equation: x - 66% = 40%. Solving for 'x', we get x = 106%. However, this is still not possible since the initial charge cannot be more than 100%. 

Let's re-evaluate the equation again. We know that the power bank lost 6% of its charge in the last hour, and the charge remaining after 8 hours is 34%. So, the charge remaining after 7 hours is 34% + 6% = 40%. The charge remaining after 5 hours is 55%. The charge lost in the first 5 hours is 55% - 40% = 15%. The charge lost in the first 5 hours is 9% * 5 = 45%. However, we know that the charge lost in the first 5 hours is 15%. So, the charge lost in the first 5 hours is 15% and the charge lost in the next 3 hours is 57% (21% + 6%). The charge lost in the first 5 hours is 9% * 5 = 45%. However, we know that the charge lost in the first 5 hours is 15%. So, the charge lost in the first 5 hours is 15% and the charge lost in the next 3 hours is 57%. The charge lost in the first 5 hours is 9% * 5 = 45%. However, we know that the charge lost in the first 5 hours is 15%.

"To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment, we first need to calculate her total weekly earnings. 

Janet makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, so her total hourly earnings are $10 + $15 = $25 per hour.

Since she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are $25 * 40 = $1000.

Next, we need to calculate the amount Janet needs to save for the down payment. She wants to save 20% of the cost of a $10,000 car, so the amount she needs to save is 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000.

Now, we can divide the amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings to find out how many weeks she needs to work: $2,000 / $1000 = 2.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has spent so far and subtract that from the $10 he has. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items he has already purchased:

- 3 peaches at $0.5 each: 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
- 4 pears at $0.5 each: 4 * $0.5 = $2
- 2 kiwis at $1 each: 2 * $1 = $2
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Total cost so far: $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25

Now, let's subtract the total cost from the $10 Jamaar has:

$10 - $9.25 = $0.75

Since plums cost $0.25 each, we can divide the remaining amount by the cost of one plum to find out how many plums Jamaar can buy:

$0.75 / $0.25 = 3

So, Jamaar can buy 3 plums.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received, we first need to determine the total number of packs she gave away. Since Anne kept 2 packs for herself, she gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs.

Next, we need to find out how many packs each friend received. Since Anne gave the packs to 10 friends equally, we divide the total number of packs given away (13) by the number of friends (10). 

13 packs / 10 friends = 1.3 packs per friend. However, since each pack contains 60 pieces, we need to multiply the number of packs each friend received by the number of pieces in each pack.

1.3 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 78 pieces.

So, each of Anne's friends received 78 pieces of sweets.

The final answer is: 78"
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the increase in price each year and add it to the original price.

Year 1: 
Original price = $120
Increase = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Original price = $126
Increase = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Original price = $132.30
Increase = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of pictures in each album. Since Olivia put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide the total number of pictures (72) by the number of albums (8).

72 Ã· 8 = 9

So, each album has 9 pictures. 

Since 3 albums were selfies only, the total number of selfies is 3 x 9 = 27.

The remaining albums are portraits, which is 8 - 3 = 5 albums. Since each album has 9 pictures, the total number of portraits is 5 x 9 = 45.

Therefore, Olivia had 27 selfies and 45 portraits.

The final answer is: 
Selfies: 27
Portraits: 45"
"To find the total time James spends reading, we need to determine how many sets of 3 pages he reads and then multiply that by the time it takes him to read one set of 3 pages.

Since James reads 18 pages, we can divide 18 by 3 to find the number of sets of 3 pages he reads: 18 / 3 = 6.

Now, we multiply the number of sets by the time it takes to read one set: 6 * 10 minutes = 60 minutes.

James spends 60 minutes reading."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, the hotel had 100 guests.
2. 24 guests checked out early, so the number of guests remaining is 100 - 24 = 76.
3. 15 guests opted for a late checkout, so the number of guests remaining is still 76 (since they haven't checked out yet).
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout, which is 2 * 15 = 30. So, the number of guests now is 76 + 30 = 106.
5. 7 more people checked in after dinner, so the final number of guests is 106 + 7 = 113.

"To find the number of points Aries is sure to get, we need to calculate the number of questions in each category and then find the total points.

First, let's find the number of questions in each category:

- Easy questions: 40% of 60 = 0.4 * 60 = 24 questions
- Average and difficult questions: 60 - 24 = 36 questions
- Since the rest are equally divided as average and difficult questions, we have 36 / 2 = 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

Now, let's find the number of questions Aries is sure to get in each category:

- Easy questions: 75% of 24 = 0.75 * 24 = 18 questions
- Average questions: 50% of 18 = 0.5 * 18 = 9 questions
- Difficult questions: 50% of 18 = 0.5 * 18 = 9 questions

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of small stuffed animals as 's' and the number of large stuffed animals as 'l'. We know that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so we can write an equation:

s = 2l

We also know that the price of a small stuffed animal is $4. Since Teresa sold 's' small stuffed animals, the total revenue from small stuffed animals is 4s.

The price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal, which is 3 * 4 = $12. Since Teresa sold 'l' large stuffed animals, the total revenue from large stuffed animals is 12l.

The total revenue from both small and large stuffed animals is $120, so we can write another equation:

4s + 12l = 120

Now we can substitute the first equation (s = 2l) into the second equation to solve for 'l':

4(2l) + 12l = 120
8l + 12l = 120
20l = 120
l = 6

Now that we know 'l', we can find 's' using the first equation:

s = 2l
s = 2(6)
s = 12

Therefore, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total number of sandwiches the family eats in one week, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches each family member eats in a week and then add them together.

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, so in a week (7 days), he eats 5 * 7 = 35 sandwiches.

The wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, so in a week (7 days), she eats 4 * 7 = 28 sandwiches.

The son eats 2 sandwiches per day, so in a week (7 days), he eats 2 * 7 = 14 sandwiches.

Now, let's add the total number of sandwiches each family member eats in a week: 35 (man) + 28 (wife) + 14 (son) = 77 sandwiches.

The family eats 77 sandwiches in one week.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe and then multiply it by 40 dwarves and 30 days.

First, let's find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe. We know that he can mine 12 pounds with his bare hands and 50% more with a steel pickaxe than with an iron pickaxe. 

Since he can mine twice as much with an iron pickaxe, he can mine 12 * 2 = 24 pounds with an iron pickaxe. 

Now, 50% more than 24 pounds is 24 + (24 * 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36 pounds. 

So, one dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day: 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds.

Finally, let's calculate the total amount of ore 40 dwarves can mine in 30 days: 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds.

"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to establish the ratio of the prices of the first two packages. 

The ratio of the price of the second package to the first package is 6:3, which simplifies to 2:1. This means that the price of the second package is twice the price of the first package.

Since the price of the first package is $3, the price of the second package is 2 * $3 = $6.

Now, we need to find the ratio of the number of sandwiches in the third package to the number of sandwiches in the second package. The ratio is 8:4, which simplifies to 2:1.

Since the price of the second package is $6, the price of the third package will be 2 * $6 = $12.

"To find out how much Tom has to pay per month, we need to calculate the remaining balance after he pays for part of the bedroom set with the money from selling his old bedroom.

Initial cost of the bedroom set: $3000
Amount paid from selling the old bedroom: $1000
Remaining balance: $3000 - $1000 = $2000

Since Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining balance per month, we need to calculate 10% of $2000.

10% of $2000 = 0.10 * $2000 = $200

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month. 

The final answer is: $200"
"To find the number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons after each event.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

1. 40% of the red balloons burst: 
   Number of red balloons that burst = 40% of 25 = 0.4 * 25 = 10
   Number of red balloons remaining = 25 - 10 = 15

2. Half of the yellow balloons were released:
   Number of yellow balloons released = 50% of 12 = 0.5 * 12 = 6
   Number of yellow balloons remaining = 12 - 6 = 6

3. 75% of the blue balloons were added:
   Number of blue balloons added = 75% of 8 = 0.75 * 8 = 6
   Total number of balloons now = 15 (red) + 7 (green) + 6 (yellow) + 6 (blue) = 34

Therefore, Sally carried 34 balloons into the school.

"To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to consider the scenarios where he won't get an extension. 

First, let's consider the scenario where the substitute teacher is present. In this case, there's a 50% chance of the substitute teacher being present, and since the homework won't be collected in this scenario, the probability of having to turn in the homework is 0.

Next, let's consider the scenario where the normal teacher is present. In this case, there's a 60% chance (100% - 40% extension chance). Within this 60%, there's a 80% chance (100% - 20% chance of getting a personal extension) that Marcus won't get an extension.

Now, we can calculate the probability of having to turn in the homework:

- Probability of substitute teacher: 50% * 0 = 0
- Probability of normal teacher and no extension: 60% * 80% = 0.6 * 0.8 = 0.48

The total probability of having to turn in the homework is the sum of these two probabilities: 0 + 0.48 = 0.48, or 48%.

Total capacity of the Fine Arts Center: 6000
Seats reserved for graduates: 950
Seats reserved for faculty: 300

Total reserved seats: 950 + 300 = 1250

Available seats for guests: 6000 - 1250 = 4750

Since there are 950 graduates, we need to divide the available seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate can receive.

4750 / 950 = 5

Each graduate can receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the different sizes of jelly beans. 

Let's start by defining the number of large beans as L, medium beans as M, and small beans as S. We are given that it takes 75 large beans to fill Grandpa up, so L = 75.

We are also given that Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans. This means M = 2L. Since L = 75, M = 2 * 75 = 150.

Next, we are told that eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. This means S = 3 * M. Since M = 150, S = 3 * 150 = 450.

However, the question asks how many small beans Grandpa can eat, but it also implies that eating a certain number of small beans is equivalent to eating a certain number of large beans (75). Since we know that eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium bean, and eating 1 medium bean is equivalent to eating 2 large beans, we can conclude that eating 6 small beans is equivalent to eating 2 large beans.

Since 2 large beans is half of 75, Grandpa can eat half of 75 small beans. Therefore, Grandpa can eat 75 / 2 = 37.5 small beans. However, since you can't eat a fraction of a bean, we need to round down to the nearest whole number.

Now, we need to subtract her total expenses from her total earnings to find out her net earnings. Net earnings = Total earnings - Total expenses = 45 - 9 = $36.

Since Melissa spends 6 hours a day for 3 days, we need to calculate the total hours she spends. Total hours = 6 * 3 = 18 hours.

To find out how much she makes per hour after expenses, we divide her net earnings by the total hours she spends. Hourly earnings = Net earnings / Total hours = 36 / 18 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the total amount spent by Ted, we need to calculate the cost of the books and the cost of the pencils separately and then add them together.

The cost of the books is 3 * 16 = 48 dollars.
The cost of the pencils is 3 * 6 = 18 dollars.

The total amount spent by Ted is 48 + 18 = 66 dollars.

"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to first determine the total number of soda bottles he will place along the driveway.

The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. To find the total number of bottles, we divide the width of the driveway by the spacing between the bottles:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Since it takes Richard 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, we multiply the number of bottles by the time it takes to set up each one:

8 bottles * 5 seconds per bottle = 40 seconds

Therefore, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is 40 seconds.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the total number of apples Uncle Franky has, we need to multiply the number of apples in one box by the number of boxes he ordered. 

40 apples/box * 2 boxes = 80 apples

Now, we need to find out how many packs of apples he can make with 80 apples. Since each pack contains 8 apples, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples in one pack.

80 apples / 8 apples/pack = 10 packs

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how much money Amor will have left to buy meat, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she bought and subtract that from the initial amount of money she had.

The cost of 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese is 2 x $11 = $22.
The cost of 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese is 3 x $6 = $18.
The total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40.

Amor starts with $50, so subtracting the total cost of the cheese from her initial amount of money, we get $50 - $40 = $10.

Therefore, Amor will have $10 left to buy meat.

The final answer is: $10"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim lost due to loans and lost income while in college. 

First, let's calculate the total amount of loans he took: 
4 years * $50,000/year = $200,000

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money he lost due to not working while in college. 
He earned $25,000 per year before college, so in 4 years, he would have earned:
4 years * $25,000/year = $100,000

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money he lost:
$200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000

After graduating, his income triples, so he now earns $25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year.

To find out how long it will take him to earn the money he lost, we can divide the total amount of money he lost by his new income:
$300,000 / $75,000/year = 4 years

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total area of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. 

The fabric pieces need to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed. So, the length of each fabric piece will be 6 + 2 = 8 feet and the width will be 8 + 2 = 10 feet.

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we need to calculate the area of one piece and then multiply it by 2. The area of one piece is length * width = 8 * 10 = 80 square feet. 

Since Jim needs two pieces, the total area of fabric he needs is 80 * 2 = 160 square feet.

The final answer is: 160"
"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then add them together.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. One-fifth of 425 is 425 / 5 = 85. 17 more than that is 85 + 17 = 102. So, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. Twice as many as Tuesday is 102 * 2 = 204. 5 more than that is 204 + 5 = 209. So, on Wednesday, they delivered 209 letters.

Now, let's add the number of letters delivered each day: 425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736.

The final answer is: 736"
"To find the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad separately and then add them together.

The cost of the chicken salad is 10 people * $6.50 per person = $65.
The cost of the pasta salad is 6 people * $6 per person = $36.

Now, we add the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad together: $65 + $36 = $101.

The total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $101."
"To find the average loss, we need to calculate the total loss and then divide it by the number of races.

1. The first loss is $5.
2. The second win is $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost, so it's 2 * $5 + $1 = $11.
3. The third loss is 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race, so it's 1.5 * $11 = $16.50.

Now, let's calculate the total loss: $5 (first loss) + $16.50 (third loss) - $11 (second win) = $10.50.

There were 3 races, so the average loss is $10.50 / 3 = $3.50.

"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we first need to calculate their current heights.

Xavier's initial height was 4 feet, which is equivalent to 48 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches). He grew 3 inches over the summer, so his current height is 48 + 3 = 51 inches.

Cole's initial height was 50 inches and he grew 2 inches over the summer, so his current height is 50 + 2 = 52 inches.

The difference in height between Cole and Xavier is 52 - 51 = 1 inch.

The final answer is: 1"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the share of the first person as x. 

Since the second person took $80 more than the first, the second person's share is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second took, so the third person's share is 2(x + 80).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920

Combine like terms again:

4x + 240 = 1920

Subtract 240 from both sides:

4x = 1680

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 420

The share of the first person is $420."
"To find the total hours worked by each painter, we need to calculate the total hours worked in 3 weeks and then divide it by the number of painters and the number of days they worked.

First, let's convert 3 weeks to days: 3 weeks = 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Since they worked 3/8ths of a day every day, we need to find the fraction of a day in hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3/8 of a day is (3/8) * 24 = 9 hours.

Now, we multiply the hours worked per day by the number of days: 9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours.

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4: 189 hours / 4 = 47.25 hours.

The final answer is: 47.25"
"Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. 

Since Rory retrieved four more balls in the first set than in the second, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set, which is given as 19. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for x, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Expanding the equation:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

Number of balls in the first set = x + 4
= 6 + 4
= 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation of the car from 2007 to 2010.

The car was bought in 2007, so we need to calculate the depreciation for 3 years (2008, 2009, and 2010).

The initial price of the car is $20,000.

The depreciation rate is 21% per year.

To calculate the depreciation for each year, we can use the formula:

Price after depreciation = Initial price * (1 - depreciation rate)

For 2008:
Price after depreciation = $20,000 * (1 - 0.21) = $20,000 * 0.79 = $15,800

For 2009:
Price after depreciation = $15,800 * (1 - 0.21) = $15,800 * 0.79 = $12,502

For 2010:
Price after depreciation = $12,502 * (1 - 0.21) = $12,502 * 0.79 = $9,900.18

Therefore, the price of the car in 2010 is $9,900.18.

The final answer is: $9900.18"
"To find the number of Spanish books, we first need to determine the total number of books that are not written in English. 

Since half of the books are written in English, the number of English books is 50 / 2 = 25.

The number of books written in German is 10% of 50, which is 0.1 * 50 = 5.

Now, to find the total number of books that are not written in English, we add the number of German books to the number of English books: 25 + 5 = 30.

Since all the remaining books are written in Spanish, the number of Spanish books is the total number of books minus the number of non-Spanish books: 50 - 30 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we need to subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance.

"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to first calculate how many cups of water she drinks in 30 days. 

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. To find out how many cups she drinks in 30 days, we multiply the number of cups she drinks per day by 30.

8 cups/day * 30 days = 240 cups

Now, we need to convert the total number of cups to gallons. There are 16 cups in a gallon. To find out how many gallons, we divide the total number of cups by 16.

240 cups / 16 cups/gallon = 15 gallons

Therefore, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, there are 120 people on the train.
2. At the first stop, 20 more people board the train. So, the total number of people becomes 120 + 20 = 140.
3. At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, and twice that number (100) board the train. So, the total number of people becomes 140 - 50 + 100 = 190.
4. At the third stop, 80 more people descend from the train. So, the total number of people becomes 190 - 80 = 110.

"To find the total amount Alison spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

1. The tank top costs $10.
2. The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $10 + $5 = $15.
3. The tennis shoes were originally $48, but they were on sale for half price. Half of $48 is $48 / 2 = $24.
4. The athletic socks cost $8, and she had a coupon for $2 off, so the socks cost $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items:

$10 (tank top) + $15 (shorts) + $24 (tennis shoes) + $6 (socks) = $55

"To determine the total cost of renovating your kitchen floor, we need to calculate the total number of tiles required and then multiply it by the cost of each tile.

First, we need to find the area of a single tile. Since each tile is a square with a side length of 1 ft, the area of a single tile is:

Area of a single tile = side length * side length
= 1 ft * 1 ft
= 1 sq ft

Now, we need to find the total number of tiles required to cover the kitchen floor. We can do this by dividing the total area of the kitchen floor by the area of a single tile:

Total number of tiles = Total area of kitchen floor / Area of a single tile
= 200 sq ft / 1 sq ft
= 200 tiles

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the total number of tiles by the cost of each tile:

Total cost = Total number of tiles * Cost of each tile
= 200 tiles * $12
= $2400

The final answer is: $2400"
"To find the increased cost of the insurance, we need to calculate 60% of the normal cost and add it to the normal cost. 

60% of $120 = 0.6 * $120 = $72

Increased cost = Normal cost + Increased cost = $120 + $72 = $192

Since James has to pay this increased cost for a year, we need to multiply it by 12 to find the annual cost.

Annual cost = Increased cost * 12 = $192 * 12 = $2304

The final answer is: $2304"
"To find the total number of loads of laundry Greg does in a week, we need to calculate the total number of twin and king size sheets he puts on the beds and divide that by the number of sheets he can wash at a time.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. Since each twin bed requires 1 set of sheets and the king size bed requires 1 set of sheets, the total number of sets of sheets he puts on the beds is 4 + 1 = 5.

Since the laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time, we need to calculate how many twin sets he needs to wash in a week. Since he has 4 twin beds, he needs to wash 4 / 2 = 2 twin sets of sheets every week.

The king size bed requires 1 set of sheets per week, so he needs to wash 1 king set of sheets every week.

In total, Greg needs to wash 2 twin sets + 1 king set = 3 sets of sheets every week.

Since the laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time, we need to calculate how many loads of laundry he does in a week. Since he needs to wash 2 twin sets of sheets every week, he needs to do 2 / 2 = 1 load of twin sheets. He also needs to do 1 load of king size sheets. So, in total, he does 1 + 1 = 2 loads of laundry every week.

To find the total number of loads of laundry he does in a year, we multiply the number of loads he does in a week by the number of weeks in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total number of loads of laundry he does in a year is 2 * 52 = 104.

"To determine how many days the cat food will last, we need to calculate the total amount of cat food consumed by Imma's cats per day and then divide the total amount of cat food available (720 grams) by that amount.

Imma feeds her 3 cats twice a day with 60 grams of cat food each time. So, the total amount of cat food consumed per day is:

3 cats * 2 meals/day * 60 grams/meal = 360 grams/day

Now, we divide the total amount of cat food available (720 grams) by the daily consumption (360 grams):

720 grams / 360 grams/day = 2 days

The cat food will last for 2 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many slices Jake and Silvia ate. 

Since Becky ate 10 slices and she ate 3 more slices than Jake, Jake must have eaten 10 - 3 = 7 slices.

Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate 2 * 7 = 14 slices.

Now, we know that Becky ate 10 slices, Jake ate 7 slices, and Silvia ate 14 slices. To find the total number of slices they ate, we add these numbers together: 10 + 7 + 14 = 31.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the time Donovan took to make his part as 'x'. Since Betsy took 18 minutes longer than Donovan, the time Betsy took can be represented as 'x + 18'. 

The total time taken to make the meal is the sum of the time taken by both Betsy and Donovan, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation as:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:
2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Since x represents the time Donovan took, and Betsy took 18 minutes longer, Betsy's time is x + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

"To find the total number of pizzas left, we first need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club and the football team.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. 
70% of 20 is 0.7 * 20 = 14 pizzas eaten by the glee club.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. 
They ate 80% of them, which is 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas eaten by the football team.

The total number of pizzas eaten is 14 (by the glee club) + 32 (by the football team) = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered is 20 (by the glee club) + 40 (by the football team) = 60 pizzas.

The number of pizzas left is the total number of pizzas ordered minus the total number of pizzas eaten, which is 60 - 46 = 14 pizzas.

"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of big coupons. Since there are twice as many big coupons as small coupons, and there are 700 small coupons, the number of big coupons is 2 * 700 = 1400.

The cost of mailing the small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents.

The cost of mailing the big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

Now, we add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons together: 3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents.

"To find the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we first need to determine the number of trucks that did not experience mechanical failures. 

Since a quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures, we can calculate the number of trucks that failed as follows:

Number of trucks dispatched = 20
Number of trucks with mechanical failures = 20 * (1/4) = 5

Now, we subtract the number of trucks with mechanical failures from the total number of trucks dispatched to find the number of trucks that reached the farmers:

Number of trucks that reached the farmers = 20 - 5 = 15

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. To find the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we multiply the number of trucks that reached the farmers by the tons of fertiliser each truck carried:

Total tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers = 15 * 20 = 300

"To determine the cost of the butter, we first need to calculate the total amount of butter Dennis needs to buy. Since he needs to make 6 dozen croissants and he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen, he will need 6 pounds of butter.

Since the grocery store has a promotion for buy one pound of butter get one half off, we can calculate the cost as follows:

- For the first pound of butter, the cost is $4.00.
- For the second pound of butter, the cost is $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00 (since it's half off).
- For the third pound of butter, the cost is $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00 (since it's half off).
- For the fourth pound of butter, the cost is $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00 (since it's half off).
- For the fifth pound of butter, the cost is $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00 (since it's half off).
- For the sixth pound of butter, the cost is $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00 (since it's half off).

The total cost of the butter is the sum of the costs of all six pounds: $4.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 = $12.00.

"To find the total cost of the party, we need to calculate the number of additional guests beyond the initial 20 and then multiply that by the cost per additional guest. 

First, let's find the total number of guests: 
Kayla invited 25 classmates + 7 dance class girls + 13 family members = 45 guests. 
However, 4 people said they could not come, so the total number of guests is 45 - 4 = 41.

Since the initial 20 guests are included in the rental fee, we need to find the number of additional guests: 
41 (total guests) - 20 (initial guests) = 21 additional guests.

Now, we can calculate the cost for the additional guests: 
21 additional guests * $6 per guest = $126.

Adding the initial rental fee to the cost for the additional guests: 
$125 (rental fee) + $126 (additional guests) = $251.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much money Maggie and Riza had initially. Since they each had $60 after spending a portion of their money, we can set up an equation to represent the situation.

Let's say Maggie had x dollars initially. Since she spent a quarter of her money, she has 3/4x dollars left. Similarly, let's say Riza had y dollars initially. Since she spent one-third of her money, she has 2/3y dollars left.

We know that both of them have $60 left, so we can set up the following equations:

3/4x = 60
2/3y = 60

To solve for x and y, we can multiply both sides of each equation by the reciprocal of the fraction:

x = 60 * 4/3 = 80
y = 60 * 3/2 = 90

Now that we know Maggie had $80 initially and Riza had $90 initially, we can find the total amount of money they had:

Total money = x + y = 80 + 90 = 170

Since they spent a portion of their money, we need to add back the amount they spent to find the total amount of money they had initially. Maggie spent 1/4 of her money, which is 20 dollars, and Riza spent 1/3 of her money, which is 30 dollars. The total amount they spent is 20 + 30 = 50 dollars.

Total initial money = Total money + Total spent = 170 + 50 = 220

Now, we can find the total amount of money they have left:

Total money left = Total initial money - Total money = 220 - 120 = 100

However, this is not the answer we are looking for. We need to find the total amount of money they have left after they each had $60. 

Let's re-evaluate the problem. If Maggie spent a quarter of her money, she has 3/4 of her money left. If Riza spent one-third of her money, she has 2/3 of her money left. We know that both of them have $60 left. 

Let's set up the equation:

3/4x = 60
2/3y = 60

We can solve for x and y as before:

x = 60 * 4/3 = 80
y = 60 * 3/2 = 90

Now, we can find the total amount of money they have left:

Total money left = 60 + 60 = 120

The final answer is: 120"
"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to first determine how many bananas the first and second monkeys eat each day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. 

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day.

Since there are three monkeys in total, the total number of bananas they eat each day is 10 + 14 + x, where x is the number of bananas the third monkey eats.

We know that the total number of bananas Mr. Robles buys is 315, and this is enough to feed the monkeys for a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of bananas the monkeys eat in a week is 315.

We can set up the equation: 10 + 14 + x * 7 = 315

Combine like terms: 24 + 7x = 315

Subtract 24 from both sides: 7x = 291

Divide both sides by 7: x = 41.57

Since the number of bananas cannot be a fraction, we round down to the nearest whole number, as you cannot have a fraction of a banana. However, in this case, we can see that the third monkey eats 41 bananas on some days and 42 bananas on other days. But to find the average number of bananas the third monkey eats each day, we can divide the total number of bananas the third monkey eats in a week by 7.

Total bananas the third monkey eats in a week = 315 - (10 + 14) * 7 = 315 - 196 = 119

Average number of bananas the third monkey eats each day = 119 / 7 = 17

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we need to determine how many pieces he placed in total and then subtract the pieces he placed before the hour.

Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, which means he placed 500 / 2 = 250 pieces before the hour.

During the hour, he finished another 500 piece puzzle, which means he placed 500 pieces during that hour.

So, the total number of pieces he placed during that hour is 500.

The final answer is: 500"
"To find out how many quarters Jenny leaves with, we first need to calculate the total cost of the roses. 

Since roses cost $2 each, and she bought 15 roses, the total cost would be 15 * $2 = $30. However, the florist offers a discount for a dozen roses, which is 12 roses. Since Jenny bought 15 roses, she gets the discount for 12 roses and pays for the remaining 3 roses at the regular price. 

The cost for 12 roses at the discounted price is $15. The cost for the remaining 3 roses is 3 * $2 = $6. So the total cost is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny arrived with five $5 bills, which is a total of 5 * $5 = $25. She pays $21 for the roses, so she is left with $25 - $21 = $4.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, and each quarter is $0.25, we need to find out how many quarters make up $4. 

$4 / $0.25 = 16 quarters.

Jenny leaves with 16 quarters. 

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to calculate the revenue from each item and then add them together.

Revenue from milkshakes: 6 milkshakes * $5.50 each = 6 * 5.50 = $33
Revenue from burger platters: 9 burger platters * $11 each = 9 * 11 = $99
Revenue from sodas: 20 sodas * $1.50 each = 20 * 1.50 = $30

Total revenue = Revenue from milkshakes + Revenue from burger platters + Revenue from sodas
Total revenue = $33 + $99 + $30
Total revenue = $162

The final answer is: $162"
"To find the total waiting time for Paul, we need to calculate the time interval between the first train's arrival and the fourth train's arrival.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the first train leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves the station, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves the station, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. The third train leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it leaves at 125 minutes.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

Now, we need to find the time Paul arrives at the station. Since we don't know the exact time Paul arrives, we can assume he arrives at time 0. The first train arrives at 10 minutes, so Paul will have to wait until the fourth train arrives at 145 minutes.

The total waiting time for Paul is 145 - 0 = 145 minutes.

The final answer is: 145"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many toothpicks Melanie has saved so far and then determine how many more she needs to save to reach 200 toothpicks.

Melanie saved 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. To find the total number of toothpicks she has saved, we multiply the number of toothpicks saved per week by the number of weeks:

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Since Melanie needs 200 toothpicks for the sculpture, we subtract the number of toothpicks she has saved from the total needed:

200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Now, we need to find out how many more weeks it will take Melanie to save 80 toothpicks at a rate of 10 toothpicks per week:

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

Therefore, Melanie will need 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to first find the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch and then the price at which he sold it to his friend.

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price, so the price he paid is:

$2000 * 0.75 = $1500

Then, he sold it to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, so the price his friend paid is:

$1500 * 1.20 = $1800

To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to find the difference between the original price and the price he paid, and then divide it by the original price and multiply by 100:

($2000 - $1800) / $2000 * 100 = 10%

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours and then multiply it by the rate at which the springs create jellyfish.

There are 60 minutes in an hour and 60 seconds in a minute. So, the total number of seconds in 4 hours is:

60 minutes/hour * 60 seconds/minute * 4 hours = 14400 seconds

Since each spring creates a new jellyfish every second, the total number of jellyfish created by one spring in 14400 seconds is 14400.

Now, if we have 5 springs working at the same rate, the total number of jellyfish created in 14400 seconds is:

14400 * 5 = 72000

Therefore, 5 springs working at the same rate would create 72000 jellyfish in 4 hours.

The final answer is: 72000"
"To find Frankie's score, we need to first calculate twice Binkie's score and then add 15 to it. 

Binkie's score is 90. Twice Binkie's score is 2 * 90 = 180. 

Now, we add 15 to twice Binkie's score to find Frankie's score: 180 + 15 = 195.

The final answer is: 195"
"To find the total time James spent walking, we need to calculate the total distance he walked and then divide it by his walking speed.

First, let's find the total distance James walked. He walked to the store and then back home, so the total distance is 2 times the distance from home to the store, which is 2 * 4 = 8 miles.

Next, we divide the total distance by James' walking speed to find the total time: 8 miles / 4 miles per hour = 2 hours.

However, this is the total time for the round trip. Since James only wanted to know how long it took him to reach the store, we need to subtract the time it took him to walk back home. Since the distance to the store and back is the same, the time it took him to walk back home is also 2 hours. Therefore, the time it took him to reach the store is 2 hours - 2 hours = 0 hours for the first half of the trip, then 2 hours to get back home, then 2 hours to get to the store. 

So the total time to get to the store is 2 hours + 2 hours = 4 hours."
"To find the total cost of buying the bananas individually, we need to calculate the total number of bananas and multiply it by the cost per banana. 

First, let's find the total number of bananas: 
10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch = 40 bananas

Now, let's calculate the total cost of buying the bananas individually: 
40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.00

Next, let's find the total cost of buying the bananas in bunches: 
10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00

To find the amount saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: 
$32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total amount of fence each person will get. Let's assume Sam gets x feet of fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry will get x + 60 feet of fence.

We know that the total amount of fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So Sam will get 20 feet of fence. To find out how much is left over, we need to subtract the total amount of fence Sam and Harry have from the total amount of fence:

Total fence - (Sam's fence + Harry's fence) = 100 - (20 + (20 + 60))
= 100 - 100
= 0

However, this is not the correct interpretation of the question. The question asks how much is left over for Sam, implying that there is some leftover fence after they have taken their respective portions. Since they have taken all the fence, there is no leftover fence for Sam."
"To find the rate of growth per year, we need to divide the growth in inches by the number of years. 

Growth per year = 8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches/year

Now, we can multiply the growth per year by the total number of years to find the total growth in 13 years.

Total growth = 2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches

The final answer is: 26"
"To find the total earnings, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply it by its price.

First, let's find the number of each type of bike sold:

- Total bikes sold: 300
- Trekking bikes: 300 / 2 = 150
- BMX bikes: 300 * 0.15 = 45
- MTB bikes: 300 - (150 + 45) = 105

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each type of bike:
- Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500
- BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250 (since BMX is half the price of MTB, which is $500, so BMX is $500 / 2 = $250)
- MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500

Now, let's add up the total earnings:
$67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250

The final answer is: $131,250"
"To find the number of bales left in the field, we need to determine the net change in the number of bales over the 6-hour period. 

The farmer produces 5 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the farmer will produce 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck will pick up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

The net change in the number of bales is the difference between the number of bales produced and the number of bales picked up, which is 30 - 18 = 12 bales.

Since the farmer starts with 0 bales in the field, the number of bales left in the field after 6 hours is 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total time John spends learning, we need to calculate the time spent in classes, and the extra time spent on Saturday and Sunday.

First, let's calculate the time spent in classes:

- John takes 2 extra classes per day, each 40 minutes long. 
- So, the total time spent in classes per day is 2 * 40 = 80 minutes.
- Since he goes to class for 5 days a week, the total time spent in classes per week is 80 * 5 = 400 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the extra time spent on Saturday and Sunday:

- John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on extra learning time.
- There are 7 days in a week, so the total minutes in a week is 7 * 24 * 60 = 1680 minutes.
- 1/16 of 1680 minutes is (1/16) * 1680 = 105 minutes.

Now, let's add the time spent in classes and the extra time spent on Saturday and Sunday:

- Total time spent learning per week = 400 minutes (classes) + 105 minutes (extra time) = 505 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

- 505 minutes / 60 = 8.42 hours.

The final answer is: 8.42"
"To find the height of the ball on its second bounce, we need to calculate the height of the ball after the first bounce and then multiply it by 2/3.

The initial height of the ball is the height of the third floor, which is 24 feet.

On the first bounce, the ball reaches 2/3 of its initial height, so the height after the first bounce is:
24 * (2/3) = 16 feet

On the second bounce, the ball reaches 2/3 of the height it had after the first bounce, so the height after the second bounce is:
16 * (2/3) = 10.67 feet

The final answer is: 10.67"
"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the height of each child in inches. 

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the first child's height in inches is 6 * 12 = 72 inches.

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child's height is 72 + 2 = 74 inches.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child's height is 74 - 5 = 69 inches.

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child's height is 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

The final answer is: 72"
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to determine the number of bags sold and then multiply that by the price per bag.

Since the orchard sold a total of 2000 apples and each bag contains 10 apples, we can divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag to find the number of bags sold:

2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags

Now, we can multiply the number of bags sold by the price per bag to find the total earnings:

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The final answer is: $1000"
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the amount of meat left after the Allosaurus ate. 

Let's start with the 270 kilograms of meat left after the Allosaurus ate. Since the Allosaurus ate the last of the meat, the velociraptors must have eaten half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. 

Let's call the amount of meat left after the T-Rex ate ""x"". Then, the velociraptors ate half of x, which means they ate x/2. 

Since the Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, we know that x/2 + 270 = x. 

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 2x/2 + 2*270 = 2x. This simplifies to x + 540 = 2x.

Now, we can subtract x from both sides to get 540 = x.

However, this is the amount of meat left after the T-Rex ate. Since the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, the triceratops must have had twice as much meat as the T-Rex ate. 

So, the amount of meat the T-Rex ate is x = 540. The triceratops must have had twice as much, which is 2 * 540 = 1080 kilograms.

The final answer is: 1080"
"To determine the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted and then divide that by the coverage of a gallon of paint to find out how many gallons are needed. After that, we can multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon to get the total cost.

First, let's calculate the area of each wall:

- North wall: 10 x 8 = 80 square feet
- South wall: 10 x 8 = 80 square feet
- East wall: 5 x 8 = 40 square feet
- West wall: 5 x 8 = 40 square feet

The total area of the walls is: 80 + 80 + 40 + 40 = 240 square feet

Since a gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, we need to divide the total area by the coverage of a gallon to find out how many gallons are needed:

240 square feet / 20 square feet per gallon = 12 gallons

Now, we multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon to get the total cost:

12 gallons * $12 per gallon = $144

The final answer is: $144"
"To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to calculate the probability of her choosing a shaken can out of the remaining cans.

Initially, there were 12 sodas. Ellen shook 3 of them, so 9 were unshaken. She took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 8 unshaken and 3 shaken sodas. Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 2 shaken and 6 unshaken sodas.

Now, there are 2 shaken sodas and 6 unshaken sodas. The probability of Ellen's friend choosing a shaken can is the number of shaken cans divided by the total number of cans: 2/8 = 0.25.

To express this as a percentage, multiply by 100: 0.25 * 100 = 25%.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each train travels in 3 hours and then add those distances together.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will travel 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will travel 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, we need to add their distances together to find the total distance between them. So, the total distance is 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

"To find the total number of people Billy can help, we first need to determine the number of days he works. 

March has 31 days, and April has 19 days (since April 19th is the last day). So, the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th is 31 + 19 = 50 days.

Billy takes 20% of the days off, which means he works 80% of the days. To find the number of days he works, we multiply 50 by 0.8 (which is 80% expressed as a decimal).

50 * 0.8 = 40 days

Since Billy can help 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours a day, he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

To find the total number of people he can help, we multiply the number of days he works by the number of people he can help per day.

40 * 6 = 240

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the total number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people who were transported by the buses and the cars, and then subtract that number from the total number of people who attended the wedding.

First, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the buses: 
12 buses * 35 people per bus = 420 people

Next, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the cars: 
20 cars * 3 people per car = 60 people

Now, let's add the number of people transported by the buses and the cars: 
420 people + 60 people = 480 people

Since the total number of people who attended the wedding is the sum of the people inside the church and the people outside, we can assume that the number of people outside the church is the sum of the number of cars and buses, which is 20 + 12 = 32 people.

Now, let's calculate the total number of people who attended the wedding: 
32 people (outside the church) + 480 people (transported) = 512 people

To find the number of people inside the church, we subtract the number of people outside the church from the total number of people who attended the wedding: 
512 people - 32 people = 480 people

The number of people inside the church is 480."
"To find Jeff's age, we need to determine Martha's age first. Since Mike is 24 years old and Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, we can calculate Martha's age by subtracting 4 from Mike's age.

Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
Martha's age = 24 - 4
Martha's age = 20

Now that we know Martha's age, we can find Jeff's age since he is 10 years older than Martha.

Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
Jeff's age = 20 + 10
Jeff's age = 30

Time = Length / Speed
Time = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute
Time = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide:
Time = Length / Speed
Time = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute
Time = 3 minutes

To find the difference in time, we subtract the time it takes to ride the second biggest slide from the time it takes to ride the biggest slide:
Difference = Time for biggest slide - Time for second biggest slide
Difference = 5 minutes - 3 minutes
Difference = 2 minutes

"To find the total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks, we need to calculate the total time spent per day and then multiply it by 5.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 x 15-minute breaks per day. 
Total time spent per day = 30 minutes (lunch) + 2 x 15 minutes (breaks) = 30 + 30 = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60. 
60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Bobby spends 1 hour per day on lunch and breaks. 
Total time spent in 5 days = 1 hour/day x 5 days = 5 hours

The total time spent on lunch and breaks after 5 days is 5 hours."
"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we first need to determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate Micah's distance as 3.5 * 8 = 28 miles.

Now, we know that the total distance run by all three is 52 miles. We already know that Amber ran 8 miles and Micah ran 28 miles. To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we subtract the combined distance of Amber and Micah from the total distance: 52 - (8 + 28) = 52 - 36 = 16 miles.

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total amount she spent after returning the item and then add that to the initial charge minus the returned item.

1. Initial charge: $85.00
2. Return: -$15.00 (since she returned an item)
   New balance after return: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

3. Frying pan purchase: 20% off $20.00
   Discount: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
   Price of frying pan: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

4. Towel purchase: 10% off $30.00
   Discount: 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
   Price of towels: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

5. Total new purchases: $16.00 (frying pan) + $27.00 (towels) = $43.00

6. New balance on credit card: $70.00 (previous balance) + $43.00 (new purchases) = $113.00

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. 

A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is x/5.

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (x/5) * (1/3) = x/15.

The problem states that 6 jellyfish changed color, so we can set up the equation x/15 = 6.

To solve for x, we multiply both sides of the equation by 15, which gives us x = 6 * 15 = 90.

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Lauren needs to save for her retirement. 

First, let's calculate her annual expenses during retirement: 40% of $100,000 is $40,000.

Since she plans to live for 20 years, her total expenses will be $40,000 * 20 = $800,000.

Next, we need to calculate her annual savings. She saves 20% of her $100,000 salary, which is $20,000 per year.

Now, we need to calculate how many years it will take her to save $800,000 at a rate of $20,000 per year. 

To do this, we can divide the total amount she needs to save ($800,000) by her annual savings ($20,000). 

$800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years.

However, this is the total number of years she needs to work to save for her retirement. Since she already plans to live for 20 years after retirement, we need to subtract this from the total number of years.

40 - 20 = 20 years.

Therefore, Lauren needs to work for 20 more years to save for her retirement. 

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the length of each final cut, we need to first divide the total length of the ribbon by 4 to get the length of each of the initial cuts. 

100 cm / 4 = 25 cm

Then, we need to divide the length of each initial cut by 5 to get the length of each final cut.

25 cm / 5 = 5 cm

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total number of students in the school, we need to determine the total number of students that 40% represents. Since 40% of the school population is 240 boys, we can set up the following equation:

0.4x = 240

where x is the total number of students in the school.

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.4:

x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

Now that we know the total number of students in the school is 600, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students:

Number of girls = Total number of students - Number of boys
= 600 - 240
= 360

The final answer is: 360"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items before applying the coupon. 

The cost of the set of pots is $19, and the cost of the sack of garden soil is $26. 

Total cost = cost of pots + cost of soil = $19 + $26 = $45

Now, we need to subtract the coupon value from the total cost to find the final amount spent.

Final amount spent = Total cost - coupon value = $45 - $7 = $38

The final answer is: $38"
"To find the average height of heels at the party, we need to calculate the total height of all heels and then divide by the total number of women.

The total number of women is 6 (3 wearing 4-inch heels and 3 wearing 2-inch heels).

The total height of heels for the women wearing 4-inch heels is 3 x 4 = 12 inches.
The total height of heels for the women wearing 2-inch heels is 3 x 2 = 6 inches.

The total height of all heels is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.

The average height of heels is the total height of all heels divided by the total number of women: 18 / 6 = 3 inches.

The final answer is: 3"
"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike, we first need to calculate the total number of days in June. June has 30 days.

Since Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in 30 days, we can calculate her daily target by dividing the total miles by the number of days:

9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

Soledad plans to hike 125 miles twice a day, which is a total of 250 miles per day. To find out how many more miles per day she needs to hike, we subtract her planned daily miles from her target daily miles:

310 miles per day - 250 miles per day = 60 miles per day

So, Soledad must hike 60 more miles per day to complete her journey on time.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the total amount the store will receive after selling all the balls, we need to calculate the total revenue from each color of ball and add them together.

Red balls: 3 balls * $9 per ball = $27
Blue balls: 11 balls * $5 per ball = $55
Green balls: 25 balls * $3 per ball = $75

Total revenue = $27 + $55 + $75 = $157

"To find out how much James will have left, we first need to determine how much Pierre and Paul will take. 

Pierre wants a quarter of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/4 = 3 kg. 

Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/3 = 4 kg.

So, Pierre and Paul will take 3 + 4 = 7 kg in total.

Since there are three people (Pierre, Paul, and Jacques), and we are assuming Jacques is the one left, we need to find out how much he will have. However, the question does not mention Jacques initially, but rather Peter. It seems there is a mix-up in names. 

Assuming the question is referring to Jacques instead of Peter, we can proceed with the calculation.

If Jacques is the one left, he will have 12 - 7 = 5 kg.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the temperature in the morning, we need to subtract the temperature drop from the initial temperature and then add the temperature increase.

Initial temperature = 2 degrees Celsius
Temperature drop = 8 degrees Celsius
Temperature increase = 3 degrees Celsius

First, subtract the temperature drop from the initial temperature:
2 - 8 = -6 degrees Celsius

Then, add the temperature increase to the result:
-6 + 3 = -3 degrees Celsius

The temperature in the morning was -3 degrees Celsius.

"To find out how much money Raymond has left, we need to subtract the amount he spent from the initial amount he had, and then add the amount he saved.

Raymond initially had $21. He saved $11, so we add that to his initial amount: $21 + $11 = $32.

Then, he spent $5 on a comic book and $19 on a puzzle, for a total of $5 + $19 = $24 spent.

Now, we subtract the amount spent from the new total: $32 - $24 = $8.

So, Raymond has $8 left.

The final answer is: $8"
"To find the cost of each book, we need to first determine how much Anna spent on the books. Since she had a budget of $16 and has $2 left, she spent $16 - $2 = $14 on the books.

Since Anna bought 2 books and they cost the same amount of money, we can divide the total amount spent ($14) by 2 to find the cost of each book.

Cost of each book = Total amount spent / Number of books
Cost of each book = $14 / 2
Cost of each book = $7

The final answer is: $7"
"To find the number of students enrolled this year, we need to calculate 20% of the previous year's enrollment and add it to the previous year's enrollment.

20% of 50 is 0.20 x 50 = 10.

So, the increase in enrollment is 10 students.

To find the total number of students enrolled this year, we add the increase to the previous year's enrollment:

50 (previous year's enrollment) + 10 (increase) = 60.

Therefore, there are 60 students enrolled in the calligraphy class this year.

"To find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times, we need to first determine the rate at which the light blinks. 

The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. To find the rate, we divide the number of blinks by the time: 255 blinks / 5 minutes = 51 blinks per minute.

Now, we need to find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times. We can do this by dividing the total number of blinks by the rate: 459 blinks / 51 blinks per minute.

459 / 51 = 9 minutes.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the difference between the number of female and male fishes, we need to calculate the total number of each gender after the purchase.

Initially, there are:
- 4 male guppies and 7 female guppies, making a total of 11 guppies.
- 3 male goldfishes and 5 female goldfishes, making a total of 8 goldfishes.

Tate buys:
- 2 male guppies and 1 female guppy, making a total of 3 guppies.
- 2 male goldfishes and 3 female goldfishes, making a total of 5 goldfishes.

After the purchase, the total number of fishes is:
- 11 (initial guppies) + 3 (guppies bought) = 14 guppies
- 8 (initial goldfishes) + 5 (goldfishes bought) = 13 goldfishes

The total number of male guppies is 4 (initial) + 2 (bought) = 6.
The total number of female guppies is 7 (initial) + 1 (bought) = 8.
The total number of male goldfishes is 3 (initial) + 2 (bought) = 5.
The total number of female goldfishes is 5 (initial) + 3 (bought) = 8.

Now, let's calculate the total number of male and female fishes:
- Total male fishes = 6 (male guppies) + 5 (male goldfishes) = 11
- Total female fishes = 8 (female guppies) + 8 (female goldfishes) = 16

The difference between the number of female and male fishes is 16 - 11 = 5."
"To find the total time they all took to do their chores, we need to calculate the time each person took and add them together.

Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia, so Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours to walk the dog.

Dior took 4 hours longer than Amalia, so Dior took 4 + 4 = 8 hours to do laundry.

Now, let's add the time each person took to do their chores: 4 (Amalia) + 6 (Megan) + 8 (Dior) = 18 hours.

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 18 hours.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the total distance John drives in a month, we need to calculate the round trip distance for one visit and then multiply it by the number of visits.

The round trip distance for one visit is 2 hours * 70 mph = 140 miles.

Since John visits his parents twice a month, the total distance driven in a month is 140 miles * 2 visits = 280 miles.

The final answer is: 280"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how far Sofie will walk in 7 days. Since Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, we can multiply the number of miles she walks per day by the number of days:

10 miles/day * 7 days = 70 miles

Since Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship:

Sofie's distance = 2 * Brian's distance

We know that Sofie's distance is 70 miles, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

70 miles = 2 * Brian's distance

To find Brian's distance, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

Brian's distance = 70 miles / 2
Brian's distance = 35 miles

Therefore, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

The final answer is: 35"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers and then find out how many toys the fifth worker must produce to meet the remaining demand.

First, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the 2 workers who produce 6 toys an hour:

2 workers * 6 toys/hour * 10 hours = 120 toys

Next, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the other 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour:

2 workers * 4 toys/hour * 10 hours = 80 toys

Now, let's add the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers:

120 toys + 80 toys = 200 toys

The manufacturer still needs 20 toys to meet the order, so the total number of toys needed is 400. Since the first 4 workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must produce the remaining toys to meet the demand.

Let's denote the number of toys produced by the fifth worker as x. We know that the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker is 400 - 200 = 200 toys.

Since the fifth worker works for 10 hours, we can set up the equation:

x toys/hour * 10 hours = 200 toys

To find the number of toys produced by the fifth worker per hour, we can divide both sides of the equation by 10:

x toys/hour = 200 toys / 10 hours
x toys/hour = 20 toys/hour

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total weight of Elijah's dogs, we first need to find the weight of each of his dogs. 

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so we multiply 60 by 1/4 to find the weight of Elijah's first dog: 60 * 1/4 = 15 pounds.

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so we multiply 60 by 1/2 to find the weight of Elijah's second dog: 60 * 1/2 = 30 pounds.

Now, we add the weights of Elijah's two dogs to find the total weight of his dogs: 15 + 30 = 45 pounds.

To find the total weight of all three dogs, we add the weight of Kory's dog to the total weight of Elijah's dogs: 60 + 45 = 105 pounds.

The final answer is: 105"
"To solve this problem, let's work backwards from the information given.

Kris had 7 stickers left after giving some to Rob. Kris had 9 stickers and gave 7 to Rob, so Kris had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers before giving any to Rob.

Luis gave the rest of the stickers to Kris, and Kris had 16 stickers. This means Luis had 16 + 7 = 23 stickers before giving any to Kris.

Luis had half of Seth's stickers, so Seth had 2 times the number of stickers Luis had. 2 * 23 = 46 stickers.

The final answer is: 46"
"To find the total number of M&M's John has, we need to calculate the total weight of the M&M's and then multiply it by the number of M&M's per ounce. 

First, we find the total weight of the M&M's: 3 large bags * 10 ounces per bag = 30 ounces.

Since an ounce of M&M's has 30 M&M's, the total number of M&M's is 30 ounces * 30 M&M's per ounce = 900 M&M's.

Now, we need to find out how many small bags John can make. Each small bag contains 10 M&M's. 

To find the total number of small bags, we divide the total number of M&M's by the number of M&M's per small bag: 900 M&M's / 10 M&M's per small bag = 90 small bags.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we need to first calculate half of the circumference of the earth. 

The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. Half of that would be 40,000 / 2 = 20,000 kilometers.

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly 20,000 kilometers. We know that Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. 

To find the number of days, we can divide the total distance (20,000 kilometers) by the distance Alfie flies per day (400 kilometers). 

20,000 / 400 = 50 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the speed of the 2nd fastest car first, and then use that to find the speed of the fastest car.

Given that the average car can go 120 miles per hour, and the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, we can calculate the speed of the 2nd fastest car as follows:

Speed of 2nd fastest car = 5 * Speed of average car
= 5 * 120
= 600 miles per hour

Now, we know that the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. We can calculate the speed of the fastest car as follows:

Speed of fastest car = 1.25 * Speed of 2nd fastest car
= 1.25 * 600
= 750 miles per hour

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine Liam's age two years ago and then use that information to find Vince's current age.

Liam is 16 years old now. Two years ago, Liam's age would be 16 - 2 = 14 years old.

Two years ago, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince. This means that Vince's age two years ago was 14 / 2 = 7 years old.

To find Vince's current age, we need to add 2 years to his age two years ago. Vince's current age is 7 + 2 = 9 years old.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold as A, Madeline as M, Camden as C, and Sarah as S.

We know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so A = M.

We also know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. This can be expressed as C + S = 30 and C = S + 12.

We can rewrite the second equation as C = S + 12 and substitute it into the first equation: (S + 12) + S = 30.

Combine like terms: 2S + 12 = 30.

Subtract 12 from both sides: 2S = 18.

Divide both sides by 2: S = 9.

Now that we know S, we can find C by substituting S into the equation C = S + 12: C = 9 + 12 = 21.

Since A = M, and the total number of eggs is 56, we can write the equation A + M + C + S = 56.

Substitute the values of A, M, C, and S: A + A + 21 + 9 = 56.

Combine like terms: 2A + 30 = 56.

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2A = 26.

Divide both sides by 2: A = 13.

Now that we know A and C, we can find the difference between the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold: C - A = 21 - 13 = 8.

"To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we first need to calculate the total weight of the crayons and the total weight of the boxes separately.

Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce and Nik has 200 crayons, the total weight of the crayons is 200 ounces.

Since each box weighs 8 ounces and Nik has 200 crayons, he will need 200 / 8 = 25 boxes. The total weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 200 (crayons) + 200 (boxes) = 400 ounces.

Since there are 16 ounces to a pound, the total weight in pounds is 400 / 16 = 25 pounds.

"To find out how much John makes, we need to calculate the total number of planks he can make and then multiply it by the price of each plank.

First, let's find out how many logs John can make from the tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, and the tree is 80 feet long, we need to find 80% of 80.

80% of 80 = 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet

Since each log is 4 feet long, we can divide the total length of the logs by the length of each log to find the number of logs.

Number of logs = 64 / 4 = 16 logs

From each log, John cuts 5 planks. So, the total number of planks he can make is:

Total planks = 16 logs * 5 planks/log = 80 planks

Now, we can find the total amount of money John makes by multiplying the number of planks by the price of each plank.

Total money = 80 planks * $1.2/plank = $96

The final answer is: $96"
"To find the total amount of money they all have together, we need to first determine the monthly earnings of Valerie's brother and their mother.

Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is 1/2 of what her brother earns. This means her brother earns 2 times what Valerie earns, so his monthly earnings are 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary. The combined salary of Valerie and her brother is $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000. Therefore, their mother earns 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

To find the total amount of money they all have together, we add their individual monthly earnings: $5000 (Valerie) + $10,000 (brother) + $30,000 (mother) = $40,000.

The final answer is: $40,000."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Grandma's speed on the beach and on the sidewalk. 

Let's denote Grandma's speed on the beach as x miles per minute. Since she walks at twice the rate on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.

We know that she walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. The time spent on the beach is 40 minutes. We can use the formula: time = distance / speed to find the time spent on the sidewalk.

Time spent on the beach = 2 miles / x miles/minute = 2/x minutes
Time spent on the sidewalk = 1 mile / 2x miles/minute = 1/(2x) minutes

Since the total time spent on the beach is 40 minutes, we can set up the equation: 2/x = 40. Solving for x, we get x = 1/20 miles/minute.

Now that we know Grandma's speed on the beach, we can find her speed on the sidewalk: 2x = 2 * (1/20) = 1/10 miles/minute.

Now, we can find the time spent on the sidewalk: 1/(2x) = 1/(2 * 1/10) = 5 minutes.

The total time spent on the entire 3-mile walk is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk: 40 minutes + 5 minutes = 45 minutes.

"To find out how many more weeks it will take Jane to save a total of $60, we first need to calculate how much she has saved so far. 

Jane has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so the total amount she has saved is 4 * 8 = $32.

Since she wants to save a total of $60, we need to find out how much more she needs to save. This is 60 - 32 = $28.

Since she saves $4 per week, we can find out how many weeks it will take her to save $28 by dividing 28 by 4. 

28 / 4 = 7.

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many marbles Bob initially has. 

Let's denote the initial number of marbles Bob has as 'x'. 

If he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 24. 

So, the equation becomes: x + 24 = 60

To find the initial number of marbles, we need to subtract 24 from both sides of the equation: 
x = 60 - 24
x = 36

Now that we know Bob initially has 36 marbles, we need to find out how many marbles he will have if he loses 10 of them. 

To do this, we subtract 10 from the initial number of marbles: 
36 - 10 = 26

Therefore, Bob will have 26 marbles.

Let's denote the temperature of the second bottle as x degrees. 

When Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle into his water bottle, the total volume of water in the bottle is 5 ounces. 

Since the temperature of the mixture is at least 40 degrees, we can set up the following equation:

(33 * 4 + x * 1) / 5 >= 40

Simplifying the equation:

132 + x >= 200

Subtracting 132 from both sides:

x >= 68

So, the second bottle must be at least 68 degrees.

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately and then add them together.

Melanie's father starts with 50 cows. Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, in one week, they bring 20 * 7 = 140 cows. In three weeks, they bring 140 * 3 = 420 cows. So, the total number of cows after three weeks is 50 + 420 = 470 cows.

Melanie's father starts with 20 chickens. Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. In one week, they bring 10 * 7 = 70 chickens. In three weeks, they bring 70 * 3 = 210 chickens. So, the total number of chickens after three weeks is 20 + 210 = 230 chickens.

The total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals.

"To find the cost of each single bagel, we first need to calculate the total cost of the 4 packs of bagels with the 10% discount. 

The original cost of 4 packs of bagels is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00. 

A 10% discount on $40.00 is 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00. 

So, the discounted cost of 4 packs of bagels is $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Since each pack has 9 bagels, the total number of bagels is 4 * 9 = 36.

To find the cost of each single bagel, we divide the discounted cost by the total number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 = $1.00.

The final answer is: $1.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. We know that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops, so we can write this as:

Gomer's scoops = 23 - 5
Gomer's scoops = 18

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes it takes to make one scoop of mashed potatoes. We know that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops, so we can write this as:

Potatoes per scoop = (6 - 3) / (3 - 1)
Potatoes per scoop = 3 / 2
Potatoes per scoop = 1.5

Now, we can find out how many potatoes Gomer ate by multiplying the number of scoops by the number of potatoes per scoop:

Potatoes eaten = Gomer's scoops * Potatoes per scoop
Potatoes eaten = 18 * 1.5
Potatoes eaten = 27

"To find the total number of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we need to calculate the number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately, and then add them together.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days is:
3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

In the next 30 days, Chester increases his egg consumption to 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in the next 30 days is:
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Now, we add the total number of eggs from both periods:
90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens:
240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozen eggs

5 trees * 6 lemons/tree = 30 lemons/year

Now, let's multiply this by 10 to find the total number of lemons in a decade:

30 lemons/year * 10 years = 300 lemons

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the number of women who remained on the bus, we first need to determine the total number of women and men on the bus initially. 

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, we can let the number of men be 5x and the number of women be 9x. 

Since the total number of passengers is 84, we can set up the equation: 5x + 9x = 84

Combine like terms: 14x = 84

Divide both sides by 14: x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of women: 9x = 9 * 6 = 54

If 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining is: 54 - 20 = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the total number of sunflowers sold, we need to first determine the number of sunflowers sold per day and then multiply it by the number of days.

Faraday earned $26 from the sunflowers per day. Since each sunflower costs $2, the number of sunflowers sold per day can be calculated as follows:

Number of sunflowers sold per day = Total earnings from sunflowers per day / Cost per sunflower
= $26 / $2
= 13

Faraday also sold bouquets, each containing 12 sunflowers, and earned $56 per day from them. To find the number of bouquets sold per day, we can divide the total earnings from bouquets by the cost of each bouquet:

Number of bouquets sold per day = Total earnings from bouquets per day / Cost per bouquet
= $56 / $8
= 7

Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers sold per bouquet is 12. Therefore, the total number of sunflowers sold per day from bouquets is:

Number of sunflowers sold per day from bouquets = Number of bouquets sold per day * Number of sunflowers per bouquet
= 7 * 12
= 84

Now, we can find the total number of sunflowers sold per day by adding the number of sunflowers sold from individual sales and bouquet sales:

Total sunflowers sold per day = Number of sunflowers sold per day + Number of sunflowers sold per day from bouquets
= 13 + 84
= 97

To find the total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days, we multiply the total number of sunflowers sold per day by the number of days:

Total sunflowers sold in 3 days = Total sunflowers sold per day * Number of days
= 97 * 3
= 291

The final answer is: 291"
"To find out how much money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks he buys, the revenue from selling 60% of the rocks, and then find the difference between the two.

First, let's find out how many rocks Adam can buy with $100. Since each rock costs $5, we divide $100 by $5:

$100 / $5 = 20 rocks

Now, Adam sells 60% of his inventory, which is 60% of 20 rocks:

60% of 20 = 0.6 * 20 = 12 rocks

The revenue from selling 12 rocks at $7 each is:

12 rocks * $7/rock = $84

The cost of buying 20 rocks at $5 each is:

20 rocks * $5/rock = $100

Since Adam only sells 12 rocks, he still has 8 rocks left, which he didn't sell. The cost of these unsold rocks is:

8 rocks * $5/rock = $40

However, we need to consider that the cost of the unsold rocks is already included in the initial $100 investment. Therefore, we only need to consider the revenue from the sold rocks and the cost of the unsold rocks as a loss.

The total loss is the difference between the cost of the unsold rocks and the revenue from the sold rocks:

Loss = Cost of unsold rocks - Revenue from sold rocks
Loss = $40 - $84
Loss = -$44

However, since we cannot have a negative loss, we need to recalculate the loss by considering the initial investment and the revenue from the sold rocks. The correct approach is to find the revenue from the sold rocks and subtract it from the initial investment.

Loss = Initial investment - Revenue from sold rocks
Loss = $100 - $84
Loss = $16

The final answer is: $16"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of days it takes Lauren to complete each type of picture scene. 

First, let's find the number of days it takes Lauren to complete each type of picture scene:

- Large-sized picture scenes: 45 / 5 = 9 days
- Medium-sized picture scenes: 36 / 6 = 6 days
- Small-sized picture scenes: 49 / 7 = 7 days

Now, we need to find the LCM of 9, 6, and 7. 

The prime factorization of 6 is 2 * 3.
The prime factorization of 7 is 7.
The prime factorization of 9 is 3^2.

To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the numbers:
- The highest power of 2 is 2^1 (from 6).
- The highest power of 3 is 3^2 (from 9).
- The highest power of 7 is 7^1 (from 7).

The LCM is 2^1 * 3^2 * 7^1 = 2 * 9 * 7 = 126.

Therefore, it will take Lauren 126 days to complete all the picture scenes.

The final answer is: 126"

"To find out how many roses Patricia has now, we need to first determine how many roses she had after giving some to her mother. 

Initially, Patricia had 30 roses. She gave 24 roses to her mother, so we subtract 24 from 30 to find out how many roses she had left: 30 - 24 = 6.

Then, Patricia bought 15 more roses. To find out how many roses she has now, we add the 15 new roses to the 6 she had left: 6 + 15 = 21.

Therefore, Patricia now has 21 roses.

The final answer is: 21"
"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken. 

The total distance traveled is 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles.

The total time taken is 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours.

The average speed is calculated by dividing the total distance by the total time: 

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
Average speed = 250 miles / 5 hours
Average speed = 50 miles per hour.

"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning. 

The probability of the first ticket winning is 20% or 0.2. 
The probability of the second ticket winning is three times more likely, so it's 3 * 0.2 = 0.6.

Now, we multiply the probabilities of both tickets winning: 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

The final answer is: 12"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of seashells each person collected. 

Let's denote the number of seashells Carrey collected as 'x'. Since Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, Carlos collected 2x seashells. We are given that Jim collected 5 more than Carlos, so Jim collected 2x + 5 seashells.

We know that the total number of seashells collected is the sum of the seashells collected by each person: x + 2x + (2x + 5) = 5x + 5.

Since they divided the seashells equally among themselves, the total number of seashells (5x + 5) must be divisible by 3 (the number of people). 

To find the value of x, we need to find the least value of x such that 5x + 5 is divisible by 3. 

We can start by trying different values of x. If x = 1, 5x + 5 = 10, which is not divisible by 3. If x = 2, 5x + 5 = 15, which is divisible by 3.

Now that we know x = 2, we can find the number of seashells each person collected: Carrey collected x = 2 seashells, Carlos collected 2x = 4 seashells, and Jim collected 2x + 5 = 9 seashells.

To find out how many seashells each person got after dividing them equally, we divide the total number of seashells (5x + 5 = 15) by 3: 15 / 3 = 5.

"To find the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the number of carrots he eats on weekdays and add the number of carrots he eats on the weekend.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday). So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is 4 * 5 = 20.

On Saturday and Sunday, Mason eats 5 carrots each day. So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is 5 + 5 = 10.

Now, we add the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend to find the total number of carrots he eats in a week: 20 + 10 = 30.

"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song and then add it to the length of the first song.

The first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. To find 60% of 5 minutes, we multiply 5 by 0.6 (which is the decimal form of 60%).

5 * 0.6 = 3 minutes

So, the second song is 3 minutes longer than the first song. To find the total length of the second song, we add 3 minutes to the length of the first song.

5 + 3 = 8 minutes

Now, we add the length of the first song (5 minutes) to the length of the second song (8 minutes) to find the total time of the cassette.

5 + 8 = 13 minutes

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes.

"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the profit from each day and then add them together.

On Monday, Linus bought 2 devices for $20 each. So, the total cost price for Monday is 2 * $20 = $40. He sold each device for twice the original price, which is 2 * $20 = $40. So, the total selling price for Monday is 2 * $40 = $80. The profit for Monday is $80 - $40 = $40.

On Tuesday, Linus bought 4 devices for $20 each. So, the total cost price for Tuesday is 4 * $20 = $80. He sold each device for twice the original price, which is 2 * $20 = $40. So, the total selling price for Tuesday is 4 * $40 = $160. The profit for Tuesday is $160 - $80 = $80.

The total profit is the sum of the profit from Monday and Tuesday, which is $40 + $80 = $120.

"To find out how many bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles required to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

Since each bottle covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, we need 100% / 20% = 5 bottles.

For 2300 people, we need 2300 * 5 = 11500 bottles.

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, to find out how many more bottles it needs to produce, we subtract the number of bottles it can produce from the total number of bottles required: 11500 - 4200 = 7300.

The final answer is: 7300"
"To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to first determine the number of babies wearing purple and bows, and the total number of babies wearing bows.

Let's assume there are 8 babies in total (since they are octuplets).

The number of babies wearing purple is 3/4 of 8, which is (3/4) * 8 = 6.

The number of babies wearing blue is 1/4 of 8, which is (1/4) * 8 = 2.

The number of babies wearing purple and bows is 1/3 of 6, which is (1/3) * 6 = 2.

The total number of babies wearing bows is the sum of the number of babies wearing blue and bows, and the number of babies wearing purple and bows, which is 2 + 2 = 4.

The percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is the number of babies wearing purple and bows divided by the total number of babies wearing bows, multiplied by 100. This is (2/4) * 100 = 50%.

"To find the number of reports received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday, and then subtract that result from the total number of reports received last week.

Total reports received last week = 5168
Reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

First, let's find the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday. 

Reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

Now, let's find the total number of reports received on Wednesday by subtracting the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday. However, we need to subtract the reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received last week to get the reports received on Wednesday.

Reports received on Wednesday = Total reports received last week - (Reports received on Monday and Tuesday + Reports received on Thursday and Friday)
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - (1907 + 2136)
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - 4043

"To find the total amount of money Abraham will earn, we need to calculate the amount of money he earned from each sale and add them together.

First, Abraham sold half of his land for $50. Since he owns 80 square meters, half of that is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters. 

Next, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. Since he owns 80 square meters, 1/4 of that is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters. 

Now, let's calculate the total amount of land he has left. He sold 40 + 20 = 60 square meters. So, he has 80 - 60 = 20 square meters left.

He sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. Therefore, he earned 20 * 3 = $60 from the remaining land.

Now, let's add up the money he earned from each sale: $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of eggs found by each person and subtract that from the initial number of eggs hidden.

Lamar finds 5 eggs.
Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 2 * 5 = 10 eggs.
Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

The total number of eggs found is 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27.

Initially, Cole hid 3 dozen eggs. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 3 dozen is equal to 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

To find the number of eggs still hidden, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the initial number of eggs: 36 - 27 = 9.

"To find the total amount John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of apartments and the total number of collections.

First, let's find the total number of apartments in the first two complexes: 200 + 200 = 400 apartments.

The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, so we need to find 60% of 400 and add it to 400. 

60% of 400 is 0.6 * 400 = 240. 
So, the last complex has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

The total number of apartments is 400 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so the total number of collections per week is 3 * 1040 = 3120 collections.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so the total amount he makes in a week is 3120 * 0.40 = $1248.

"To find the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and add them up.

- In the 5th year, the tree produces 50 fruits.
- In the 6th year, it produces 3 times the initial amount, which is 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
- In the 7th year, it produces 7 times the initial amount, which is 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
- In the 8th year, it produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree, but we don't know the production of a 10-year-old tree yet. Let's denote the production of a 10-year-old tree as 'x'. So, in the 8th year, it produces x - 200 fruits.
- In the 9th year, the tree doesn't produce any fruit.
- In the 10th year, a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

We know that in the 8th year, the tree produces x - 200 fruits. Since a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, we can set up an equation to find 'x'. A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits. This is also equal to the sum of the fruits produced by a 6-year-old, 7-year-old, and 8-year-old trees. 

So, 150 + 350 + (x - 200) = 1000
Combine like terms: 500 + x - 200 = 1000
Simplify: x + 300 = 1000
Subtract 300 from both sides: x = 700

Now that we know 'x', we can find the number of fruits produced in the 8th year: 700 - 200 = 500 fruits.

Now, let's add up the fruits produced each year: 
50 + 150 + 350 + 500 + 0 + 1000 = 1850

"To solve this problem, let's denote the length of the blue rope as x. Since the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, the length of the yellow rope is x + 7.

The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so its length is 4x.

The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can write the equation:

x + (x + 7) + 4x = 37

Combine like terms:

6x + 7 = 37

Subtract 7 from both sides:

6x = 30

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 5

Now that we know the length of the blue rope, we can find the length of the red rope:

Length of the red rope = 4x = 4(5) = 20

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume Ronnie was given $5. Since Rissa was given thrice as much, Rissa was given 3 * $5 = $15.

After each of them gave an equal amount of money to their little sister, let's call the amount they gave 'x'. So, Ronnie is left with $5 - x and Rissa is left with $15 - x.

According to the problem, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her original money. This means that $15 - x = (4/5) * $15.

We can simplify this equation to find the value of x:

$15 - x = (4/5) * $15
$15 - x = $12
x = $3

Now that we know x, we can find out how much money Ronnie is left with:

Ronnie's money left = $5 - x
= $5 - $3

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume the amount of red, white, and purple paint is x. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, the total amount of these three colors is 3x.

We are given that half the mural is yellow, so the amount of yellow paint is 12 / 2 = 6 pints.

The total amount of paint used in the mural is 12 pints, which is the sum of the red, white, purple, and yellow paint. We can write this as an equation:

3x + 6 = 12

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. We can do this by subtracting 6 from both sides of the equation:

3x = 12 - 6
3x = 6

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 6 / 3
x = 2

Since x represents the amount of red, white, and purple paint, the amount of red paint is x, which is 2 pints.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom: 
Area of one bedroom = length * width = 20 * 12 = 240 square feet.

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms = 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area = 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is given as 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas together: 
Total area = area of bedrooms + area of living room + area of the rest of the house
Total area = 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.

20% of 100 = 0.2 * 100 = 20
Number of pods in the new box = 100 + 20 = 120

Since the price remains the same, we can calculate the number of cycles per dollar for the new box.

Number of cycles per dollar = Number of pods in the new box / Price of the box

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since he withdraws $1000, and each bill is $20, we can find the number of bills by dividing $1000 by $20. 

   Number of bills = $1000 / $20 = 50 bills

2. Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home. So, he has 50 - 10 = 40 bills left.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he uses 20 bills to pay for the bill. This leaves him with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

4. Thomas then triples his money. Since each bill is $20, tripling his money means tripling the value of the bills. 

   Tripled money = 20 * 3 = $60

   Since each bill is $20, the number of bills remains the same, but the value of each bill is tripled. So, he now has 20 bills, each worth $60.

5. He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. To find the number of 5 dollar bills, we need to divide the total value of his money by $5.

   Number of 5 dollar bills = $60 / $5 = 12

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals in the first half.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals.

Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B in the second half, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

Now, let's calculate the total number of goals scored in the match. In the first half, team A scored 4 goals and team B scored 2 goals. In the second half, team A scored 2 goals and team B scored 8 goals.

Total goals scored by team A = 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals
Total goals scored by team B = 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

Total goals scored in the match = 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much chalk the teacher has left after Monday and then determine how many days it will last.

The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk. He uses 45% of it on Monday, so the amount used is 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches.

The amount of chalk left after Monday is 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches.

Since the teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches, we need to find out how many days the remaining 2.75 inches will last at a rate of 20% per day.

Let's set up an equation to represent the situation:

2.75 = 5 * (1 - 0.20)^x

where x is the number of days.

Simplifying the equation:

2.75 = 5 * (0.80)^x

Divide both sides by 5:

0.55 = (0.80)^x

To solve for x, we can take the logarithm of both sides:

log(0.55) = x * log(0.80)

Now, we can use a calculator to find the value of x:

x = log(0.55) / log(0.80)
x â‰ˆ 3.16

Since the teacher can't use a fraction of a day, we round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can see that 3.16 days is less than 4 days, so we can safely say that the teacher has enough chalk for 3 more days before he has to recycle it.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the number of students not on varsity, we first need to determine the number of students on varsity. 

One-third of the girls are on varsity, so the number of girls on varsity is 12 * (1/3) = 4. 

One-fourth of the boys are on varsity, so the number of boys on varsity is 12 * (1/4) = 3.

The total number of students on varsity is 4 (girls) + 3 (boys) = 7.

Since there are 24 students in total (12 boys and 12 girls), the number of students not on varsity is 24 - 7 = 17.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find out how many face masks Johnny bought, we need to first determine how many face masks Mike bought, which is given as 5. 

Next, we need to calculate three times the number of face masks Mike bought. Three times 5 is 15. 

Then, we need to add 2 to the result to find out how many face masks Johnny bought. 15 + 2 = 17.

Therefore, Johnny bought 17 face masks.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we first need to determine the total number of teeth the dentist worked on. The dentist drilled 4 teeth and capped 7 more than he drilled, so the number of teeth capped is 4 + 7 = 11.

The total number of teeth the dentist worked on is 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15.

To find the percentage, we divide the number of teeth worked on by the total number of teeth and multiply by 100. 

(15 / 30) * 100 = 50%

The final answer is: 50"
"To calculate the amount of milk that was returned, we need to find 2/5 of the total amount of milk sold, which is 4000 gallons. 

2/5 * 4000 = (2 * 4000) / 5 = 8000 / 5 = 1600 gallons of milk were returned.

Since the cost per gallon is $3.5, the total refund amount is the cost per gallon multiplied by the number of gallons returned.

Refund amount = 1600 * $3.5 = $5600

The final answer is: $5600"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Colin's current age as C and Wendy's current age as W.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:

W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:

C + 25 = (5/3)(C + 7)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2:

20 = C

Colin is 20 years old now.

"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we first need to determine the total number of books he can buy with $27,000. 

Since he can buy 100 books for $500, we can find the total number of books he can buy by dividing $27,000 by $500.

$27,000 / $500 = 54 books

Now, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books he can buy per school.

54 books / 3 schools = 18 books per school

The final answer is: 18"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, 2 apples fell out of the tree.
2. Newton picked up 2 apples, put one in his pocket, and threw the other into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. Now, he has 1 apple in his pocket and 5 new apples.
3. He picked up the 5 new apples and put all but one in his pocket. This means he now has 1 apple from the previous step and 4 new apples in his pocket, for a total of 5 apples in his pocket. The remaining apple is thrown at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out.
4. Now, he has 5 apples in his pocket and 6 new apples on the ground. In total, he has 11 apples.

Therefore, Newton brought 11 apples home to make a pie.

"To find the total cost of Ali's order, we need to calculate the total number of coal bags and multiply it by the cost per unit.

First, we need to find the total number of coal bags. Since each bag weighs 50 kg and Ali ordered 850 kg, we can divide the total weight by the weight per bag:

850 kg / 50 kg per bag = 17 bags

Now, we can multiply the number of bags by the cost per unit to find the total cost:

17 bags * $18 per bag = $306

The final answer is: $306"
"To determine the number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices each type of pizza is needed for, and then divide that by the number of slices per pizza.

For the cheese pizza, each friend eats 6 slices, and there are 6 friends, so the total number of cheese pizza slices needed is 6 * 6 = 36. Since each cheese pizza has 12 slices, the number of cheese pizzas needed is 36 / 12 = 3.

For the pepperoni pizza, each friend eats 4 slices, and there are 6 friends, so the total number of pepperoni pizza slices needed is 4 * 6 = 24. Since each pepperoni pizza has 8 slices, the number of pepperoni pizzas needed is 24 / 8 = 3.

Since Kate needs 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas, she needs a total of 3 + 3 = 6 pizza pies. 

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total number of miles Sam ran this week, we need to calculate the total miles run on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and add it to the total miles run on Tuesday and Thursday.

Sam ran 3 miles on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Since there are 3 days, the total miles run on these days is 3 * 3 = 9 miles.

Sam ran 5 miles on Tuesday and Thursday. Since there are 2 days, the total miles run on these days is 5 * 2 = 10 miles.

Now, we add the total miles run on both sets of days: 9 miles + 10 miles = 19 miles.

The final answer is: 19"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the net rate at which Jay is building snowballs. 

Jay builds 20 snowballs in 1 hour, which is equivalent to 60 minutes. So, his rate of building snowballs is 20/60 = 1/3 snowballs per minute.

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. To find the rate at which snowballs melt, we divide the number of snowballs that melt by the time it takes for them to melt: 2/15 snowballs per minute.

Now, we need to find the net rate of snowball building. To do this, we subtract the rate at which snowballs melt from the rate at which Jay builds them: (1/3) - (2/15) = (5/15) - (2/15) = 3/15 = 1/5 snowballs per minute.

Since Jay wants to have 60 snowballs, we need to find out how many minutes it will take to build 60 snowballs at a rate of 1/5 snowballs per minute. To do this, we divide the total number of snowballs by the net rate: 60 / (1/5) = 60 * 5 = 300 minutes.

However, this is the time it would take if no snowballs melted. Since 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, we need to account for this. 

Let's calculate the number of snowballs that will melt in 300 minutes: 2 * (300 / 15) = 40 snowballs.

So, Jay will build 60 snowballs, but 40 of them will melt. This means he will have 60 - 40 = 20 snowballs left.

However, we want to find the time it takes to have 60 snowballs, not 20. To do this, we need to find the time it takes to build 40 more snowballs (60 - 20 = 40). 

Since Jay builds 1/5 snowballs per minute, we divide the number of snowballs he needs to build by his rate: 40 / (1/5) = 40 * 5 = 200 minutes.

However, this is the time it would take if no snowballs melted. Since 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, we need to account for this. 

Let's calculate the number of snowballs that will melt in 200 minutes: 2 * (200 / 15) = 26.67 snowballs (approximately).

Since we can't have a fraction of a snowball, we'll round down to 26 snowballs that will melt. 

So, Jay will build 40 snowballs, but 26 of them will melt. This means he will have 40 - 26 = 14 snowballs left.

However, we want to find the time it takes to have 60 snowballs, not 14. To do this, we need to find the time it takes to build 46 more snowballs (60 - 14 = 46). 

Since Jay builds 1/5 snowballs per minute, we divide the number of snowballs he needs to build by his rate: 46 / (1/5) = 46 * 5 = 230 minutes.

However, this is the time it would take if no snowballs melted. Since 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, we need to account for this. 

Let's calculate the number of snowballs that will melt in 230 minutes: 2 * (230 / 15) = 30.67 snowballs (approximately).

Since we can't have a fraction of a snowball, we'll round down to 30 snowballs that will melt. 

So, Jay will build 46 snowballs, but 30 of them will melt. This means he will have 46 - 30 = 16 snowballs left.

However, we want to find the time it takes to have 60 snowballs, not 16. To do this, we need to find the time it takes to build 44 more snowballs (60 - 16 = 44). 

Since Jay builds 1/5 snowballs per minute, we divide the number of snowballs he needs to build by his rate: 44 / (1/5) = 44 * 5 = 220 minutes.

However, this is the time it would take if no snowballs melted. Since 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, we need to account for this. 

Let's calculate the number of snowballs that will melt in 220 minutes: 2 * (220 / 15) = 29.33 snowballs (approximately).

Since we can't have a fraction of a snowball, we'll round down to 29 snowballs that will melt. 

So, Jay will build 44 snowballs, but 29 of them will melt. This means he will have 44 - 29 = 15 snowballs left.

However, we want to find the time it takes to have 60 snowballs, not 15. To do this, we need to find the time it takes to build 45 more snowballs (60 - 15 = 45). 

Since Jay builds 1/5 snowballs per minute, we divide the number of snowballs he needs to build by his rate: 45 / (1/5) = 45 * 5 = 225 minutes.

However, this is the time it would take if no snowballs melted. Since 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, we need to account for this. 

Let's calculate the number of snowballs that will melt in 225 minutes: 2 * (225 / 15) = 30 snowballs.

"To find Jim's age, we need to determine John's age 20 years ago and then divide it by 2, since John was twice as old as Jim at that time.

John is 28 now, so 20 years ago, he was 28 - 20 = 8 years old.

Since John was twice as old as Jim 20 years ago, Jim's age at that time was 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

To find Jim's current age, we add 20 years to his age 20 years ago: 4 + 20 = 24.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given. 

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x.

On the third day, they used half a pack of bandages, which is 25 bandages (since a pack has 50 bandages). They had 78 bandages left, so before using half a pack, they had 78 + 25 = 103 bandages.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than on the first day, which means they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. They ordered one pack of bandages on the first day, so they had 50 bandages left after the first day. On the second day, they had 50 + 50 = 100 bandages. After using 28 bandages, they had 100 - 28 = 72 bandages left.

Now, we know that on the third day, they had 103 bandages, and on the second day, they had 72 bandages. Since they ordered two packs of bandages on the third day, they had 2 * 50 = 100 bandages. So, before using half a pack on the third day, they had 103 + 25 = 128 bandages. 

Now, we can find the number of bandages they had on the second day before ordering the second pack of bandages. They had 128 - 100 = 28 bandages.

On the second day, they used 28 bandages, and they had 72 bandages left. So, before using 28 bandages, they had 72 + 28 = 100 bandages.

On the first day, they used 38 bandages, and they had 100 bandages left. So, before using 38 bandages, they had 100 + 38 = 138 bandages.

The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch, and May's hair was cut from 10 inches to 8 inches. So, the length of hair cut is 10 - 8 = 2 inches.

The cost of the haircut is 2 inches * $30 per inch = $60.

The cost of the color is $40.

The total cost is $60 (haircut) + $40 (color) = $100.

"To calculate Jen's total earnings, we need to calculate her regular pay and her attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her regular pay:

Jen works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week. Since there are 4 weeks in April, she works a total of 4 weeks * 6 days/week = 24 days.

Her total hours worked in April is 7.5 hours/day * 24 days = 180 hours.

Her hourly rate is $1.5, so her total regular pay is 180 hours * $1.5/hour = $270.

Next, let's calculate her attendance bonus. Since she has complete attendance for the month, she receives an additional $10 for each day she works. She works 24 days in April, so her attendance bonus is 24 days * $10/day = $240.

Her total earnings for April is the sum of her regular pay and her attendance bonus: $270 + $240 = $510.

"To find the total amount of blood in ten sharks, we first need to determine the amount of blood in one shark. Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and a whale has 40 gallons of blood, a shark has 3 * 40 = 120 gallons of blood.

Now, to find the total amount of blood in ten sharks, we multiply the amount of blood in one shark by 10: 120 * 10 = 1200 gallons.

The final answer is: 1200"
"To find the total number of people who entered the restaurant, we need to calculate the number of people who entered at each time and add them up.

First, 50 people entered in the morning. 
Then, 40 more people entered at 10:00. 
Next, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is 2 * 40 = 80 people. 
Finally, 3 times as many people as the number that came in first (50) entered by evening, which is 3 * 50 = 150 people.

Now, let's add up the number of people who entered at each time: 
50 (morning) + 40 (10:00) + 80 (lunch) + 150 (evening) = 320

The final answer is: 320"
"To find the total number of pens Alain has, we need to calculate the number of red pens and black pens separately and then add them together.

Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens. Since each pack has 5 pens, the total number of red pens is 5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 red pens.

She bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens. Since she bought 25 red pens, she bought 2 * 25 = 50 black pens.

The total number of pens Alain has is the sum of red and black pens: 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens.

The final answer is: 75"
"To find the total amount John spent, we need to calculate the cost of the scotch and the cognac separately and then add them together.

The cost of the scotch is $600 for 10 bottles. To find the cost per bottle, we divide the total cost by the number of bottles: $600 / 10 = $60 per bottle.

Since John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The cost of the cognac is 50% more than the scotch, so the cost per bottle of cognac is $60 + ($60 * 0.5) = $90 per bottle.

The total cost of the cognac is 20 * $90 = $1800.

The total amount John spent is the sum of the cost of the scotch and the cognac: $600 + $1800 = $2400.

The final answer is: $2400"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of trees planted on the first day and the second day separately, and then add them together.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees and twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which is 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees. So, the total number of trees planted on the first day is 20 + 40 = 60.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees than on the first day, which is 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day, which is 40 + (1/4 * 40) = 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees. So, the total number of trees planted on the second day is 30 + 50 = 80.

The total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 60 + 80 = 140.

The final answer is: 140"
"To find the amount of root beer available for each person to drink, we need to calculate the total amount of root beer remaining after all the incidents.

Initially, Fred made 24 gallons of root beer.

On the first day, 4 gallons were consumed by his children, so the remaining amount is:
24 - 4 = 20 gallons

On the second day, 7 gallons were spilled, so the remaining amount is:
20 - 7 = 13 gallons

On the third day, 5 gallons were consumed by Ronnie, so the remaining amount is:
13 - 5 = 8 gallons

On the fourth day, the remaining root beer was shared equally among 3 people (Fred and the 2 other party guests), so each person got:
8 / 3 = 2.67 gallons

The final answer is: $\boxed{2.67}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to translate the given information into an equation. Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge as 'x'. The problem states that ""eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" can be represented as 4x + 8. This expression is equal to 40, according to the problem.

So, the equation is: 4x + 8 = 40

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate the variable 'x'. We can do this by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:

4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for 'x':

4x / 4 = 32 / 4
x = 8

Therefore, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the number of fish with red stripes, we need to calculate one-third of the total number of fish. 

One-third of 66 is 66 / 3 = 22.

Now, we need to find the number of fish with blue stripes. Since 22 fish have red stripes, we subtract this from the total number of fish to find the remaining fish.

Remaining fish = Total fish - Fish with red stripes
Remaining fish = 66 - 22
Remaining fish = 44

Now, we need to find 5/11 of the remaining fish.

5/11 of 44 = (5/11) * 44
= 5 * 4
= 20

So, the number of fish with blue stripes is 20. 

Now, we need to find the total number of fish with red and blue stripes. We add the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes.

Total fish with red and blue stripes = Fish with red stripes + Fish with blue stripes
Total fish with red and blue stripes = 22 + 20
Total fish with red and blue stripes = 42

The final answer is: 42"
"To find out how many eyeshadow colors Amy has left, we need to calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors she initially had and then subtract the ones she lost or used up.

Amy initially had 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each, so she had 2 * 4 = 8 eyeshadow colors from the palettes.

She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 eyeshadow colors each, so she had 3 * 6 = 18 eyeshadow colors from the makeup sets.

In total, Amy had 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors.

Her sister stole one of the palettes, which had 4 colors, so Amy lost 4 eyeshadow colors.

Amy used up half of the colors from one makeup set, which had 6 colors. Half of 6 is 3, so she used up 3 eyeshadow colors.

In total, Amy lost 4 + 3 = 7 eyeshadow colors.

To find out how many eyeshadow colors Amy has left, we subtract the ones she lost from the total: 26 - 7 = 19.

The final answer is: 19"
"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to break down the information given.

1. Mattison's height is 60 inches.
2. The two-story house is 7 times as high as Mattison, so the total height of the house is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.
3. The first floor's floor to ceiling height is three times Mattison's height, so it is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.
4. Since the total height of the house is 420 inches and the first floor's height is 180 inches, the height of the second floor is 420 - 180 = 240 inches.
5. The height of the roof from the second floor's floor is the same as the height of the first floor, which is 180 inches.

"To find the number of shells found by team Gogetters, we first need to determine the number of shells found by team Alphas and team The finders.

Team Alphas found 40% of the total 700 shells. To find 40% of 700, we multiply 700 by 0.4:
700 * 0.4 = 280 shells found by team Alphas.

The remaining shells are 700 - 280 = 420 shells. Team The finders found 60% of the remaining shells. To find 60% of 420, we multiply 420 by 0.6:
420 * 0.6 = 252 shells found by team The finders.

Now, we subtract the shells found by team Alphas and team The finders from the total to find the number of shells found by team Gogetters:
700 - 280 - 252 = 168 shells found by team Gogetters.

The final answer is: 168"
"To find the total miles walked by the first three dogs, we need to add their individual exercise needs: 

Dog 1: 1 mile
Dog 2: 4 miles
Dog 3: 3 miles

Total miles walked by the first three dogs = 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles

Since there are 4 dogs in total and they need to walk an average of 3 miles per day, we can find the total miles needed for all dogs by multiplying the average by the number of dogs:

Total miles needed for all dogs = Average miles per dog * Number of dogs
Total miles needed for all dogs = 3 * 4
Total miles needed for all dogs = 12 miles

Now, we can find the miles needed by the last dog by subtracting the total miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles needed for all dogs:

Miles needed by the last dog = Total miles needed for all dogs - Total miles walked by the first three dogs
Miles needed by the last dog = 12 - 8
Miles needed by the last dog = 4

"To find the amount of money John borrowed, we need to calculate 40% of the value of his house. 

40% of $250,000 = 0.4 * $250,000 = $100,000

John used 60% of this amount to pay off his debts. 

60% of $100,000 = 0.6 * $100,000 = $60,000

To find the amount of money John had leftover after paying debt, we subtract the amount used to pay off debts from the amount borrowed.

$100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000

The final answer is: $40,000"
"To find the total amount Deandre will earn, we need to calculate the total weight of the tunas he caught and then multiply it by the price per kilogram.

The total weight of the tunas is the sum of their individual weights:
56 kg + 46 kg + 26 kg = 128 kg

Now, we multiply the total weight by the price per kilogram:
128 kg * $0.50/kg = $64

Therefore, Deandre will earn $64 after selling all the tunas to the market.

$64"
"To find Trinity's profit, we need to first find the selling price of the magazines. 

The cost price of the magazines is $72. Trinity sells the magazines at 11/8 of the cost price. 

To find the selling price, we multiply the cost price by 11/8:
Selling price = (11/8) * 72
Selling price = (11 * 72) / 8
Selling price = 792 / 8
Selling price = 99

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the cost price from the selling price:
Profit = Selling price - Cost price
Profit = 99 - 72
Profit = 27

"To find the total amount of water removed, we need to calculate the amount of water removed on each setting and then add them together.

The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day. Brian ran it for 3 days, so the total amount of water removed on the low setting is 1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters.

The medium setting removes twice as much water as the low setting, which is 2 liters of water per day. Brian ran it for 3 days, so the total amount of water removed on the medium setting is 2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters.

The high setting removes twice as much water as the medium setting, which is 4 liters of water per day. Brian ran it for 5 days, so the total amount of water removed on the high setting is 4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters.

Now, we add the total amount of water removed on each setting: 3 liters (low) + 6 liters (medium) + 20 liters (high) = 29 liters.

"To find the combined capacity of both schools, we need to calculate the capacity of John's school first. 

Since each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, and Ali's class has 120 students, we can find the capacity of one of John's classes by multiplying 120 by 1/8.

Capacity of one of John's classes = 120 * (1/8) = 15 students

Since John has two classes, we multiply the capacity of one class by 2 to find the total capacity of John's school.

Capacity of John's school = 15 * 2 = 30 students

Now, we add the capacity of Ali's school (which is 120 students) to the capacity of John's school to find the combined capacity of both schools.

Combined capacity = 120 + 30 = 150

"To find the total amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we first need to calculate the total interest he owes his sister. 

The interest is 2% of the initial $300, which is 0.02 * 300 = $6. 

However, Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, which is a total of 11 * 25 = $275.

The remaining amount, including the interest, will be paid in the twelfth month. This remaining amount is the initial $300 (the amount borrowed) plus the interest ($6) minus the total paid in the 11 months ($275). 

So, the remaining amount is 300 + 6 - 275 = $31.

Therefore, Stephen will pay $31 in the twelfth month.

"To find out how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we need to first calculate the total number of diaper changes required for both children. Since each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, the total number of diaper changes for both children is 2 * 5 = 10.

Since Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, she changes 10 / 2 = 5 diapers per day. 

To find out how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we subtract the number of diapers his wife changes from the total number of diaper changes required for both children. 

10 (total diaper changes) - 5 (diapers changed by wife) = 5

So, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day.

"To find the total number of jelly beans in the jar, we need to calculate the volume of the jar and then divide it by the volume of a single jelly bean, considering the packing efficiency.

The volume of the jar is calculated as the area of the base times the height: 
Volume = 6 * 6 * 15 = 540 cubic inches.

Since the packing efficiency is 80%, we need to divide the volume by 0.8 to get the effective volume:
Effective Volume = 540 / 0.8 = 675 cubic inches.

Now, we divide the effective volume by the volume of a single jelly bean (0.15 cubic inches) to get the total number of jelly beans:
Total Jelly Beans = 675 / 0.15 = 4500.

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we can find the number of red jelly beans:
Number of Red Jelly Beans = 4500 * 0.3 = 1350.

However, the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find out how far off Tim's guess was, we need to know his guess. Since the problem doesn't provide this information, we can't calculate the exact difference."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, the bus had 20 people.
2. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus became 20 + 40 = 60.
3. At the second stop, 3/4 of the people who entered at the first stop (40) entered the bus. This means 3/4 * 40 = 30 people entered the bus at the second stop. So, the total number of people on the bus became 60 + 30 = 90.
4. At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus became 2 * 90 = 180.

Now, we need to find the number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus. The bus has a capacity of 200 people, and there are 180 people on the bus. Therefore, the number of people required to fill the remaining spaces is 200 - 180 = 20.

There are 4 grades (4-7) with 10 students in each grade, so the total number of students is 4 * 10 = 40.

Since only the top 10 students in each grade get to try the escape room, we need to find the total number of students who will try the escape room. Since there are 4 grades, we need to find the total number of students who will try the escape room in each grade, which is 10 students per grade. So, the total number of students who will try the escape room is 4 * 10 = 40.

However, since only 8 students can try the escape room at a time, we need to divide the total number of students who will try the escape room by 8 to find the total number of groups required. 

40 / 8 = 5

Since each group takes 45 minutes to try the escape room, we multiply the number of groups by the time it takes for each group to try the escape room.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length can be represented as 4x.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, and it is divided into two pieces. Therefore, the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is equal to 40 feet. We can write this as an equation:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Now, divide both sides of the equation by 5 to solve for x:

x = 40 / 5
x = 8

Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, we can find its length by multiplying x by 4:

Longer piece = 4x
Longer piece = 4 * 8
Longer piece = 32

"To determine the amount of seasoning Aiden needs, we first need to find out how many pounds of ground beef he needs to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound to find the total pounds of meat needed.

Total meatballs needed = 80
Meatballs per pound = 16

Total pounds of meat needed = Total meatballs needed / Meatballs per pound
Total pounds of meat needed = 80 / 16
Total pounds of meat needed = 5

Since Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat, we can multiply the total pounds of meat needed by the amount of seasoning per pound to find the total amount of seasoning needed.

Total seasoning needed = Total pounds of meat needed * Seasoning per pound
Total seasoning needed = 5 * 2
Total seasoning needed = 10

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of treats that Carly's class will have. Since each person gets two treats and there are five people in the class, the total number of treats is 2 * 5 = 10.

Let's denote the number of cupcakes as C and the number of brownies as B. We are given that Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, so we can write this as B = 3C - 2.

We also know that the total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, so C + B = 10.

Substituting the expression for B from the first equation into the second equation, we get C + (3C - 2) = 10.

Simplifying the equation, we get 4C - 2 = 10.

Adding 2 to both sides of the equation, we get 4C = 12.

Dividing both sides of the equation by 4, we get C = 3.

$75 * 0.20 = $15

Now, we subtract the discount from the total price to get the discounted price.
$75 - $15 = $60

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the nail art. Since Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, and assuming a standard adult has 10 fingers, the total cost of nail art is $3 * 10 = $30.

"To find the total number of magazines Susan receives per year, we need to calculate the number of issues from each magazine and add them up.

1. The first 3 magazines send 12 issues a year, so the total number of issues from these magazines is 3 * 12 = 36.
2. The second magazine sends 6 issues a year.
3. The third magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6-issue magazine, which is 4 * 6 = 24 issues per year.

Now, let's add up the total number of issues: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

However, the question asks for the total number of magazines, not issues. Since each magazine sends a certain number of issues, we need to find the total number of magazines. We know that the first 3 magazines send 12 issues each, the second magazine sends 6 issues, and the third magazine sends 24 issues. 

The first 3 magazines are the same, so we can consider them as 1 type of magazine. The second magazine is a different type, and the third magazine is also a different type. Therefore, Susan has 4 different types of magazines.

The total number of magazines is 4.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of paintings Shelley has. Since Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, and Samantha has 27 paintings, we can set up an equation to find Shelley's total.

Let's denote the number of paintings Shelley has as S. Since Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, we can write the equation as:

Samantha's paintings = Shelley's paintings - 12
27 = S - 12

To find Shelley's total, we add 12 to both sides of the equation:

S = 27 + 12
S = 39

Now that we know Shelley has 39 paintings, we can find the number of paintings Kim has. Since Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, we can set up another equation:

Shelley's paintings = Kim's paintings + 8
39 = K + 8

To find Kim's total, we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:

K = 39 - 8
K = 31

1/4 of 20 is calculated as: 20 * (1/4) = 20 * 0.25 = 5

This means Eve was left with 5 pieces of pomelos after giving some away. 

Since Eve originally had 20 pieces, the number of pomelos she gave away can be found by subtracting the remaining amount from the original amount: 

20 - 5 = 15

So, Eve gave away 15 pieces of pomelos.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the number of apples Walter ate, we need to calculate 2/5 of 60. 

2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

So, Walter ate 24 apples. 

Now, we need to find the number of apples remaining. 

60 - 24 = 36

Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples. 

25% of 36 = (25/100) * 36 = 0.25 * 36 = 9

So, Walter gave his sister 9 apples. 

Now, we need to find the number of apples remaining. 

36 - 9 = 27

Walter sold the remaining apples to his uncle at $3 each. 

Number of apples sold = 27
Price per apple = $3
Total money received = Number of apples sold * Price per apple
Total money received = 27 * 3
Total money received = 81

The final answer is: $81"
"To find the total number of novels Regina wrote this year, we need to determine the total number of novels she wrote last year and then multiply it by 4 (since 3 quarters is equivalent to 3/4, and to find the whole, we multiply by 4/3).

Regina wrote 9 novels last year. 

To find the total number of novels she wrote this year, we multiply 9 by 4/3.

9 * (4/3) = 12

So, Regina wrote 12 novels this year.

"To find the distance covered by Michael in 3 days, we need to calculate the total distance he travels in that time. 

First, we need to find the total hours he travels in 3 days. Since there are 24 hours in a day, the total hours he travels is 3 * 24 = 72 hours.

Now, we can find the total distance he travels by multiplying his average speed by the total hours he travels: 50 km/hr * 72 hr = 3600 km.

To find the percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas that he has covered, we need to divide the distance he has traveled by the total distance and multiply by 100: (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100 = 60%.

The final answer is: 60"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Madeline ate 6 grapes.
2. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make a full glass, so he used 6 * 5 = 30 grapes.
3. The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.
4. Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie requires 12 grapes. So, the total number of grapes used by their mother is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.
5. To find the total number of grapes at the beginning, we need to add the grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and her mother. However, since the grapes used by their mother are the remaining grapes, we need to subtract the grapes used by Madeline and her brother from the total number of grapes used by their mother to find the initial number of grapes. 
   Total grapes used by their mother = 48
   Total grapes used by Madeline and her brother = 36
   Initial number of grapes = Total grapes used by their mother + Total grapes used by Madeline and her brother
   Initial number of grapes = 48 + 36
   Initial number of grapes = 84

"To find the total number of teachers at school that day, we need to add the number of teachers who were sick and the number of substitute teachers. 

Number of teachers who were sick: 13
Number of substitute teachers: 9

Total number of teachers at school that day = Number of teachers who were sick + Number of substitute teachers
Total number of teachers at school that day = 13 + 9
Total number of teachers at school that day = 22

However, we also need to consider the total number of teachers at the school. The problem states that 13 out of 82 teachers were sick. This means that 82 - 13 = 69 teachers were not sick. 

Since 9 substitute teachers were called in, the total number of teachers at school that day is the sum of the teachers who were not sick and the substitute teachers.

Total number of teachers at school that day = 69 + 9
Total number of teachers at school that day = 78

The final answer is: 78"
"To find the total cost of making macaroni and cheese, we need to calculate the cost of the pasta, cheddar cheese, and gruyere cheese.

The cost of the pasta is $1.00 per box. Since Bud makes it once a week, he buys 52 boxes in a year (52 weeks). The total cost of the pasta is 52 * $1.00 = $52.00.

The cost of the cheddar cheese is $3.00. Since Bud makes it once a week, he buys 52 * $3.00 = $156.00 worth of cheddar cheese in a year.

The cost of the gruyere cheese is twice the cost of the cheddar cheese, which is 2 * $3.00 = $6.00. Since Bud makes it once a week, he buys 52 * $6.00 = $312.00 worth of gruyere cheese in a year.

The total cost of making macaroni and cheese in a year is the sum of the costs of the pasta, cheddar cheese, and gruyere cheese: $52.00 + $156.00 + $312.00 = $520.00.

The final answer is: $520.00"
"To find the total number of classrooms the custodian needs to clean, we already know that number is 80. 

The custodian has 5 days to complete the task. 

First, we need to find the total number of minutes the custodian has to work in 5 days. Since they work 8 hours a day, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total minutes per day is 8 * 60 = 480 minutes. 

The total minutes for 5 days is 480 * 5 = 2400 minutes.

Now, we need to find the total minutes spent cleaning classrooms. Since it takes 15 minutes per classroom, and there are 80 classrooms, the total minutes spent cleaning is 15 * 80 = 1200 minutes.

To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms, we need to divide the total minutes spent cleaning by the total minutes available and multiply by 100. 

(1200 / 2400) * 100 = 50%

"To solve this problem, let's first determine the capacity of each shelf. 

Let's denote the capacity of a middle shelf as 'x'. Since the bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, its capacity is 2x. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so its capacity is 2x - 5.

We know that each of the middle shelves can hold 10 books. Therefore, x = 10.

Now, we can calculate the capacity of the bottom and top shelves:
- Bottom shelf: 2x = 2 * 10 = 20 books
- Top shelf: 2x - 5 = 2 * 10 - 5 = 15 books

The total capacity of the three shelves is 10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55 books.

Since Elly has 110 books, she needs more than one bookcase to hold all of them. Let's calculate how many bookcases she needs.

Let's assume she needs 'n' bookcases. The total capacity of 'n' bookcases is 55n.

We want to find the smallest 'n' such that 55n â‰¥ 110.

Dividing both sides by 55, we get n â‰¥ 2.

Therefore, Elly needs at least 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

"To find Rose's profit, we first need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

The cost of 5 dozens of eggs is 5 * $2.40 = $12.

Since 1 dozen has 12 eggs, 5 dozens have 5 * 12 = 60 eggs.

Rose will sell the eggs for $1 for 3 eggs, so the selling price per egg is $1 / 3 = $0.33.

The total revenue from selling 60 eggs is 60 * $0.33 = $20.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $20 - $12 = $8.

The final answer is: $8"
"To find the number of white hats, we first need to determine the number of red and blue hats. 

Half of the hats are red, so the number of red hats is 100 * 0.5 = 50.

The remaining hats are 100 - 50 = 50. 

3/5 of the remaining hats are blue, so the number of blue hats is 50 * (3/5) = 30.

The number of white hats is the remaining hats after subtracting the red and blue hats, which is 50 - 30 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the cost of each stick of jerky, we need to first calculate the total cost of the bag after the discount and then divide that by the number of sticks.

The original price of the bag is $18.00, and there's a $3.00 discount. 

New price = Original price - Discount
New price = $18.00 - $3.00
New price = $15.00

Since the new price is in dollars, we need to convert it to cents to match the units of the number of sticks (30). There are 100 cents in a dollar.

New price in cents = New price * 100
New price in cents = $15.00 * 100
New price in cents = 1500 cents

Now, we can find the cost of each stick by dividing the new price in cents by the number of sticks.

Cost per stick = New price in cents / Number of sticks
Cost per stick = 1500 cents / 30
Cost per stick = 50 cents

"To determine the total number of questions Audrey needs to answer correctly to pass, we first need to find the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly out of the total questions in both tests. 

The total number of questions in both tests is 70 + 40 = 110. 

Since she needs to answer 70% of the total questions correctly, we can calculate this as 0.7 * 110 = 77 questions.

Now, let's find out how many questions she answered correctly in the first test. She got 60% of 70 questions correct, which is 0.6 * 70 = 42 questions.

To find out how many questions she needs to answer correctly in the second test, we subtract the number of questions she answered correctly in the first test from the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly. 

77 - 42 = 35

So, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as S and the number of blueberry cubes as B. We know that B = 5S - 4.

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, which is the sum of strawberry and blueberry cubes. So, we can write the equation: S + B = 116.

Substituting the expression for B from the first equation into the second equation, we get: S + (5S - 4) = 116.

Combine like terms: 6S - 4 = 116.

Add 4 to both sides: 6S = 120.

Divide both sides by 6: S = 20.

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes: B = 5S - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96.

Ara plays 40 games every year, and she has been playing for 4 years. So, the total number of games she has played is:
40 games/year * 4 years = 160 games

Since her score for every game is 21 points, we can multiply the total number of games by her score per game to find the total points:
160 games * 21 points/game = 3360 points

The final answer is: 3360"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Brendan initially had 10 marbles.
2. He dropped half of them, so he had 10 / 2 = 5 marbles left.
3. He found 3 more marbles, so now he had 5 + 3 = 8 marbles.
4. However, one of the marbles he picked up was actually a bead, so he removed it from the count. This leaves him with 8 - 1 = 7 marbles.

Therefore, Brendan ended up with 7 marbles.

"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of flashlights and the number of candles separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of flashlights. There are 4 people in the family, and each person has a flashlight. So, the total number of flashlights is 4.

Next, let's calculate the number of candles. There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. 

Half of 8 rooms is 4 rooms. So, 4 rooms have 4 small candles each, which is 4 * 4 = 16 small candles. The other 4 rooms have 5 medium candles each, which is 4 * 5 = 20 medium candles. 

The total number of candles is 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles.

Now, we add the number of flashlights and the number of candles together: 4 flashlights + 36 candles = 40.

"To find out the total number of calls Tim deals with in a day, we need to convert the time it takes him to deal with a call from minutes to hours. 

15 minutes is equal to 15/60 = 0.25 hours.

Now, we can find the number of calls he deals with in a day by dividing the total hours he spends at work by the time it takes to deal with a call.

Number of calls per day = 6 hours / 0.25 hours per call = 24 calls per day.

To find the total number of calls he deals with in a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of calls per day by the number of days.

Total calls in a week = 24 calls per day * 5 days = 120 calls.

"To find the total cost of the phone plan, we need to determine the cost of the additional phones and add it to the cost of the main phone.

Let's assume the cost of each additional phone is x. Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of the main phone is 2x.

We know that the main phone costs $20, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 20

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 20 / 2
x = 10

Now that we know the cost of each additional phone is $10, we can find the total cost of the additional phones. There are 4 additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is:

4x = 4 * 10
4x = 40

The total cost of the phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of kernels that popped during each 30-second interval and then add the additional kernels that popped from residual heat.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped.

In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount popped, so 3 * 20 = 60 kernels popped.

In the next 30 seconds, four times the initial popping rate popped, so 4 * 20 = 80 kernels popped.

In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slowed down to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, so 0.5 * 80 = 40 kernels popped.

So far, a total of 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 kernels popped.

After Garrett takes the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat. A quarter of 40 is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

Therefore, the total number of kernels that popped is 200 + 10 = 210.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by Elvis in both directions and then determine the remaining distance from his house.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled in the west direction:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 18 mph * 5 hours
Distance = 90 miles

Now, let's calculate the distance traveled in the east direction:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 18 mph * 8 hours
Distance = 144 miles

Since Elvis traveled 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, we need to find the net distance from his house. To do this, we subtract the distance traveled west from the distance traveled east:

Net distance = Distance traveled east - Distance traveled west
Net distance = 144 miles - 90 miles
Net distance = 54 miles

So, Elvis is 54 miles away from his house now.

"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year and subtract it from the initial value.

Initial value of the boat = $9000

First year depreciation = 30% of $9000 = 0.3 * $9000 = $2700
Value after first year = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Second year depreciation = 30% of $6300 = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890
Value after second year = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Third year depreciation = 20% of $4410 = 0.2 * $4410 = $882

"To find the number of pink candies, we first need to determine the number of orange and yellow candies. 

We are given that there are 54 red candies. Since there are twice as many orange candies as red candies, the number of orange candies is 2 * 54 = 108.

We are also given that there are half as many yellow candies as red candies. The number of yellow candies is 54 / 2 = 27.

Now, we know the total number of candies is 232. We can find the total number of non-pink candies by adding the number of red, orange, and yellow candies: 54 + 108 + 27 = 189.

To find the number of pink candies, we subtract the total number of non-pink candies from the total number of candies: 232 - 189 = 43.

"To find out how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we first need to determine how many marbles Dallas received. We know that Dallas had 21 marbles after dropping 4, so we can calculate the number of marbles he received from Mazie by adding the marbles he dropped back to the total he had after receiving them.

Dallas received 21 + 4 = 25 marbles from Mazie.

Since Mazie gave a total of 52 marbles to the twins, and Dallas received 25, we can find out how many marbles Darla received by subtracting the number of marbles Dallas received from the total number of marbles given by Mazie.

Darla received 52 - 25 = 27 marbles.

"To determine the total weight of the car and its contents, we need to add the weight of the car, the luggage, and the weight of the two children.

Total weight = weight of car + weight of luggage + weight of children
Total weight = 1200 pounds + 250 pounds + (2 * 75 pounds)
Total weight = 1200 pounds + 250 pounds + 150 pounds
Total weight = 1600 pounds

Since the force required to move the car is 1% of the total weight, we need to calculate 1% of 1600 pounds.

Force required = 1% * 1600 pounds
Force required = 0.01 * 1600 pounds
Force required = 16 pounds

"To determine how much John needs to spend on hot dogs, we first need to calculate the total number of hot dogs required for the party. 

John invited 20 people, and each guest will eat 2 hot dogs. So, the total number of hot dogs required is 20 * 2 = 40 hot dogs.

However, John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party. Therefore, he needs to buy 40 - 4 = 36 hot dogs.

Since a pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs and costs $2, we need to find out how many packs John needs to buy. 

To do this, we divide the total number of hot dogs needed (36) by the number of hot dogs in a pack (6). 

36 / 6 = 6

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the speed of Aaron and Vanessa. Let's assume Aaron's speed is A miles per minute and Vanessa's speed is V miles per minute.

Given that Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, we can write the equation:
A = 2V

We are also given that Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron, so if Vanessa runs 4 miles, Aaron runs 2 miles. Since Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, we can write the equation:
2 = 16A
A = 1/8 miles per minute

Now that we know Aaron's speed, we can find Vanessa's speed:
V = A / 2
V = (1/8) / 2
V = 1/16 miles per minute

Since Vanessa runs 4 miles at a speed of 1/16 miles per minute, we can find the time it took her to complete her part of the race:

First, let's find James' current age. We know that James is twice as old as Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years. This means that James is twice as old as 12 - 3 = 9 years old. So, James is 9 * 2 = 18 years old.

Since James is 18 years old now and John had him when he was 19, John is currently 19 + 18 = 37 years old.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so the youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years old now.

In 3 years, the youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

The final answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many oranges each person can peel in an hour and then compare their rates.

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges.

Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

To find out how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane, we subtract Jane's total from Ana's total: 20 - 15 = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total amount Mark paid, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator and the labor cost.

First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator. The original price is $400, and Mark gets it for 80% off. To find the discount amount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage (80% = 0.8).

Discount = $400 * 0.8 = $320

The cost of the radiator after the discount is the original price minus the discount amount.

Cost of radiator = $400 - $320 = $80

Next, let's calculate the labor cost. The mechanic works for 3 hours at $50 an hour.

Labor cost = 3 hours * $50/hour = $150

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the labor cost to find the total amount Mark paid.

Total amount = Cost of radiator + Labor cost
= $80 + $150
= $230

The final answer is: $230"
"Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as W. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write the equation:

C + W = 20

We also know that the total number of legs is 70. Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, so we can write the equation:

2C + 4W = 70

We can solve this system of equations by multiplying the first equation by 2 to get:

2C + 2W = 40

Now, we can subtract this equation from the second equation to eliminate C:

(2C + 4W) - (2C + 2W) = 70 - 40
2W = 30

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

W = 15

Now that we know the number of cows, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find the number of chickens:

C + 15 = 20
C = 5

Therefore, the number of chickens is 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

First, let's find the total number of slices. There are 7 pizzas, and each pizza is cut into 8 slices. 

Total slices = 7 pizzas * 8 slices/pizza = 56 slices

There are 4 people in total, including Henry and his 3 friends. 

Now, let's divide the total number of slices by the number of people:

56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices/person

So, each person can have 14 slices."
