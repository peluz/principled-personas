"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to first determine how many eggs she has left after eating and baking. 

Janet starts with 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast, so she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left. Then, she bakes 4 eggs for muffins, leaving her with 13 - 4 = 9 eggs.

Since she sells the remaining eggs at $2 each, we multiply the number of eggs she sells (9) by the price per egg ($2). 

9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18

So, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.

"To find the total number of bolts needed for the robe, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber first. Since it's half the amount of blue fiber, and there are 2 bolts of blue fiber, we can calculate the white fiber as follows:

White fiber = 2 bolts (blue fiber) / 2 = 1 bolt

Now, we add the blue fiber and white fiber together to get the total number of bolts:

Total bolts = 2 bolts (blue fiber) + 1 bolt (white fiber) = 3 bolts

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the profit Josh made, we first need to determine the total value of the house after the repairs. 

The original value of the house was $80,000. Josh put in $50,000 in repairs, which increased the value of the house by 150%. 

To find the new value of the house, we can set up an equation: 

New Value = Original Value + (Original Value * 150% of the original value)

New Value = $80,000 + ($80,000 * 1.5)

New Value = $80,000 + $120,000

New Value = $200,000

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the total cost (purchase price + repairs) from the new value of the house.

Total Cost = $80,000 (purchase price) + $50,000 (repairs) = $130,000

Profit = New Value - Total Cost
Profit = $200,000 - $130,000
Profit = $70,000

The final answer is: $70,000"
"To find the total number of meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total meters he runs in one sprint session and then multiply it by the number of sessions he has in a week.

Since James runs 3 sprints in one session, and each sprint is 60 meters, the total meters he runs in one session is:
3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/session

Since James runs 3 sessions a week, the total meters he runs in a week is:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

The final answer is: 540"
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to determine the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon meals. 

In the morning, Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups of feed. In the afternoon, she gives them another 25 cups of feed. So, the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

Since Wendi feeds each chicken 3 cups of feed per day, and she has 20 chickens, the total amount of feed needed per day is 3 * 20 = 60 cups.

Now, to find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we subtract the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total amount of feed needed per day. 

60 (total feed needed per day) - 40 (feed given in morning and afternoon) = 20 cups.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining glasses. 

The first glass costs $5. 
The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3. 
The third glass costs 60% of $3, which is 0.6 * $3 = $1.8. 
We can see that the cost of each subsequent glass is 60% of the previous glass's cost. 

The sequence of the cost of the glasses is: $5, $3, $1.8, $1.08, $0.64, $0.384, $0.2304, $0.13824, $0.082944, $0.0497664, $0.02986584, $0.017949504, $0.010794903, $0.00646784128, $0.003863960576, $0.0023281813456, $0.0014005088032.

To find the total cost, we need to sum up the cost of all the glasses. 
Total cost = $5 + $3 + $1.8 + $1.08 + $0.64 + $0.384 + $0.2304 + $0.13824 + $0.082944 + $0.0497664 + $0.02986584 + $0.017949504 + $0.010794903 + $0.00646784128 + $0.003863960576 + $0.0023281813456 + $0.0014005088032.

Total cost ≈ $24.999999999999996.

However, we can also use a formula to find the total cost. The cost of the first glass is $5, and the cost of the remaining 15 glasses is the sum of a geometric series with a first term of $3 and a common ratio of 0.6. 

The sum of a geometric series is given by the formula: S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.

In this case, a = $3, r = 0.6, and n = 15. 

S = $3 * (1 - 0.6^15) / (1 - 0.6)

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   Since Seattle has 20 sheep, Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.

2. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   Since Charleston has 80 sheep, Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, let's add up the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle:
160 (Toulouse) + 80 (Charleston) + 20 (Seattle) = 260

The final answer is: 260"
"To find the total time it takes Carla to download the file, we need to calculate the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file, the time it takes to install the updates, and the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file.

First, let's find the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file. 40% of 200 GB is 0.4 x 200 = 80 GB. Since Carla can download 2 GB/minute, the time it takes to download 80 GB is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

Next, we need to add the time it takes to install the updates, which is 20 minutes.

Now, we need to find the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file. 60% of 200 GB is 0.6 x 200 = 120 GB. The time it takes to download 120 GB is 120 / 2 = 60 minutes.

The total time it takes to download the file is the sum of the time it takes to download the first 40%, the time it takes to install the updates, and the time it takes to download the remaining 60%. 

Total time = 40 + 20 + 60 = 120 minutes

The final answer is: 120"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and calculate the distance traveled in each segment.

First, John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph. The distance traveled in this segment is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 60 mph * 3 hours = 180 miles

Then, he spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so no distance is traveled in this segment.

Next, he drives for 0.5 hours (half an hour) at 30 mph. The distance traveled in this segment is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 mph * 0.5 hours = 15 miles

Finally, he drives for the remaining 1.5 hours (4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours) at 80 mph. The distance traveled in this segment is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 80 mph * 1.5 hours = 120 miles

The total distance traveled is the sum of the distances in each segment:
Total Distance = 180 miles + 0 miles + 15 miles + 120 miles = 315 miles

However, since John is trying to get home, we need to consider the distance he traveled initially. He drove 180 miles away from home, and then he traveled 315 miles in total. Since he is trying to get home, we need to subtract the initial distance from the total distance to find the distance from home:
Distance from home = Total Distance - Initial Distance = 315 miles - 180 miles = 135 miles

The final answer is: 135"
"To find Eliza's total earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately, then add them together.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings are:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours, she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours. Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, so her overtime rate is $10 * 1.2 = $12/hour. 
Her overtime earnings are:
5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Total earnings = $400 + $60 = $460

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and then add them together.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it's 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the downloads were reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which is 54. Then, we subtract 54 from 180 to get 126 downloads in the third month.

Now, we add the downloads from each month together: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The final answer is: 366"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts: 3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen will be 3 x $68 = $204.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes: 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen will be 2 x $80 = $160.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes: 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen will be 6 x $55 = $330.

Finally, let's add the costs of all the pastries together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost is $694."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of planting the tree and the annual expenses, and then find the point at which the total earnings from selling lemons exceed these costs.

The initial cost of planting the tree is $90. The annual expenses for watering and feeding the tree are $3. 

Each year, the tree will grow 7 lemons, which can be sold for $1.5 each, resulting in a total annual revenue of 7 * $1.5 = $10.5.

To find the break-even point, we need to calculate the total cost of the tree and the total annual expenses, and then find the point at which the total earnings from selling lemons exceed these costs.

Let's denote the number of years as 'n'. The total cost of the tree is $90, and the total annual expenses are $3. The total earnings from selling lemons after 'n' years will be $10.5 * n.

The break-even point can be found by setting up the equation:

Total cost + Total annual expenses * n = Total earnings from lemons

90 + 3n = 10.5n

Subtracting 3n from both sides:

90 = 7.5n

Dividing both sides by 7.5:

n = 90 / 7.5
n = 12

So, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

The final answer is: 12"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume Melanie started with x vacuum cleaners.

At the green house, she sold a third of her vacuum cleaners, which is x/3.

At the red house, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners.

At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, which is (x - x/3 - 2)/2.

We know that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we can set up the equation:

x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

To simplify the equation, let's first simplify the fraction (x - x/3 - 2)/2:

(x - x/3 - 2)/2 = (2x/3 - 6)/2 = x/3 - 3

Now, let's rewrite the equation:

x - x/3 - 2 - (x/3 - 3) = 5

Combine like terms:

x - 2x/3 - 2 + x/3 - 3 = 5

Combine like terms:

x - 2x/3 - 5 = 5

To get rid of the fraction, multiply both sides by 3:

3x - 2x - 15 = 15

Combine like terms:

x - 15 = 15

Add 15 to both sides:

x = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to find the number of students who enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance, and then subtract that from the total number of students.

20% of 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance:
20 * 0.2 = 4 students

The remaining students are 20 - 4 = 16 students.

25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:
16 * 0.25 = 4 students

The number of students who enrolled in jazz dance is 4, and the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance is 4. So, the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is 20 - 4 - 4 = 12 students.

To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100:
(12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is: 60"
"To determine the maximum profit, we need to calculate the potential increase in value for both options and then compare them.

For the jewelry option, the potential increase in value is 2.5% of $5,000:
2.5% of $5,000 = 0.025 * $5,000 = $125

For the electronic gadgets option, the potential increase in value is 1.2% of $8,000:
1.2% of $8,000 = 0.012 * $8,000 = $96

Since the jewelry option has a higher potential increase in value, the merchant should choose the jewelry option to maximize profit.

The potential profit from the jewelry option is the increase in value, which is $125.

The final answer is: $125"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance covered on the first day and the distance covered on the second day.

On the first day, both trains travel 80 miles westward. Since they are traveling in the same direction, they cover the same distance. 

On the second day, they travel 150 miles northward. Again, since they are traveling in the same direction, they cover the same distance.

So, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 80 miles + 150 miles = 230 miles.

The final answer is: 230"
"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:

She works 35 hours a week as a teacher and gets paid $20 per hour. So, her weekly earnings from teaching are:
35 hours/week * $20/hour = $700/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from teaching are:
$700/week * 50 weeks/year = $35,000/year

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:

She works 15 hours a week as a coach and gets paid $30 per hour. So, her weekly earnings from coaching are:
15 hours/week * $30/hour = $450/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from coaching are:
$450/week * 50 weeks/year = $22,500/year

Now, let's add her earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary:
$35,000/year (teaching) + $22,500/year (coaching) = $57,500/year

The final answer is: $57,500"
"To find out how many eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to first calculate how many eggs she eats in a day and then multiply that by the number of days in 4 weeks.

Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning, so she eats 3 eggs per day. 

There are 7 days in a week, so in 4 weeks, there are 4 x 7 = 28 days.

Now, we multiply the number of eggs she eats per day by the number of days in 4 weeks: 3 eggs/day * 28 days = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks: 84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozen eggs.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much time Marissa has left to walk the remaining distance. 

She has walked 4 miles in 1 hour and 2 miles in another hour, so she has walked a total of 6 miles in 2 hours. 

The total distance of the trail is 12 miles, and she has already walked 6 miles, so she has 12 - 6 = 6 miles left to walk.

Since she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, and the total distance is 12 miles, she needs to walk the entire 12 miles in 12 / 4 = 3 hours.

She has already walked for 2 hours, so she has 3 - 2 = 1 hour left to walk the remaining 6 miles.

To find her required speed, we divide the remaining distance by the remaining time: 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total amount of water in the orange drink, we first need to calculate two-thirds of 10 liters. Two-thirds of 10 liters is (2/3) * 10 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters. Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, this means 6.67 liters of the orange drink is water.

Next, we need to find the total amount of water in the pineapple drink. Three-fifths of 15 liters is (3/5) * 15 = 45/5 = 9 liters. Since the pineapple drink is three-fifths water, this means 9 liters of the pineapple drink is water.

Now, we need to subtract the 1 liter of orange drink that was spilled. The total amount of water in the orange drink after the spill is 6.67 - 1 = 5.67 liters.

The total amount of water in the mixture is the sum of the water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink, which is 5.67 + 9 = 14.67 liters.

However, we are asked to find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture. Since we have 1 liter of orange drink spilled, the total amount of the mixture is 10 + 15 - 1 = 24 liters. The amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 14.67 liters."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha.
2. Samantha is now 31 years old.
3. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, Raymond is 31 - 6 = 25 years old.
4. Raymond had a son at the age of 23, so the son is 25 - 23 = 2 years younger than Raymond.
5. Since the son is 2 years younger than Raymond, and Raymond is 25 years old, the son is 25 - 2 = 23 years old.
6. To find out how many years ago the son was born, we need to subtract his age from the current year. However, the current year is not given, but we can find the difference in age between Samantha and the son, which is 31 - 23 = 8 years.

Since we don't know the current year, we can't find the exact year the son was born, but we can find the difference in age between Samantha and the son, which is 8 years.

However, if we assume the current year is the year Samantha is 31, then the son was born 8 years ago.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how many DVDs Billy sold, we need to calculate the total number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers.

The first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each, so they bought a total of 3 DVDs. 

The next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so they bought a total of 2 * 2 = 4 DVDs.

Now, let's add the total number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers: 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs.

The last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs, so we don't need to add anything to the total.

Therefore, Billy sold a total of 7 DVDs on Tuesday.

"To find out how many centimeters shorter the candle will be, we need to calculate the total time it burns and multiply it by the rate at which it melts.

The candle burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, which is a total of 4 hours.

The candle melts at a rate of 2 centimeters per hour.

So, we multiply the total time (4 hours) by the rate (2 centimeters per hour):

4 hours * 2 centimeters/hour = 8 centimeters

The candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

"To find the original price of the book, we need to determine the amount of the discount and add it to the discounted price. 

First, let's find the amount of the discount: 
Discount = 25% of the original price
Let's call the original price 'x'. 
Discount = 0.25x

Since the discounted price is $19.50, we can set up the equation:
x - 0.25x = 19.50
Combine like terms:
0.75x = 19.50
Now, divide both sides by 0.75 to solve for x:
x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book was $26.

The final answer is: $26"
"To find the total cost of the items Marie ordered, we need to calculate the cost of the chicken meal, the milk, and the apples, and then subtract that from the total amount she paid.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of the milk is 5 packs * $3 per pack = $15.
The cost of the apples is 4 apples * $1.50 per apple = $6.

The total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the cost of the pizza boxes is $50 - $33 = $17.

To find the number of boxes of pizza, we need to divide the cost of the pizza boxes by the cost per box: $17 / $8.50 = 2.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total amount Mishka spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

First, let's find the total cost of the shorts: 3 pairs of shorts * $16.50 = $49.50
Next, let's find the total cost of the pants: 3 pairs of pants * $22.50 = $67.50
Then, let's find the total cost of the shoes: 3 pairs of shoes * $42 = $126
Now, let's add the costs of all the items together: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243

"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to calculate the total number of cartons she buys and then multiply it by the cost per carton.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she will go through 60 servings in 60 days. 

Each carton has 15 servings, so to find out how many cartons she buys, we divide the total number of servings by the number of servings per carton: 
60 servings / 15 servings per carton = 4 cartons

Now, we multiply the number of cartons by the cost per carton to find the total cost:
4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00

The final answer is: $16.00"
"To find the distance Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to determine the distance between the two stops. 

First, let's find the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip. Since Henry's second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip is 60 - 15 = 45 miles.

Now, we know that Henry's first stop was after 20 miles. So, the distance from the first stop to the second stop is the difference between the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip and the distance from the first stop. 

Distance from the first stop to the second stop = Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip - Distance from the first stop
= 45 miles - 20 miles
= 25 miles

The final answer is: 25"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that one pair of heels costs $33 and the other costs twice as much, which means the second pair costs 2 * $33 = $66. 

The total cost of the two pairs of heels is $33 + $66 = $99. We are also told that the two pairs of heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. 

Let's represent the cost of the boots as 'x'. Since the two pairs of heels cost $99 and they are five dollars less than the boots, we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 99.

To find the cost of the boots, we need to solve for 'x'. We can do this by adding 5 to both sides of the equation: x = 99 + 5.

x = 104

The final answer is: $104"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let Darrell's age be 7x and Allen's age be 11x, where x is a constant. 

Since their total age is 162, we can write the equation: 
7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms: 
18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18: 
x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Darrell's and Allen's current ages: 
Darrell's age = 7x = 7(9) = 63
Allen's age = 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age: 
Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

The final answer is: 109"
"To find the average guess, we need to calculate the total number of guesses and divide by the number of people.

The first person guesses 80 jelly beans.
The second person guesses 20 more than half of 80, which is (80 / 2) + 20 = 60.
The third person guesses 25% more than 80, which is 80 + (80 * 0.25) = 100.

Now, let's add up all the guesses: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

There are 3 people, so we divide the total by 3 to find the average: 240 / 3 = 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the total hours John spends taking care of dogs in a week, we need to first calculate the total hours he spends per day. 

There are 10 dogs, and each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business. 

Total hours per day = Number of dogs * Hours per dog per day
Total hours per day = 10 * 0.5
Total hours per day = 5 hours

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the total hours per day by 7 to find the total hours per week.

Total hours per week = Total hours per day * 7
Total hours per week = 5 * 7
Total hours per week = 35 hours

The final answer is: 35"
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins can be represented as 'x + 30'. 

We know that the total number of coins is 110, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 30) = 110.

Combine like terms: 2x + 30 = 110.

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2x = 80.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 40.

Since x represents the number of silver coins, and there are 30 more gold coins, the number of gold coins is x + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70.

The final answer is: 70"
"To find out how many jewels Siobhan has, we first need to determine how many jewels Aaron has. 

Since Raymond has 40 jewels, half of Raymond's jewels would be 40 / 2 = 20. 

Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, so Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.

Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, so Siobhan has 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.

"To find the total points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points he scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes separately, then add them together.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% of 4, we multiply 4 by 0.25, which is 1. Then, we add this to the original 4 points to get the total points scored in the second 20 minutes: 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Now, we add the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes: 4 + 5 = 9 points.

The total points Mike scored is 9."
"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to first calculate how many yogurts he eats in 30 days and then find out the cost of those yogurts.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

Since they are on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00, we need to find out how many sets of 4 yogurts Terry buys in 30 days. To do this, we divide the total number of yogurts he eats by 4: 60 / 4 = 15.

Now, we multiply the number of sets by the cost per set: 15 * $5.00 = $75.00.

So, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days.

The final answer is: $75.00"
"To find out how many Lego sets John sold, we first need to calculate the total amount of money he made from selling the Lego sets. 

He sold 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount of money he made is 13 * 15 = $195.

Next, we need to find out how much money he spent on video games. He bought 8 video games for $20 each, so the total amount of money he spent is 8 * 20 = $160.

Since he had $5 left after buying the video games, we can find out how much money he had before buying the video games by adding the money he had left to the money he spent on video games. So, he had $160 + $5 = $165 before buying the video games.

Now, we can find out how much money he made from selling the Lego sets by subtracting the money he had before buying the video games from the total amount of money he made from selling the Lego sets. However, we can also find out how much money he made from selling the Lego sets by subtracting the money he spent on video games from the money he had left plus the money he spent on video games. This will give us the same result. 

So, the total amount of money he made from selling the Lego sets is $165 + $160 = $325. 

Now, we can find out how many Lego sets he sold by dividing the total amount of money he made from selling the Lego sets by the price of each Lego set. 

13 Lego sets were not sold, but we know he sold 13 - x Lego sets. We know that 13 - x Lego sets were sold for $195. We also know that 13 Lego sets were sold for $325. So, we can set up the equation (13 - x) * 15 = 195. 

We can solve for x by first dividing both sides of the equation by 15. This gives us 13 - x = 13. 

Now, we can solve for x by subtracting 13 from both sides of the equation. This gives us -x = 0. 

Now, we can solve for x by multiplying both sides of the equation by -1. This gives us x = 0.

However, this is not the correct answer. We know that John sold some of his Lego sets, so x cannot be 0. 

Let's try a different approach. We know that 13 - x Lego sets were sold for $195. We also know that 13 Lego sets were sold for $325. So, we can set up the equation (13 - x) * 15 = 195. 

We can solve for x by first dividing both sides of the equation by 15. This gives us 13 - x = 13.

"To find John's running speed, we first need to calculate the total hours he runs per week. 

He runs 3 hours on the first day. The other two days, he runs half as much as the first day, which is 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours per day. 

So, the total hours he runs per week is 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours.

Now, we know John runs 60 miles a week and 6 hours a week. To find his speed, we divide the total miles by the total hours: 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Dana's running and walking speeds. 

Given that Dana can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run, and she can skip at 3 miles per hour, we can find her running speed by multiplying her skipping speed by 2. 

Dana's running speed = 2 * 3 miles per hour = 6 miles per hour.

Since Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, we can find her walking speed by dividing her running speed by 4.

Dana's walking speed = 6 miles per hour / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, we know that Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. So, in six hours, she will spend 2 hours running and 4 hours walking.

Distance traveled while running = speed * time = 6 miles per hour * 2 hours = 12 miles.

Distance traveled while walking = speed * time = 1.5 miles per hour * 4 hours = 6 miles.

Total distance traveled = distance traveled while running + distance traveled while walking = 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles.

The final answer is: 18"
"Let's break down the information given:

"To solve this problem, we need to find the distance Polly can throw the javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone and then subtract the dragon's reach from that distance.

When Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone. Since she can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone, she can throw it 3 * 400 = 1200 feet with the gemstone.

The dragon's flames reach 1000 feet. To find the distance outside the dragon's reach where Polly can still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's reach from the distance Polly can throw with the gemstone: 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet.

The final answer is: 200"
"To find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we need to first find out the total number of pieces of pie that were available. Since Grandma Jones cut each pie into 8 pieces and she baked 5 pies, the total number of pieces is 5 * 8 = 40.

Since there were 14 pieces of pie remaining at the end of the evening, we can subtract this from the total number of pieces to find out how many were taken by the guests. 

40 - 14 = 26

So, 26 pieces of pie were taken by the guests.

The final answer is: 26"
"To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we first need to calculate how many calories you have left for the day. 

Your daily calorie target is 2000, and you have already consumed 1800 calories. 

2000 (daily target) - 1800 (calories consumed) = 200 calories left for the day.

Since each serving of chips has 250 calories, we need to find out how many servings you can have with the remaining calories.

200 (calories left) / 250 (calories per serving) = 0.8 servings

Since a 300g bag has 5 servings, we need to find out how many grams are in one serving.

300g (total weight) / 5 (servings) = 60g per serving

Now, we can multiply the number of servings you can have by the weight per serving to find out how many grams you can eat.

0.8 (servings) * 60g (per serving) = 48g

The final answer is: 48"
"To find Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost.

First, let's find the total cost. Since one pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10.00, and Charlie makes 10 candles per pound, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax to make 20 candles. The total cost of the beeswax and wicks for 20 candles is 2 * $10.00 = $20.00.

Next, let's find the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, and he sells 20 candles, so the total revenue is 20 * $2.00 = $40.00.

Now, let's find the net profit. The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. So, the net profit is $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.

The final answer is: $20.00"
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we first need to determine the number of articles she wrote each day.

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. To find this, we multiply the number of articles she wrote on Monday by 2/5 and add it to the original number of articles.

2/5 * 5 = 2
5 + 2 = 7

So, on Tuesday, Meredith wrote 7 articles.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. To find this, we multiply the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday by 2.

7 * 2 = 14

Now that we know the number of articles she wrote each day, we can find the total number of hours she spent writing. Each article takes 4 hours to write.

On Monday, she wrote 5 articles, so she spent 5 * 4 = 20 hours writing.
On Tuesday, she wrote 7 articles, so she spent 7 * 4 = 28 hours writing.
On Wednesday, she wrote 14 articles, so she spent 14 * 4 = 56 hours writing.

The total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days is 20 + 28 + 56 = 104 hours.

The final answer is: 104"
"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we need to first determine how many Post-it notes she used in total. 

Candice started with 80 Post-it notes. She used 220 Post-it notes at work. To find the total number of Post-it notes she used, we add these two numbers together: 80 + 220 = 300. 

Since she had 23 Post-it notes remaining, we need to subtract this from the total number of Post-it notes she used to find out how many she purchased: 300 - 23 = 277.

The final answer is: 277"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many blue ties John bought. Since he spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can find the number of blue ties by dividing the total amount spent by the cost per tie.

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is twice the number of blue ties.

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
= 2 * 5
= 10

Now, we need to find the cost of each red tie. Since the red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, we can find the cost of each red tie by adding 50% of the cost of a blue tie to the cost of a blue tie.

Cost of a blue tie = $40
50% of the cost of a blue tie = 0.5 * $40 = $20
Cost of a red tie = Cost of a blue tie + 50% of the cost of a blue tie
= $40 + $20
= $60

Now, we can find the total amount spent on red ties by multiplying the number of red ties by the cost of each red tie.

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of a red tie
= 10 * $60
= $600

Finally, we can find the total amount spent on ties by adding the total amount spent on blue ties and the total amount spent on red ties.

Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
= $200 + $600
= $800

The final answer is: $800"
"To find out how many pieces Tracy obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches, since the pieces are 6 inches long. There are 12 inches in a foot, so the total length of the wire in inches is 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches.

Now, we can divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece to find out how many pieces Tracy obtained: 48 inches / 6 inches/piece = 8 pieces.

"To find the total number of units in the building, we need to multiply the number of floors by the number of units per floor. 

Number of floors: 15
Units per floor: 8

Total units = Number of floors * Units per floor
Total units = 15 * 8
Total units = 120

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we need to find 1/4 of the total units to determine the number of unoccupied units.

Unoccupied units = Total units * (1 - 3/4)
Unoccupied units = Total units * 1/4
Unoccupied units = 120 * 1/4
Unoccupied units = 30

"To find out how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to calculate the total number of eggs produced per week and then multiply it by the price per dozen.

First, let's find out how many eggs are produced per week. There are 7 days in a week, so:

252 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 1764 eggs/week

Since Lloyd sells eggs by the dozen, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen:

1764 eggs/week / 12 eggs/dozen = 147 dozen eggs/week

Now, let's calculate the total revenue per week:

147 dozen eggs/week * $2/dozen = $294/week

So, Lloyd makes $294 per week on eggs.

"To find the total time it takes for Tom to travel back, we first need to determine the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM. Since we don't know the exact distance, let's assume it's 'd' miles. 

The time taken to travel from 1 to 4 PM is d / 10 hours. 

Now, the time taken to travel back is d / 6 hours. 

The total time taken is the sum of these two times: d / 10 + d / 6.

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 30. 

So, the total time is (3d + 5d) / 30 = 8d / 30 = 4d / 15 hours.

However, we still need to find the value of 'd'. To do this, we need to know the distance. Since we don't have the distance, let's assume it's a round trip, and the total time is 4 hours. 

The time taken from 1 to 4 PM is 3 hours. 

So, the time taken to travel back is 4 - 3 = 1 hour.

Now, we can find the distance 'd'. The time taken to travel back is d / 6 = 1 hour. 

d = 6 miles.

Now that we have the distance, we can find the total time taken to travel back. 

The time taken to travel back is d / 6 = 6 / 6 = 1 hour.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much weight the comic books weigh in total. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and Uriah removes 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Since Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds in total, and the comic books already weigh 7.5 pounds, the remaining weight that needs to be removed from the toys is 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound, so to find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy: 7.5 / 0.5 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total revenue for each day, we need to calculate the revenue from truck tires and car tires separately and then add them together.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. The revenue from truck tires is 6 * $60 = $360. The revenue from car tires is 4 * $40 = $160. The total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires. The revenue from car tires is 12 * $40 = $480. Since there are no truck tires, the total revenue on Friday is $480.

To find the day with higher revenue, we compare the revenues: $520 (Thursday) and $480 (Friday). Thursday has higher revenue.

Now, to find how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we subtract the lower revenue from the higher revenue: $520 - $480 = $40.

"To find out how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to calculate how many times he can afford the total cost of a movie outing, which includes both the ticket and the popcorn.

The total cost of a movie outing is $7 (ticket) + $7 (popcorn) = $14.

We know Peter has $42 for the week. To find out how many times he can go to the movies, we'll divide the total amount of money he has by the cost of a movie outing.

$42 ÷ $14 = 3

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times this week.

"To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck, we need to first calculate the remaining weight capacity of the bridge after the truck and driver are on it. 

The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. The weight limit of the bridge is 5000 pounds. 

Remaining weight capacity = Weight limit - Combined weight of driver and empty truck
Remaining weight capacity = 5000 - 3755
Remaining weight capacity = 1245 pounds

Since each box weighs 15 pounds, we can find the maximum number of boxes by dividing the remaining weight capacity by the weight of each box.

Maximum number of boxes = Remaining weight capacity / Weight of each box
Maximum number of boxes = 1245 / 15
Maximum number of boxes = 83

"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to first calculate the total cost after the delivery vendor's fee. 

The original bill was $40.00. The vendor added a 25% fee to this amount. To find 25% of $40.00, we multiply $40.00 by 0.25. 

$40.00 * 0.25 = $10.00

Now, we add the 25% fee to the original bill: 
$40.00 + $10.00 = $50.00

Next, we add the $3.00 delivery fee to the total: 
$50.00 + $3.00 = $53.00

Finally, we add the $4.00 tip to the total:

"To find Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to calculate the value of the pension after 30 years and then add the additional 5% of the value for the last 10 years.

First, let's calculate the total value of the pension after 30 years. Since Marcy gets $50,000 per year for 10 years, we can calculate the total value as follows:

Total value = $50,000 * 10 = $500,000

Now, we need to calculate the additional 5% of the value for the last 10 years. This is 5% of the total value:

Additional value = 0.05 * $500,000 = $25,000

Now, we add the additional value to the total value to get the annual pension after 30 years:

Annual pension = $500,000 / 10 = $50,000 (for the first 10 years) + $25,000 (for the last 10 years) = $75,000

However, this is not the correct answer because the question states that she gets 5% of the value of the pension per year after 20 years. This means that the value of the pension increases by 5% each year for the last 10 years. 

To calculate the correct value, we need to calculate the value of the pension after 20 years and then calculate the value of the pension for the last 10 years.

The value of the pension after 20 years is:
Value after 20 years = $50,000 * 20 = $1,000,000

Now, we need to calculate the value of the pension for the last 10 years. Since the value increases by 5% each year, we can use the formula for compound interest:

Value after 30 years = Value after 20 years * (1 + 0.05)^10
Value after 30 years = $1,000,000 * (1.05)^10
Value after 30 years ≈ $1,628,929.08

Now, we can calculate the annual pension after 30 years by dividing the value after 30 years by 30:

Annual pension = $1,628,929.08 / 30 ≈ $54,296.97

The final answer is: $54,297"
"To find the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to calculate the amount she paid for the first half of the year and the second half of the year separately and then add them together.

The streaming service charges $140 per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the first half of the year consists of 6 months. 

The amount Aleena paid for the first half of the year is 6 * $140 = $840.

For the second half of the year, the streaming company charged her 10% less money. To find the amount she paid for the second half of the year, we need to calculate 10% of $140 and subtract it from $140.

10% of $140 = 0.1 * $140 = $14
Amount paid for the second half of the year = $140 - $14 = $126

The amount Aleena paid for the second half of the year is $126.

Now, we can find the total amount she paid for the streaming service by the end of the year by adding the amount she paid for the first half of the year and the second half of the year.

Total amount = $840 + $126 = $966

The final answer is: $966"
"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to determine the car's miles per gallon (mpg) rating. We can do this by dividing the distance traveled since the last fill-up (100 miles) by the amount of gas used (4 gallons).

mpg = distance / gas used
mpg = 100 miles / 4 gallons
mpg = 25 miles per gallon

Now that we know the car's mpg rating, we can calculate the total distance Sophia can drive on a full tank by multiplying the tank capacity (12 gallons) by the mpg rating.

total distance = tank capacity * mpg
total distance = 12 gallons * 25 miles/gallon
total distance = 300 miles

Therefore, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas.

Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys'), and each team has 5 players. So, the total number of students from each school is 2 teams * 5 players/team = 10 players.

Each school also has a coach for each team, so there are 2 coaches per school.

Now, we multiply the number of students and coaches per school by the total number of schools to find the total number of people sent by all schools.

Total students = 10 players/school * 4 schools = 40 players
Total coaches = 2 coaches/school * 4 schools = 8 coaches

Total people = Total students + Total coaches = 40 + 8 = 48

First, let's calculate the total amount she received from her weekly allowance:

Weekly allowance: $5
Number of weeks: 8
Total allowance = Weekly allowance * Number of weeks
Total allowance = $5 * 8
Total allowance = $40

Now, let's subtract the total allowance from the total amount she has at the end of 8 weeks to find out how much she started with:

Total amount at the end of 8 weeks: $100
Total allowance: $40
Initial amount = Total amount at the end of 8 weeks - Total allowance
Initial amount = $100 - $40
Initial amount = $60

The final answer is: $60"
"To find out how much Judy makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of classes she teaches in a week and then multiply it by the number of students per class and the charge per student.

Judy teaches 5 classes a day, 5 days a week, which is 5 * 5 = 25 classes. 
On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes. 
So, the total number of classes in a week is 25 + 8 = 33 classes.

Each class has 15 students, so the total number of students per week is 33 * 15 = 495 students.

Judy charges $15 per student, so the total amount she makes in a week is 495 * $15 = $7,425.

The final answer is: $7,425."
"To find the total number of instructions, we need to add the number of instructions in the first recipe to the number of instructions in the second recipe.

The first recipe has 20 instructions. 
The second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one, so it has 2 * 20 = 40 instructions.

"To find the total cost of the cell phones, we first need to calculate the total interest charged. Since there are 5 cell phones and a 2% interest will be charged for each unit, the total interest for all 5 phones is 5 * 2% = 10%.

The cost of the cell phones is $150 each, so the total cost is 5 * $150 = $750. 

The total interest charged is 10% of $750, which is 0.1 * $750 = $75.

The total amount Shiela needs to pay is the cost of the cell phones plus the interest, which is $750 + $75 = $825.

Since the payment is for 3 months, we need to divide the total amount by 3 to find the monthly payment. 

$825 / 3 = $275.

The final answer is: $275"

"To find the average square footage of a level, we need to first find the total square footage of the sandcastle and then divide it by the number of levels.

Since each level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can start with the top level and work our way down. 

The top level has a square footage of 16. 
The second level will have half of 16, which is 8. 
The third level will have half of 8, which is 4. 
The fourth level will have half of 4, which is 2.

Now, we add up the square footage of all levels: 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30.

There are 4 levels in total. To find the average square footage, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels: 30 / 4 = 7.5.

The final answer is: 7.5"
"To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food the puppy will eat in the first year. 

First, let's find out how many days are in a year. There are 365 days in a year.

The puppy eats 1 cup of dog food for the first 180 days. So, the amount of dog food eaten in the first 180 days is 1 cup/day * 180 days = 180 cups.

The puppy eats 2 cups of dog food for the rest of its life, which is 365 - 180 = 185 days. So, the amount of dog food eaten in the rest of the year is 2 cups/day * 185 days = 370 cups.

The total amount of dog food eaten in the first year is 180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the total number of bags of dog food used in the first year is 550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
- Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, so David does 400 / 4 = 100 pounds of laundry.
- Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so Raymond does 400 / 2 = 200 pounds of laundry.

To find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do, we subtract the amount David does from the amount Raymond does: 200 - 100 = 100.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the better price, we need to compare the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 and packages of 2.

For packages of 3: 
- The cost of one package of 3 flowers is $2.50.
- To buy 18 flowers, Vincent needs 18 / 3 = 6 packages of 3 flowers.
- The total cost of 18 flowers in packages of 3 is 6 * $2.50 = $15.

For packages of 2:
- The cost of one package of 2 flowers is $1.
- To buy 18 flowers, Vincent needs 18 / 2 = 9 packages of 2 flowers.
- The total cost of 18 flowers in packages of 2 is 9 * $1 = $9.

Since $9 is less than $15, the better price is $9. 

To find the amount of money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price:
- The difference between the cost of buying in packages of 3 and the cost of buying in packages of 2 is $15 - $9 = $6.

First, we multiply the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush: 3 * 25 = 75

Then, we multiply the result by the number of thorns per rose: 75 * 8 = 600

So, there are 600 thorns in total."
"To find out how many games the team won, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the number of games they lost is x. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games they won is x + 8.

We know that the total number of games played is 22, which is the sum of the games won and lost. So, we can write the equation as:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:

2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 7

Since x represents the number of games lost, the number of games won is x + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15

"To find Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we first need to calculate her salary after five years of service, and then calculate the increase for the next three years.

Initially, Sylvie's salary is $600. 

After one year, her salary will be 600 + (600 * 0.10) = 600 + 60 = $660.

After two years, her salary will be 660 + (660 * 0.10) = 660 + 66 = $726.

After three years, her salary will be 726 + (726 * 0.10) = 726 + 72.6 = $798.60.

After four years, her salary will be 798.60 + (798.60 * 0.10) = 798.60 + 79.86 = $878.46.

After five years, her salary will be 878.46 + (878.46 * 0.10) = 878.46 + 87.846 = $966.306.

Now, for the next three years, her salary will increase by 10% each year. 

After six years, her salary will be 966.306 + (966.306 * 0.10) = 966.306 + 96.6306 = $1062.9366.

After seven years, her salary will be 1062.9366 + (1062.9366 * 0.10) = 1062.9366 + 106.29366 = $1169.23026.

After eight years, her salary will be 1169.23026 + (1169.23026 * 0.10) = 1169.23026 + 116.923026 = $1286.153286.

So, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service is $1286.15."
"Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as 'H' and the number of copies Marilyn sold as 'M'. We are given that M = 10H. We also know that M + H = 88,000.

Substituting M = 10H into the second equation, we get 10H + H = 88,000. Combining like terms, we get 11H = 88,000.

To find the value of H, we divide both sides of the equation by 11: H = 88,000 / 11.

H = 8000

The final answer is: 8000"
"To find out how many gift bags Christina needs, we first need to calculate the number of guests who will actually attend the party. Since 1/4 of the invited guests don't show up, we can find the number of guests who will attend by subtracting 1/4 from the total number of invited guests.

16 (invited guests) - (1/4 * 16) = 16 - 4 = 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we multiply the number of attending guests by 0.75 to find the total number of gift bags needed.

12 (attending guests) * 0.75 (gift bags per guest) = 9

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of gift bags needed by the cost per gift bag.

9 (gift bags) * $2 (cost per gift bag) = $18

"To find Gerald's new time, we first need to find out how long it took him to run the 400-meter hurdles before his diet change. Since Lee runs 2 seconds faster than Gerald, and Lee runs it in 38 seconds, Gerald's original time would be 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.

Gerald's speed improved by 10% after his diet change. To find his new time, we need to calculate 10% of his original time and subtract it from his original time. 

10% of 40 seconds is 0.1 * 40 = 4 seconds. 

So, Gerald's new time would be 40 - 4 = 36 seconds.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats.
2. There are two cats for every dog.
3. The number of dogs is 60.

Since there are two cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs, the number of cats can be calculated as follows:
Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
= 2 * 60
= 120

Now, we know the number of dogs and cats. The combined number of dogs and cats is:
Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
= 60 + 120
= 180

According to the first point, the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats:
Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
= 180 - 12
= 168

To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of rabbits, dogs, and cats:
Total number of pets = Number of rabbits + Number of dogs + Number of cats
= 168 + 60 + 120
= 348

"To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we first need to find the total number of girls and then subtract the number of girls in the girl scout.

First, let's find the number of boys and girls. We know that 2/5 of the students are boys. 

Number of boys = (2/5) * 200 = 80

Since there are 200 students in total, the number of girls can be found by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students.

Number of girls = 200 - 80 = 120

Now, we know that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. 

Number of girls in the girl scout = (2/3) * 120 = 80

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls.

Number of girls not in the girl scout = 120 - 80 = 40

"To find out how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we need to first determine the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam. 

We know that 20 cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. 

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as 'x'. Since 5 cars took an exit, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is x + 20 + 5 (the 5 cars that took an exit).

We are given that there were originally 30 cars on the motorway. Since the 5 cars that took an exit are not included in the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 30 - 5 = 25.

Now we can set up an equation to solve for 'x':

x + 20 + 5 = 25

Combine like terms:

x + 25 = 25

Subtract 25 from both sides:

x = 0

So, no cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

"To find out how many potted plants Mary will have left, we need to first determine how many potted plants she has initially and then subtract the number of plants she gives away.

Initially, Mary has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, so she has 2 * 40 = 80 potted plants.

She received 18 new potted plants from the nursery, so now she has 80 + 18 = 98 potted plants.

Tomorrow, she will give away 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges, so she will give away 40 potted plants.

To find out how many potted plants Mary will have left, we subtract the number of plants she gives away from the total number of plants she has: 98 - 40 = 58.

So, Mary will have 58 potted plants left.

"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell and add them up.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. 
1/4 of 20 is 5, so the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. 
We are given that the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times, so the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

Now, we add up the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell: 
20 (first friend) + 25 (second friend) + 70 (third friend) + 60 (fourth friend) = 175

The total number of doorbell rings is 175."

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to find the inner volume of one box and then multiply it by 3.

The outer dimensions of the box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches, but the walls are 1 inch thick. So, the inner dimensions will be (5-2) inches by (6-2) inches by (4-2) inches, which is 3 inches by 4 inches by 2 inches.

The formula to find the volume of a rectangular prism is length * width * height. 

So, the inner volume of one box is 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches.

Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume is 3 * 24 = 72 cubic inches.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 2 episodes of a 1-hour show, which is a total of 2 * 1 = 2 hours.

On Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. Let's call the number of episodes 'x'. Since each episode is 30 minutes, the total time he watched on Wednesday is 30x minutes.

On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, which is a total of 1.5 hours.

On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, which is a total of 2 hours.

The total time Frankie watched TV is 7 hours. We can set up an equation to represent this:

2 (Monday and Tuesday) + 30x (Wednesday) + 1.5 (Thursday) + 2 (Friday) = 7

Combine like terms:

2 + 30x + 1.5 + 2 = 7

Combine the constants:

5.5 + 30x = 7

Subtract 5.5 from both sides:

30x = 1.5

Divide both sides by 30:

x = 0.05

Since x represents the number of episodes, and each episode is 30 minutes, we can multiply x by 30 to find the total time in minutes:

0.05 * 30 = 1.5 minutes

However, this doesn't make sense because we're looking for the number of episodes, not the total time in minutes. Let's re-evaluate the equation:

30x = 1.5

Since 1.5 hours is equal to 90 minutes, we can set up a new equation:

30x = 90

Divide both sides by 30:

x = 3

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of a 30-minute show on Wednesday.

The final answer is: 3"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as 'x'. Since Henry wants to make twice as many cookies this year, he plans to bake 2x cookies.

However, he actually baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the actual number of cookies he baked is 2x + 15.

After baking, he drops 5 cookies, so the total number of cookies he has now is (2x + 15) - 5 = 2x + 10.

We are given that he now has a total of 110 cookies, so we can set up the equation 2x + 10 = 110.

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. We can do this by subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation:

2x + 10 - 10 = 110 - 10
2x = 100

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for x:

2x / 2 = 100 / 2
x = 50

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total cost of gas after the cashback rewards, we need to first calculate the total cost of gas without the rewards, and then subtract the cashback amount.

The cost of gas per gallon is $3.00, and the person is buying 10 gallons. 

Total cost of gas = cost per gallon * number of gallons
Total cost of gas = $3.00 * 10
Total cost of gas = $30.00

The cashback reward is $0.20 per gallon, and the person is buying 10 gallons.

Total cashback = cashback per gallon * number of gallons
Total cashback = $0.20 * 10
Total cashback = $2.00

Now, we subtract the total cashback from the total cost of gas to find the final cost.

Final cost = Total cost of gas - Total cashback
Final cost = $30.00 - $2.00
Final cost = $28.00

The final answer is: $28.00"
"To find the total number of fruit roll-ups eaten by each person, we need to multiply the width and length of each roll-up. 

Beatrice's roll-up is 2 roll-ups wide and 24 rolls long, so the total number of roll-ups is 2 * 24 = 48.

Marcell's roll-up is 3 roll-ups wide and 14 rolls long, so the total number of roll-ups is 3 * 14 = 42.

To find the average number of roll-ups eaten, we need to add the total number of roll-ups eaten by each person and divide by 2. 

Total roll-ups eaten = 48 + 42 = 90
Average roll-ups eaten = 90 / 2 = 45

The final answer is: 45"
"To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to calculate the rate at which the boat is taking on water and then multiply it by the total time it took to reach the shore.

First, let's find the rate at which the boat is taking on water. It takes 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. Since it took 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can find the rate per second as follows:

Rate per 10 feet = 2 liters
Rate per 20 feet = 4 liters (since it's double the distance)
Time taken to row 20 feet = 16 seconds
Rate per second = 4 liters / 16 seconds = 0.25 liters/second

Now, we know the boat takes on 0.25 liters of water per second. The total time it took to reach the shore is 64 seconds. 

Total water taken on = Rate per second * Total time
Total water taken on = 0.25 liters/second * 64 seconds
Total water taken on = 16 liters

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we need to calculate the total number of lessons and then multiply it by the number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per lesson.

Each teacher has 2 lessons per day, and there are 4 teachers. So, the total number of lessons per day is 2 * 4 = 8.

The whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson. Therefore, the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day is 8 * 3 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the total number of flowers Ryan has, we need to calculate the total number of flowers he planted and subtract the ones that did not grow.

Ryan plants 2 flowers a day. After 15 days, he would have planted 2 * 15 = 30 flowers.

However, 5 of these flowers did not grow. So, we need to subtract 5 from the total number of flowers planted.

Total flowers = 30 - 5 = 25

The final answer is: 25"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
2. The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.
3. Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.

From point 1, we know that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. If Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, then Brittany's phone can hold 1800 / 6 = 300 photographs.

From point 2, we know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. This means that the number of birds in Jamal's photograph is 300 / 50 = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total cost of the lumber, we need to calculate the cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards and the 4 x 4 x 10 boards separately and then add them together.

The cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $10 per board = $100.

The cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $16 per board = $80.

The total cost of the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since prices have gone up by 50%, the new price of the lumber is 1.5 times the original price. 

The new price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 per board.

The new price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 per board.

The total revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $15 per board = $150.

The total revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $24 per board = $120.

The total revenue is $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, we need to determine the total parts in the ratio and then find the fraction of the total that represents the sugar.

The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, so the total parts in the ratio is 7 + 13 = 20.

Since Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and water, we can set up a proportion to find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar:

(7/20) = x/120

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

7 * 120 = 20x
840 = 20x
x = 840 / 20
x = 42

The final answer is: 42"
"To find the total amount John paid, we need to calculate the cost of the shoes for all 3 children. 

First, we find the cost of shoes for one child: 2 pairs * $60 per pair = $120.

So, John paid a total of $360."
"To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we first need to find the total number of vehicles that were already at the port. We know that there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles initially is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of vehicles at the port after the second day is 30. To find the number of vehicles that were added on the second day, we subtract the initial number of vehicles from the total number of vehicles: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can find the number of containers imported on the second day by dividing the number of vehicles added by the number of vehicles per container: 20 / 5 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Lylah's salary four years ago. 

Let's assume Lylah's salary four years ago was 'x'. Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can express Adrien's salary as 1.3x. We are given that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000, so we can set up the equation:

1.3x = 40000

To find 'x', we can divide both sides by 1.3:

x = 40000 / 1.3
x = 30769.23

So, Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30769.23.

Now, we need to find Adrien's salary four years later. We are given that his salary increased by 40% of his original salary. We can express this as:

New salary = Original salary + (40% of Original salary)
= 40000 + (0.4 * 40000)
= 40000 + 16000
= 56000

Now, we need to find Lylah's salary four years later. Since their salaries increased simultaneously, we can assume the percentage increase in their salaries is the same. We can express Lylah's new salary as:

New salary = Original salary + (40% of Original salary)
= 30769.23 + (0.4 * 30769.23)
= 30769.23 + 12307.69
= 43076.92

Now, we can find the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later by adding their new salaries:

Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary
= 56000 + 43076.92
= 99076.92

The final answer is: $99077"
"To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we need to first calculate how many sheets he uses in a week and then multiply that by the number of weeks in a month.

Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad has 30 sheets. So, the total number of sheets he uses in a week is 2 pads * 30 sheets/pad = 60 sheets.

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we can multiply the number of sheets Miguel uses in a week by 4 to find the total number of sheets he uses in a month: 60 sheets/week * 4 weeks/month = 240 sheets/month.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the total number of fruits, we first need to determine the number of fruits each person brought. 

Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges. 

Kael brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette, so Kael brought 2 * 5 = 10 apples. 
Kael brought half the number of oranges as Morisette, so Kael brought 8 / 2 = 4 oranges.

Now, we need to find the total number of fruits each person brought. 
Morisette brought 5 + 8 = 13 fruits. 
Kael brought 10 + 4 = 14 fruits.

To find the total number of fruits, we add the number of fruits each person brought. 
13 (Morisette's fruits) + 14 (Kael's fruits) = 27

"To find the total hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we need to calculate the hours she slept each day and add them up.

On Monday, Sadie slept 8 hours.

For the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday), she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours each day.

The rest of the week (Thursday to Sunday) she slept 1 hour more than those two days, so she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours each day.

Now, let's calculate the total hours she slept for each day:
- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday: 6 hours
- Wednesday: 6 hours
- Thursday: 7 hours
- Friday: 7 hours
- Saturday: 7 hours

"To find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour and the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour.

First, let's calculate the distance Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours. 

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour x 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, let's calculate the remaining time after 3 hours. 
Total time = 7 hours
Time already run = 3 hours
Remaining time = Total time - Time already run
Remaining time = 7 hours - 3 hours
Remaining time = 4 hours

Next, let's calculate the distance Rosie runs at 5 miles per hour for the remaining 4 hours.

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour x 4 hours
Distance = 20 miles

Now, let's add the distances run at both speeds to find the total distance.

Total distance = Distance at 10 miles/hour + Distance at 5 miles/hour
Total distance = 30 miles + 20 miles
Total distance = 50 miles

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many letters Jennie stamped and then subtract that from the total number of letters that were already stamped when she started.

We know that Jennie put stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps. Since there are 60 letters needing stamps, one-third of that is 60 / 3 = 20 letters.

We also know that after Jennie stamped 20 letters, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. This means that the 20 letters Jennie stamped were added to the pile of already-stamped letters.

So, to find out how many letters were in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began, we need to subtract the 20 letters Jennie added from the current total of 30 letters.

30 (current total) - 20 (letters Jennie added) = 10

Therefore, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Julia initially bought a package of spoons, but we don't know the quantity yet. Let's call this quantity 'x'.
2. Her husband bought a package of 5 new spoons and gave them to Julia.
3. Julia used 3 spoons while making the stew.
4. When she went to set the table, she had a total of 12 spoons.

Now, let's set up an equation to represent the situation:

Initial spoons (x) + spoons from her husband (5) - spoons used (3) = total spoons (12)

x + 5 - 3 = 12

Combine like terms:

x + 2 = 12

Subtract 2 from both sides:

x = 10

So, Julia bought a package of 10 spoons.

"To find the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we need to add the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages. 

First, let's find the number of fish sausages. Since Dylan bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, we can add 6 to the number of chicken sausages: 38 + 6 = 44.

Now, we can add the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages to find the total: 38 + 44 = 82.

The final answer is: 82"
"To find the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together, we first need to determine the number of friends Amy has. Since Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, and Lily has 50 friends, we can calculate Amy's friends by adding 20 to Lily's friends.

Amy's friends = Lily's friends + 20
Amy's friends = 50 + 20
Amy's friends = 70

Now, to find the total number of friends they have together, we add the number of friends Lily and Amy have.

Total friends = Lily's friends + Amy's friends
Total friends = 50 + 70
Total friends = 120

"To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to determine the cost of each item and then multiply it by the quantity.

First, let's find the cost of a watermelon. Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, and each pepper costs $15, the cost of a watermelon is 3 * $15 = $45.

Next, we find the cost of an orange. An orange costs 5 dollars less than a watermelon, so the cost of an orange is $45 - $5 = $40.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of each item:

- 4 watermelons: 4 * $45 = $180
- 20 peppers: 20 * $15 = $300
- 10 oranges: 10 * $40 = $400

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is the sum of the costs of all items: $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the total time spent by doctors and the total amount charged to patients, then subtract the cost from the revenue.

First, let's find the total time spent by doctors. The hospital sees 500 people a day, and each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes. 

Total time spent by doctors = 500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we need to convert the total time from minutes to hours.

Total time spent by doctors = 12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

The doctors charge $150 an hour, so the total cost for the doctors is:

Total cost for doctors = 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000

Now, let's find the total amount charged to patients. The hospital charges $200 an hour, and the total time spent is 12,000 minutes or 200 hours.

Total amount charged to patients = 200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000

The profit is the difference between the total amount charged to patients and the total cost for doctors.

Profit = Total amount charged to patients - Total cost for doctors
Profit = $40,000 - $30,000
Profit = $10,000

"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we first need to determine how many miles he walked on Tuesday. 

Since Walt walked 6 times as many miles on Tuesday as he did on Monday, and he walked 4 miles on Monday, we can calculate the miles walked on Tuesday by multiplying the miles walked on Monday by 6. 

Miles walked on Tuesday = 4 * 6 = 24 miles.

Now, we know that the total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. We already know the miles walked on Monday (4 miles) and Tuesday (24 miles). To find the miles walked on Wednesday, we subtract the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage.

Miles walked on Wednesday = Total mileage - (Miles walked on Monday + Miles walked on Tuesday)

"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine the total number of semi-automatic cars. We know that there are 20 cars in total, with 12 being automatic and 4 being manual. 

Total number of automatic and manual cars = 12 + 4 = 16

Now, we can find the number of semi-automatic cars by subtracting the total number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars.

Number of semi-automatic cars = Total number of cars - Total number of automatic and manual cars
= 20 - 16
= 4

Now, we can find the percentage of semi-automatic cars by dividing the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100

"Let's break down the information given. 

Let's denote the number of baby bees as B, the number of worker bees as W, and the number of queens as Q. 

We know that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so W = 2B. 

We also know that there are twice as many babies as queens, so B = 2Q.

We can express the total number of bees in the hive as the sum of the number of worker bees, baby bees, and queens: 700 = W + B + Q.

Substituting the expressions for W and B in terms of Q, we get 700 = 2B + B + Q. 

Since B = 2Q, we can substitute this into the equation to get 700 = 2(2Q) + 2Q. 

Simplifying the equation, we get 700 = 4Q + 2Q, which is 700 = 6Q.

To find the number of queens, we divide both sides of the equation by 6: Q = 700 / 6.

Q = 116.67. However, since the number of queens must be a whole number, we can round down to 116 queens.

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees: B = 2Q = 2 * 116 = 232.

Finally, we can find the number of worker bees: W = 2B = 2 * 232 = 464.

Since John has 10 hectares of a pineapple field and there are 100 pineapples per hectare, we multiply the number of hectares by the number of pineapples per hectare:

10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples

Next, we need to determine how many times John can harvest his pineapples within a year. Since he can harvest every 3 months, there are 4 harvests in a year (12 months / 3 months per harvest = 4 harvests).

Now, we multiply the total number of pineapples by the number of harvests:

1000 pineapples * 4 harvests = 4000 pineapples

Therefore, John can harvest 4000 pineapples within a year.

The final answer is: 4000"
"To find the total number of blocks Johnny picks up, we need to calculate the number of pieces in each set and add them together.

The first set has 500 pieces.
The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first set, so it has 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces.
The third set has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first set, so it has 500 / 4 = 125 pieces.

Now, let's add the number of pieces in each set together: 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125.

The final answer is: 2125"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 that many bees return, which is 30 / 2 = 15 bees.
   So, the total number of bees that have left but not returned is 30 - 15 = 15 bees.
3. In the next 6 hours, two times as many bees as the initial 30 leave the hive, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.
   So, the total number of bees that have left but not returned is now 15 + 60 = 75 bees.
4. In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive, which is 75 bees.

Therefore, Debra saw 75 bees return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day.

75"
"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to first calculate the total cost of the tickets. 

The cost of 1 adult ticket is $12 and the cost of 1 child ticket is $10. 

Total cost = cost of adult ticket + cost of child ticket
Total cost = $12 + $10
Total cost = $22

Since Brittany's mom received $8 in change, the amount she gave the cashier is the total cost plus the change.

Amount given to the cashier = Total cost + Change
Amount given to the cashier = $22 + $8
Amount given to the cashier = $30

The final answer is: $30"
"Let's break down the information given. We know that Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends. 

Let's represent the number of friends Dorothy has as 'x'. Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, we can write an equation: 3x = 12.

To find the value of 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 3: x = 12 / 3, which simplifies to x = 4. 

This means Dorothy has 4 friends on Facebook. 

Now, we know that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. Since Dorothy has 4 friends, we can multiply 4 by 4 to find the number of friends James has: 4 * 4 = 16.

James has 16 friends on Facebook.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out who will win the race, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school.

First, let's convert the distance from miles to feet for both Steve and Tim. Since 1 mile is equal to 5280 feet, we can convert their distances as follows:

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15,840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10,560 feet

Now, let's calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school:

Steve's time: distance / speed = 15,840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: distance / speed = 10,560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 36 minutes to get home and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve will win the race. To find out how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to subtract the winner's time from the loser's time:

Waiting time = Tim's time - Steve's time = 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how much Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total cost of inflating all the tires. 

First, let's calculate the cost of inflating the bicycle tires. Each bicycle has 2 tires, and there were 5 bicycles. So, the total number of bicycle tires is 5 * 2 = 10. The cost of inflating these tires is 10 * 25 cents = $2.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of inflating the tricycle tires. Each tricycle has 3 tires, and there were 3 tricycles. So, the total number of tricycle tires is 3 * 3 = 9. The cost of inflating these tires is 9 * 25 cents = $2.25.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of inflating the unicycle tire. A unicycle has 1 tire, and there was 1 unicycle. So, the total number of unicycle tires is 1 * 1 = 1. The cost of inflating this tire is 1 * 25 cents = $0.25.

Now, let's add up the total cost of inflating all the tires: $2.50 + $2.25 + $0.25 = $5.00.

The final answer is: $5.00"
"To find out how much change Carl receives, we first need to calculate the total cost of the cookies. 

There are 10 packs of cookies, and each pack has 6 cookies. So, the total number of cookies is 10 * 6 = 60 cookies.

Each cookie costs $0.10, so the total cost of the cookies is 60 * $0.10 = $6.

Carl pays with a $10 bill, so the change he receives is $10 - $6 = $4.

The final answer is: $4"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Dave ate 14 french fries initially.
2. The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 french fries.
   Now, the total amount eaten by Dave and the seagull is 14 + 7 = 21 french fries.
3. Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate a total of 3 * 3 = 9 french fries.
   Now, the total amount eaten is 21 + 9 = 30 french fries.
4. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries. Let's denote the initial number of fries as x. 
   After Dave and the seagull ate, there were x - 21 fries left. 
   After the pigeons ate, there were (x - 21) - 9 = x - 30 fries left.
   The raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries, which is (2/3)(x - 30).
   The remaining amount after the raccoon ate is (x - 30) - (2/3)(x - 30).
   We can simplify this expression: (x - 30) - (2/3)(x - 30) = (1/3)(x - 30).
5. After the raccoon ate, ants carried off a final french fry, leaving 5 behind. 
   This means that (1/3)(x - 30) - 1 = 5.
   We can solve for x: (1/3)(x - 30) = 6.
   Multiply both sides by 3: x - 30 = 18.
   Add 30 to both sides: x = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in a semester, we need to calculate the total hours he spends in a week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a semester.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes per day, each lasting 1 hour. So, the total hours he spends on these days in a week is 3 * 3 * 1 = 9 hours.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes per day, each lasting 2 hours. So, the total hours he spends on these days in a week is 2 * 2 * 2 = 8 hours.

The total hours Kimo spends in a week is 9 + 8 = 17 hours.

Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, the total hours Kimo spends attending classes in a semester is 17 * 16 = 272 hours.

The final answer is: 272"
"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the total length of each type of baked good and then add them together.

First, let's convert the length of the baguettes from feet to inches, since the lengths of the rolls and croissants are given in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so each baguette is 2 * 12 = 24 inches long.

Now, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good:

- Rolls: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches
- Croissants: 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches
- Baguettes: 60 baguettes * 24 inches/baguette = 1440 inches

Now, let's add the lengths together: 1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 inches

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12: 3360 / 12 = 280 feet

"To determine the total number of bananas needed for 2 months, we need to calculate the monthly consumption of all the apes and then multiply it by 2.

The monkeys need 200 bananas per month, the gorillas need 400 bananas per month, and the baboons need 100 bananas per month. 

Total monthly consumption = 200 (monkeys) + 400 (gorillas) + 100 (baboons) = 700 bananas per month.

Since the zookeeper needs to order bananas for 2 months, we multiply the total monthly consumption by 2.

Total bananas needed for 2 months = 700 bananas/month * 2 months = 1400 bananas.

The final answer is: 1400"
"To find out who the winner is, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Since he's running back and forth, the total distance he covers is 2 times the length of the field for each run. So, the total distance Blake ran is 15 * 2 * 100 = 3000 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 2 * 100 = 200 yards. Then, she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 2 * 40 = 80 yards. She does this 34 times, so the total distance she covers is 34 * 80 = 2720 yards. 

To find the total distance Kelly ran, we add the distance she ran back and forth and the distance she ran to the 40-yard line and back. So, the total distance Kelly ran is 200 + 2720 = 2920 yards.

Since 3000 is greater than 2920, Blake is the winner.

To find out how much farther the winner ran than the loser, we subtract the loser's distance from the winner's distance. So, 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

The final answer is: 80"

Initially, Finn saw 11 tadpoles. 
6 tadpoles came out from under the lily pad, so now he sees 11 + 6 = 17 tadpoles.
Then, 2 tadpoles hid under the rock, so we need to subtract 2 from 17. 
17 - 2 = 15

"To find the depth of the water on Wednesday, we need to first find the depth of the water on Tuesday. 

The depth of the water on Monday is 17 feet. On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water, so the depth of the water on Tuesday is 17 + 7 = 24 feet.

On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. To find two thirds of 24, we multiply 24 by 2/3.

24 * (2/3) = 16

So, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet.

"To find the total number of fish caught by Anakin, we need to add the number of starfish, sea horses, and clownfish he caught. 

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. 

Total fish caught by Anakin = 10 + 6 + 3 = 19

Now, let's find the number of fish caught by Locsin. Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so he caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish. Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so he caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses. Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so he caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Total fish caught by Locsin = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

Now, let's find the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin. 

Total fish caught = Total fish caught by Anakin + Total fish caught by Locsin
Total fish caught = 19 + 13
Total fish caught = 32

"To find the total worth of all the toys, we need to calculate the cost of each type of toy and then add them together.

The doll costs as much as 3 action figures. Since an action figure costs $5, the doll costs 3 * $5 = $15.

One red car costs $4. Since there are 5 red cars, the total cost of the red cars is 5 * $4 = $20.

The total cost of the action figures is 3 * $5 = $15.

Now, we add the cost of the doll, the red cars, and the action figures together: $15 (doll) + $20 (red cars) + $15 (action figures) = $50.

The total worth of all the toys is $50.

"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the difference in income between the two options.

If Jackie does her taxes herself, she'll lose $35/hour in missed income for 3 hours of freelance work. So, the total income lost is $35/hour * 3 hours = $105.

The cost of hiring the accountant is $90.

Now, let's calculate the difference in income between the two options. If Jackie hires the accountant, she'll have the $90 cost, but she won't lose any income from missed freelance work. If she does her taxes herself, she'll have the $105 income loss.

The difference in income is $105 (income loss) - $90 (accountant cost) = $15.

However, since the question asks how much more money she'll have if she hires the accountant, we need to consider the income she would have earned if she did her taxes herself. Since she would have lost $105, hiring the accountant will give her $105 more than doing it herself.

So, the correct answer is $105."
"To find out how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the computer accessories and subtract that from her budget.

The total cost of the computer accessories is:

Total cost = €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102 = €1323

Now, we subtract the total cost from Elvira's budget:
€1500 (budget) - €1323 (total cost) = €177

So, Elvira will have €177 left for her clothing. 

The final answer is: €177"
"To find out how many times Sandra has to babysit, we need to determine how many eggs she needs in total to make 15 Spanish flans and then divide that by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting job.

Since each Spanish flan requires 3 eggs, Sandra will need 15 * 3 = 45 eggs in total.

Since Sandra gets 9 eggs every time she babysits, we can divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysit: 45 / 9 = 5.

So, Sandra has to babysit 5 times to get enough eggs to make 15 Spanish flans.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let's denote Brooke's current age as B and Seth's current age as S. We know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write an equation:

S = 2B

In 2 years, their ages will be B + 2 and S + 2. The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write another equation:

(B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28

Substituting S = 2B into the second equation, we get:

(B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28

Combine like terms:

3B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3B = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B = 8 into the equation S = 2B:

S = 2(8)
S = 16

The final answer is: 16"

"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of the hat, jacket, and pants separately and then add them together.

The hat costs $25.

The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so the jacket costs 3 * $25 = $75.

The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. To find the average, we add the costs of the hat and jacket and divide by 2. The average cost is ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50.

Now, we add the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants together to find the total cost of each uniform: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red.
2. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four.
3. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, and Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.

From point 3, we know Sally Four is 8 years old. 

From point 2, we can calculate Granny Red's age: 
Granny Red's age = 2 * Sally Four's age
Granny Red's age = 2 * 8
Granny Red's age = 16

From point 1, we can calculate Sally Two's age:
Sally Two's age = Granny Red's age + 3
Sally Two's age = 16 + 3
Sally Two's age = 19

Now, we know the ages of Sally Four, Sally Two, and Granny Red. We still need to find the age of the fourth bird, but there's no information about the fourth bird's age. However, the question asks for the total age of the four birds. Since we have three of the four birds' ages, we can calculate the total age of the three birds we know and assume the fourth bird's age is unknown.

Total age of the three birds = Sally Four's age + Sally Two's age + Granny Red's age
Total age of the three birds = 8 + 19 + 16
Total age of the three birds = 43

Since we don't have information about the fourth bird's age, we can't calculate the total age of all four birds. However, the question might be asking for the total age of the three birds we know, or it might be missing information about the fourth bird's age. 

If we assume the question is asking for the total age of the three birds we know, the answer is 43."
"To find out how much Jessica pays in a year, we first need to calculate the increased minimum payments for each debt. 

The minimum payment for the student loans is $300, so 50% more than that would be $300 + ($300 * 0.5) = $300 + $150 = $450.

The minimum payment for the credit card is $200, so 50% more than that would be $200 + ($200 * 0.5) = $200 + $100 = $300.

The minimum payment for the mortgage is $500, so 50% more than that would be $500 + ($500 * 0.5) = $500 + $250 = $750.

Now, we need to add up the increased minimum payments for each debt to find the total monthly payment. 

$450 (student loans) + $300 (credit card) + $750 (mortgage) = $1500.

To find the total amount paid in a year, we multiply the monthly payment by 12.

$1500 * 12 = $18,000.

"To find the total time it takes Billy to peel and cut all the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel one potato and multiply it by the total number of potatoes, then add the time it takes to cut one potato and multiply it by the total number of potatoes.

Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds = 5/60 minutes (converting seconds to minutes)

Total time to peel all potatoes: 1.5 minutes * 60 potatoes = 90 minutes
Total time to cut all potatoes: (5/60) minutes * 60 potatoes = 5 minutes

Now, we add the time it takes to peel and cut all the potatoes: 90 minutes + 5 minutes = 95 minutes

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much they made in total from selling lemonade and then subtract the cost of sugar to find the cost of lemons.

Let's start by finding the total revenue from selling lemonade. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. So, the revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10.

Since they made a profit of $25, and we know that profit is revenue minus cost, we can set up an equation to find the total revenue. Let's denote the number of gallons as 'g'. The total revenue is $10g. The total cost is $3g (for lemons) + $2g (for sugar). The profit is $25, so we can write the equation as:

$10g - ($3g + $2g) = $25

Combine like terms:

$10g - $5g = $25

Simplify:

$5g = $25

Divide both sides by 5:

g = 5

Now that we know they made 5 gallons, we can find the total revenue: $10 * 5 = $50.

The total cost is the cost of lemons plus the cost of sugar: $3g + $2g = $5g. Since g = 5, the total cost is $5 * 5 = $25.

The cost of lemons is the total cost minus the cost of sugar: $25 - $2 * 5 = $25 - $10 = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the number of Chinese participants, we first need to subtract the number of Japanese participants from the total number of participants. 

Total participants = 240
Japanese participants = 80
Chinese participants = Total participants - Japanese participants
Chinese participants = 240 - 80
Chinese participants = 160

Since we know that the number of boys on the Chinese team was 60, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants.

Number of girls = Chinese participants - Number of boys
Number of girls = 160 - 60
Number of girls = 100

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how much money Zaid has left after all his expenses and donations, we need to follow the order of operations.

First, let's calculate the amount Zaid spends on rent: 1/4 of his salary is 6000 * 1/4 = 1500 dollars.

Next, let's calculate the amount he spends on car fuel: 1/3 of his salary is 6000 * 1/3 = 2000 dollars.

Now, let's subtract the rent and car fuel expenses from his total salary: 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 dollars.

Since he donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity, we need to find half of 2500, which is 2500 * 1/2 = 1250 dollars.

Now, let's subtract the donation from the remaining amount: 2500 - 1250 = 1250 dollars.

Zaid gives his daughter 200 dollars and his wife 700 dollars, so we need to subtract these amounts from the remaining amount: 1250 - 200 - 700 = 350 dollars.

Therefore, Zaid will have 350 dollars left after all his expenses and donations.

The final answer is: $350"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Bo has 40 crabs.
- Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.
- Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

To find the total number of crabs the three have together, we add the number of crabs each one has: 40 (Bo) + 36 (Monic) + 46 (Rani) = 122.

The final answer is: 122"
"To find out how much Lloyd earned in the first two weeks, we need to calculate his earnings for each week and then add them together.

For the first week, Lloyd tutored 5 hours at $10 per hour, so his earnings for the first week are:
5 hours * $10/hour = $50

For the second week, Lloyd tutored 8 hours at $10 per hour, so his earnings for the second week are:
8 hours * $10/hour = $80

Now, let's add his earnings for both weeks:
$50 (first week) + $80 (second week) = $130

The final answer is: $130"
"To find the number of votes the loser got, we first need to find the total number of votes the winner got. Since the winner got 3/4 of the votes, we can calculate this by multiplying 3/4 by the total number of students who voted, which is 80.

3/4 * 80 = 60

This means the winner got 60 votes. To find the number of votes the loser got, we subtract the number of votes the winner got from the total number of students who voted.

80 - 60 = 20

The loser got 20 votes.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of white carnations and then calculate the number of red roses.

Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. Since Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations, we can write an equation:

200 = 5x

To find the value of 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

x = 200 / 5
x = 40

So, Sandra ordered 40 white carnations.

Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, we can calculate the number of red roses as:

Number of red roses = 4 * x
= 4 * 40
= 160

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

The final answer is: 160"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem.

Let's denote Mark's current age as M and Jean's current age as J. We know that Jean is two years older than Mark, so we can write an equation:

J = M + 2

We are also given that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. Two years ago, Mark's age would be M - 2, and Jan's age would be 30 - 2 = 28. Half of Jan's age two years ago would be 28 / 2 = 14. We can write an equation based on this information:

M - 2 = 14 + 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

M - 2 = 19

Adding 2 to both sides of the equation, we get:

M = 21

Now that we know Mark's age, we can find Jean's age using the first equation:

J = M + 2
J = 21 + 2
J = 23

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total time for each team, we need to calculate the time for each runner and add them up.

The well-rounded team's total time is 4 x 55 seconds = 220 seconds.

The less well-rounded team's first runner runs 60 seconds. The second runner is 3 seconds faster, so they run 60 - 3 = 57 seconds. The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so they run 57 - 3 = 54 seconds. The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so they run 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

The less well-rounded team's total time is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 162 seconds.

The difference in time between the two teams is 220 - 162 = 58 seconds.

The faster team will win by 58 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, and then find the difference between these two probabilities.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die is the probability of rolling a 4, 5, or 6. There are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, 6) out of 6 possible outcomes, so the probability is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5 or 50%.

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5, since there are 3 even numbers (2, 4, 6) out of 6 possible outcomes. Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 = 0.25 or 25%.

Now, we need to find the difference between the two probabilities. The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 50% and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 25%. The difference is 50% - 25% = 25%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To find out how many apples Jenna picked, we need to determine half of the number of apples her mom picked. Since her mom picked 20 apples, we can calculate Jenna's share by dividing 20 by 2.

20 / 2 = 10

Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, and her mom picked 20, Jenna picked 10 apples. To find the total number of apples they both picked, we need to add Jenna's share to her mom's share.

20 (mom's apples) + 10 (Jenna's apples) = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of small rodents (rats and hamsters) and the total number of straw pieces given to them. 

Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as 'r'. Since there are 3 cages of rats, the total number of rats is 3r. 

The total number of hamsters is 10. 

The total number of straw pieces given to rats is 3r * 6 = 18r. 
The total number of straw pieces given to hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50. 

The total number of straw pieces given to small rodents is 160. So, we can set up the equation: 18r + 50 = 160.

Now, let's solve for 'r'. Subtract 50 from both sides of the equation: 18r = 110. 

Divide both sides by 18: r = 110 / 18. 

r = 6.11 (round down to the nearest whole number is not possible in this case as the number of rats must be a whole number, so we will round to the nearest whole number that makes sense in the context of the problem, which is 6)

However, we need to check if this value of 'r' satisfies the given conditions. 

If there are 6 rats in each cage, the total number of rats is 3 * 6 = 18. The total number of straw pieces given to rats is 18 * 6 = 108. The total number of straw pieces given to hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50. The total number of straw pieces given to small rodents is 108 + 50 = 158, which is less than 160. 

However, if we consider 7 rats in each cage, the total number of rats is 3 * 7 = 21. The total number of straw pieces given to rats is 21 * 6 = 126. The total number of straw pieces given to hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50. The total number of straw pieces given to small rodents is 126 + 50 = 176, which is more than 160.

Since 6 rats in each cage results in less straw than needed and 7 rats in each cage results in more straw than needed, the number of rats in each cage must be between 6 and 7. 

Let's try 6.5 rats in each cage. The total number of rats is 3 * 6.5 = 19.5. The total number of straw pieces given to rats is 19.5 * 6 = 117. The total number of straw pieces given to hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50. The total number of straw pieces given to small rodents is 117 + 50 = 167, which is still more than 160.

However, if we try 6.11 rats in each cage, the total number of rats is 3 * 6.11 = 18.33. The total number of straw pieces given to rats is 18.33 * 6 = 110. The total number of straw pieces given to hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50. The total number of straw pieces given to small rodents is 110 + 50 = 160, which is equal to the given total.

Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is 6.11, which we round to the nearest whole number that makes sense in the context of the problem, which is 6."
"To calculate the total amount Mandy should pay, we need to calculate the interest for 3 months and add it to the initial amount.

The formula for simple interest is: Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

In this case, the principal is $100, the rate is 2% or 0.02, and the time is 3 months.

Interest = $100 * 0.02 * 3
Interest = $6

Now, we add the interest to the principal to get the total amount Mandy should pay:
Total Amount = Principal + Interest
Total Amount = $100 + $6
Total Amount = $106

"To find the number of bags the trader sold, we need to first calculate the total cost and total revenue. 

Let's denote the number of bags as 'x'. 

The total cost of buying the bags is $20x (since each bag costs $20).
The total cost of transporting the bags is $2x (since each bag costs $2 to transport).
The total cost is the sum of the buying cost and the transportation cost: $20x + $2x = $22x.

The total revenue from selling the bags is $30x (since each bag is sold at $30).

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost: $30x - $22x = $8x.

We are given that the profit is $400, so we can set up the equation: $8x = $400.

To find the value of x, we divide both sides by 8: x = $400 / $8.

x = 50.

"To find out how much each friend paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets, food, and rides, and then divide it by 3.

First, let's find the cost of the food. They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. Since they spent $20.25 on tickets, the cost of food is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.

The cost of the rides is 2 rides * $33 per ride = $66.

Now, let's add up the total cost: $20.25 (tickets) + $15.75 (food) + $66 (rides) = $102.

Since they split the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3: $102 / 3 = $34.

"To find out how many peaches John collects, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he collects peaches and then multiply it by the number of peaches he collects per minute.

Since John collects peaches for 3 hours, we need to convert the hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Now, we know John collects 2 peaches per minute. To find the total number of peaches, we multiply the total minutes by the peaches collected per minute:

180 minutes * 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches

So, John collects 360 peaches.

The final answer is: 360"
"To find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ducks needs per day, we first need to calculate the total pounds of insects they need per week. 

Since there are ten ducks and each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week, we multiply the number of ducks by the pounds of insects each duck needs per week:

10 ducks * 3.5 pounds/duck/week = 35 pounds/week

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of insects they need per day. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total pounds of insects needed per week by 7:

35 pounds/week / 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day

So, the flock of ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day to survive.

"To find the total number of trees Tom has left, we need to calculate the net change in the number of trees over 10 years.

Initially, Tom has 50 trees.

Each year, he plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees. So, the net change in trees per year is 10 - 2 = 8.

Over 10 years, the net change is 8 * 10 = 80 trees.

So, the total number of trees Tom has after 10 years is 50 + 80 = 130.

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find the number of trees that die, we multiply 130 by 0.3: 130 * 0.3 = 39.

The number of trees left is 130 - 39 = 91.

The final answer is: 91"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos on Sue's front yard.

On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. They painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back out on Sue's front yard. So, now there are 6 white flamingos and 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos.

On Sunday morning, the neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection. Now, there are 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos.

The total number of flamingos on Sue's front yard is 30 pink + 6 white = 36 flamingos.

To find out how many more pink plastic flamingos were out than white plastic flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

"To find out how much change Violetta will get, we need to first determine how many crayons she can buy with $20. Since one crayon costs $2, we can divide the total amount she has by the cost of one crayon.

$20 ÷ $2 = 10 crayons

Since Violetta needs 5 different colors, we can assume she will buy 2 crayons of each color (although the problem doesn't specify this, it's a reasonable assumption). 

The total number of crayons she will buy is 5 colors * 2 crayons per color = 10 crayons

Since she can buy 10 crayons with $20 and she actually buys 10 crayons, the total cost will be 10 crayons * $2 per crayon = $20

The change she will get is $0, as the total cost of the crayons is equal to the amount she has."

Cost of a pen = $1.20 + $0.30
Cost of a pen = $1.50

Now, we need to find the cost of 8 pens. 

Cost of 8 pens = Cost of a pen * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $1.50 * 8

Total pounds of carrots used = 40 * 2
Total pounds of carrots used = 80 pounds

Now, we subtract the total pounds of carrots used from the total pounds of carrots available to find out how many pounds will not be used.

Pounds of carrots not used = Total pounds of carrots - Total pounds of carrots used
Pounds of carrots not used = 200 - 80
Pounds of carrots not used = 120

"Let's break down the information given. Mark edits 1000 sentences each week, and Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence. Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, he also edits 1000 sentences for Publisher B.

We know that Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays 2 * 5 cents = 10 cents per sentence.

Mark's total earnings from Publisher A are 1000 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 5000 cents.

Mark's total earnings from Publisher B are 1000 sentences * 10 cents/sentence = 10000 cents.

"To calculate John's total earnings for the year, we need to consider both the one-time monetary reward and the 5% raise in salary.

First, let's calculate the total amount John earns from his weekly salary for the year. Since he makes $2000 a week and works every week of the year, we multiply his weekly salary by the number of weeks in a year (52).

Weekly salary: $2000
Number of weeks in a year: 52
Total salary for the year: $2000 * 52 = $104,000

Now, let's calculate the 5% raise in salary. A 5% raise means John's new salary will be 105% of his original salary (100% + 5% increase).

Original salary: $2000
New salary: $2000 * 1.05 = $2100

Since John got the award on the first day of the year, he will earn the new salary for all 52 weeks of the year. We can calculate his total earnings for the year using the new salary.

Total salary for the year with the raise: $2100 * 52 = $109,200

Now, let's add the one-time monetary reward of $5000 to his total salary for the year.

"To find out how many pens Janet has now, we need to calculate the total number of pens she initially had and then add the number of pens she bought.

Janet initially had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, so the total number of pens she had initially is 22 + 10 = 32.

She bought 6 bags of blue pens, with 9 pens in each bag, so the total number of blue pens she bought is 6 * 9 = 54.

She also bought 2 bags of red pens, with 6 pens in each bag, so the total number of red pens she bought is 2 * 6 = 12.

Now, let's add the number of pens she bought to the number of pens she initially had: 32 (initial pens) + 54 (blue pens) + 12 (red pens) = 98.

However, we also need to consider the green and yellow pens she initially had. We already added the pens she bought, but we didn't add the initial green and yellow pens to the total number of pens she bought. Since she bought no green or yellow pens, we don't need to add anything to the total.

"To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we first need to find the total score she needs for the semester. Since there are six tests and she wants an average of 93, we multiply the desired average by the number of tests: 93 * 6 = 558.

Since Brinley can remove the lowest score, we need to find the lowest score among the five she has so far. The scores are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. The lowest score is 71.

Now, we add up the remaining four scores: 89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367. 

To find the total score she needs, we add the lowest score to the sum of the remaining scores: 367 + 71 = 438.

Now, we subtract the total score she has so far from the total score she needs: 558 - 438 = 120.

So, Brinley needs a score of 120 on the sixth test to get an average of 93.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since each plate costs $6000, half a dozen plates will cost 6 * $6000 = $36,000.

We are also given that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, the total cost of twenty dozen cups is $36,000 - $1200 = $34,800.

Since there are 24 cups in a dozen, twenty dozen cups will be 20 * 24 = 480 cups.

To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of twenty dozen cups by the number of cups: $34,800 / 480 = $72.50.

The final answer is: $72.50"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy and the total amount of money she has earned so far.

The total cost of the items is the cost of the jacket plus the cost of 2 pairs of shoes: 
$30 (jacket) + 2 * $20 (shoes) = $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved before she started babysitting. She earns $5 each time she babysits the neighbor's kids, so the total amount she has earned from babysitting is:
$5 * number of times she babysits.

Let's denote the number of times she babysits as 'x'. Then, the total amount she has earned from babysitting is $5x.

She also earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. Let's denote the number of times she mows the lawn as 'y'. Then, the total amount she has earned from mowing the lawn is $4y.

The total amount of money she has is the sum of the money she already had, the money she earned from babysitting, and the money she earned from mowing the lawn:
$10 (initial savings) + $5x (babysitting) + $4y (mowing the lawn).

Since she wants to buy the jacket and shoes, the total amount of money she has must be greater than or equal to the total cost of the items:
$10 + $5x + $4y ≥ $70.

We want to find the minimum number of times she must mow the lawn, so we want to find the smallest value of 'y' that satisfies the inequality. To do this, we can first subtract $10 from both sides of the inequality:
$5x + $4y ≥ $60.

Since we want to find the minimum value of 'y', we can try to find the smallest value of 'x' that satisfies the inequality. We know that 'x' must be an integer (since it represents the number of times she babysits), so we can try different values of 'x' to find the smallest one that satisfies the inequality.

If x = 4, then $5x = $20, and $20 + $4y ≥ $60. Subtracting $20 from both sides gives $4y ≥ $40. Dividing both sides by $4 gives y ≥ 10.

So, the minimum number of times she must mow the lawn is 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's denote the number of red chickens as R and the number of white chickens as W. We know that W = R + 2.

We also know that the total number of eggs collected is 42. Since each red chicken produces 3 eggs and each white chicken produces 5 eggs, we can set up the following equation:

3R + 5W = 42

Substituting W = R + 2 into the equation, we get:

3R + 5(R + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3R + 5R + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8R + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8R = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

R = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the time Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park since he walks around the edge. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the dimensions of the park, l = 6 miles and w = 1.5 miles, we can plug these values into the formula:

P = 2(l + w)
P = 2(6 + 1.5)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles/hour, we can find the time he spends walking by dividing the perimeter by his speed:

Time = Perimeter / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of customers Sloane counted on the first day. Let's denote the number of customers on the first day as x.

On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so the number of customers on the second day is x + 50.

The total number of customers by the third day was 500, which is the sum of the customers on the first and second days. We can write the equation as:

x + (x + 50) = 500

Combine like terms:
2x + 50 = 500

Subtract 50 from both sides:
2x = 450

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 225

So, Sloane counted 225 customers on the first day. 

Now, let's find the number of customers she counted on the third day. We already know that the total number of customers by the third day was 500, and we found that the number of customers on the first day was 225. The number of customers on the second day is 225 + 50 = 275.

The number of customers on the third day is the sum of the customers on the second and third days, but since we are looking for the third day, we can simply subtract the first day from the total:
500 - 225 = 275

However, we know that the second day had 225 + 50 = 275 customers. Therefore, the third day had 500 - 275 = 225 customers."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as 'x' gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the initial amount of water in the big pool is 2x gallons.

Since both pools leak at 4 gallons/minute, the rate of water loss for both pools is the same. 

The difference in the amount of water between the big and small pool is 2x - x = x gallons. 

Since the rate of water loss is the same for both pools, the difference in the amount of water between the big and small pool remains constant over time. 

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as 'y' gallons. Then, the current amount of water in the big pool is 4y gallons.

The difference in the amount of water between the big and small pool is still x gallons. Since the rate of water loss is the same for both pools, the time it took for the big pool to have four times as much water as the small pool is the same as the time it took for the big pool to lose x gallons of water.

Since the rate of water loss is 4 gallons/minute, the time it took for the big pool to lose x gallons of water is x/4 minutes.

The time it took for the big pool to have four times as much water as the small pool is 4 minutes (as given in the problem). 

Since the time it took for the big pool to lose x gallons of water is x/4 minutes, we can set up the equation x/4 = 4.

Solving for x, we get x = 16.

Now that we know the initial amount of water in the small pool is 16 gallons, we can find the current amount of water in the small pool. Since the small pool leaks at 4 gallons/minute, the amount of water lost in 4 minutes is 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.

The current amount of water in the small pool is 16 - 16 = 0 gallons.

The final answer is: 0"
"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn, which is the cost of the shoes and the belt. 

Total cost = Cost of shoes + Cost of belt
Total cost = $320.00 + $32.00
Total cost = $352.00

Since Lori earns $8.00 per hour, we can divide the total cost by her hourly wage to find out how many hours she needs to work.

Hours to work = Total cost / Hourly wage
Hours to work = $352.00 / $8.00
Hours to work = 44 hours

The final answer is: 44"
"To find the remaining balance, we first need to calculate the total amount Janeth will pay in 12 months. 

Janeth pays $165 per month for 12 months, so the total amount she will pay is:
$165 * 12 = $1980

Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. The additional amount is 10% of $2000, which is:
$2000 * 0.10 = $200

So, the total amount Janeth will pay is the initial amount plus the additional amount:
$2000 + $200 = $2200

However, Janeth will only pay $1980, so she will still owe the difference:
$2200 - $1980 = $220

The final answer is: $220"
"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to determine the number of dahlias and add it to the number of roses. 

First, we know there are 4 roses in the vase. Then, we are told there are 7 more dahlias than roses. So, the number of dahlias is 4 (number of roses) + 7 (additional dahlias) = 11 dahlias.

Now, we add the number of roses and dahlias to find the total number of flowers: 4 (roses) + 11 (dahlias) = 15.

"To find the average age of the three in three years, we first need to find their current ages and then add 3 to each age. 

Given that Harriet is 21 years old, and she is half the age of Zack, Zack's age is 2 * 21 = 42 years old.

Since Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, Adrian's age is 3 * 21 = 63 years old.

Now, we have the current ages of the three: Harriet (21), Zack (42), and Adrian (63). 

In three years, their ages will be: Harriet (21 + 3 = 24), Zack (42 + 3 = 45), and Adrian (63 + 3 = 66).

To find the average age, we add their ages and divide by 3: (24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45.

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Yuri and Brianna. 

Naomi scored 68 points. 
Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. 10 more than that is 34 + 10 = 44. 
Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, we know the points scored by Naomi (68), Yuri (44), and Brianna (85). To find out Jojo's points, we subtract the points scored by the other three students from the total points. 
Total points = 251
Points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna = 68 + 44 + 85 = 197
Points scored by Jojo = Total points - Points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna
Points scored by Jojo = 251 - 197
Points scored by Jojo = 54

"To find out how much water is left in the tank after Celine used 90 liters, we subtract 90 from the initial 120 liters. 

120 - 90 = 30 liters

Since Celine collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left, we multiply the remaining 30 liters by 2.

30 * 2 = 60 liters

The collected rainwater is added to the remaining 30 liters, so we add 60 to 30.

30 + 60 = 90 liters

The final amount of water in the tank is 90 liters.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the total number of flowers Andy planted, we need to calculate the number of petunias first. Since he planted 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, we subtract 40 from the number of geraniums.

Number of geraniums: 90
Number of petunias = Number of geraniums - 40
Number of petunias = 90 - 40
Number of petunias = 50

Now, we add the number of geraniums and petunias to find the total number of flowers.

Total flowers = Number of geraniums + Number of petunias
Total flowers = 90 + 50
Total flowers = 140

The company spends a third of $15000 on advertising for the second year. To find a third of $15000, we divide $15000 by 3.

$15000 / 3 = $5000

Now, we add the amount spent in the first year to the amount spent in the second year to find the total amount spent on advertising for the two years.

$15000 + $5000 = $20000

The total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is $20000."

"To find the total number of days Andrew will travel, we need to calculate the time it takes for each leg of the trip and add them together.

The time it takes to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus is 6 days.

The time it takes to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by car is half of 6 days, which is 6 / 2 = 3 days.

The time it takes to travel from Rochester to New Jersey by car is the same as the time it takes to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by car, which is 3 days.

The time it takes to travel from Rochester to New Jersey by bus is the same as the time it takes to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus, which is 6 days.

So, the total number of days Andrew will travel is 6 (bus to Rochester) + 3 (car to Rochester) + 3 (car to New Jersey) + 6 (bus to New Jersey) = 18 days.

"To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we first need to find the total number of cards James has after the changes. 

Initially, James has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards. 

After losing 8 water type cards, he has 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards.

After buying 14 grass type cards, he has 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards.

The total number of cards James has now is 30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96 cards.

The probability of picking a water type card is the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards, which is 32/96.

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type is 33."
"To find out how much Chad still owes, we need to calculate the total cost of his meal and then subtract the gift card amount.

The base burrito costs $6.50. 
He adds extra meat for $2.00, extra cheese for $1.00, avocado for $1.00, and 2 sauces for $0.25 each, which is 2 * $0.25 = $0.50. 
So, the total cost of the add-ons is $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $4.50.
The total cost of the meal before the upgrade is $6.50 + $4.50 = $11.00.
He upgrades his meal for an extra $3.00, so the new total is $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00.

"To find the total number of pieces Kalinda and her mom can place per minute, we need to determine how many pieces her mom can place per minute. Since her mom can place half as many pieces as Kalinda, and Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute, her mom can place 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute.

The total number of pieces they can place per minute is 4 (Kalinda) + 2 (her mom) = 6 pieces per minute.

To find the total time it will take to complete the 360-piece puzzle, we need to divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they can place per minute. 

360 pieces / 6 pieces per minute = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in 1 hour, we can convert the time from minutes to hours by dividing by 60.

60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Therefore, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

"To find out how many vines Steve needs, we first need to determine how many tomatoes he eats per week. Since Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, we multiply this by 7 to get the total tomatoes he eats per week.

6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, we can assume his girlfriend eats half as much as Steve. So, his girlfriend eats 6 / 2 = 3 tomatoes per day. 

3 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 21 tomatoes/week

The total number of tomatoes they both eat per week is 42 (Steve) + 21 (girlfriend) = 63 tomatoes/week.

Each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week. To find out how many vines Steve needs, we divide the total number of tomatoes they eat per week by the number of tomatoes per vine.

"To find out how many hours Mike spends writing a week, we need to calculate the total number of letters he writes and then multiply it by the time it takes him to write one page.

First, let's find out how many letters Mike writes in a week. He has 3 pen pals left, and each of them sends 2 letters a week. So, the total number of letters he receives is 3 * 2 = 6 letters.

Since he responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters a week. 

Each letter is 5 pages long, so the total number of pages he writes in a week is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

It takes Mike 6 minutes to write one page, so the total time he spends writing in a week is 30 * 6 = 180 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60. So, 180 minutes is equal to 180 / 60 = 3 hours.

Therefore, Mike spends 3 hours writing a week.

"To find the total amount Jean paid, we need to calculate the total hours worked, the total cost before the discount, and then apply the discount.

First, let's find the total hours worked. The makeup artist works 6 hours a day, 4 times a week, for 5 weeks. 

Total hours worked per week = 6 hours/day * 4 days/week = 24 hours/week
Total hours worked in 5 weeks = 24 hours/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours

The makeup artist charges $250 per hour. 

Total cost before discount = Total hours worked * Hourly rate
Total cost before discount = 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000

After the movie is done, the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount.

Discount amount = 10% of $30,000
Discount amount = 0.1 * $30,000 = $3,000

Total amount paid by Jean = Total cost before discount - Discount amount
Total amount paid by Jean = $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000

The final answer is: $27,000"
"To find out how much each person paid, we need to first calculate the total cost of the party supplies. 

Total cost = cost of cake + cost of presents + cost of decorations + cost of invitations + cost of goodie bags
Total cost = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22
Total cost = $96

Since Isabelle split the cost evenly with her two parents, there are 3 people in total. 

To find out how much each person paid, we divide the total cost by 3.

$96 / 3 = $32

Each person paid $32."
"To find out how much the chef spent, we need to calculate the total weight of the onions and then multiply it by the cost per pound.

The chef bought 4 bags of onions, and each bag weighs 50 pounds. So, the total weight of the onions is:
4 bags * 50 pounds/bag = 200 pounds

Since a pound of onions costs $1.50, the total cost is:
200 pounds * $1.50/pound = $300

The chef spent $300."
"To find out how many calories Sue consumed, we first need to determine how many cookies she ate. 

On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 5 cookies, so Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday.

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 13 cookies, so Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.

In total, Sue ate 20 + 26 = 46 cookies. 

Her sister ate 5 + 13 = 18 cookies.

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, Sue consumed 46 * 200 = 9200 calories and her sister consumed 18 * 200 = 3600 calories.

The difference in calories consumed is 9200 - 3600 = 5600. 

The final answer is: 5600"
"To find the number of boys in the third class, we first need to determine the total number of girls in the school. 

Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, and there are 3 classes with 20 students each, the total number of students in the school is 3 * 20 = 60.

The total number of girls in the school is 50% of 60, which is 0.5 * 60 = 30.

We already know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27.

The number of girls in the third class can be found by subtracting the total number of girls in the first two classes from the total number of girls in the school: 30 - 27 = 3.

Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, the total number of boys in the school is also 30. 

The number of boys in the first two classes is 60 - 27 = 33. 

The number of boys in the third class can be found by subtracting the number of boys in the first two classes from the total number of boys in the school: 30 - 33 is incorrect, we need to find the number of boys in the third class. 

Let's find the number of boys in the third class by first finding the number of boys in the first two classes. We know that the first class has 20 - 15 = 5 boys and the second class has 20 - 12 = 8 boys. 

The number of boys in the first two classes is 5 + 8 = 13.

The number of boys in the third class can be found by subtracting the number of boys in the first two classes from the total number of boys in the school: 30 - 13 = 17.

So, the current number of apps on Travis's tablet is 70.

The final answer is: 70"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars. 

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's represent the number of cougars killed today as 'x'. Then, the number of wolves killed today is 3x.

We also know that Rick killed three fewer cougars today than the previous night. So, the number of cougars killed today is 15 - 3 = 12.

Since we know the number of cougars killed today is 12, we can set up the equation 3x = 12 to find the number of wolves killed today. Solving for x, we get x = 4. 

However, we already know that the number of cougars killed today is 12, so we don't need to use x. 

Now, we can find the total number of animals killed by adding the number of animals killed last night and today. The total number of wolves killed is 10 + 3x = 10 + 3(12) = 10 + 36 = 46. The total number of cougars killed is 15 + 12 = 27.

The total number of animals killed is 46 + 27 = 73.

"To find out how many times Anne went down the water slide, we need to calculate 30% less than Mitchel's 30 times. 

30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. 
So, 30% less than 30 is 30 - 9 = 21. 

Now, we know that Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. Since Anne went 21 times, Robert went 4 * 21 = 84 times.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we first need to determine how many cows Mr. Sylas added to each stall. 

Initially, each stall had 20 cows. Mr. Sylas bought 40 cows and divided them equally among the 10 stalls. 

To find out how many cows he added to each stall, we divide the total number of new cows (40) by the number of stalls (10). 

40 / 10 = 4

So, Mr. Sylas added 4 cows to each stall. 

Now, we need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. We know that each stall has 20 original cows and 4 new cows. 

20 (original cows) + 4 (new cows) = 24 cows per stall

Since we want to know the total number of cows in 8 stalls, we multiply the number of cows per stall by 8.

24 * 8 = 192

The final answer is: 192"
"To find the total amount of money in Brady's piggy bank, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and bill, then add them together.

First, let's calculate the value of the pennies:

Next, let's calculate the value of the nickels:
40 nickels * $0.05 = $2.00

Now, let's calculate the value of the dimes:
20 dimes * $0.10 = $2.00

Finally, let's calculate the value of the dollar bills:
40 dollar bills * $1.00 = $40.00

Now, let's add all the values together:
$1.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $40.00 = $45.00

The total amount of money in Brady's piggy bank is $45.00

$45.00"
"To find the total weight of the redwood tree, we first need to calculate the total number of 10-foot sections. 

The redwood is 200 feet tall, so we divide 200 by 10 to get the total number of sections: 200 / 10 = 20 sections.

Each section weighs 400 pounds, so we multiply the number of sections by the weight per section: 20 * 400 = 8000 pounds.

Now, we need to find 30% of the total weight that the termites ate. To do this, we multiply the total weight by 0.3 (which is the decimal form of 30%): 8000 * 0.3 = 2400 pounds.

To find the remaining weight of the redwood, we subtract the weight eaten by the termites from the total weight: 8000 - 2400 = 5600 pounds.

"To find the total amount Nancy has to pay, we need to calculate the total cost of the overdue books and add the flat fee.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the overdue books: 
8 books * $0.50 per book = $4.00

Then, we add the flat fee of $2.00 for having at least one book that's over a week overdue.

Total cost = $4.00 (overdue books) + $2.00 (flat fee) = $6.00

The total amount Nancy has to pay is $6.00."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, and Andrea has 52 apples. So, Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.
2. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.
3. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.
4. To find the total number of fruits, we need to add the number of apples and bananas that both Andrea and Jamal have. 
   Total fruits = (Andrea's apples + Jamal's apples + Andrea's bananas + Jamal's bananas)
   Total fruits = (52 + 44 + 24 + 48)
   Total fruits = 168

"To determine the total amount of flour needed, we need to calculate the amount needed for each day and then add them together.

For today, Carla is making 36 cookies. Since 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many cups are needed for 36 cookies. 

First, let's find out how many dozens are in 36 cookies: 36 / 12 = 3. This means Carla needs 3 dozen cookies' worth of flour for today. Since 2 cups are needed for a dozen, Carla will need 3 * 2 = 6 cups of flour for today.

For tomorrow, Carla is making 30 cookies. Again, we need to find out how many dozens are in 30 cookies: 30 / 12 = 2.5. Since 2 cups are needed for a dozen, Carla will need 2.5 * 2 = 5 cups of flour for tomorrow.

Now, let's add the flour needed for both days: 6 cups (for today) + 5 cups (for tomorrow) = 11 cups.

"To find the total dollar amount of two-thirds of the pennies in the cup, we first need to calculate two-thirds of 9,300. 

Two-thirds of a number is calculated by multiplying the number by 2/3. 

So, we multiply 9,300 by 2 and then divide by 3.

9,300 * 2 = 18,600
18,600 / 3 = 6,200

Since each penny is worth $0.01, we multiply 6,200 by 0.01 to find the total dollar amount.

6,200 * 0.01 = $62

The final answer is: $62"
"To find the total number of marbles Maddison has now, we need to first calculate the total number of marbles she initially had in the 5 boxes. 

5 boxes * 50 marbles per box = 250 marbles

"To find the number of trees in each yard, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. Chris has 6 trees.
2. Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has. 
   So, Ferdinand has 6 / 2 = 3 trees.
3. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has.
   First, we find twice the number of trees Ferdinand has: 2 * 3 = 6.
   Then, we add 5 to this number: 6 + 5 = 11.
   So, Harry has 11 trees.

Now, we need to find the difference in the number of trees between Harry's yard and Ferdinand's yard.
The difference is 11 - 3 = 8.

"To find the total price of the house, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and the transfer fee, then add them to the selling price.

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, which is 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500.

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price, which is 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000.

The total price of the house is the sum of the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee: $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

To find out how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we subtract her budget from the total price: $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500.

The final answer is: $9,500"
"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to calculate the total amount he paid in fees and subtract that from the selling price, then subtract the remaining loan amount.

First, let's calculate the transfer fees: 3% of $400,000 is 0.03 x $400,000 = $12,000.

Next, let's calculate the brokerage fee: 5% of $400,000 is 0.05 x $400,000 = $20,000.

The total amount paid in fees is $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000.

Now, let's subtract the total fees from the selling price: $400,000 - $32,000 = $368,000.

"To find the total time, we first need to determine the time it takes to heat the oil to 400 degrees. 

It takes 20 minutes to heat the oil to 300 degrees. Since it takes 40% longer to heat it up to 400 degrees, we need to find 40% of 20 minutes and add it to 20 minutes.

40% of 20 minutes is 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes. 

So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat the oil to 400 degrees.

After warming the oil, it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil. Since it took 28 minutes to warm up the oil, it will take 28 - 5 = 23 minutes to cook.

The total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is 28 (heating the oil) + 23 (cooking) = 51 minutes.

The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.

The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, let's add the number of M&Ms in each bag together: 300 + 312 + 150 = 762.

The total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762."
"To find the total number of windows, we need to calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows in each house.

Each house has 3 bedrooms with 2 windows each, so the total number of windows in the bedrooms of one house is 3 * 2 = 6. Since there are 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms is 6 * 2 = 12.

Each house has 4 additional windows not connected to bedrooms. Since there are 2 houses, the total number of additional windows is 4 * 2 = 8.

The total number of windows in one house is 12 (from bedrooms) + 8 (additional) = 20. Since there are 2 houses, the total number of windows is 20 * 2 = 40.

"To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we first need to determine the total number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette. 

The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches, which is 900 * 0.1 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so it takes 90 * 2 = 180 stitches.

The total number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette is 90 + 180 = 270 stitches.

Since the whole sweater is a 1800-stitch project, the total number of stitches used for the body and the sleeves is 1800 - 270 = 1530 stitches.

The body takes 900 stitches, so the sleeves take 1530 - 900 = 630 stitches in total.

Since there are two sleeves, each sleeve takes 630 / 2 = 315 stitches.

"To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the lines for each scene and the song, and then add them together.

The solo song has 54 lines.

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. However, only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has 4/5 * 60 = 48 lines from the second scene.

To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

"To find the number of cards with the letter D, we need to calculate the number of cards that had the letters A, B, and C, and then subtract that from the total number of cards.

First, we find the number of cards with the letter A: 2/5 of 80 is (2/5) * 80 = 32 cards.

Next, we find the number of cards with the letter B. The remaining cards after A are 80 - 32 = 48. 1/2 of 48 is (1/2) * 48 = 24 cards.

Now, we find the number of cards with the letter C. The remaining cards after B are 48 - 24 = 24. 5/8 of 24 is (5/8) * 24 = 15 cards.

The total number of cards with the letters A, B, and C is 32 + 24 + 15 = 71.

To find the number of cards with the letter D, we subtract the total number of cards with A, B, and C from the total number of cards: 80 - 71 = 9.

"To find the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we first need to determine their current ages. Since the sum of their ages is 20, we can represent their ages as x and 20 - x.

In 10 years, Mico's age will be x + 10 and Marco's age will be (20 - x) + 10.

The sum of their ages in 10 years will be (x + 10) + ((20 - x) + 10). 

Simplifying the expression, we get (x + 10) + (20 - x + 10) = 20 + 20 = 40.

So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Ruby's current age as R and Sam's current age as S.

From the first statement, we know that Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, so we can write an equation:

R = 6S

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9 and Sam's age will be S + 9.

From the second statement, we know that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can write another equation:

R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Now, let's simplify the second equation:

R + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtract 9 from both sides:

R = 3S + 18

Now we have two equations:

R = 6S
R = 3S + 18

Since both equations are equal to R, we can set them equal to each other:

6S = 3S + 18

Subtract 3S from both sides:

3S = 18

Divide both sides by 3:

S = 6

So, Sam is 6 years old now.

The final answer is: 6"

"To find the total number of spots on the cobras, we need to multiply the number of cobras by the number of spots on each cobra. 

Number of cobras: 40
Number of spots per cobra: 70
Total spots on cobras: 40 * 70 = 2800

Since the cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, we can find the number of spots on a mamba by dividing the number of spots on a cobra by 2.

Number of spots per mamba: 70 / 2 = 35

Now, we can find the total number of spots on the mambas by multiplying the number of mambas by the number of spots on each mamba.

Number of mambas: 60
Number of spots per mamba: 35
Total spots on mambas: 60 * 35 = 2100

To find the total number of spots on all the snakes, we add the total spots on the cobras and the mambas.

Total spots on all snakes: 2800 + 2100 = 4900

Finally, to find half the number of spots they all have combined, we divide the total number of spots by 2.

Half the total spots: 4900 / 2 = 2450"
"To find out how many pizzas Maddy needs to buy, we first need to determine the total number of people she needs to serve. 

There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, so the total number of team members and coaches is 12 + 3 = 15. 

Each team member brings 2 guests, so the total number of guests is 12 * 2 = 24. 

The total number of people Maddy needs to serve is 15 (team members and coaches) + 24 (guests) = 39.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, the total number of pizzas Maddy needs to buy is 39 / 3 = 13.

Each pizza costs $15, so the total amount Maddy will spend is 13 * 15 = $195.

The final answer is: $195"
"To find the total number of sterling silver beads used per necklace, we first need to calculate the total length taken up by the topaz gemstones and then subtract that from the total length of the necklace. 

Each topaz gemstone is one inch long, and there are 8 of them, so the total length taken up by the gemstones is 8 inches. 

The remaining length for the sterling silver beads is 25 inches (total length of the necklace) - 8 inches (length taken up by the gemstones) = 17 inches.

Each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long, so the number of beads that can fit in 17 inches is 17 / (1/4) = 17 / 0.25 = 68.

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

Total stories in the first week = 20 + 40 + 60 = 120

In the second week, each of them doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week. 

Alani doubled her 20 stories, so she wrote 20 * 2 = 40 stories in the second week.
Braylen doubled his 40 stories, so he wrote 40 * 2 = 80 stories in the second week.
Margot doubled her 60 stories, so she wrote 60 * 2 = 120 stories in the second week.

Total stories in the second week = 40 + 80 + 120 = 240

To find the total number of stories written altogether, we need to add the total number of stories written in the first week and the second week.

Total stories altogether = 120 + 240 = 360

It also has two rows of 6 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 2 * 6 = 12. 

The total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows is 24 + 12 = 36. 

Since the flag has 76 stars in total, the number of stars in the 5-star rows is 76 - 36 = 40. 

Since each 5-star row has 5 stars, the number of rows of 5-star stars is 40 / 5 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the number of trucks needed, we need to calculate the total weight of the flagstones and divide it by the weight capacity of each truck.

First, let's find the total weight of the flagstones: 
80 flagstones * 75 pounds per flagstone = 6000 pounds

Now, let's divide the total weight by the weight capacity of each truck:
6000 pounds / 2000 pounds per truck = 3

So, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the time taken by the car in the slow lane, we first need to determine its speed. Since it's traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, its speed is 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed. Given that the distance is 480 miles and the speed of the car in the slow lane is 30 miles/hour, we can calculate the time taken as follows:

Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours

The final answer is: 16"
"Let's break down the information given. 

Ali has 22 medals. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals. 

Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals. 

It's given that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have. 

Let's represent the total number of medals given out as 'x'. Then, we can write the equation: 39 = x / 10. 

To find 'x', we multiply both sides of the equation by 10: x = 39 * 10.

x = 390

The final answer is: 390"
"To find out how many chocolate bars each child will get, we first need to determine the total number of chocolate bars available. 

There are 8 packets of chocolate bars, each containing 5 chocolate bars. So, the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

Since each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 * 6 = 24.

Now, we need to find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children. This is 40 - 24 = 16.

There are 8 children, and they will share the remaining 16 chocolate bars equally. To find out how many each child will get, we divide 16 by 8, which is 2.

So, each child will get 2 chocolate bars.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much Susan earns, we need to calculate the total time she works and then multiply it by her hourly wage.

First, let's find the total time she works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total time.

3 hours (working time) - 0.5 hours (pause time) = 2.5 hours

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to convert the total working time to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Now, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes:

150 minutes / 10 minutes/interval = 15 intervals

Since she earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by her earnings per interval:

15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

So, Susan earns $75 for the online task. 

The final answer is: $75"
"To find the total points of all three players after the extra points are distributed, we first need to calculate their points after the fourth round.

Initially, Mike has 21 points. 
Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

After the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. 
Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point. Now Mike has 21 + 1 = 22 points.
Jim has 18 points, so he doesn't get an extra point. Jim still has 18 points.
Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point. Now Tony has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

Now, let's calculate the total points of all three players after the extra points are distributed:
Mike has 22 points, Jim has 18 points, and Tony has 43 points.
Total points = 22 + 18 + 43 = 83

The final answer is: 83"
"To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we first need to determine how many oranges the sons washed. 

The oldest son is 8 years old, and he washes as many oranges as he is years old, so he washes 8 oranges. 

The youngest son is half as old as the oldest son, which means he is 8 / 2 = 4 years old. He also washes as many oranges as he is years old, so he washes 4 oranges.

In total, the sons wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

Since Will buys 15 oranges, and the sons wash 12, the number of oranges left unwashed is 15 - 12 = 3.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the total count of activities, we need to calculate the number of each activity done on both days and then add them up.

On the first day, Darren does:
- 100 pushups
- 50 squats
- 20 dumbbell presses

On the second day, he does:
- 20 more pushups than the first day, so 100 + 20 = 120 pushups
- 10 fewer squats than the first day, so 50 - 10 = 40 squats
- Doubles the number of dumbbell presses, so 20 * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses

Now, let's add up the total count of each activity:
- Pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

The total count of activities is the sum of these: 220 + 90 + 60 = 370. 

The final answer is: 370"
"To find out how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day and then divide the total amount of rice available by that amount.

First, let's calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day. Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 3 meals per day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner). Since 5 members of the household eat rice every lunch and dinner, we'll assume they also eat it for breakfast. So, the total number of people eating rice per day is 5.

Total rice consumed per person per day = 0.2 kg/meal * 3 meals = 0.6 kg/day
Total rice consumed by 5 people per day = 0.6 kg/day * 5 people = 3 kg/day

Now, let's calculate how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last:

Total rice available = 42 kg
Total rice consumed per day = 3 kg

Number of days a 42 kg bag of rice will last = Total rice available / Total rice consumed per day
= 42 kg / 3 kg/day
= 14 days

Since we want to find out how many weeks it will last, we'll divide the number of days by 7 (number of days in a week):

Number of weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last = 14 days / 7 days/week
= 2 weeks

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we first need to calculate the total number of crates he sold in the week. 

Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he sold bread for 5 days. 

He sold 20 crates over the weekend, which is 2 days. 
He sold 15 crates on Tuesday, 12 crates on Wednesday, and 18 crates on Thursday.

Total crates sold = 20 (weekend) + 15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday) = 65 crates

Since he was closed on Monday and Friday, he had 5 working days. His target for the week is 120 crates. 

To find the target for 5 working days, we need to calculate the daily target: 
Daily target = 120 / 7 = 17.14 (approximately)

Since we can't sell a fraction of a crate, we'll consider the daily target as 17 crates per day.

Target for 5 working days = 17 * 5 = 85 crates

Now, let's find out how many crates Sam was off from his target:
Crates off target = Target for 5 working days - Total crates sold
= 85 - 65
= 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost of the desk, we need to determine the last bid made by Carmen. 

The initial bid is $200. The bids rise by $50 each time. Since there are 3 other people who bid once, there are a total of 4 people who bid before Carmen makes her final bid. 

The sequence of bids would be: $200, $250, $300, $350, $400, $450, $500. 

Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, so she makes 4 bids. The last bid is $500. 

The total cost of the desk is the last bid, which is $500.

The final answer is: $500"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to find the total miles driven per year, the total cost per year for the miles driven, and the total bonus per year.

First, let's find the total miles driven per year. Since John goes to work 30 miles away and back each day, the total miles driven per day is 30 * 2 = 60 miles. He goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year, so the total miles driven per year is 60 * 5 * 50 = 15,000 miles.

The cost per mile is $2, so the total cost per year for the miles driven is 15,000 * $2 = $30,000.

John also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus per year is $150 * 12 = $1,800.

The total cost per year for driving is the sum of the total cost for the miles driven and the total bonus, which is $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

The final numerical answer is: $31,800"
"To find out how many minutes Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to add the minutes he exercised on both days. 

Monday: 16 minutes
Sunday: 23 minutes
Combined: 16 + 23 = 39 minutes

Since Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to multiply the combined minutes by 2.

Combined minutes: 39
Twice the combined minutes: 39 * 2 = 78 minutes

Therefore, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal.

The final answer is: 78"
"To determine the number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider the folding process. 

When a piece of paper is folded vertically, it creates two layers: the front and the back. 

For a 32-page tabloid, we need to have 32 pages in total. Since each piece of paper can have 2 pages (front and back), we can calculate the number of pieces of paper needed by dividing the total number of pages by 2.

32 pages / 2 pages per piece of paper = 16 pieces of paper

However, this is not the final answer because we need to consider the fact that the first and last pages are on the outside of the folded paper, and the remaining pages are on the inside. 

When we fold the paper, the first and last pages are on the outside, and the remaining 30 pages are on the inside. Since the first and last pages are on the outside, they are on separate pieces of paper. The remaining 30 pages are on the inside, and since they are on the inside, they are on the same piece of paper.

So, we need 2 pieces of paper for the first and last pages, and 1 piece of paper for the remaining 30 pages.

"To find out how much money Annika has left, we need to calculate the amount she spent on food and snacks, and then subtract that from the initial amount she brought.

Annika spent half of $50 on food and snacks, which is $50 / 2 = $25.

She also spent an additional $10 on rides.

So, the total amount she spent is $25 (food and snacks) + $10 (rides) = $35.

Now, let's subtract the total amount she spent from the initial amount she brought: $50 - $35 = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we first need to determine how many books she sold in the first year. 

Let's denote the number of books sold in the current year as 'x'. Since she sold twice as many books in the first year, the number of books sold in the first year is 2x.

We know that there are 50 unsold books and her sales number this year is 45. This means the total number of books she has sold in three years is 250 - 50 = 200. 

Since the number of books sold in the first year is 2x and in the current year is x, the total number of books sold in the first two years is 3x. 

We can set up the equation: 3x = 200. 

Solving for x, we get x = 200 / 3 = 66.67. However, since the number of books cannot be a fraction, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. 

So, the number of books sold in the current year is 66, and the number of books sold in the first year is 2 * 66 = 132.

The total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is the number of books sold in the second year multiplied by the price of each book. 

Since we don't have the information about the number of books sold in the second year, we need to find it. We know that the total number of books sold in the first two years is 132 + 66 = 198. 

The total number of books sold in three years is 200, so the number of books sold in the second year is 200 - 198 = 2.

The total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is 2 * 20 = 40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find out how much Watson made in April, we need to calculate his total earnings from his hourly wage and the weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate his total hours worked in a week: 
10 hours/day * 5 days/week = 50 hours/week

Since Watson earns $10 per hour, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:
50 hours/week * $10/hour = $500/week

In April, there are 4 weeks. So, his total earnings from his hourly wage in April are:
$500/week * 4 weeks = $2000

Additionally, Watson gets a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well. Since the company performed well for the whole month, he gets the bonus for 4 weeks:
$300/week * 4 weeks = $1200

Now, let's add his earnings from his hourly wage and the bonus to find his total earnings in April:
$2000 + $1200 = $3200

The final answer is: $3200"
"To find out how many people John lost to, we need to calculate 20% of 20, since he beat 80% of the people he arm wrestled.

"To find out how many loaves are sold in the afternoon, we first need to determine how many loaves are left after the morning sales. 

The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. 

Two-thirds of 60 is calculated as (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves sold in the morning.

Now, we need to find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales. The total number of loaves left is 60 - 40 = 20 loaves.

Half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening. Half of 20 is calculated as (1/2) * 20 = 10 loaves.

Since the remaining loaves are divided equally between the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much weight Joey loses per week and then multiply that by the number of weeks it takes Sandy to lose the same amount of weight.

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. To find out how much weight Joey loses per week, we divide the total weight lost by the number of weeks:

Weight lost per week = Total weight lost / Number of weeks
Weight lost per week = 8 pounds / 4 weeks
Weight lost per week = 2 pounds per week

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, we multiply the weight lost per week by the number of weeks it takes Sandy:

Total weight lost = Weight lost per week * Number of weeks
Total weight lost = 2 pounds/week * 4 weeks
Total weight lost = 8 pounds

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose 8 pounds.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total savings, we need to calculate the savings on the tubs of ice cream and the packets of milk separately and then add them together.

The original price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $13 = $26. The discounted price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 x $11 = $22. The savings on 2 tubs of ice cream is $26 - $22 = $4.

The original price of 4 packets of milk is 4 x $1 = $4. The discounted price of 4 packets of milk is 4 x ($1 - $0.5) = 4 x $0.5 = $2. The savings on 4 packets of milk is $4 - $2 = $2.

The total savings is $4 + $2 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of new arms and legs grown after 15 days.

The serum grows an extra arm every 3 days. To find out how many arms are grown in 15 days, we divide 15 by 3. 

15 / 3 = 5

So, the person will grow 5 extra arms.

The serum grows an extra leg every 5 days. To find out how many legs are grown in 15 days, we divide 15 by 5.

15 / 5 = 3

So, the person will grow 3 extra legs.

To find the total number of new limbs, we add the number of new arms and legs.

5 (new arms) + 3 (new legs) = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Theo has spent so far and subtract the amount he wants to save from it. 

First, let's calculate the cost of the business suits: 6 suits * $100 = $600.
Next, let's calculate the cost of the suitcases: 3 suitcases * $50 = $150.
Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket. The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. The cost of a business suit is $100, so 5 times that is $500. $700 more than that is $1200. 
Now, let's add up the costs: $600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight) = $1950.

The total amount spent so far is $1950. Theo wants to save $2000, so he has $6000 - $2000 = $4000 left. 

To find out how much he has to spend on gifts, we subtract the total amount spent from the amount he has left: $4000 - $1950 = $1050.

The final answer is: $1050"
"To find the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we first need to calculate the number of eggs consumed by each group per day and then multiply it by 7.

Three people eat 3 eggs each day, so the total number of eggs consumed by this group per day is 3 * 3 = 9 eggs.

The rest of the family members are 5 - 3 = 2. They eat 2 eggs each day, so the total number of eggs consumed by this group per day is 2 * 2 = 4 eggs.

The total number of eggs consumed by the family per day is 9 + 4 = 13 eggs.

To find the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7: 13 * 7 = 91 eggs.

The final answer is: 91"
"To find Trent's age, we need to first determine Jane's age. Since Quinn is 30 and Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, we can calculate Jane's age by subtracting 3 from Quinn's age.

Jane's age = Quinn's age - 3
Jane's age = 30 - 3
Jane's age = 27

Now that we know Jane's age, we can find Trent's age. Trent is 5 years older than Jane, so we can calculate Trent's age by adding 5 to Jane's age.

Trent's age = Jane's age + 5
Trent's age = 27 + 5
Trent's age = 32

The final answer is: 32"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Six years ago, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.
2. At that time, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old.
3. The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah, which is 3000 * 20 = 60,000.
4. Since the population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now, the current population of Chile is 2 * 60,000 = 120,000.

The final answer is: 120,000"
"Let's break down the information given. 

Let's denote the number of players on the defense as D. 

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2D.

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is D/2.

We know that the total number of players on the team is 105. The sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams is equal to 105. 

So, we can write the equation: 2D + D + D/2 = 105.

To solve for D, we need to get rid of the fraction. We can do this by multiplying the entire equation by 2, which gives us: 4D + 2D + D = 210.

Combining like terms, we get: 7D = 210.

Now, we can solve for D by dividing both sides of the equation by 7: D = 210 / 7.

D = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total number of people invited, we first need to calculate the number of people from the 2 families with 6 people and the 3 families with 4 people.

For the 2 families with 6 people, the total number of people is 2 * 6 = 12.
For the 3 families with 4 people, the total number of people is 3 * 4 = 12.
The total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.

However, 8 people couldn't come due to illness. So, we subtract 8 from the total number of people invited: 24 - 8 = 16.

Then, 1/4 of the people who couldn't come due to illness had previous commitments. 1/4 of 8 is 2. So, we subtract 2 from the number of people who couldn't come due to illness: 8 - 2 = 6.

Now, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come due to illness and previous commitments from the total number of people invited: 16 - 6 = 10.

"To find the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store, we need to calculate the total number of marbles first.

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and added them to a store that had 50. So, the total number of marbles in the store after buying from Johanna is 20 + 50 = 70.

His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna, his father gave him 2/5 * 20 = 8 marbles.

Now, the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store is 70 (initial marbles) + 20 (bought from Johanna) + 8 (given by his father) = 98 marbles.

Since each marble weighs 2kgs, the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store is 98 * 2 = 196 kgs.

"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (such as a pool) is length x width x height.

Given dimensions: 
- Length (L) = 6 feet
- Width (W) = 4 feet
- Height (H) = 5 feet

Volume = L x W x H = 6 x 4 x 5 = 120 cubic feet

Now, we need to find the cost to fill the pool. The cost is given as $0.1 per cubic foot.

Cost = Volume x Cost per cubic foot
= 120 cubic feet x $0.1/cubic foot
= $12

"To find the total number of children in the classroom, we first need to determine the number of girls and nongendered children.

Given that there are 30 boys, and the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, we can calculate the number of girls by multiplying the number of boys by 3.

Number of girls = 3 * 30 = 90

Next, we are told that the classroom has 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys. To find the number of nongendered children, we can multiply the number of boys by 1/10.

Number of nongendered children = 30 * (1/10) = 3

Now, we can find the total number of children by adding the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children.

Total number of children = 30 (boys) + 90 (girls) + 3 (nongendered children) = 123

The final answer is: 123"
"To find the total number of electric poles required, we need to use the given ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This means for every 1 electric pole, 3 electric wires are needed.

Given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles:

1 (electric pole) : 3 (electric wires) = x (electric poles) : 45 (electric wires)

We can cross-multiply to solve for x:

1 * 45 = 3x
45 = 3x
x = 45 / 3
x = 15

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of people who left the party. We know that 1/4 of the total number of people left, and 22 men stayed. 

Let's denote the total number of people as 'x'. Since 1/4 of the people left, 3/4 of the people stayed. We can set up the equation:

3/4 * x = 22 + (number of women who stayed)

We know that the total number of people at the beginning was 25 men + 15 women = 40 people. So, x = 40.

Now, we can substitute x = 40 into the equation:

3/4 * 40 = 22 + (number of women who stayed)

30 = 22 + (number of women who stayed)

To find the number of women who stayed, we subtract 22 from both sides:

number of women who stayed = 30 - 22
number of women who stayed = 8

Since there were 15 women at the beginning, the number of women who left is 15 - 8 = 7.

The total number of people who left is 1/4 of the total number of people, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10. We already know that 7 women left, and 22 men stayed. So, the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3.

We know that the total number of people who left is 10, and 7 women and 3 men left. So, the number of women who left is indeed 7.

The final answer is 8."
"To find the cost of the pen, we first need to determine the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book, and the book costs $4, the magazine costs $4 / 2 = $2.

"To find the total number of pencils Jam has, we know she has 3 boxes and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils. We can set up an equation to represent this: 3x + 2 = 26, where x is the number of pencils in each box.

To solve for x, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: 3x = 26 - 2, 3x = 24.

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 3 to find the value of x: x = 24 / 3, x = 8.

Now that we know each box has 8 pencils, we can find the total number of pencils Jam has: 3 boxes * 8 pencils per box = 24 pencils.

We also know Meg has 46 pencils. To find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have, we add their pencils together: 24 pencils (Jam) + 46 pencils (Meg) = 70 pencils.

Since each box holds 8 pencils, we can find the total number of boxes needed by dividing the total number of pencils by 8: 70 pencils / 8 pencils per box = 8.75 boxes.

Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we round up to the nearest whole number to ensure all pencils fit. Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

The final answer is: 9"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total weakening effect of the ice cubes and the added cream.

First, let's calculate the number of ice cubes needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, so the number of ice cubes needed is:

65 / 13 = 5

Since each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, 5 ice cubes will make it 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters weaker.

Next, we need to add the weakening effect of the cream. The coffee is already 60 milliliters weaker due to the ice cubes, and adding 15 milliliters of cream will make it 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters weaker.

The final answer is: 75"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the trade ratio. For every 2 old records, 1 new record is given. Since 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of new records as 7. 

Now, we need to find out how many old records were traded for these 7 new records. Since the trade ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record, we can multiply the number of new records by 2 to find the total number of old records traded.

Total old records = 7 new records * 2 = 14

So, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records.

"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we first need to find the number of junior and senior programmers, and then their respective salaries.

The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, which is 100. 
2/5 * 100 = 40 junior programmers.

Since the number of senior programmers is the remaining 3/5 of the total number of employees, we can find it by subtracting the number of junior programmers from the total number of employees.
100 - 40 = 60 senior programmers.

Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, who are paid $2000 per month. So, senior programmers are paid $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month.

Now, we can find the total amount of money the company pays to junior programmers per month by multiplying the number of junior programmers by their salary.
40 * $2000 = $80000

Similarly, we can find the total amount of money the company pays to senior programmers per month by multiplying the number of senior programmers by their salary.
60 * $2400 = $144000

Finally, we can find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month by adding the total amount paid to junior and senior programmers.
$80000 + $144000 = $224000

The final answer is: $224000"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as 'x'.

Initially, there were x people on the bus.

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the total number of people became x + 5.

At the second bus stop, 7 people got down, so the total number of people became (x + 5) - 7 = x - 2.

Then, 8 more people got in, so the total number of people became (x - 2) + 8 = x + 6.

We are given that the total number of people heading to the third stop is 20, so we can set up the equation:

x + 6 = 20

To solve for x, we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:

x = 20 - 6
x = 14

"To find out how many lollipops Oscar has, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, Oscar has 24 lollipops. He eats 2 on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left.

He passes 14 out to his friends, so he has 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops left.

He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now, he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.

He eats 3 more that night, so he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops left.

He eats 2 more in the morning, so he has 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops left.

"To find the time it takes to fully charge the phone, we need to first find out how many percentage points are left to charge. Since the phone is already at 60% charged, it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more to be fully charged.

Since the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can find the time it takes to charge 40% by multiplying the rate by the amount left to charge: 40% * 3 minutes/percentage-point = 120 minutes.

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours.

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

"To find out how much the customer paid, we need to calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip, apply the rewards and the coupon to the current shopping trip, and then subtract the total from the amount spent.

The customer spent $80 on their last shopping trip, so they earned $80 / $20 = 4 rewards. 

On this shopping trip, they spent $43 and used their rewards. Since they had 4 rewards, they used $4 off the price. 

The coupon took twice the amount of rewards off the price, which is 2 * $4 = $8. 

So, the total discount is $4 (from rewards) + $8 (from the coupon) = $12.

The amount the customer paid is $43 (spent) - $12 (discount) = $31.

"To determine which job pays more, we need to calculate the net pay for each job.

For Job A, the total income is $15/hour * 2000 hours/year = $30,000/year. The total tax is 20% of $30,000, which is 0.20 * $30,000 = $6,000. The net pay for Job A is $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

For Job B, the total income is $42,000. The property tax is $6,000, and the net income after property tax is $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000. The tax on the net income is 10% of $36,000, which is 0.10 * $36,000 = $3,600. The net pay for Job B is $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

Since $32,400 is greater than $24,000, Job B pays more. To find the difference in net pay, we subtract the net pay of Job A from the net pay of Job B: $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

"To find the final value of Maria's shares, we need to calculate the price of the stock after the first year and then after the second year.

Initially, Maria buys 8 shares for $8 each, so the total cost is 8 * 8 = $64.

The stock price increases by 50% in the first year. To find the new price, we multiply the original price by 1.5 (100% + 50% = 150%, or 1.5 as a decimal). 

New price after the first year = $8 * 1.5 = $12.

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. To find the new price, we multiply the price after the first year by 0.75 (100% - 25% = 75%, or 0.75 as a decimal).

New price after the second year = $12 * 0.75 = $9.

Now, we multiply the new price after the second year by the number of shares Maria owns to find the final value of her shares.

Final value = 8 * $9 = $72.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of students in the two equal groups as 'x'. Since the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the smallest group is 'x - 10'.

We know that the total number of students in the class is 200, and the sum of the students in all three groups is equal to 200. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 70

Since the smallest group has 'x - 10' students, we can find the number of students in the smallest group by subtracting 10 from x:

x - 10 = 70 - 10

We know that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds. 

Since the pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle and the green toad, they also weigh 50 pounds.

The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.

The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we can find the total weight of the animals: 50 (pink frog) + 50 (blue beetle) + 50 (green toad) + 60 (yellow snake) + 30 (red bird) = 240 pounds.

The container weighs 20 pounds. 

The total weight of the container and the animals is 240 (animals) + 20 (container) = 260 pounds.

The final answer is: 260"
"To find the total number of baby outfits Laurel has, we need to add up the outfits she received from her friend, at the baby shower, and from her mom.

Laurel's friend gave her 24 baby outfits.
At the baby shower, she received twice the amount of new baby outfits, which is 2 * 24 = 48 outfits.
Her mom gifted her with 15 baby outfits.

Now, let's add up the total number of outfits: 24 + 48 + 15 = 87.

The final answer is: 87"
"To find the total distance Tyson covered in June, we first need to calculate the new daily distance he needs to run based on his coach's advice. 

The coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters in a day. To find 1/5 of 5000 meters, we multiply 5000 by 1/5.

5000 * (1/5) = 5000 / 5 = 1000

So, the coach wants him to run 1000 more meters every day. To find the new daily distance, we add this to the original 5000 meters.

New daily distance = 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters

Since Tyson trained for a month, and there are 30 days in June, we multiply the new daily distance by 30 to find the total distance covered in June.

Total distance = 6000 * 30 = 180,000 meters

The final answer is: 180,000"
"To find the price difference between Juice Box C and Juice Box B, we first need to determine the prices of both boxes. 

Juice Box A is 4 dollars. 
Juice Box B is 5 dollars more than Juice Box A, so it is 4 + 5 = 9 dollars.
Juice Box C is 7 dollars more than Juice Box A, so it is 4 + 7 = 11 dollars.

Now, we need to find the difference between Juice Box C and Juice Box B. 
The difference is 11 - 9 = 2 dollars.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the total number of legs from the tables with 4 legs and the tables with 3 legs separately and then add them together.

The tables with 4 legs have a total of 40 * 4 = 160 legs.

The tables with 3 legs have a total of 50 * 3 = 150 legs.

Now, we add the total number of legs from both types of tables: 160 + 150 = 310.

The final answer is: 310"
"To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we need to first determine how many cookies are used by her son and her husband. 

Her son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, so he eats 4 * 5 = 20 cookies per week. 

Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so he eats 1 * 7 = 7 cookies per week.

The total number of cookies used by her son and husband is 20 + 7 = 27 cookies per week.

Since each bag has 36 cookies, and 27 cookies are used by her son and husband, Jenny eats the remaining cookies. 

36 (total cookies in a bag) - 27 (cookies used by son and husband) = 9 cookies.

Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"To find the total cost of the shirts, we first need to calculate the discount amount. 

The original price of each shirt is $30. 
The discount percentage is 40%. 
To find the discount amount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage (as a decimal): 
$30 * 0.4 = $12 

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the original price to get the discounted price of one shirt: 
$30 - $12 = $18 

Since Davos bought 2 shirts, we multiply the discounted price by 2 to get the total cost: 
$18 * 2 = $36 

The final answer is: $36"
"To find the percentage increase in the amount of money the factory is making per day, we need to first find the difference in the amount of money they are making per day now and the amount they used to make per day.

The factory used to make $100 per tractor and sold 10 tractors a day, so they made $100 * 10 = $1000 per day.

Now, they make $220 per silo and sell 5 silos a day, so they make $220 * 5 = $1100 per day.

The difference in the amount of money they are making per day now and the amount they used to make per day is $1100 - $1000 = $100.

To find the percentage increase, we divide the difference by the original amount and multiply by 100:

($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%

So, the factory is making 10% more per day now. 

10%"
"To find out how much Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to calculate the monthly expenses and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's calculate the monthly expenses. 

Food costs $25 per week, and there are 4 weeks in a month, so the monthly food cost is:
$25/week * 4 weeks/month = $100/month

Treats cost $20 per month.

Medicine costs $100 per month.

Now, let's add up the monthly expenses:
$100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine) = $220/month

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the monthly expenses by 12:
$220/month * 12 months/year = $2640/year

The final answer is: $2640"
"To find the total time spent on after-work activities, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and add them up.

- Monday's yoga class is 1 hour.
- Tuesday's cooking class is 3 times as long as Monday's yoga, so it's 1 * 3 = 3 hours.
- Wednesday's cheese-tasting event is 0.5 hours (half an hour).
- Thursday's museum tour is half as long as the cooking class, so it's 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours.
- Friday's errands are 2 hours.

Now, let's add up the time spent on each activity:
1 (Monday) + 3 (Tuesday) + 0.5 (Wednesday) + 1.5 (Thursday) + 2 (Friday) = 7.5 hours.

The final answer is: 7.5"
"To find out how many plant pots April has left over, we first need to determine the total number of plant pots she needs for the school garden. 

The school needs 30 plant pots for the daisies. Since they need twice as many for the roses, we multiply 30 by 2 to get the number of plant pots needed for the roses. 

30 * 2 = 60

So, the total number of plant pots needed for both daisies and roses is 30 + 60 = 90.

April had already bought 100 plant pots from the garden center. To find out how many plant pots she has left over, we subtract the total number of plant pots needed from the number she already bought.

100 - 90 = 10

Therefore, April has 10 plant pots left over. 

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how much Andrea saved, we need to subtract the amount she spent from the initial amount of money she had. 

First, let's calculate the total amount she spent. She spent $11 on a sweater and gave her brother $4, so the total amount spent is $11 + $4 = $15.

Now, let's subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money she had: $36 - $15 = $21.

Andrea saved $21."
"To find the total time John spent, we need to calculate the time he spent boating, swimming, and watching shows. 

He spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours swimming. 

The total time spent boating and swimming is 6 + 3 = 9 hours.

He watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so the total time spent watching shows is 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

The total time spent on these activities is 9 + 6 = 15 hours.

We are given that watching shows was 30% of his total time, so we can set up the equation: 6 = 0.3x, where x is the total time.

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 0.3: x = 6 / 0.3 = 20.

Now that we know the total time, we can find the time spent sightseeing, which is 40% of the total time. 

Time spent sightseeing = 0.4 * 20 = 8 hours.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how much money Annabelle still needs to save, we need to calculate her total earnings from both jobs and subtract the amount she already has in her savings.

First, let's calculate her earnings from the first job:
20 hours * $10 per hour = $200

Next, let's calculate her earnings from the second job:
15 hours * $5 per hour = $75

Now, let's add her earnings from both jobs:
$200 + $75 = $275

Since she already has $80 in her savings, we need to subtract that from her total earnings:
$275 - $80 = $195

So, Annabelle still needs to save $195 to buy the phone.

The final answer is: $195"
"To find the height of the tallest tree, we first need to find the combined height of the two shorter trees. The shortest tree is 6 feet tall, and the second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, so the second tree is 6 + 5 = 11 feet tall. 

The combined height of the two shorter trees is 6 + 11 = 17 feet. 

The height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two shorter trees combined, so the tallest tree is 2 * 17 = 34 feet tall.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find out how much money Dean has left, we need to first calculate the total amount of money he spent at the toy store. 

The cost of 6 toy cars is 6 * $2 = $12. 
The cost of 5 teddy bears is 5 * $1 = $5. 
The total cost of the toys is $12 + $5 = $17.

Dean initially had $28. After spending $17, he has $28 - $17 = $11 left. 

His mother then gives him an extra $10, so he now has $11 + $10 = $21.

The final answer is: $21"
"To find out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to first calculate the total cost of the activities. 

The cost of mini-golf for Morgan and her friends is 1 round * $5 per round = $5. 
Since there are 'x' friends, the total cost for mini-golf for all of them will be $5 + $5x.

The cost of arcade tokens for Morgan and her friends is $5. 
The cost of go-karts for Morgan and her friends is 2 rides * $10 per ride = $20. 
Since there are 'x' friends, the total cost for go-karts for all of them will be 2 * $10 * x = $20x.

The total cost for all activities is the sum of the costs for mini-golf, arcade tokens, and go-karts: $5 + $5x + $20x.

We know that Morgan's dad has a budget of $90. So, we can set up the equation: $5 + $5x + $20x = $90.

Combine like terms: $5 + $25x = $90.

Subtract $5 from both sides: $25x = $85.

Divide both sides by $25: x = $85 / $25.

x = 3.4

Since we can't invite a fraction of a friend, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. 

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how much money Marisa saves in her piggy bank, we need to first calculate how much money she spends on lollipops each day and then subtract that from her daily pocket money.

Marisa buys 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each, so the total amount she spends on lollipops each day is:
4 lollipops * 25 cents/lollipop = 100 cents or $1

Since Marisa gets $5 as pocket money each day, the amount she saves each day is:
$5 - $1 = $4

Now, we need to find out how much she saves in 5 days:
$4/day * 5 days = $20

The final answer is: $20"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how much change Billy has after buying the candy. 

Billy starts with $10. The candy costs $1.5 per pound. Let's call the number of pounds of candy he buys 'x'. The total cost of the candy is 1.5x. 

So, the change Billy has after buying the candy is 10 - 1.5x.

Next, Billy spends half of his change on gumballs. Since he bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, the total cost of the gumballs is 40 * 0.05 = $2. 

Since he spent half of his change on gumballs, the amount he spent on gumballs is half of (10 - 1.5x), which is (10 - 1.5x) / 2.

We know that the amount he spent on gumballs is $2, so we can set up the equation:

(10 - 1.5x) / 2 = 2

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2:

10 - 1.5x = 4

Now, we can isolate x by subtracting 10 from both sides:

-1.5x = -6

Dividing both sides by -1.5 gives us:

x = 4

So, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy.

The final answer is: 4"
"Let's break down the information given. Carver's age is 45, and it's 5 years less than twice the age of his son. 

Let's represent the son's age as 'x'. According to the problem, 2x - 5 = 45. 

To find the son's age, we need to solve for 'x'. 

First, we add 5 to both sides of the equation: 2x = 45 + 5
This simplifies to 2x = 50.

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 2 to isolate 'x': x = 50 / 2
x = 25

The son is 25 years old.

"To find the total distance the train travels in one trip, we need to add the distances between the three cities. 

Distance from the first city to the second city: 75 miles
Distance from the second city to the third city: 100 miles
Distance from the third city to the first city: 100 - 50 = 50 miles (since it's 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs)
Total distance in one trip: 75 + 100 + 50 = 225 miles

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance it travels in a day is:
225 miles/trip * 3 trips/day = 675 miles/day

To find out how many days the train goes between services, we need to divide the total distance it can travel before needing service (18,000 miles) by the distance it travels in a day (675 miles):
18,000 miles / 675 miles/day = 26.67 days

So, the train goes approximately 26.67 days between services."
"To find the amount of stuffing needed for the collie beds, we first need to find the average amount of stuffing between the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds. 

The average amount of stuffing is calculated by adding the amount of stuffing for the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds and then dividing by 2. 

Average stuffing for collie beds = (8 + 2) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for the collie beds. 

Total stuffing for collie beds = 5 * 3 = 15 pounds.

Next, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for the chihuahua beds. 

Total stuffing for chihuahua beds = 2 * 4 = 8 pounds.

Finally, we add the total amount of stuffing needed for the collie and chihuahua beds to find the total amount of stuffing Mark needs.

Total stuffing needed = 15 + 8 = 23 pounds.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total time taken for the trip, we need to calculate the time taken for each part of the trip and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time taken for the trip to his friend's house. The distance is 200 miles and the speed is 70 mph. 

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 200 miles / 70 mph
Time = 2.857 hours (approximately)

However, he took a detour that added 10 miles to his trip. So, the actual distance traveled to his friend's house is 200 + 10 = 210 miles. 

Time taken for the detour = 10 miles / 70 mph
Time taken for the detour = 0.143 hours (approximately)

Total time taken to reach his friend's house = 2.857 hours + 0.143 hours
Total time taken to reach his friend's house = 3 hours

Now, let's calculate the time taken for the trip back home. The distance is 240 miles and the speed is 80 mph.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 240 miles / 80 mph
Time = 3 hours

Total time taken for the trip = Time taken to reach his friend's house + Time taken for the trip back home
Total time taken for the trip = 3 hours + 3 hours
Total time taken for the trip = 6 hours

"To find the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we first need to find the total number of fourth-grade students present on Friday. 

Total fourth-graders = 96
Absent girls = 5
Absent boys = 4
Total absent students = 5 + 4 = 9

Total students present = Total fourth-graders - Total absent students
Total students present = 96 - 9
Total students present = 87

Now, we know that 43 out of the total 96 fourth-graders are girls. So, the number of fourth-grade boys is:
Total fourth-graders - Total girls
Total fourth-grade boys = 96 - 43
Total fourth-grade boys = 53

Now, we need to find the number of fourth-grade boys who were present on Friday. We know that 4 boys were absent. So, the number of boys present is:
Total fourth-grade boys - Absent boys
Boys present = 53 - 4
Boys present = 49

"To find the total number of kids in the park, we need to determine the number of boys and then add it to the number of girls. 

Since there are twice the number of boys as girls, and there are 6 girls, we can calculate the number of boys by multiplying the number of girls by 2. 

Number of boys = 2 * 6 = 12

Now, we can find the total number of kids by adding the number of boys and girls.

Total number of kids = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total number of kids = 12 + 6
Total number of kids = 18

"Let's break down the information given:

1. 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.
2. A number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. 
   Since 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks, four times that many is 4 * 3 = 12. 
   Four times that many minus 5 is 12 - 5 = 7. So, 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting.
3. Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. 
   Since 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting, three times that many is 3 * 7 = 21. 
   So, 21 customers were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale.

Now, let's add up the number of customers kicked out for each reason:
- Refusing to wear masks: 3
- Shoplifting: 7
- Physical violence over goods on sale: 21

Total number of customers kicked out for these reasons = 3 + 7 + 21 = 31

Since a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:
50 - 31 = 19

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many points Erin has now. We know that Erin has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8. 

Let's denote Erin's current points as E and Sara's points as S. We know that E = 3S. Since Sara scored 8, we can substitute S with 8. 

E = 3 * 8
E = 24

Now that we know Erin has 24 points, we need to find out how many points she had before. We know that she now has 14 points. 

Let's denote Erin's previous points as P. We can set up the equation: P + x = 24, where x is the points she gained. However, we know that she scored 14 points, so we can set up the equation as P + 14 = 24.

P + 14 = 24
P = 24 - 14
P = 10

So, Erin had 10 points before.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total cost of the picture frames, we first need to calculate the cost of the etching. The cost of etching is 20% of $20, which is 0.2 * $20 = $4. 

The total cost of the picture frames is the cost of the frame plus the cost of the etching, which is $20 + $4 = $24 per frame. 

Since there are 44 seniors, the total cost of the picture frames is 44 * $24 = $1056.

2 seniors will receive pins, so the total cost of the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

1/4 of the seniors are officers, which is 44 / 4 = 11 officers. The total cost of the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

The total cost of the senior gifts is the sum of the cost of the picture frames, the cost of the pins, and the cost of the cords. This is $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

"To find the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we first need to calculate the materials cost. Since the original price of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400 and making it yourself saves 20%, we can calculate the materials cost as follows:

Original price = $400
Savings = 20% of $400 = 0.20 * $400 = $80
Materials cost = Original price - Savings = $400 - $80 = $320

So, the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper is $320.

"To find the total number of shoes sold, we need to calculate the number of shoes sold on each day and then add them together.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes they sold on Friday, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the amount they did the day before, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six people returned their pairs on Sunday, so we need to subtract those from the total number of shoes sold on Sunday. 14 - 6 = 8 pairs.

Now, let's add up the total number of shoes sold over the weekend: 14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 8 (Sunday) = 50 pairs.

Since each pair has 2 shoes, we need to multiply the total number of pairs by 2 to get the total number of shoes sold. 50 * 2 = 100.

The total value of the equipment is $400,000. 
40% of the equipment was faulty. 
To find 40% of $400,000, we multiply $400,000 by 0.4.

$400,000 * 0.4 = $160,000

This is the value of the faulty pieces of equipment. To find the value of the functioning pieces, we subtract the value of the faulty pieces from the total value.

$400,000 - $160,000 = $240,000

The total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is $240,000.

Half of the sheep = 30 / 2 = 15

Now, let's calculate the milk from each half:
Milk from the first half = 15 * 1 kg = 15 kg
Milk from the second half = 15 * 2 kg = 30 kg

Now, let's add the milk from both halves to find the total milk collected:

"To find out how many pieces of rolls Mrs. Sherman fed to the chickens, we first need to determine how many rolls were left after feeding her children. Since she made a dozen (12) rolls and fed 6 to her children, we subtract 6 from 12 to get the number of rolls left.

12 (initial rolls) - 6 (rolls fed to children) = 6 rolls left

Since each of the remaining 6 rolls was broken into 8 pieces, we multiply 6 by 8 to find the total number of pieces fed to the chickens.

6 (rolls left) * 8 (pieces per roll) = 48

So, Mrs. Sherman fed 48 pieces of rolls to the chickens.

"To find the number of pupils who like the color yellow, we first need to find the number of pupils who like blue, then the number of pupils who like green, and finally subtract the sum of these two from the total number of pupils.

First, half of the class likes blue. So, the number of pupils who like blue is 40 / 2 = 20.

Now, one-fourth of the remaining pupils like green. The remaining pupils are 40 - 20 = 20. One-fourth of 20 is 20 / 4 = 5.

So, the number of pupils who like green is 5.

Now, we subtract the sum of pupils who like blue and green from the total number of pupils to find the number of pupils who like yellow. The number of pupils who like yellow is 40 - (20 + 5) = 40 - 25 = 15.

"To find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we need to calculate the number of apples picked each day and then add them together.

On Monday, Lucy sold all the apples picked, but we don't know the number of apples picked. However, we do know that she made $56 from selling them at $4 per piece. So, we can find the number of apples picked on Monday by dividing the total amount earned by the price per apple:

$56 ÷ $4 = 14 apples

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she did the previous day, which is 2 * 12 = 24 apples.

Now, we can find the total number of apples picked over the three days by adding the number of apples picked each day:

14 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 24 (Wednesday) = 50 apples

"To find out how many socks Lindsay has washed, we need to calculate the total number of socks from the pairs and the loose socks. 

Since each pair of socks contains 2 socks, washing 10 pairs of socks means Lindsay has washed 10 * 2 = 20 socks from the pairs. 

Adding the 15 loose socks, Lindsay has washed a total of 20 + 15 = 35 socks.

Since there are 50 socks that need washing, to find out how many socks Lindsay has missed, we subtract the number of socks she has washed from the total number of socks that need washing: 50 - 35 = 15.

After that, we need to subtract the number of cookies her brother ate, which is 44.

65 (total cookies) - 44 (cookies eaten) = 21 cookies

So, there are 21 cookies left for Rachel.

The final answer is: 21"
"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total interest she has to pay and then divide it by the number of months.

First, let's calculate the total interest:

Interest = Principal * Rate * Time
Principal = $3,650
Rate = 10% or 0.10
Time = 5 months

Interest = $3,650 * 0.10 * 5
Interest = $1,825

Now, let's calculate the total amount Karan has to pay, which is the principal plus the interest:

Total Amount = Principal + Interest
Total Amount = $3,650 + $1,825
Total Amount = $5,475

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month for 5 months, we can divide the total amount by the number of months:

Monthly Payment = Total Amount / Number of Months
Monthly Payment = $5,475 / 5
Monthly Payment = $1,095

The final answer is: $1,095"
"To find out how many kilometers Cho hiked, we need to multiply the speed by the time. Cho hiked at 14 kilometers per hour for 8 hours, so Cho hiked 14 * 8 = 112 kilometers.

To find out how many kilometers Chloe hiked, we need to multiply Chloe's speed by the time she hiked. Chloe hiked at 9 kilometers per hour for 5 hours, so Chloe hiked 9 * 5 = 45 kilometers.

To find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked than Chloe, we need to subtract the distance Chloe hiked from the distance Cho hiked. Cho hiked 112 kilometers and Chloe hiked 45 kilometers, so Cho hiked 112 - 45 = 67 kilometers farther.

The final answer is: 67"
"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we first need to determine how many silver and gold pesos each of them has.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos.

Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos.

Anna also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

Now, let's add up the total number of silver and gold pesos each of them has:

Axel's total: 50 (silver) + 80 (gold) = 130 pesos
Anna's total: 100 (silver) + 120 (gold) = 220 pesos

To find the total number of pesos they have together, we add Axel's total and Anna's total:

130 (Axel's total) + 220 (Anna's total) = 350

The final answer is: 350"
"To find the total profit per hour, we first need to determine the total revenue and the total cost.

Millie buys supplies for $18 to make 3 pitchers of lemonade. Each pitcher holds 12 cups of lemonade, so she can make 3 * 12 = 36 cups of lemonade.

She sells each cup of lemonade for $1, so her total revenue will be 36 * $1 = $36.

Her total cost is $18.

To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the revenue: $36 - $18 = $18.

Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, we need to find out how many hours it takes her to sell all the lemonade. Since she has 36 cups, and she sells 4 cups per hour, it will take her 36 / 4 = 9 hours to sell all the lemonade.

To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours: $18 / 9 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the initial amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we can use the information that he sold 3/5 of his land and had 12.8 hectares left. 

Let's denote the initial amount of land as x hectares. Since he sold 3/5 of his land, he was left with 2/5 of his land, which is equal to 12.8 hectares.

We can set up the equation: (2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2 to isolate x:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land initially.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the number of female members in the choir, we first need to calculate 50% of the total members. 

50% of 52 is 0.5 * 52 = 26. 

Since there are 26 female members, and half of them can't make it to the show, we need to find half of 26. 

Half of 26 is 26 / 2 = 13.

Now, the 3 teachers are joining the performance, so we add 3 to the number of female members who made it. 

13 + 3 = 16.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find Wilson's current math grade, we need to calculate the average of his 5 test scores. 

First, we add up all the scores: 
65 + 94 = 159
159 + 81 = 240
240 + 86 = 326
326 + 74 = 400

Next, we divide the sum by the number of tests to find the average:
400 / 5 = 80

So, Wilson's current math grade is 80. 

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the erasers and the cost of the pencils separately and then add them together.

The cost of 6 erasers is 6 x $2 = $12.

The cost of 8 pencils is 8 x $3 = $24.

Now, we add the cost of the erasers and the pencils together: $12 + $24 = $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to add the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson and the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu.

First, let's find the number of messages James delivers to Mr. Yu. Since he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can multiply the number of messages to Ms. Thompson by 1/3.

Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * Messages to Ms. Thompson
Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * 66
Messages to Mr. Yu = 22

Now, we can add the number of messages to Ms. Thompson and the number of messages to Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages James delivers.

Total messages = Messages to Ms. Thompson + Messages to Mr. Yu
Total messages = 66 + 22
Total messages = 88

The final answer is: 88"
"To find out how much money David saves, we need to calculate the cost of the rides for Dasha and compare it to the cost of the ride bracelet for David.

Each ride costs 2 tickets at $2 per ticket, so the cost of one ride is 2 * $2 = $4.

Since they ride all 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha to buy tickets for all rides is 9 * $4 = $36.

David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides. 

The cost of the rides for Dasha is $36, and the cost for David is $30. 

To find out how much money David saves, we subtract the cost for David from the cost for Dasha: $36 - $30 = $6.

David saves $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To find out how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we need to first determine the total number of gifts she has to wrap. 

Total gifts = gifts for family + gifts for friends + gifts for teachers
Total gifts = 6 + 4 + 2
Total gifts = 12

Since Monica wants to make a bow for each gift, she will need to make 12 bows in total.

Now, we need to find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each bow. To do this, we will divide the total amount of ribbon by the total number of bows.

Total ribbon = 144 inches
Total bows = 12

Ribbon per bow = Total ribbon / Total bows
Ribbon per bow = 144 / 12
Ribbon per bow = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we first need to find out how many popsicles each of them has. 

Let's assume the number of popsicles Betty has is 5x and the number of popsicles Sam has is 6x. 

Since the total number of popsicles they have together is 165, we can write the equation: 5x + 6x = 165

Combine like terms: 11x = 165

Divide both sides by 11: x = 15

Now that we know x, we can find the number of popsicles each of them has. Betty has 5x = 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles. Sam has 6x = 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has: 90 - 75 = 15

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total cost of the streaming services, we need to calculate the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus. 

The normal cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 each, so together they cost $20. 

Since Tim saves 20% by bundling, we need to find 20% of $20. 
20% of $20 is 0.2 x $20 = $4.

So, the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $20 - $4 = $16.

The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $16 (bundled Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26.

Since Tim was paying $60 for the cable package, he saves $60 - $26 = $34 by cancelling his cable subscription.

The final answer is: $34"
"To find the total time spent on the song, we need to add up the time spent writing, recording, and editing. 

Time spent writing: 4 hours
Time spent recording: 4 hours / 2 = 2 hours
Time spent editing: 90 minutes = 1.5 hours

Total time spent = 4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5 hours

Now, let's find the percentage of time spent editing. 
Percentage = (Time spent editing / Total time) * 100
= (1.5 / 7.5) * 100
= 0.2 * 100
= 20%

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total number of books Wendy wants to place, we first need to determine the number of books in the shelving system and then add 20 more than double that amount.

The shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns, so the total number of books it can hold is 6 * 6 = 36.

Now, we need to find double the number of books in the shelving system, which is 2 * 36 = 72.

Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books, so we add 20 to 72: 72 + 20 = 92.

Therefore, Wendy will need to carry 92 books to complete her task.

The final answer is: 92"
"To find out how many Valentine's Day cards Erica has now, we need to calculate the total number of cards she initially had, added to the cards her dad brought, and then subtract the cards she passed out and add the cards she received.

Initially, Erica made 20 Valentine's cards.

Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards that had 15 cards each, so that's 2 * 15 = 30 cards.

She initially had 20 cards, and her dad brought 30, so she had 20 + 30 = 50 cards.

She passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 to her family, so she gave away 24 + 5 = 29 cards.

She received 17 cards from family and friends.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards she has: 50 (initial cards) - 29 (cards given away) + 17 (cards received) = 38.

So, Erica now has 38 Valentine's Day cards. 

The final answer is: 38"
"To find out how many slices are left, we first need to determine how many slices Jenny gave away. 

Jenny gave 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices, we can calculate the number of slices Bill received as follows: 
1/3 * 12 = 4 slices

Jenny gave 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. We can calculate the number of slices Mark received as follows: 
1/4 * 12 = 3 slices

In total, Jenny gave away 4 + 3 = 7 slices.

Jenny ate 2 slices, so the total number of slices she gave away or ate is 7 + 2 = 9 slices.

To find out how many slices are left, we subtract the total number of slices given away or eaten from the total number of slices: 
12 - 9 = 3 slices

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many days Mark needs to save his money, we need to divide the cost of the bike by the amount he earns per day.

Cost of the bike: $300
Daily earnings: $10

Number of days = Cost of the bike / Daily earnings

= 30

So, Mark needs to save his money for 30 days to buy the bike.

30"
"To find the total number of bugs, we first need to find the number of millipedes and stink bugs. 

Nancy saw 90 spiders. Since there are 1/3rd as many millipedes as spiders, we can find the number of millipedes by multiplying the number of spiders by 1/3. 

Number of millipedes = 90 * (1/3) = 30

Next, we need to find the number of stink bugs. The number of stink bugs is equal to twice the number of millipedes minus 12. 

Number of stink bugs = 2 * 30 - 12 = 48

Now, we can find the total number of bugs by adding the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs.

Total number of bugs = 90 + 30 + 48 = 168

The final answer is: 168"
"To find the difference between Alice and Erica's ages, we first need to determine Alice's age. Since Beth is 5 years older than Erica, and Erica is 30 years old, Beth's age is 30 + 5 = 35 years.

Alice is 7 years older than Beth, so Alice's age is 35 + 7 = 42 years.

The difference between Alice and Erica's ages is 42 - 30 = 12 years.

"To find the total calories consumed by John, we need to calculate the total ounces of milk he drank and then multiply it by the calories per ounce.

John drank 2 glasses of milk, and each glass is 8 ounces. So, the total ounces of milk he drank is 2 * 8 = 16 ounces.

Since milk has 3 calories per ounce, the total calories consumed by John is 16 * 3 = 48 calories.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find out how much the builder earns in a year, we first need to calculate his daily earnings and then multiply it by the total number of working days in a year.

The builder works 6 days a week and 4 weeks a month. So, the total number of working days in a month is 6 days/week * 4 weeks/month = 24 days/month.

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of working days in a year is 24 days/month * 12 months/year = 288 days/year.

The builder gets paid $50 every day. So, his daily earnings are $50/day.

Now, we can calculate his total earnings in a year by multiplying his daily earnings by the total number of working days in a year: $50/day * 288 days/year = $14,400/year.

The final answer is: $14,400"
"To find out how many bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of flour and milk required for the quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. Since Mark is making a quadruple batch, we multiply the ingredients by 4:

- Flour: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups
- Milk: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark will need to buy:
12 cups / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags of flour

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so Mark will need to buy:
4 cups / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles of milk

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour:
6 bags of flour - 2 bottles of milk = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the energy saved, we first need to calculate the original energy consumption and the new energy consumption. 

The original energy consumption is 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours (Wh) per day. 

Since 1 kilowatt-hour (kWh) is equal to 1000 watt-hours (Wh), the original energy consumption is 7200 Wh / 1000 = 7.2 kWh per day.

If Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, the new energy consumption is 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 Wh per day. 

The new energy consumption in kWh is 2700 Wh / 1000 = 2.7 kWh per day.

The energy saved per day is the original energy consumption minus the new energy consumption: 7.2 kWh - 2.7 kWh = 4.5 kWh per day.

To find the total energy saved in 30 days, we multiply the daily energy saved by 30: 4.5 kWh/day * 30 days = 135 kWh.

The final answer is: 135"
"To find the average number of stripes, we first need to calculate the total number of stripes and then divide it by the total number of zebras.

There are two zebras with 17 stripes each, so that's 2 * 17 = 34 stripes.
There's a zebra with 36 stripes.
There's another zebra with half the number of stripes as the third zebra, which is 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.

The total number of stripes is 34 + 36 + 18 = 88.
The total number of zebras is 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.

To find the average, we divide the total number of stripes by the total number of zebras: 88 / 4 = 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To determine the total cost of the meat and cheese, we first need to calculate the total number of sandwiches required to serve 20 people. Since each sandwich serves 4 people, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each sandwich serves:

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, we need a total of 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

The cost of the meat is $7.00 per pound, so the total cost of the meat is:
5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00

The cost of the cheese is $3.00 per pound, so the total cost of the cheese is:
5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

The total cost of the meat and cheese is the sum of the cost of the meat and the cost of the cheese:
$35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

The final answer is: $50.00"
"To solve this problem, we first need to find the initial number of corns and the new number of cannolis and corns after Allan's purchases.

Since Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis initially, and he has 40 cannolis, the initial number of corns is 2 * 40 = 80.

Allan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis, so the number of corns he bought is 60 - 40 = 20.

The total number of cannolis after the purchase is 40 + 60 = 100.

The total number of corns after the purchase is 80 + 20 = 100.

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 100 + 100 = 200.

The final answer is: 200"
"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to first calculate the total steps he completed before the jog. 

Elliott finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. Since he wants to walk 10,000 steps, half of that would be 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps. 

He also did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. 

So, before the jog, Elliott completed 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

Since he had 2,000 steps left to take after the jog, we can find out how many steps he took during the jog by subtracting the remaining steps from the total steps he wanted to take. 

10,000 (total steps) - 6,000 (steps completed before jog) = 4,000 steps left to complete. However, he only had 2,000 steps left, so the steps he took during the jog must be 4,000 - 2,000 = 2,000 steps.

The final answer is: 2000"
"To find out how many minutes Toby will be early, we first need to determine how long it will take him to read the book. 

The book is 45 pages long and averages 200 words per page, so the total number of words in the book is 45 * 200 = 9000 words.

Toby can read 300 words per minute, so the time it will take him to read the book is 9000 / 300 = 30 minutes.

Since it takes 10 minutes to get to the airport, Toby will arrive 30 + 10 = 40 minutes after he starts reading.

However, Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to leave for the airport, so we need to subtract the time it takes him to read the book and get to the airport from the total time he has. 

60 - 40 = 20 minutes.

Therefore, Toby will be 20 minutes early. 

20"
"To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we first need to calculate the total number of employees and the total hours worked in each month.

In May, the company hired 40 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, so the total hours worked by each employee in May is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in May is 160 * $15 = $2400.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so the number of employees left is 40 - (1/4 * 40) = 40 - 10 = 30 employees. Each employee still worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, so the total hours worked by each employee in June is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in June is 160 * $15 = $2400.

The total amount paid to all employees in May is 40 * $2400 = $96,000. The total amount paid to all employees in June is 30 * $2400 = $72,000.

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000.

The final answer is: $168,000"
"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. Since she bought 2 pounds and the sale is ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off,"" we can break it down as follows:

- The first pound costs $3.
- The second pound is 1/2 off, so it's 1/2 * $3 = $1.50 off. Therefore, the second pound costs $3 - $1.50 = $1.50.
- The total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the magnets. She bought 4 magnets at $0.25 each, so the total cost of the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items: $4.50 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1 (magnets) = $7.

Sally started with $10, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from the initial amount: $10 - $7 = $3.

"To find the total amount Tim spent, we first need to calculate the cost of the two packages of fireworks. The first package costs $400, and the second package costs twice that much, which is 2 * $400 = $800. 

The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200. 

Since Tim gets a 20% discount on the two packages, we need to calculate the discount amount. 20% of $1200 is 0.2 * $1200 = $240. 

The discount amount is subtracted from the total cost of the two packages: $1200 - $240 = $960. 

Now, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted cost of the two packages: $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To determine how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we need to calculate how many cookies she will eat in 30 days. 

Since Shannon eats 2 cookies a night, we multiply the number of cookies she eats per night by the number of nights in 30 days. 

There are 30 nights in 30 days. 

2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies

Since Shannon's recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies she needs by 12 to find out how many dozens she needs to make.

60 cookies / 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozen cookies

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozen cookies to have enough for 30 days. 

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. 

First, let's find the number of candles that smell like wet dog. Since 5% of the candles have this defect, we can calculate it as follows:

Number of candles that smell like wet dog = Total number of candles * Percentage of candles with the defect
= 50000 * 0.05
= 2500

Now, we need to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. Since the candles that explode are guaranteed to be 99% safe, it means 1% of the candles can explode. However, we are not given the total number of candles that can explode. We are only given the percentage of candles that are guaranteed not to explode. 

To find the number of candles that can explode, we can calculate the number of candles that are guaranteed not to explode and subtract it from the total number of candles:

Number of candles that are guaranteed not to explode = Total number of candles * Percentage of candles that are guaranteed not to explode
= 50000 * 0.99
= 49500

Now, we can find the number of candles that can explode by subtracting the number of candles that are guaranteed not to explode from the total number of candles:

Number of candles that can explode = Total number of candles - Number of candles that are guaranteed not to explode
= 50000 - 49500
= 500

However, we are not given the percentage of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. We only know that 5% of the candles that can explode smell like wet dog. 

Let's assume the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is x. Then, the number of candles that can explode and smell like wet dog is 5% of the number of candles that can explode:

x = Number of candles that can explode * 0.05
x = 500 * 0.05
x = 25

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses is 4 * $14 = $56.

The final answer is: $56"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so her sister gathers 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.
- Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees as she does from the tallest trees, so she gathers 30 / 2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees.
- Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so her sister gathers 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.
- The combined total of apples gathered from the tallest and shortest trees is 30 + 60 + 15 + 45 = 150 apples.
- Since the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, the number of apples gathered from the average trees is 500 - 150 = 350 apples.
- Since Joanne gathers some apples from the average trees, we need to find out how many apples she gathered from the average trees. Let's denote the number of apples she gathered from the average trees as x.
- The total number of apples gathered by Joanne is 30 (from the tallest trees) + 15 (from the shortest trees) + x (from the average trees) = 45 + x.
- The total number of apples gathered by her sister is 60 (from the tallest trees) + 45 (from the shortest trees) = 105 apples.
- The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, so 45 + x + 105 = 500.
- Solving for x, we get x = 500 - 150 = 350.

However, this is the total number of apples gathered from the average trees by both sisters. Since the problem asks for the number of apples gathered by Joanne from the average trees, we need to find out how many apples she gathered from the average trees. Let's denote the number of apples she gathered from the average trees as y.
- The total number of apples gathered by Joanne from the average trees is y.
- The total number of apples gathered by her sister from the average trees is 350 - y.
- The combined total of apples gathered from the average trees is 350, so y + (350 - y) = 350.
- Solving for y, we get y = 350 - y, which is a contradiction. This means that the previous equation was incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the problem.
- The total number of apples gathered by Joanne is 30 (from the tallest trees) + 15 (from the shortest trees) + y (from the average trees) = 45 + y.
- The total number of apples gathered by her sister is 60 (from the tallest trees) + 45 (from the shortest trees) = 105 apples.
- The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, so 45 + y + 105 = 500.
- Solving for y, we get y = 500 - 150 = 350.

However, this is the total number of apples gathered from the average trees by both sisters. Since the problem asks for the number of apples gathered by Joanne from the average trees, we need to find out how many apples she gathered from the average trees. Let's denote the number of apples she gathered from the average trees as y.
- The total number of apples gathered by Joanne from the average trees is y.
- The total number of apples gathered by her sister from the average trees is 0 (since she doesn't take any from the average trees).
- The combined total of apples gathered from the average trees is 350, so y + 0 = 350.
- Solving for y, we get y = 350.

The final answer is: 350"
"Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D. We know that camels have two humps each and dromedaries have one hump each. 

We are given two pieces of information: 
1. The total number of heads is 180. Since each animal has one head, we can write this as C + D = 180.
2. The total number of bumps is 304. Since camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump, we can write this as 2C + D = 304.

Now, we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve this system by subtracting the first equation from the second equation to eliminate D.

2C + D - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find the number of dromedaries.

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

The final answer is: 56"
"To find the total distance traveled by Tom, we need to break down the information given.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day. So, the total distance covered in the first 4 days is 4 * 200 = 800 kilometers.

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. 30% of 800 kilometers is 0.3 * 800 = 240 kilometers. So, the total distance covered in the next two days is 240 kilometers.

On the next day, he wasn't traveling at all, so the distance covered is 0 kilometers.

During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total distance covered in the second week is 7 * 300 = 2100 kilometers.

Now, let's add up the distances covered in each period: 
- First 4 days: 800 kilometers
- Next two days: 240 kilometers
- Next day: 0 kilometers
- Second week: 2100 kilometers

Total distance = 800 + 240 + 0 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.

The final answer is: 3140"
"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to work backwards from Peter's locker size. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, Zack's locker must be 4 times as big as Peter's locker. 

Given that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, Zack's locker is 4 * 5 = 20 cubic inches.

Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, Timothy's locker must be twice as big as Zack's locker. 

So, Timothy's locker is 2 * 20 = 40 cubic inches.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the elevation where Stanley's comb fell, we need to subtract the distance it fell from Stanley's initial elevation. 

Stanley's initial elevation: 10,000 feet
Distance the comb fell: 4,000 feet
Elevation where the comb fell: 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet

Now, we need to find the difference between the elevation where the comb fell and Oliver's elevation to determine how much Oliver needs to climb.

Elevation where the comb fell: 6,000 feet
Oliver's elevation: 3,000 feet
Distance Oliver must climb: 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet

The final answer is: 3000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we know that the first bank gave Mr. Josue $4000. 

The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, so the second bank gave him 2 * $4000 = $8000.

Now, let's add the money from both banks to the initial capital: $4000 + $8000 = $12,000.

Adding this to the initial capital of $5000, we get: $12,000 + $5000 = $17,000.

So, Mr. Josue now has $17,000 in capital.

The final answer is: $17,000."
"To find the number of cats left on the rock, we first need to determine the number of cats taken away by the boats and then subtract that from the initial number of cats. 

Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each. So, the total number of cats taken away by the boats is 4 * 5 = 20.

Now, we subtract the number of cats taken away from the initial number of cats: 50 - 20 = 30.

After the boats left, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find the number of cats that ran after the mouse, we multiply the remaining cats by 3/5: 30 * (3/5) = 18.

Now, we subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats: 30 - 18 = 12.

The final number of cats left on the rock is 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into the different periods and calculate the cost for each period.

The first 6 months cost $8 per month, so the total cost for the first 6 months is:
6 months * $8/month = $48

The next 8 months cost $12 per month, so the total cost for the next 8 months is:
8 months * $12/month = $96

After that, the price increased to $14 per month. Since 2 years is 24 months, and we've already accounted for 14 months, there are 10 months left in the 2-year period at the new price. The total cost for the remaining 10 months is:
10 months * $14/month = $140

Now, let's add up the costs for all the periods:
$48 (first 6 months) + $96 (next 8 months) + $140 (remaining 10 months) = $284

The total cost for 2 years of the service is $284.

The final answer is: $284"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let the cost of the jogger jeans be x. Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, the cost of the tattered jeans is x + $6.

The total savings is $6, and Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. This means that 1/3 of the total savings is from the jogger jeans, and 2/3 of the total savings is from the tattered jeans.

We can set up the equation: (1/3) * (x - (x + 6)) + (2/3) * (x + 6 - 28) = 6

Simplifying the equation, we get: (1/3) * (-6) + (2/3) * (x - 22) = 6

Multiplying both sides by 3, we get: -6 + 2(x - 22) = 18

Expanding the equation, we get: -6 + 2x - 44 = 18

Combine like terms: 2x - 50 = 18

Add 50 to both sides: 2x = 68

Divide both sides by 2: x = 34

The jogger jeans cost $34, and the tattered jeans cost $40. The difference in cost is $40 - $34 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To find the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and then add them together.

The capacity of the 4 buses is 4 x 60 = 240 employees.
The capacity of the 6 minibusses is 6 x 30 = 180 employees.
The capacity of the 10 minivans is 10 x 15 = 150 employees.

Now, we add the capacities together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of birds that visit the bird feeders each day. 

First, let's find the number of birds that visit the store-bought bird feeders. Since there are 3 store-bought bird feeders and each attracts 20 birds, the total number of birds visiting the store-bought bird feeders is 3 * 20 = 60.

Next, let's find the number of birds that visit the bird feeders Lillian made herself. Since there are 3 homemade bird feeders and each attracts 20 + 10 = 30 birds, the total number of birds visiting the homemade bird feeders is 3 * 30 = 90.

Now, we add the number of birds visiting the store-bought bird feeders and the homemade bird feeders to find the total number of birds visiting the garden each day. Total birds = 60 + 90 = 150.

"To find the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The bagel costs $4. 
The soup costs 25% more than the bagel, which is 4 + (4 * 0.25) = 4 + 1 = $5.
The cake costs half the price of the bagel, which is 4 / 2 = $2.

Now, let's add the costs of all the items together: 
4 (bagel) + 5 (soup) + 2 (cake) = 11.

The total cost of Aleksandra's dinner is $11.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cards Kenny sold to get the remaining $50. Since he sold the cards for $1.5 each, we can divide the remaining money by the price per card to find the number of cards sold.

Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as 'x'. Since he kept 1/3 of the cards, he sold 2/3 of the cards. The number of cards sold is 2/3 * x.

The money he got from selling the cards is equal to the number of cards sold multiplied by the price per card, which is $1.5. So, the equation becomes:

2/3 * x * $1.5 = $50

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3/2 to get:

x * $1.5 = $50 * 3/2

x * $1.5 = $75

Now, we can divide both sides by $1.5 to find x:

x = $75 / $1.5

x = 50

So, Kenny started with 50 cards.

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, the caterer prepared enough hot dogs for half of the guests to have two hot dogs. Since there are 36 guests, half of them would be 36 / 2 = 18. So, the caterer prepared enough hot dogs for 18 guests to have two hot dogs each.

This means the caterer prepared 18 * 2 = 36 hot dogs for the first 18 guests. However, since the caterer prepared enough for 18 guests to have two hot dogs, the total number of hot dogs prepared is 36.

Now, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hot dog. This means that the 18 guests who were initially supposed to have two hot dogs got their second hot dog, and the remaining 22 guests (40 - 18 = 22) also got a second hot dog.

However, the caterer only prepared 36 hot dogs. Since 18 guests got two hot dogs each, that's 36 hot dogs. The remaining 22 guests also got a second hot dog, but there are not enough hot dogs for them.

Since there are 36 hot dogs, and 18 guests got two hot dogs each, that's 36 hot dogs. The remaining 18 hot dogs are for the 22 guests who also got a second hot dog. This means that 18 out of the 22 guests who got a second hot dog did not get a second hot dog because there were not enough hot dogs.

The number of guests who did not get a second hot dog is 18.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the number of letters in Indras' sister's name, we first need to find half of the letters in Indras' name. 

Half of the letters in Indras' name is 6 / 2 = 3. 

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name, so it has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

The total number of letters in both names is 6 (Indras) + 7 (her sister) = 13.

The final answer is: 13"
"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the total cost of the items before the discount and then apply the 20% discount.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- The set of pot and pans costs $120.00
- The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00
- 5 separate utensils at $5.00 each will cost 5 x $5.00 = $25.00

The total cost of the items before the discount is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

Now, let's apply the 20% discount to the total cost:

20% of $165.00 is 0.20 x $165.00 = $33.00

The discount amount is $33.00, so we subtract this from the total cost:

$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

The final cost of Charlotte's order is $132.00.

The final answer is: $132.00"
"To find out how much more money Dora needs, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy and subtract the amount of money she already has.

The total cost of the items is: $6 (skipping rope) + $11 (board game) + $2 (playground ball) = $19.

Dora has $2 from her allowance and $16 from her mother, so she has a total of $2 + $16 = $18.

To find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost: $19 - $18 = $1.

Therefore, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball.

"To find out how many dragons Prince Bruce slew, we need to first determine how many dragons Prince Arthur and Prince Walter slew. 

Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, who slew 100 dragons. Three quarters of 100 is 75. 

Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so he slew 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.

Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so he slew 150 / 5 = 30 dragons.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we first need to determine how much gas was in each container. Since 15 gallons were equally divided into 5 containers, we can divide 15 by 5 to find the amount in each container.

15 gallons / 5 containers = 3 gallons per container

Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we can convert the 3 gallons to pints by multiplying 3 by 8.

3 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 24 pints

Josey needed 1/4 of a container, so we need to find 1/4 of 24 pints.

1/4 * 24 pints = 6 pints

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money George had left after buying the chips. Since he had 1% of his money left, that means he spent 99% of his money. 

Let's assume George had x dollars initially. Then, 99% of x is the amount he spent on chips and candy bars. We know that he spent $5, so we can set up the equation:

0.99x = 5

To find x, we can divide both sides by 0.99:

x = 5 / 0.99
x = 5.05

So George had $5.05 initially. 

Now, let's find out how much he spent on chips. Each bag of chips costs 40 cents, or $0.40. He bought 3 bags, so the total cost of chips is:

3 * 0.40 = 1.20

Now, let's subtract the cost of chips from the total amount he spent to find out how much he spent on candy bars:

5 - 1.20 = 3.80

Each candy bar costs 75 cents, or $0.75. To find out how many candy bars he bought, we can divide the total amount he spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar:

3.80 / 0.75 = 5.07

Since we can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can see that 5 candy bars would cost 3.75, and 6 candy bars would cost 4.50. Since 3.80 is between these two values, George must have bought 6 candy bars.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how many lollipops each of Ray's friends received, we need to first determine how many lollipops he shared with his friends. 

Ray had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself, so he shared 25 - 5 = 20 lollipops with his friends.

Since he shared the lollipops equally among his four friends, we need to divide the total number of lollipops shared (20) by the number of friends (4).

20 ÷ 4 = 5

So, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the remaining weight of the cake, we first need to determine how much of the cake was eaten. Since Rory and her mom each had a piece, that's 2 pieces in total. 

The cake was cut into 8 pieces, and 2 pieces were eaten. To find the weight of the eaten pieces, we need to divide the total weight of the cake by the number of pieces it was cut into, then multiply by the number of pieces eaten.

Weight of the cake: 20 ounces
Number of pieces cut: 8
Number of pieces eaten: 2

Weight per piece = Total weight / Number of pieces = 20 / 8 = 2.5 ounces per piece
Weight of eaten pieces = Weight per piece * Number of pieces eaten = 2.5 * 2 = 5 ounces

Now, to find the remaining weight of the cake, we subtract the weight of the eaten pieces from the total weight of the cake.

Remaining weight = Total weight - Weight of eaten pieces = 20 - 5 = 15 ounces

The remaining cake weighs 15 ounces."
"To find out how many oranges each person will get, we need to first calculate the total number of oranges Sitti and Juris have. 

Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges. 

Total oranges = 34 + 22 = 56

Since they are sharing the oranges with 6 other friends, including themselves, the total number of people sharing the oranges is 8 (Sitti, Juris, and 6 friends).

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people.

Oranges per person = Total oranges / Total people
= 56 / 8
= 7

So, everyone will get 7 oranges. 

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the cost per serving, we first need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients. 

Antoine wants to double the amount of onions, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The cost of onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, which costs 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

Since the soup serves 6 people, the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how long it takes Bernadette to get to the theater and then determine how much earlier she needs to leave than Wayne.

Since it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, and Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's, we can calculate Bernadette's drive time as 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, so she needs to leave 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, Bernadette needs to leave 4 - 5 = -1 minutes before Wayne. However, since time cannot be negative, this means Bernadette needs to leave 1 minute after Wayne to arrive 5 minutes before him.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 1 minute after Wayne to get to the theater first.

"To find the perimeter of Billie's room, we first need to find the width of the room. Since we know the area and the length, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle: Area = Length * Width.

Given that the area is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. There are 3 feet in a yard, so 3 yards is equal to 3 * 3 = 9 feet.

Now we can plug in the values into the area formula: 360 = 9 * Width. To find the width, we can divide both sides of the equation by 9: Width = 360 / 9 = 40 feet.

Now that we have the width, we can find the perimeter of the room using the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width). Plugging in the values, we get: Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40) = 2 * 49 = 98 feet.

The final answer is: 98"
"To find out how many beads each sister has, we need to calculate the total number of beads they bought. 

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has 1 * 20 + 2 * 20 = 20 + 40 = 60 beads.

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has 3 * 20 + 4 * 20 = 60 + 80 = 140 beads.

Now, we need to find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth. To do this, we subtract the number of beads Elizabeth has from the number of beads Margareth has: 140 - 60 = 80.

"To find the final temperature of the house, we need to calculate the temperature increase due to the oven and the temperature decrease due to the open window.

First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to the oven. The oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour, and Marcus bakes for 3 hours. So, the total temperature increase is 5 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 15 degrees.

Now, let's calculate the temperature decrease due to the open window. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Since the window is open for 30 minutes, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are there in 30 minutes. 30 minutes / 10 minutes = 3 intervals. So, the total temperature decrease is 2 degrees/interval * 3 intervals = 6 degrees.

Now, let's subtract the temperature decrease from the temperature increase: 15 degrees (increase) - 6 degrees (decrease) = 9 degrees.

The initial temperature of the house was 40 degrees. So, the final temperature is 40 degrees + 9 degrees = 49 degrees.

The final answer is: 49"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it took James to complete each segment of the triathlon. 

Let's start with the swim. Since James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon, and Jon took 40 minutes, we can calculate James' swim time as follows:

James' swim time = Jon's swim time - (10% of Jon's swim time)
= 40 - (0.1 * 40)
= 40 - 4
= 36 minutes

Next, we know that James took 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. Since Jon took 1 hour and 20 minutes (or 80 minutes) for the bike ride, we can calculate James' bike time as follows:

James' bike time = Jon's bike time + 5 minutes
= 80 + 5
= 85 minutes

Now, let's find out how long it took Jon to complete the triathlon. We know that Jon took 40 minutes for the swim, 80 minutes for the bike ride, and 50 minutes for the run. So, the total time it took Jon to complete the triathlon is:

Jon's total time = 40 + 80 + 50
= 170 minutes

We are given that Jon won by 10 minutes, which means James took 10 minutes longer than Jon to complete the triathlon. Therefore, James' total time is:

James' total time = Jon's total time + 10 minutes
= 170 + 10
= 180 minutes

Now, we can find out how long it took James to complete the run by subtracting his swim and bike times from his total time:

James' run time = James' total time - James' swim time - James' bike time
= 180 - 36 - 85
= 59 minutes

"To find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay, we need to calculate the total cost of the hay and subtract it from the amount of money he has.

First, let's find out how many miles the horse runs in 30 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 30 minutes is half an hour. 

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 32 MPH * 0.5 hours
Distance = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile, and it ran 16 miles, the total hay consumed is:
Total Hay = 16 miles * 1/2 bail/mile
Total Hay = 8 bails

Each bail costs $3, so the total cost of the hay is:
Total Cost = 8 bails * $3/bail
Total Cost = $24

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of:
Total Money = 6 * $5
Total Money = $30

Now, let's find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay:
Change = Total Money - Total Cost
Change = $30 - $24
Change = $6

"To find out how many eggs Rozanne has in total, we need to calculate the number of eggs from the cases and the loose eggs separately. 

4 dozen eggs is equal to 4 x 12 = 48 eggs. 
Adding the 2 loose eggs, Rozanne has a total of 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Since each glass needs 5 eggs, we can divide the total number of eggs by 5 to find out how many glasses of eggnog Rozanne can make. 
50 eggs / 5 eggs per glass = 10 glasses.

Each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog, so we can divide the total number of glasses by 5 to find out how many trays Rozanne can put out. 
10 glasses / 5 glasses per tray = 2 trays.

"To find the salesman's profit, we first need to calculate the total revenue from the flash sale and the sales to the department store.

The salesman sold 17 sneakers at $20 each during the flash sale, so the revenue from the flash sale is:
17 * $20 = $340

The salesman sold the remaining 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers to the department store at $25 each. The revenue from the sales to the department store is:
31 * $25 = $775

The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from the flash sale and the sales to the department store:
$340 + $775 = $1115

The cost of the case of 48 sneakers is $576. To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the total revenue:
$1115 - $576 = $539

The salesman's profit is $539.

"To find the total number of crayons Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the total number of crayons in the six packets with eight pieces each and the four packets with sixteen pieces each.

First, let's calculate the total number of crayons in the six packets with eight pieces each:
6 packets * 8 crayons/packet = 48 crayons

Next, let's calculate the total number of crayons in the four packets with sixteen pieces each:
4 packets * 16 crayons/packet = 64 crayons

Now, we add the total number of crayons from both types of packets to find the overall total:
48 crayons + 64 crayons = 112 crayons

The final answer is: 112"
"Let's break down the information given. 

If you buy a super ticket for $20, you get one popcorn and a soda for $1 extra. This means the total cost for the super ticket, popcorn, and soda is $20 + $1 = $21. 

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the cost of the movie ticket, popcorn, and soda without the super ticket is $21 - $2 = $19.

The cost of the movie ticket is $12. So, the cost of the popcorn and soda without the super ticket is $19 - $12 = $7.

The cost of the soda is $3. So, the cost of the popcorn is $7 - $3 = $4.

The final answer is: $4"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the cost of filling one balloon before the price increase. 

Let's denote the original cost of filling one balloon as 'x'. Since the total cost of filling 20 balloons was $900, we can set up the equation:

20x = 900

To find the value of 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 20:

x = 900 / 20
x = 45

So, the original cost of filling one balloon was $45.

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost of filling one balloon is:

New cost = Original cost + Increase
New cost = 45 + 20
New cost = 65

Now, we need to find the total cost of filling 170 balloons at the new rate:

Total cost = New cost per balloon * Number of balloons
Total cost = 65 * 170
Total cost = 11050

The final answer is: 11050"
"To find the average speed of the car during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled at 60 mph for 2 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 60 mph x 2 hours
Distance = 120 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled at 30 mph for 1 hour:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 30 mph x 1 hour
Distance = 30 miles

Now, let's find the total distance traveled:
Total Distance = 120 miles + 30 miles
Total Distance = 150 miles

The total time taken for the trip is 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours.

To find the average speed, we divide the total distance by the total time:
Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
Average Speed = 150 miles / 3 hours
Average Speed = 50 mph

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total value of Jenna's jewels, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires and rubies separately and then add them together.

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. Each sapphire is worth $800, so the total value of her sapphires is 8 * $800 = $6400.

Jenna trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. This means she now has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left. 

The value of the 3 sapphires she traded is 3 * $800 = $2400. 

Since she traded 3 sapphires for 2 rubies, the value of the 2 rubies is also $2400.

Now, we need to find the total value of her jewels. The value of the sapphires is $6400, and the value of the rubies is $2400. 

The total value of her jewels is $6400 + $2400 = $8800.

The final answer is: $8800"
"To find the total number of apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of apples they eat per day and then multiply it by 30.

Marin and Nancy each eat 4 apples a day. So together, they eat 4 + 4 = 8 apples per day.

Now, we multiply the total number of apples they eat per day by 30 to find the total number of apples they eat in 30 days: 8 * 30 = 240.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the total volume of soil needed, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed and then multiply it by the number of beds. 

The volume of one raised bed is calculated as length * width * height. 
Volume = 2 feet * 8 feet * 2 feet = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:
Total Volume = 32 cubic feet/bed * 10 beds = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. To find the number of bags needed, we divide the total volume by the volume of one bag:
Number of bags = Total Volume / Volume per bag = 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet/bag = 160 bags.

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:
Total Cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag = 160 bags * $12/bag = $1920.

The final answer is: $1920"
"To find the total number of cards, we first need to determine the number of green cards. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:

Number of red cards = 15
60% of red cards = 0.6 * 15 = 9
Number of green cards = 15 + 9 = 24

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards:
Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
= 15 + 24
= 39

To find the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards:
Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
= 15 + 24 + 39
= 78

The final answer is: 78"
"To find the number of fairies remaining, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies.

After 20 minutes, one of her friends saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the fairies that were there. This means her friend saw 50 / 2 = 25 fairies. So, the total number of fairies now is 50 + 25 = 75.

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. To find the remaining number of fairies, we subtract 30 from 75: 75 - 30 = 45.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the total number of puppies, we need to add the number of puppies Jennifer's dog has to the number of puppies Brandon's dog has. 

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies. 
Total number of puppies = 8 + 12 = 20

Next, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots. Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots. 
Total number of puppies with spots = 3 + 4 = 7

Now, we can find the percentage of puppies with spots by dividing the total number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

The final answer is: 35"
"To find the total weight of the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and add them together.

The farmer buys 2 boxes of sugar cubes, each weighing 1 pound, so the total weight of sugar cubes is 2 * 1 = 2 pounds.

The farmer buys 4 bags of carrots, each weighing 12 pounds, so the total weight of carrots is 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.

The farmer buys 42 bales of hay, each weighing 75 pounds, so the total weight of hay is 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.

The farmer buys 20 sacks of oats, each weighing 65 pounds, so the total weight of oats is 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

The total weight of all the feed is 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3400 pounds.

Since the farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, we need to divide the total weight of the feed by the truck's capacity to find the number of trips needed.

3400 / 2250 = 1.511 (round up to the nearest whole number since we can't make a fraction of a trip)

So, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To find out how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate the total earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the earnings from aluminum cans. Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans a week, and each can is worth 2 cents. So, her weekly earnings from aluminum cans are 3 cans/week * 2 cents/can = 6 cents/week. 

For a four-week month, her earnings from aluminum cans would be 6 cents/week * 4 weeks = 24 cents.

Next, let's calculate the earnings from plastic bottles. Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles a week, and each bottle is worth 3 cents. So, her weekly earnings from plastic bottles are 5 bottles/week * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents/week.

For a four-week month, her earnings from plastic bottles would be 15 cents/week * 4 weeks = 60 cents.

Now, let's add the earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles together. 24 cents (aluminum cans) + 60 cents (plastic bottles) = 84 cents.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find out how many plants Shondra has, we need to first determine how many plants Toni has. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, and Frederick has 10 plants, we can calculate Toni's plants as follows:

Toni's plants = Frederick's plants + (60% of Frederick's plants)
Toni's plants = 10 + (0.6 * 10)
Toni's plants = 10 + 6
Toni's plants = 16

Now that we know Toni has 16 plants, we can find out how many plants Shondra has. Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni, so:

Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
Shondra's plants = 16 - 7
Shondra's plants = 9

"To find out how many students Miss Maria has, we first need to calculate the total number of cards she has. 

She has 6 decks of basketball cards with 25 cards in each deck, so the total number of basketball cards is 6 * 25 = 150.

She has 5 boxes of baseball cards with 40 cards in each box, so the total number of baseball cards is 5 * 40 = 200.

The total number of cards is the sum of basketball and baseball cards, which is 150 + 200 = 350.

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so the remaining cards are 350 - 50 = 300.

If her students got 10 cards each, the number of students can be found by dividing the remaining cards by 10. 

300 / 10 = 30

"Let's break down the problem. Let's say the number of carrot sticks Matt eats is 'x'. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, which is x/2. He also gets two extra cookies for cleaning his room. So, the total number of cookies he gets is x/2 + 2.

We are given that Matt wants to eat five cookies in total. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x/2 + 2 = 5.

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. First, subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: x/2 = 5 - 2, which simplifies to x/2 = 3.

Next, multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction: x = 3 * 2.

x = 6

"To find the combined length of the remoras, we need to convert their individual lengths to feet and then add them together. 

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 6 inches to feet by dividing by 12. 

6 inches / 12 = 0.5 feet

Since there are two remoras, we multiply the length of one remora by 2.

0.5 feet * 2 = 1 foot

Now, we add the length of the remoras to the length of the shark.

10 feet (shark) + 1 foot (remoras) = 11 feet

To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy, we divide the combined length of the remoras by the length of the shark and multiply by 100.

(1 foot / 10 feet) * 100 = 10%

"To find out how many books each child got, we need to first determine the total number of books Sarah bought. Since each book costs $15 and she spent $300, we can divide the total amount spent by the cost of each book.

Total amount spent = $300
Cost of each book = $15

Total number of books = Total amount spent / Cost of each book
Total number of books = $300 / $15
Total number of books = 20

Since Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, we can divide the total number of books by 4 to find out how many books each child got.

Number of books per child = Total number of books / 4
Number of books per child = 20 / 4
Number of books per child = 5

"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we need to first find the total number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts. 

We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find this. The formula is Total = A + B - Both, where A is the number of kids allergic to dairy, B is the number of kids allergic to peanuts, and Both is the number of kids allergic to both.

A = 9 (kids allergic to dairy)
B = 6 (kids allergic to peanuts)
Both = 3 (kids allergic to both)

Total = A + B - Both
Total = 9 + 6 - 3
Total = 12

However, this is the number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts. To find the number of kids allergic to at least one of these, we need to subtract the number of kids allergic to both from the total number of kids allergic to either. 

Number of kids allergic to at least one = Total
Number of kids allergic to at least one = 12

Now, to find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids allergic to at least one from the total number of kids in the class.

Now, let's divide the sum by 3:
-30 / 3 = -10

The average highest temperature of the three countries is -10 degrees Fahrenheit."
"To find out how many days it will take for the child to save the remaining amount, we need to first calculate the remaining amount he needs to save. 

The toy costs $12, and he already has $4. So, the remaining amount he needs to save is $12 - $4 = $8.

He promises to save $2 daily from his allowance. To find out how many days it will take to save $8, we can divide the remaining amount by the daily savings.

$8 / $2 = 4

So, it will take the child 4 days to save the remaining amount of money. 

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many eggs Jaime won't be able to place on the tray, we need to calculate the total number of eggs that can fit on the 2 trays and subtract that from the total number of eggs he has.

Each tray can hold 24 eggs, and Jaime has 2 trays, so the total number of eggs that can fit on the trays is 24 * 2 = 48.

Jaime has 64 eggs, and 48 can fit on the trays, so the number of eggs that won't fit is 64 - 48 = 16.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total amount Sally spent, we need to calculate the cost of the family-size pizza first. Since it costs 3 times as much as the small pizza, we multiply the cost of the small pizza by 3.

Cost of small pizza: $8
Cost of family-size pizza: $8 * 3 = $24

Now, we add the cost of the small pizza and the family-size pizza to find the total amount spent.

Total amount spent: $8 + $24 = $32

The final answer is: $32"
"To find the cost per individual razor after the discount, we need to first calculate the total cost of 2 packs of razors with the sale and the coupon.

Since the razors are buy one get one free, Heather will only pay for 1 pack of razors. The cost of 1 pack is $4.00. 

Heather also has a $2.00 coupon, so she will get a discount of $2.00.

The total cost of 1 pack of razors with the coupon is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since there are 4 razors in a pack, the cost per individual razor is $2.00 / 4 = $0.50.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.50 * 100 = 50 cents.

Since Heather buys 2 packs, the total number of razors is 2 * 4 = 8.

The cost per individual razor after the discount is 50 cents.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total height of the human pyramid, we need to calculate the height of each level and add them up.

The 4 girls on the bottom are 64"" tall each. 
4 * 64"" = 256""

The 3 girls on top of the 4 are also 64"" tall each. 
3 * 64"" = 192""

The 2 girls on top of the 3 are also 64"" tall each. 
2 * 64"" = 128""

The shortest girl at the top is 60"" tall.

Now, we add up the heights of all the levels:
256"" + 192"" + 128"" + 60"" = 576""

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches):
576"" / 12 = 48 feet

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the total number of minutes Charisma walked, we need to calculate the total number of 5-minute breaks she took in a day and then multiply it by the number of days she worked.

Charisma works 8 hours a day and takes a 5-minute break every hour. So, she takes 8 breaks per day. 

8 breaks per day * 5 minutes per break = 40 minutes per day

Since Charisma worked for 5 days, we multiply the daily breaks by the number of days:

40 minutes per day * 5 days = 200 minutes

The final answer is: 200"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how old Brett will be in four years. Since Brett is currently 14 years old, in four years he will be 14 + 4 = 18 years old.

According to the problem, in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. Since Brett is 14 years old now, three times that is 3 * 14 = 42 years old.

Since Angela will be 42 years old in four years, we need to subtract 4 from 42 to find out how old Angela is now. So, Angela's current age is 42 - 4 = 38 years old.

The final answer is: 38"
"To find the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car, we need to calculate the cost of the morning rides and the cost of the afternoon rides separately and then add them together.

The cost of the morning rides is the cost per ride multiplied by the number of rides. Since Paul drives twice a day for 14 days, he drives a total of 2 * 14 = 28 rides in the morning. The cost per ride is $6, so the total cost of the morning rides is 28 * $6 = $168.

The cost of the afternoon rides is also the cost per ride multiplied by the number of rides. Since Paul drives twice a day for 14 days, he drives a total of 2 * 14 = 28 rides in the afternoon. The cost per ride is $2, so the total cost of the afternoon rides is 28 * $2 = $56.

To find the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car, we add the cost of the morning rides and the cost of the afternoon rides together: $168 + $56 = $224.

The final answer is: $224"
"To find out how many Greek orange pies Brianne and Ashley can make, we need to calculate the total number of oranges they have and then divide that by the number of oranges needed for one pie.

Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so she has 5 * 10 = 50 oranges.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so she has 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

In total, they have 50 + 70 = 120 oranges.

Since one Greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, we can divide the total number of oranges by 3 to find out how many pies they can make: 120 / 3 = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's break down the costs for each venue. 

For the first venue, the cost is a flat fee of $200, plus $5 per guest. If there are x guests, the total cost for the first venue is $200 + $5x.

For the second venue, the cost is $25 per guest. If there are x guests, the total cost for the second venue is $25x.

Since we want the two venues to be equal in cost, we can set up the equation:

$200 + $5x = $25x

To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting $5x from both sides:

$200 = $20x

Now, we can divide both sides by $20 to solve for x:

x = $200 / $20
x = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's denote the number of insects David found as D, the number of insects Bodhi found as B, and the number of insects Lily found as L. 

We know that Lily found 7 more than David, so we can write an equation: L = D + 7.

We also know that David found half of what Bodhi found, so we can write another equation: D = B/2.

We are also given that together they collected 43 insects, so the sum of the insects they found is L + D + B = 43.

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the third equation: (D + 7) + D + B = 43.

Combine like terms: 2D + B + 7 = 43.

Subtract 7 from both sides: 2D + B = 36.

Now, substitute the second equation into the new equation: 2(D) + B = 36, 2(B/2) + B = 36.

Simplify the equation: B + B = 36.

Combine like terms: 2B = 36.

Divide both sides by 2: B = 18.

Now that we know B, we can find D: D = B/2 = 18/2 = 9.

Now that we know D, we can find L: L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total yards of yarn used, we need to calculate the yards used by Mariah and her grandma separately and then add them together.

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, and there are 364 yards in a skein. To find 1/4 of 364, we multiply 364 by 1/4 (which is the same as dividing by 4).

364 yards / 4 = 91 yards

So, Mariah used 91 yards of yarn.

Mariah's grandma used 1/2 of a skein, which is the same as 2/4. To find 2/4 of 364, we multiply 364 by 2 and then divide by 4.

364 * 2 = 728
728 / 4 = 182 yards

So, Mariah's grandma used 182 yards of yarn.

Now, let's add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma together.

91 yards (Mariah) + 182 yards (grandma) = 273 yards

The final answer is: 273"
"To find the total number of gifts Cherrie bought, we need to calculate the number of gifts for her friends and add the 10 random gifts.

First, let's calculate the number of gifts for her friends. 2 friends want 5 gifts each, so that's 2 x 5 = 10 gifts. The other 3 friends want 2 gifts each, so that's 3 x 2 = 6 gifts. 

Now, let's add the gifts for her friends: 10 + 6 = 16 gifts.

Finally, we add the 10 random gifts: 16 + 10 = 26 gifts.

The total number of gifts Cherrie bought is 26."
"To find the length of the couch, we first need to find the width of the rug. Since the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, and the chair is 3 feet wide, the rug's width is 3 + 5 = 8 feet.

The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Twice the width of the rug is 2 * 8 = 16 feet. Adding 2 feet to this gives us the length of the couch: 16 + 2 = 18 feet.

The final answer is: 18"
"Let's break down the information given. Suzie bought 4 packs of gum in total. She bought 2 packs of strawberry gum, 1 pack of grape gum for $2, and 1 pack of green apple gum for half the price of the grape gum.

Since the green apple gum costs half as much as the grape gum, and the grape gum costs $2, the green apple gum costs $2 / 2 = $1.

The total cost of the 4 packs of gum is $7. We know the cost of 3 packs: 2 packs of strawberry gum (unknown cost), 1 pack of grape gum ($2), and 1 pack of green apple gum ($1). 

Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as 'x'. The total cost equation is: 2x + 2 + 1 = 7.

Combine like terms: 2x + 3 = 7.

Subtract 3 from both sides: 2x = 4.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 2.

The cost of each pack of strawberry gum is $2."
"To find the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to determine which type of wood gives him the most sticks per dollar spent. 

First, let's calculate the cost per stick for each type of wood:

For a 2 x 4, Frederick can get 200 sticks for $4. 
Cost per stick = $4 / 200 sticks = $0.02 per stick

For a 2 x 8, Frederick can get 400 sticks for $6.
Cost per stick = $6 / 400 sticks = $0.015 per stick

Since the 2 x 8 costs less per stick, we should prioritize buying 2 x 8 lumber. 

Now, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces Frederick can buy with his $24:

Number of 2 x 8 pieces = $24 / $6 = 4

Since each 2 x 8 piece gives 400 sticks, the total number of sticks Frederick can make is:

Total sticks = 4 * 400 = 1600

However, we need to check if buying 2 x 4 pieces would give him more sticks. 

Number of 2 x 4 pieces = $24 / $4 = 6

Since each 2 x 4 piece gives 200 sticks, the total number of sticks Frederick can make is:

Total sticks = 6 * 200 = 1200

Comparing the two options, buying 2 x 8 pieces gives him more sticks. 

The final answer is: 1600"
"To find the total cost of snowshoes for Mario's dogs, we first need to determine the total number of snowshoes required. Since each dog has 4 legs and Mario has 6 dogs, the total number of legs is 6 * 4 = 24.

Since each dog needs a pair of snowshoes, and each pair covers 4 legs, we need to divide the total number of legs by 4 to get the total number of pairs of snowshoes required. However, since each dog needs a pair, we simply need to multiply the number of dogs by 2 (2 legs per dog * 6 dogs = 12 legs, but we need 2 snowshoes per dog, so 6 dogs * 2 snowshoes per dog = 12 snowshoes). 

The total number of snowshoes required is 6 * 2 = 12.

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of snowshoes by the cost per pair. The cost per pair is $12.00.

Total cost = 12 * $12.00 = $144.00

The final answer is: $144.00"
"To find out how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we first need to calculate how much she spends on bus trips in a week. 

Janet takes two bus trips a day, five days a week. So, the total number of bus trips in a week is 2 * 5 = 10 trips.

Each bus trip costs $2.20, so the total cost of bus trips in a week is 10 * $2.20 = $22.

If Janet buys a weekly bus pass for $20, she would save $22 - $20 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's break down the information given:

- The farm has 30 cows.
- The zoo has 20 sheep.
- The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does, so the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.
- The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.
- The zoo has 20 sheep and 60 cows, so the zoo has a total of 20 + 60 = 80 animals.
- The farm has 30 cows and 10 sheep, so the farm has a total of 30 + 10 = 40 animals.

To find the total number of animals in both the farm and the zoo, we add the number of animals in the farm and the zoo: 40 + 80 = 120.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find out how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we need to first determine the total number of items Rose bought. Since Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, the total number of items she bought is 12 + 4 = 16.

We are told that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought. Let's represent the number of items Sophia bought as 'x'. Then, the number of items Rose bought is 4x. We already know that Rose bought 16 items, so we can set up the equation 4x = 16.

To solve for 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 4: x = 16 / 4 = 4.

Since 'x' represents the number of items Sophia bought, and we know that Sophia bought a mix of onions and potatoes, we can assume that the ratio of onions to potatoes is the same as Rose's, which is 12:4 or 3:1. This means for every 3 onions, Sophia bought 1 potato. Since Sophia bought 4 items in total, she bought 3 onions and 1 potato.

The total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is 3 + 1 = 4."
"To determine the calorie deficit Andy needs each day, we first need to calculate the total number of days he has to reach his goal. 

Since Andy's birthday is on July 19th and today is December 31st, we can calculate the number of days as follows:

December has 31 days, January has 31 days, February has 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year), March has 31 days, April has 30 days, May has 31 days, June has 30 days, and July has 19 days. 

Total days = 31 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 201 days

Now, we know Andy wants to lose 30 pounds and that he needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound. 

Total calories to burn = 30 pounds * 3500 calories/pound = 105,000 calories

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories to burn by the total number of days:

Daily calorie deficit = Total calories to burn / Total days
= 105,000 calories / 201 days
= approximately 522 calories per day

So, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of approximately 522 calories to reach his goal. 

The final answer is: 522"
"To find out how much Gerald has left, we need to calculate his total earnings for the week and then subtract the amount he spent.

Gerald works 7 days a week, and he earns $30 per day. So, his total earnings for the week would be:

7 days * $30/day = $210

Gerald spent a total of $100. To find out how much he has left, we subtract the amount he spent from his total earnings:

$210 - $100 = $110

So, Gerald has $110 left."
"To find out how many milliliters of water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total distance she will run. Since each lap is 0.25 km and she needs to run 8 laps, we multiply the number of laps by the distance per lap.

Total distance = 8 laps * 0.25 km/lap = 2 km

Since Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs, we multiply the total distance by the amount of water needed per kilometer.

Total water needed = 2 km * 60 ml/km = 120 ml

Therefore, Hannah will need to drink 120 milliliters of water.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find out how much money Julie had left, we need to calculate the amount she spent on clothes and CDs, and then subtract that from the initial amount.

First, let's calculate the amount she spent on clothes: 20% of $500 is 0.20 x $500 = $100.

Now, let's subtract the amount spent on clothes from the initial amount: $500 - $100 = $400.

Next, let's calculate the amount she spent on CDs: 25% of $400 is 0.25 x $400 = $100.

Now, let's subtract the amount spent on CDs from the remaining amount: $400 - $100 = $300.

The final answer is: $300"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. We also know that the house cost three times as much as the lot. 

Let's represent the cost of the lot as 'x'. Since the house cost three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write the equation: x + 3x = 120,000.

Combine like terms: 4x = 120,000.

Divide both sides by 4: x = 30,000.

Since the cost of the lot is $30,000, the cost of the house is 3 times that, which is 3 * 30,000 = $90,000.

The final answer is: $90,000."
"To find the profit, we first need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

The total cost is the cost of the canvas bags, which is 8 packs * 5 bags per pack * $4 per bag = 8 * 5 * 4 = $160.

The total revenue is the selling price of the bags, which is 8 bags * $8 per bag = 8 * 8 = $64.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $64 - $160 = -$96.

However, since profit cannot be negative, it seems there might be an error in the given information. If the selling price is less than the cost, then Tara would have actually incurred a loss.

But if we assume that the question is asking for the profit in terms of the difference between the selling price and the cost, then the profit per bag is $8 - $4 = $4. The total profit would be 8 bags * $4 per bag = $32.

The final answer is: $32"
"To find the total number of punches Joe threw, we need to calculate the total time of the fight and multiply it by the average punches thrown per minute.

The fight lasts for 5 rounds of 3 minutes each, so the total time is 5 * 3 = 15 minutes.

"To find out how many cookies Kelsie made, we need to first determine how many cookies Josh made. Since Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, and Suzanne made 36 cookies, we can calculate Josh's cookies as follows:

Josh's cookies = Suzanne's cookies / 4
Josh's cookies = 36 / 4
Josh's cookies = 9

Now that we know Josh made 9 cookies, we can find out how many Kelsie made. Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh, so we can calculate Kelsie's cookies as follows:

Kelsie's cookies = 2 * Josh's cookies
Kelsie's cookies = 2 * 9
Kelsie's cookies = 18

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total amount of money Ali has. 

Ali has four $10 bills, which is 4 * $10 = $40. 
He also has six $20 bills, which is 6 * $20 = $120. 
The total amount of money Ali has is $40 + $120 = $160.

Ali gives his sister half of the total money, which is $160 / 2 = $80. 
So, the amount of money Ali has left after giving his sister half is $160 - $80 = $80.

Now, Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount of money to buy dinner. 
3/5 of $80 is (3/5) * $80 = $48.

The amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is $80 - $48 = $32.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it takes Rob to shingle a house in minutes. Since Rob takes 2 hours, we need to convert this to minutes. 

1 hour = 60 minutes
2 hours = 2 * 60 = 120 minutes

Now, we know that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time it takes Rob. Let's first find out what double the time it takes Rob is. 

Double the time it takes Rob = 2 * 120 = 240 minutes

Now, we add 40 minutes to this to find out how long it takes Royce.

"To find out how many math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday, we need to calculate the total number of problems he completed and subtract that from the initial total.

On Monday, Chris completed 12 problems. 
On Tuesday, he completed 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, which is 3 * 12 = 36 problems.
So, in total, Chris completed 12 + 36 = 48 problems on Monday and Tuesday.

The remaining problems after Monday and Tuesday are 100 - 48 = 52.

On Wednesday, Chris completed one-quarter of the remaining problems, which is 52 / 4 = 13 problems.

"To find the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Kathy, and Ricky can pick per hour, we need to calculate the number of quarts each of them can pick per hour and then add them together.

Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Bobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony, so Bobby can pick 6 - 1 = 5 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy can pick 2 * 5 = 10 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy, so Ricky can pick 10 - 2 = 8 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Now, let's add the number of quarts each of them can pick per hour: 6 (Tony) + 5 (Bobby) + 10 (Kathy) + 8 (Ricky) = 29 quarts.

"To find the number of rows of red tulips, we need to divide the total number of red tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row. 

36 red tulips / 6 tulips per row = 6 rows of red tulips

To find the number of rows of blue tulips, we need to divide the total number of blue tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row.

24 blue tulips / 8 tulips per row = 3 rows of blue tulips

Since we can't have a fraction of a row, we can't plant a partial row of flowers. However, we can plant the full rows of red and blue tulips separately. 

The total number of rows of flowers Jackson can plant is the sum of the rows of red and blue tulips.

6 rows of red tulips + 3 rows of blue tulips = 9 rows of flowers

"To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we first need to determine how many cups of raisins she has available for the oatmeal cookies. 

Since she divides the raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, we can divide the total number of cups of raisins by 3. 

Total cups of raisins = 27
Cups of raisins for oatmeal cookies = Total cups of raisins / 3
Cups of raisins for oatmeal cookies = 27 / 3
Cups of raisins for oatmeal cookies = 9

Now, we need to find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make with 9 cups of raisins. Each batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins. 

Number of batches = Cups of raisins for oatmeal cookies / Cups of raisins per batch
Number of batches = 9 / (3/4)
To divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal.
Number of batches = 9 * (4/3)
Number of batches = 12

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we first need to calculate her daily and weekly consumption before and after adding the new device.

Before adding the new device, Ada's daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. Since there are 24 hours in a day, her daily consumption in dollars is:
12 kilowatts/hour * $1.50/kilowatt/hour = $18/day

Her weekly consumption before adding the new device is:
$18/day * 7 days/week = $126/week

After adding the new device, her daily consumption will be:
12 kilowatts/hour + 2 kilowatts/hour = 14 kilowatts/hour

Her daily consumption in dollars after adding the new device is:
14 kilowatts/hour * $1.50/kilowatt/hour = $21/day

Her weekly consumption after adding the new device is:
$21/day * 7 days/week = $147/week

The difference in her weekly electric bill is:
$147/week - $126/week = $21/week

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how long it would take one person to paint a whole house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take them twice as long to paint a whole house, which is 10 days.

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can calculate the total hours it would take one person to paint a whole house by multiplying the number of days by 24:

10 days * 24 hours/day = 240 hours

Now, if 5 people are painting a whole house, we can divide the total hours it would take one person to paint a whole house by the number of people:

240 hours / 5 people = 48 hours

So, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

1. Ophelia has 20 sofas.
2. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so she has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.
4. Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Now, let's calculate the total number of sofas and chairs they have:

Ophelia's sofas: 20
Ophelia's chairs: 22
Jenna's sofas: 64
Jenna's chairs: 66

Total number of sofas: 20 + 64 = 84
Total number of chairs: 22 + 66 = 88

The total number of sofas and chairs is 84 + 88 = 172."
"To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought, we first need to determine the cost of the headphone set. 

Let's subtract the cost of the CD from the total amount Tom paid: $48 - $4 = $44. 

This is the cost of the headphone set. 

Now, we can find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with the money he saved by not buying the headphone set. 

The cost of one CD is $4. 

To find out how many CDs Tom could have bought, we divide the cost of the headphone set by the cost of one CD: $44 / $4 = 11.

So, Tom could have bought 11 more CDs if he had decided not to buy the headphone set.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we need to consider the different scenarios where he spent more or less time than the usual 4 hours per week.

In 6 weeks, Josh spent 4 hours per week. So, the total hours spent in these 6 weeks is 6 * 4 = 24 hours.

In 1 week, Josh spent 6 hours. 

In 1 week, Josh spent 5 hours for two consecutive weeks. So, the total hours spent in these 2 weeks is 2 * 5 = 10 hours.

Now, let's add up the total hours spent in all the weeks: 24 + 6 + 10 = 40 hours.

The total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is 40."
"To find the number of passengers after the second stop, we need to calculate the number of passengers at each step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is:
48 - 8 = 40

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get into the bus, which is 5 * 8 = 40. 
So, the total number of passengers after the first stop is:
40 (remaining) + 40 (new passengers) = 80

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is:
80 - 21 = 59

Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on, which means 1/3 of the number of passengers who got off (21) get on. 
1/3 of 21 is 7, so 7 passengers get on the bus.
The total number of passengers after the second stop is:
59 (remaining) + 7 (new passengers) = 66

The final answer is: 66"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, so his current age is 27 - 5 = 22 years.
2. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. 
   Jame's age in 8 years will be 22 + 8 = 30 years.
   Twice Jame's age in 8 years will be 2 * 30 = 60 years.
   So, Jame's cousin's age in 8 years will be 60 - 5 = 55 years.
3. Since Jame's cousin will be 55 in 8 years, his current age is 55 - 8 = 47 years.

Now, let's find the difference in their current ages: 47 (cousin's age) - 22 (Jame's age) = 25 years.

The final answer is: 25"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400.
2. The computer costs $1,100.
3. The printer costs $400 less than the computer.

First, let's find the cost of the printer. Since the printer costs $400 less than the computer, we subtract $400 from the cost of the computer:
Printer cost = Computer cost - $400
Printer cost = $1,100 - $400
Printer cost = $700

Now, we know the total cost of the computer and the printer, which is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800. To find the cost of the two monitors, we subtract this amount from the total cost:
Cost of 2 monitors = Total cost - Cost of computer and printer
Cost of 2 monitors = $2,400 - $1,800
Cost of 2 monitors = $600

Since there are two monitors, we need to find the cost of one monitor. To do this, we divide the cost of the two monitors by 2:
Cost of one monitor = Cost of 2 monitors / 2
Cost of one monitor = $600 / 2
Cost of one monitor = $300

The final answer is: $300"
"To find out how many seashells each girl brought, we first need to determine the total number of seashells brought by the boys. Since there are 10 boys (half of 20 kids) and each brought 60 shells, the total number of seashells brought by the boys is 10 * 60 = 600.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 600 + 4 * 600 seashells. 

First, we calculate 4 * 600, which is 2400. Then we add 600 to that, which equals 3000. 

Since there are 10 girls (half of 20 kids), we need to divide the total number of seashells brought by the girls by 10 to find out how many seashells each girl brought. 

3000 / 10 = 300.

The final answer is: 300"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, Nick had twice as many candies as George. Let's denote the number of candies George had initially as 'x'. Then, Nick had 2x candies.

George ate 5 candies, so the number of candies George has left is x - 5. We are given that George has 3 candies left, so we can set up the equation:

x - 5 = 3

To solve for x, we add 5 to both sides of the equation:

x = 3 + 5
x = 8

Now that we know George had 8 candies initially, we can find out how many candies Nick had initially. Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, Nick had 2x candies:

2x = 2 * 8
2x = 16

So, Nick had 16 candies initially."
"To find Anne's age, we first need to find Alyana's age. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, Alyana's age is 10 - 4 = 6 years.

Now, we know that Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, so Anne's age is 6 + 2 = 8 years.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book and then add them together.

The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 * 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add the thickness of all four books together: 
31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188

The final answer is: 188"
"To find out how many vlogs Emma needs to make to complete 72 vlogs per month, we first need to calculate how many vlogs she has already made. 

In the first week, Emma made 18 vlogs. 
In the second week, Emma made 21 vlogs. 
In the third week, Emma made 15 vlogs.

Total vlogs made so far = 18 + 21 + 15 = 54 vlogs.

Since Emma aims to make 72 vlogs per month, we need to find out how many more vlogs she needs to make. 

Vlogs needed to be made = 72 (target) - 54 (already made) = 18 vlogs.

So, Emma should make 18 vlogs to complete 72 vlogs per month.

18"
"To find the total amount you paid, we need to calculate the 20% tip and add it to the original bill.

First, let's find 20% of the $50 dinner bill. To do this, we multiply $50 by 0.20 (which is the decimal equivalent of 20%).

$50 * 0.20 = $10

Now, we add the tip to the original bill:

$50 (bill) + $10 (tip) = $60

So, you ended up paying $60.

The final answer is: $60"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much money the eldest boy initially received. Since $18 is shared among 3 boys, we divide $18 by 3 to find the initial share of the eldest boy.

Initial share of the eldest boy = $18 / 3 = $6

The eldest boy added $5 to his share, so his new total is:

$6 + $5 = $11

The following day, he added another $10, making his total:

$11 + $10 = $21

Then, he spent $8 from his total, leaving him with:

$21 - $8 = $13

After saving some more, he tripled the amount he had left after spending the $8. To find the final amount, we multiply $13 by 3:

$13 * 3 = $39

So, the eldest boy now has $39."
"To solve this problem, we first need to find out how much Elvis needs to save in the first half of the month. 

Let's assume the number of days in the first half of April is x. Since April has 30 days, the number of days in the second half will also be x. 

The total number of days in April is 30, so x + x = 30. 
Solving for x, we get 2x = 30, x = 15. 

So, the first half of April has 15 days and the second half also has 15 days.

Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half as in the first half. Let's assume he saves y dollars in the first half. Then, he will save 2y dollars in the second half.

The total savings for the month is the sum of the savings in the first and second half: y + 2y = 1125.

Combine like terms: 3y = 1125.

Divide both sides by 3: y = 375.

So, Elvis needs to save 375 dollars in the first half of the month.

Since he wants to save twice as much in the second half, he will save 2y = 2 * 375 = 750 dollars in the second half.

The final answer is: $750"
"To find the total cost of the fruits, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and add them together.

The cost of three apples at $1.50 each is 3 x $1.50 = $4.50.
The cost of five oranges at $0.80 each is 5 x $0.80 = $4.
The cost of six peaches at $0.75 each is 6 x $0.75 = $4.50.

Now, let's add the costs together: $4.50 + $4 + $4.50 = $13.

Since Verna gave $20, the change she received is $20 - $13 = $7.

The final answer is: $7"
"To find out how much more Jairus will get than Jenny, we need to calculate the total amount each of them will get for completing 20 tasks.

Jairus gets $0.8 for each task, so for 20 tasks, he will get 20 * $0.8 = $16.

Jenny gets $0.5 for each task, so for 20 tasks, she will get 20 * $0.5 = $10.

Now, we need to find the difference between what Jairus and Jenny get. 

$16 (Jairus) - $10 (Jenny) = $6

The final answer is: $6"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, and the total amount they have to divide is $100.

Let's represent the amount Brad gets as 'x'. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, the amount Jeff gets is 4x.

The total amount they have to divide is $100, so we can set up the equation: x + 4x = 100.

Combine like terms: 5x = 100.

Now, divide both sides by 5 to solve for x: x = 20.

Since x represents the amount Brad gets, and Jeff gets 4 times as much, Jeff gets 4x = 4(20) = 80.

The final answer is: $80"
"To find the total miles Jeff walks in a week, we need to calculate the total miles he walks each day and then multiply it by the number of days he works in a week.

Since Jeff walks 3 miles to work and 3 miles back home, the total miles he walks each day is 3 + 3 = 6 miles.

If he works 5 times a week, the total miles he walks in a week is 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. Elise writes the alphabet in full twice, which means she writes 26 letters each time. So, she writes 26 * 2 = 52 letters.

2. Then, she writes half of the alphabet once. Half of the alphabet is 26 / 2 = 13 letters.

3. So far, Elise has written 52 + 13 = 65 letters.

4. Finally, she re-writes everything she has already written. This means she re-writes 65 letters.

5. To find the total number of letters Elise has written, we add the letters she wrote initially (52) to the letters she wrote in the second step (13) and the letters she re-wrote (65). 

Total letters = 52 + 13 + 65 = 130

"This problem can be solved using a geometric progression. 

In the first round, 3 families are notified directly by Ali. 

In the second round, each of the 3 families notifies 3 other families, resulting in 3 * 3 = 9 new families notified. 

In the third round, each of the 9 families notifies 3 other families, resulting in 9 * 3 = 27 new families notified.

To find the number of families notified in the fourth round, we need to find the number of families that were notified in the third round, which is 27, and multiply it by 3. 

So, in the fourth round, 27 * 3 = 81 families will be notified.

"To find Mark's initial weight, we need to calculate the total weight he lost and then add that to his final weight.

Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, so the total weight he lost is:
10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds

Since Mark's final weight is 70 pounds, we can find his initial weight by adding the weight he lost to his final weight:
Initial weight = Final weight + Weight lost
Initial weight = 70 pounds + 30 pounds
Initial weight = 100 pounds

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many toys Jonathan needs to have a play set five times larger than James's. Since James's play set has 80 toys, a play set five times larger would have 5 * 80 = 400 toys.

Since Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have enough toys to make a play set five times larger than James's, we can set up an equation: x + 2 = 400, where x is the number of toys Jonathan currently has.

To find x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 2 from both sides: x = 400 - 2.

x = 398

So, Jonathan currently has 398 toys."
"To find the total cost of the items Daniel wants to buy, we first need to calculate the cost of each item without the discount. 

The cost of 5 notebooks at $1.50 each is 5 * $1.50 = $7.50.
The cost of 2 pens at $0.25 each is 2 * $0.25 = $0.50.
The cost of 1 calculator at $12 each is $12.
The cost of 1 geometry set at $10 each is $10.

The total cost of all the items without the discount is $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30.

Since the shop gives a 10% discount on all the purchased items, we need to calculate 10% of $30.
10% of $30 is 0.1 * $30 = $3.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final amount Daniel has to spend.
$30 - $3 = $27.

The final answer is: $27"

"To determine how many additional bottles Bill needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles he already has. Since he has 2 cases of water with 24 bottles each, we multiply the number of cases by the number of bottles per case: 2 * 24 = 48 bottles.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of bottles Bill needs for his party. He wants 2 bottles for each of his 70 guests, so we multiply the number of guests by the number of bottles per guest: 70 * 2 = 140 bottles.

Now, we subtract the number of bottles Bill already has from the total number of bottles he needs: 140 - 48 = 92 bottles.

So, Bill needs to buy 92 additional bottles of water for his party.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. 

When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as in cold water. Since it takes Ray 16 minutes to swim a mile in cold water, twice that time is 2 * 16 = 32 minutes. Adding 2 minutes to that gives us 32 + 2 = 34 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water. 

In cold water, it takes Ray 16 minutes to swim a mile, so for 3 miles it would be 3 * 16 = 48 minutes.

In warm water, it takes Ray 34 minutes to swim a mile, so for 3 miles it would be 3 * 34 = 102 minutes.

To find out how much longer it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day, we subtract the time it takes in cold water from the time it takes in warm water: 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

"To find the average weight of the three friends, we first need to find their individual weights. 

Mark's weight is given as 150 pounds. 
Susan's weight is 20 pounds less than Mark's, so Susan's weight is 150 - 20 = 130 pounds. 
Bob's weight is twice as much as Susan's, so Bob's weight is 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, we need to find the average weight of the three friends. To do this, we add their weights and divide by 3. 
Average weight = (Mark's weight + Susan's weight + Bob's weight) / 3 
Average weight = (150 + 130 + 260) / 3 
Average weight = 540 / 3

"To find out how many packs of candles James needs to buy, we first need to determine the total number of candles required. Since one son is 12 and the other is 4 years younger, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Typically, birthday candles are used in the same number as the person's age. So, James needs 12 candles for the older son and 8 candles for the younger son, making a total of 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we need to find out how many packs James needs to buy. To do this, we divide the total number of candles needed by the number of candles in a pack: 20 / 5 = 4.

Since James needs 4 packs of candles, and each pack costs $3, the total amount he spends on candles is 4 * 3 = $12.

"To find out how many pages Judy read in the first week, we need to calculate the total minutes she read in the first week and then convert that to pages. 

In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night. Since there are 7 nights in a week, she read for a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes in the first week.

Given that Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we can find out how many pages she read in the first week by first finding out how many 1.5 minute intervals are in 105 minutes. 

To do this, we divide 105 by 1.5, which equals 70. So, Judy read 70 * 2 = 140 pages in the first week.

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

To find the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we add the pages she read in the first week to the pages she read in the second week: 140 + 100 = 240.

"Let's break down the information given. We know that Richie scored 80 goals. We also know that Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark and 45 more goals than Anna.

Let's denote Mark's goals as M and Anna's goals as A. We can set up two equations based on the given information:

1. Richie's goals = Mark's goals + 20
   80 = M + 20
   M = 60

2. Richie's goals = Anna's goals + 45
   80 = A + 45
   A = 35

Now that we know Mark scored 60 goals and Anna scored 35 goals, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers.

Total goals = Richie's goals + Mark's goals + Anna's goals

"To find out how much more money Mitchell made than Liam, we need to first calculate the total amount of money each of them made. 

Liam made $63 in total. 

Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 apiece, so we multiply the number of lemonades by the price per lemonade: 21 * 4 = 84. 

Now, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings to find the difference: 84 - 63 = 21.

The final answer is: $21"
"To find out how many action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate how much he spent on each type of action figure and then determine how many of each type he can buy.

First, let's calculate how much Peter spent on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday. He spent $5 each day for 4 days, so the total amount spent on wooden action figures is:

$70 - (4 * $5) = $70 - $20 = $50

Since he spent $50 on wooden action figures, he has $20 left for the rest of the week.

Now, let's calculate how many plastic action figures he can buy with the remaining money. He has $20 left and each plastic action figure costs $2, so the number of plastic action figures he can buy is:

$20 / $2 = 10

Since he buys 1 plastic action figure per day from Thursday to Saturday, he will buy 4 plastic action figures.

Now, let's calculate the total number of action figures he will have by the end of the week. He bought 4 wooden action figures and 4 plastic action figures, so the total number of action figures is:

4 (wooden) + 4 (plastic) = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To calculate the total cost of the kitten, we need to add up the cost of spaying, vaccines, and the broken vases.

The cost of spaying is $200.
The cost of 3 vaccines is 3 x $20 = $60.
The cost of 4 broken vases is 4 x $12 = $48.

Now, let's add up the costs: $200 (spaying) + $60 (vaccines) + $48 (broken vases) = $308.

The final answer is: $308"
"To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we first need to calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week and then per month.

The total number of roses ordered per week is 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered per month is 65 * 4 = 260 roses.

Ford grows 40 roses every week, so the total number of roses he grows per month is 40 * 4 = 160 roses.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the total number of roses he grows per month from the total number of roses ordered per month: 260 - 160 = 100.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how much money will be remaining in Katina's account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount of money she will withdraw over that period.

There are 12 months in a year, so in 2 years, there are 2 x 12 = 24 months.

Katina removes $100 from her account every month, so the total amount she will withdraw in 24 months is 24 x $100 = $2400.

To find the remaining amount in her account, we subtract the total amount withdrawn from the initial amount: $3000 - $2400 = $600.

So, after 2 years, Katina will have $600 remaining in her account.

The final answer is: $600"
"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

The cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is $3.00 per loaf, and since each loaf makes 10 sandwiches, the cost per sandwich is $3.00 / 10 = $0.30 per sandwich. 

The cost of cheese and condiments for 10 sandwiches is $30.00. So, the cost per sandwich is $30.00 / 10 = $3.00 per sandwich.

The total cost per sandwich is the sum of the cost of bread and cheese/condiments, which is $0.30 + $3.00 = $3.30 per sandwich.

The total revenue from selling 10 sandwiches at $7.00 each is 10 * $7.00 = $70.00.

The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. Since they sell 10 sandwiches, the total cost is 10 * $3.30 = $33.00. 

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00
Net profit = $37.00

The final answer is: $37.00"
"To find out how much money Kate can make, we need to determine how many muffin crayons she can make and then multiply that number by the price of each muffin crayon.

First, let's find out how many small pieces of crayons Kate has in total. Since there are 3 boxes of 64 crayons, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of crayons in each box:

3 boxes * 64 crayons/box = 192 crayons

Since Kate melts 8 small pieces of crayons together to make one muffin crayon, we need to divide the total number of crayons by 8 to find out how many muffin crayons she can make:

192 crayons / 8 crayons/muffin = 24 muffin crayons

Now, we multiply the number of muffin crayons by the price of each muffin crayon to find out how much money Kate can make:

24 muffin crayons * $1.50/muffin crayon = $36

The final answer is: $36"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the area of the bedroom and then calculate the cost of the new carpet, padding, and installation.

The area of the bedroom is 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet.

The cost of the new carpet is $12 per square foot, so the total cost of the carpet is 216 * $12 = $2592.

The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot, so the total cost of the padding is 216 * $2 = $432.

The cost of removing the old carpet is $4 per square foot, so the total cost of removing the old carpet is 216 * $4 = $864.

The cost of installing the new carpet is $34 per square foot, so the total cost of installing the new carpet is 216 * $34 = $7344.

The total cost of replacing the carpet is the sum of the cost of the new carpet, padding, removing the old carpet, and installing the new carpet: $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344 = $11332.

The total cost of replacing the carpet is $11332.

"To find the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we need to add up the total number of birds he saw over the week and then divide by the number of days.

First, let's add up the total number of birds Mack saw:

Day 1 and 2: 50 birds
Day 3: 0 birds
Day 4 and 5: 120 birds
Day 6: 20 birds
Day 7: 90 birds

Total number of birds = 50 + 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 230

There are 7 days in a week. To find the average, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days:

Average number of birds per day = Total number of birds / Number of days
= 230 / 7
= 32.86

So, Mack saw an average of 32.86 birds per day over the week."
"To find the final value of the number train, we need to follow the given operations step by step.

1. The starting value of the number train is 20.
2. Half of the starting value is 20 / 2 = 10.
3. The starting value plus half the number is 20 + 10 = 30.
4. The resulting value is divided by 5, so 30 / 5 = 6.
5. The resulting value is multiplied by the starting value minus 12, so 6 * (20 - 12) = 6 * 8 = 48.

The final value of the number train is 48."
"To find the total number of cards they have together, we first need to determine the number of cards each person has. 

The boy has 5 cards. His brother has 3 fewer cards than he has, so his brother has 5 - 3 = 2 cards.

Now, we add the number of cards the boy and his brother have to find the total number of cards they have together: 5 (boy's cards) + 2 (brother's cards) = 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the percentage by which the oven is off, we need to calculate the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature, and then divide it by the set temperature.

The difference between the actual and set temperature is 468 - 450 = 18 degrees.

The percentage by which the oven is off is (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%.

Since the oven is off by 4% for any recipe, we need to find the temperature that is 4% less than 520 degrees.

First, we find 4% of 520: 0.04 * 520 = 20.8.

Then, we subtract 20.8 from 520 to get the temperature Maggie should set: 520 - 20.8 = 499.2.

The final answer is: 499.2"
"To find the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to convert the time of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time as follows:
1 hour = 60 minutes
Adding the 30 minutes, we get:
60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting the time to minutes:
2 hours = 2 x 60 minutes = 120 minutes
Adding the 5 minutes, we get:
120 minutes + 5 minutes = 125 minutes

Now, we add the time of both movies together:
90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes

The total time Max will spend watching the two movies is 215 minutes.

"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house price and subtract it from Herb's house price. 

30% of $76,000 is 0.3 x $76,000 = $22,800.

Now, subtract $22,800 from $76,000 to find the value of Juan's house: $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200.

The value of Juan's house is $53,200.

To find the combined value of the two houses, add the value of Juan's house to Herb's house price: $53,200 + $76,000 = $129,200.

The final answer is: $129,200."
"To find the total number of utensils brought by Judy, we first need to determine how many cups and dishes she brought. 

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of utensils brought by Judy: 12 cups + 24 dishes = 36 utensils.

The total number of utensils brought by Judy is 36.

Now, let's calculate the total number of utensils brought by Judy's friend: 40 cups + 44 dishes = 84 utensils.

The total number of utensils brought by Judy's friend is 84.

To find the total number of utensils brought by both Judy and her friend, we add the number of utensils each brought: 36 (Judy) + 84 (her friend) = 120 utensils.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total number of contacts, we multiply the number of contacts per box by the number of boxes. 

90 contacts per box * 2 boxes = 180 contacts

Since the contacts will last Pete 45 days, we can find the number of contacts per day by dividing the total number of contacts by the number of days.

180 contacts / 45 days = 4 contacts per day

However, the question asks for the cost per pair of contacts. Since a pair of contacts is 2 contacts, we divide the total number of contacts by 2.

180 contacts / 2 = 90 pairs of contacts

Now, we need to find the total cost of the 2 boxes of contacts. Since each box is $100 and there's a 10% discount, we first find the discount amount.

10% of $100 = 0.1 * $100 = $10

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the discounted price.

$100 - $10 = $90

Since Pete buys 2 boxes, we multiply the discounted price by 2.

$90 * 2 = $180

Now, we divide the total cost by the number of pairs of contacts to find the cost per pair.

$180 / 90 pairs = $2 per pair

The final answer is: $2"
"To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we need to calculate their individual earnings first.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, for a total of 3 hours. Her hourly wage is $10, so her total earnings are 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 hours. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, which is 3 * 1 = 3 hours. So, John worked a total of 4 + 3 = 7 hours. His total earnings are 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find out how much water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total calories she burns during her activities. 

She spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories/hour. So, the total calories burned from aerobics is 2 * 500 = 1000 calories.

She also spends 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories/hour. So, the total calories burned from running is 1 * 600 = 600 calories.

The total calories burned is the sum of calories burned from aerobics and running, which is 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns, we need to divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many 200-calorie units she burned. 

Total calories burned / 200 = 1600 / 200 = 8

Since she needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we multiply the number of 200-calorie units by 100 ml. 

8 * 100 = 800 ml

The final answer is: 800"
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G. 

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so B + R + G = 4500.

We also know that R = 0.99B (1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans) and G = 1.01B (1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans).

Substituting the expressions for R and G into the first equation, we get:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

3.01B = 4500

Divide both sides by 3.01:

B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

R = 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
G = 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is:

G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the average of the three measurements, we need to first find the third measurement. 

Jared's initial typing speed is 47 WPM. After the first increase, it becomes 52 WPM. To find the second increase, we need to add 5 WPM to 52 WPM. 

52 WPM + 5 WPM = 57 WPM

Now we have the three measurements: 47 WPM, 52 WPM, and 57 WPM. To find the average, we add the three measurements and divide by 3.

(47 + 52 + 57) / 3 = 156 / 3 = 52

"To find the total number of people attending, we need to calculate the number of people invited via email, the number of friends Alex's friends will bring, and the number of Alex's friends and their spouses.

First, let's calculate the number of people invited via email. Each of the 100 people invited will bring 2 friends, so the total number of people invited via email is 100 + (100 * 2) = 300.

Next, Alex calls 10 friends and 8 of them will bring their spouses, so the total number of Alex's friends and their spouses is 10 + 8 = 18.

Now, we add the number of people invited via email and the number of Alex's friends and their spouses to get the total number of people attending. 

Total number of people = 300 + 18 = 318

However, we also need to include Alex herself, so the total number of people attending is 318 + 1 = 319.

Therefore, Alex will need 319 seats.

The final answer is: 319"
"To find the weight of the Mastiff, we need to start from the Papillon's weight. The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Dachshund's weight is 4 times the Papillon's weight. 

Since the Papillon's weight is unknown, let's call it 'x'. The Dachshund's weight is 4x. 

The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Affenpinscher's weight is half of the Dachshund's weight, which is 2x.

The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff's weight is 44x.

Now, we know the Affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds. Since the Affenpinscher's weight is 2x, we can set up the equation 2x = 10. Solving for x, we get x = 5.

Now that we know the Papillon's weight is 5 pounds, we can find the Mastiff's weight by multiplying 44 and 5.

The Mastiff's weight is 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.

The final answer is: 220"
"To find the total cost of the boots on eBay, we need to add the cost of the boots and the shipping cost. The shipping cost on eBay is twice as much as on Amazon, which is $4. So, the shipping cost on eBay is 2 * $4 = $8. 

The total cost of the boots on eBay is $13 (boots) + $8 (shipping) = $21.

The total cost of the boots on Amazon is $16 (boots) + $4 (shipping) = $20.

To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we need to subtract the cost on Amazon from the cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

Let's calculate the height of the beanstalk for each day:

Day 1: 4 feet
Day 2: 4 * 2 = 8 feet
Day 3: 8 * 2 = 16 feet
Day 4: 16 * 2 = 32 feet

As we can see, on the 4th day, the beanstalk will be taller than Mark's window, which is 20 feet off the ground.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we first need to calculate how many grams of protein he gets per day. 

Since a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein, we can find the protein percentage in a cup of mushrooms by dividing the protein by the weight: 3 grams / 100 grams = 0.03 or 3%.

Now, we know that John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day. To find out how many grams of protein he gets per day, we multiply the weight of mushrooms he eats by the protein percentage: 200 grams * 0.03 = 6 grams of protein per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7 to find the weekly protein intake: 6 grams/day * 7 days/week = 42 grams of protein per week.

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's break down the information given. If Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can represent his current age as 'x'. 

Five years ago, Jerry's age would be 'x - 5'. According to the problem, Jerry's current age is twice his age 5 years ago, so we can write the equation: x = 2(x - 5).

Simplifying the equation, we get: x = 2x - 10.

Subtracting '2x' from both sides of the equation, we get: -x = -10.

Dividing both sides by -1, we get: x = 10.

So, Jerry's current age is 10 years. 

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age: 10 + 3 = 13.

"To find out how many hours George needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the dental work. 

The base price for two implants is 2 * $2000 = $4000. 
For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain, which costs an extra $500. So, the total cost for the implants with the crown is $4000 + $500 = $4500. 

However, George has already put down a deposit of $600. So, the remaining amount he needs to pay is $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since George makes $15 per hour at work, we can find out how many hours he needs to work by dividing the remaining amount by his hourly wage: $3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

The final answer is: 260"
"Let's denote the smallest angle as 'x'. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it's 2x. The other angle is three times the smallest angle, so it's 3x.

We know that the sum of the three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:

One angle is twice the smallest angle: 2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees
The other angle is three times the smallest angle: 3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has in cents. 

First, let's convert the quarters to cents: 8 quarters * 25 cents = 200 cents
Next, let's convert the dimes to cents: 6 dimes * 10 cents = 60 cents
Then, we already have the number of nickels in cents: 14 nickels * 5 cents = 70 cents
Lastly, let's convert the pennies to cents: 15 pennies * 1 cent = 15 cents

Now, let's add up the total amount of money Colby has: 200 cents + 60 cents + 70 cents + 15 cents = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs a nickel (5 cents), we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball: 345 cents / 5 cents = 69

Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

"To find the rate at which the plane is traveling, we need to divide the distance it traveled by the time it took. 

Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Rate = 400 miles per hour

Now, we need to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this rate.

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

Since the question asks for the additional hours it would take, we need to subtract the initial 3 hours from the total time.

Additional time = Total time - Initial time
Additional time = 5 hours - 3 hours
Additional time = 2 hours

"To find out how much Marissa makes in an hour, we need to first find out how much Ruiz makes in an hour. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, we divide 120 by 2 to get the amount he makes in an hour.

Ruiz's hourly production = 120 / 2 = 60 pounds per hour.

Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in 2 hours. Since Ruiz makes 60 pounds in an hour, we multiply 60 by 2 to find out how much he makes in 2 hours, then multiply that by 3/4 to find Marissa's hourly production.

Ruiz's 2-hour production = 60 * 2 = 120 pounds
Marissa's hourly production = (3/4) * 120 = 90 pounds per hour.

Now, we know that Ruiz makes 60 pounds per hour and Marissa makes 90 pounds per hour. To find the total amount of chocolate they make together in 12 hours, we add their hourly production and multiply by 12.

Total production per hour = 60 + 90 = 150 pounds per hour
Total production in 12 hours = 150 * 12 = 1800 pounds

Next, let's calculate the total number of cups sold in the next two hours:
10 cups/hour * 2 hours = 20 cups

The total revenue from the next two hours is:
20 cups * $0.60/cup = $12

Now, let's add the total revenue from both time periods:
$30 + $12 = $42

Patrick earned $42 from selling lemonade for 6 hours.

The final answer is: $42"
"To find out how many times the tires rotate in a month, we need to multiply the number of miles driven per month by the number of rotations per mile. 

Rotations per month = 400 miles/month * 725 rotations/mile = 290,000 rotations/month

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can find the total rotations per year by multiplying the rotations per month by 12.

Rotations per year = 290,000 rotations/month * 12 months/year = 3,480,000 rotations/year

Now, we need to divide the total number of rotations a tire can undergo by the number of rotations it undergoes in a year to find out how many years it will last.

Years before replacement = 10,440,000 rotations / 3,480,000 rotations/year = 3 years

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the cost per pump, we need to first find the total number of pumps in the bottle. Since 2 pumps give 120 washings and Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, the total number of pumps in the bottle is 120 * 2 = 240 pumps.

The total cost of the shampoo is $24.00, which is equivalent to 2400 cents. 

To find the cost per pump, we divide the total cost by the total number of pumps: 2400 cents / 240 pumps = 10 cents per pump.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how much money Joe will have left after the purchase, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items before the discount. 

The shirt costs $25 and the shorts cost $35, so the total cost is $25 + $35 = $60.

Since there's a 30% off sale, we need to calculate the discount amount. To do this, we multiply the total cost by the discount percentage (30% or 0.3).

Discount = $60 * 0.3 = $18

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final price.

Final price = $60 - $18 = $42

Since sales tax is included, we don't need to add any additional tax to the final price. 

Joe started with $50, and the final price of the items is $42, so he will have $50 - $42 = $8 left after the purchase.

The final answer is: $8"
"To find out how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we first need to calculate the total number of croissants he wants to make in a week. Since he wants to make 4 dozen a day for a week, we multiply the number of dozen croissants per day by the number of days in a week.

4 dozen/day * 7 days/week = 28 dozen/week

Since there are 12 croissants in a dozen, we can convert the total number of dozen croissants to individual croissants:

28 dozen/week * 12 croissants/dozen = 336 croissants/week

Now, we know it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. To find out how much butter is needed for 28 dozen croissants, we multiply the amount of butter needed for 1 dozen by 28:

(1/4 pound/dozen) * 28 dozen = 7 pounds

So, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the cost of repaving Lewis' street, we need to multiply the cost per meter by the length of his street. 

Cost per meter: $194
Length of Lewis' street: 490 meters

Cost to repave Lewis' street: 194 * 490 = $95,060

To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's, we need to first find the cost to repave Monica's street and then subtract that from the cost to repave Lewis' street.

Cost to repave Monica's street: 194 * 150 = $29,100

Now, we subtract the cost to repave Monica's street from the cost to repave Lewis' street:

$95,060 - $29,100 = $65,960

The final answer is: $65,960"
"To find the total cost of John's research, we first need to determine the total number of months his research took. Since it took 10 times longer than the initial 5 months, it took 5 * 10 = 50 months.

The initial 5 months cost $100,000. After that, the funding increased by 50% each month. This means the cost for each of the remaining 45 months (50 - 5 = 45) is 1.5 times the initial cost.

The cost for the first 5 months is $100,000. The cost for the remaining 45 months is 45 * $100,000 * 1.5 = $6,750,000.

The total cost is the sum of the cost for the first 5 months and the cost for the remaining 45 months: $100,000 + $6,750,000 = $6,850,000.

The final answer is: $6,850,000"
"To find the total amount of meat consumed, we need to calculate the amount eaten by the first, second, and third players. 

The first player ate a 6-ounce steak. 
The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so 8 ounces of beef tips. 
The third player ate a one-pound steak, which is equal to 16 ounces (1 pound = 16 ounces).

Now, let's add up the total amount of meat consumed: 
6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces.

At the end of the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall.

At the end of the second week, it doubled in height, so it became 3 * 2 = 6 inches tall.

At the end of the third week, it grew another 4 inches, so it became 6 + 4 = 10 inches tall.

Therefore, the beanstalk was 10 inches tall after 3 weeks.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we need to calculate the total amount of meat he sells in a day and then divide the total weight of the bull by that amount.

Prince sells 15kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day, so he sells 15 * 10 = 150kg of meat per day.

The bull weighs 750kg. To find out how many days it will take to sell the meat, we divide the total weight of the bull by the amount of meat Prince sells per day: 750 / 150 = 5.

So, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull.

"To find the number of students, we first need to find the total number of seats occupied by the administrators, parents, and students.

Total seats in the auditorium = 4 rows * 18 seats/row = 72 seats

One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators. 
Administrators = 1/4 * 72 = 18 seats

Remaining seats = 72 - 18 = 54 seats

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents.
Parents = 1/3 * 54 = 18 seats

Remaining seats (students) = 54 - 18 = 36 seats

Therefore, the number of students in the school auditorium is 36."
"To find the total number of functioning street lights, we first need to find the total number of street lights. 

Each intersection has 6 poles, and each pole has 4 street lights. So, the total number of street lights at each intersection is 6 * 4 = 24. 

Since there are 4 intersections, the total number of street lights is 24 * 4 = 96.

However, 20 street lights are not working. To find the total number of functioning street lights, we subtract the non-working lights from the total number of lights: 96 - 20 = 76.

"To find the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break, we need to add the number of times each DVD has already been played to the number of times each can be played before breaking, and then add those two totals together.

DVD 1 has been played 356 times and can be played 1000 times before breaking, so it can be played 1000 - 356 = 644 more times.

DVD 2 has been played 135 times and can be played 1000 times before breaking, so it can be played 1000 - 135 = 865 more times.

Now, we add the number of times each DVD can be played before breaking to the number of times each has already been played: 356 + 644 + 135 + 865 = 2000.

"To find out how many pieces of gum Jim chews during school, we need to calculate how many 2-hour intervals are in an 8-hour school day. 

8 hours / 2 hours per interval = 4 intervals

Since Jim chews 1 piece of gum per 2-hour interval, he chews 4 pieces of gum during school.

He also chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner, so that's 2 more pieces.

In total, Jim chews 4 (during school) + 2 (on the way home and after dinner) = 6 pieces of gum.

Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

However, he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. Half of 14 is 7.

So, Jim gives 7 pieces to his sister, leaving him with 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum.

"To find out how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to calculate the difference between the required height (4 feet) and Adam's current height (40 inches), and then divide that by his growth rate (2 inches per year).

First, let's convert the required height from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, 4 feet is equal to 4 x 12 = 48 inches.

Now, let's calculate the difference between the required height and Adam's current height: 48 inches - 40 inches = 8 inches.

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we can divide the difference by his growth rate to find out how many years it will take for him to reach the required height: 8 inches / 2 inches/year = 4 years.

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To find out how much James made, we need to calculate the profit from selling the cars, then apply his commission to that profit.

First, let's find the total cost of the cars: 10 cars * $25,000 = $250,000.

The company paid 30% of the cost to acquire the cars, so the amount they paid is 0.3 * $250,000 = $75,000.

The profit from selling the cars is the selling price minus the cost to acquire them: $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.

James gets a 10% commission on the profit, so his commission is 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

Therefore, James made $17,500.

The final answer is: $17,500."
"To find the number of men who can stay upright, we first need to find the total number of riders who can stay upright. 

Given that 25% of the riders can stay upright, and there are 100 riders, we can calculate the number of riders who can stay upright as follows:

25% of 100 = 0.25 * 100 = 25

Now, we know that 60% of these 25 riders are women. To find the number of women, we can calculate:

60% of 25 = 0.6 * 25 = 15

Since the remaining riders who can stay upright are men, we can find the number of men by subtracting the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:

25 - 15 = 10

Therefore, 10 men can stay upright on the wave.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total price for all three jewels, we first need to find the prices of the gold and silver jewels.

Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, we know that the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of a diamond jewel. 

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * Price of diamond jewel
Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * $2000
Price of gold jewel = $1600

The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold. 

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
Price of silver jewel = $1600 - $400
Price of silver jewel = $1200

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels.

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
Total price = $2000 + $1600 + $1200
Total price = $4800

The final answer is: $4800"
"To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to calculate the number of each type of stamp and add them together.

Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.

He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

To find the total number of stamps, we add the number of each type of stamp together: 16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45.

The final answer is: 45"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the relative speed between Bob and Tom. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract Tom's speed from Bob's speed to get the relative speed.

Relative speed = Bob's speed - Tom's speed
Relative speed = 55 mph - 70 mph
Relative speed = -15 mph

However, since we are dealing with a time problem, we need to consider the absolute value of the relative speed. The negative sign indicates that Tom is actually gaining on Bob, but we are interested in the rate at which he is gaining.

Absolute relative speed = 15 mph

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed

The distance between Bob and Tom is 75 miles. We want to find the time it takes for Tom to cover this distance at the relative speed.

Time = Distance / Relative speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"To find out how many fish Tommy caught, we need to first determine how many fish Darren caught. Since Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish, we can calculate Darren's catch by subtracting 6 from Naomi's total.

Darren's catch = Naomi's catch - 6
Darren's catch = 17 - 6
Darren's catch = 11

Now that we know Darren caught 11 fish, we can find out how many Tommy caught by adding 3 to Darren's total.

Tommy's catch = Darren's catch + 3
Tommy's catch = 11 + 3
Tommy's catch = 14

The final answer is: 14"
"To find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to determine the maximum number of classes he can attend without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Let's assume the cost per class is $10. If Manny attends all 10 classes, the total cost would be 10 classes * $10 per class = $100. However, Manny signed up for classes for $60, so he has a remaining balance of $40.

Since Manny's parents are concerned about the cost exceeding $10 per class, we need to find out how many classes he can miss to stay within the $60 budget. 

Let's subtract the cost of the classes he attends from the total budget: $60 (remaining budget) - $10 (cost per class) = $50. This is the amount he can spend on the classes he attends.

Now, let's divide the remaining budget by the cost per class to find out how many classes he can attend: $50 / $10 per class = 5 classes.

Since there are 10 total classes, Manny can miss 10 - 5 = 5 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

"To find the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges, we first need to find the cost of one apple and one orange. 

The cost of 4 apples is $5.20, so the cost of one apple is $5.20 / 4 = $1.30. 

The cost of 3 oranges is $3.30, so the cost of one orange is $3.30 / 3 = $1.10.

Now, we can find the cost of 5 apples: 5 apples * $1.30/apple = $6.50.

Next, we can find the cost of 5 oranges: 5 oranges * $1.10/orange = $5.50.

Finally, we can add the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges to find the total cost: $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add them to the base price.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade costs $7,500.

The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of the leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of the running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the features and the base price:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

"To find out how much Tim will make in a year, we need to calculate his new monthly salary and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's calculate the 5% raise on his $20,000 monthly salary. 
5% of $20,000 is 0.05 * $20,000 = $1,000. 
So, his new monthly salary will be $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000.

Next, let's calculate the bonus, which is half a month's salary. 
Half of $20,000 is $10,000. 

Now, let's add the bonus to his new monthly salary. 
$21,000 (new monthly salary) + $10,000 (bonus) = $31,000 (total monthly income).

To find out how much he will make in a year, we multiply his total monthly income by 12. 
$31,000 * 12 = $372,000.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil. Bill can dig 4 feet/hour through soil, and he needs to dig 24 feet of soil. 

Time to dig through soil = Total soil depth / Rate of digging through soil
Time to dig through soil = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour
Time to dig through soil = 6 hours

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the clay. Bill can dig half as fast through clay as he can through soil, so his rate of digging through clay is 4 / 2 = 2 feet/hour. He needs to dig 8 feet of clay.

Time to dig through clay = Total clay depth / Rate of digging through clay
Time to dig through clay = 8 feet / 2 feet/hour
Time to dig through clay = 4 hours

Now, we add the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay to find the total time.

Total time = Time to dig through soil + Time to dig through clay
Total time = 6 hours + 4 hours
Total time = 10 hours

"To find the total number of cupcakes Howie needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of people and multiply it by 2 (since he's getting 2 cupcakes for each person).

There are 25 classmates and 2 more people (Howie and his teacher), so the total number of people is 25 + 2 = 27.

Since each person gets 2 cupcakes, the total number of cupcakes needed is 27 * 2 = 54.

So, Howie should buy 54 cupcakes.

The final answer is: 54"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, Fishio received 2000 likes on her selfie.

Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times as many as the initial number of likes. 
So, the number of likes after 3 weeks = 70 * 2000 = 140000.

Now, she received 20000 more new likes recently. 
So, the total number of likes = 140000 + 20000 = 160000.

The final answer is: 160000"
"To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost for each day and then subtract the two amounts.

On the first day, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, but she got a $2 discount. So, the total cost for the first day is:
20 pomegranates * $20 = $400
Discount: $2
Total cost for the first day: $400 - $2 = $398

On the second day, the price per pomegranate is $30, and there's a 10% discount on the total cost. So, the total cost for the second day is:
20 pomegranates * $30 = $600
Discount: 10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
Total cost for the second day: $600 - $60 = $540

Now, let's find the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days:
Difference = Total cost for the second day - Total cost for the first day
Difference = $540 - $398
Difference = $142

The final answer is: $142"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find the total sales from green hats in the first month. Since the sales from red hats were half the total amount she earned from selling green hats, let's denote the total sales from green hats as 'x'. Then, the sales from red hats would be 'x/2'.

We know that the sales from red hats were $400, so we can set up the equation:

x/2 = 400

To find 'x', we multiply both sides by 2:

x = 400 * 2
x = 800

So, the total sales from green hats in the first month were $800.

Now, let's find the total sales from both red and green hats in the first month:

Total sales in the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
= 400 + 800
= 1200

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. To find the total sales in the second month, we multiply the total sales in the first month by 3/4:

Total sales in the second month = (3/4) * 1200
= 900

Now, let's find the total sales in two months:

Total sales in two months = Total sales in the first month + Total sales in the second month
= 1200 + 900
= 2100

The final answer is: $2100"

"To find out how much was withheld from Sally's wage, we need to determine the total amount she should have received and subtract the actual amount in her account.

First, let's calculate the total amount Sally should have received. Since her weekly wage is $300, and she started with $200 in her account, the total amount she should have received is $300 (weekly wage) + $200 (initial amount) = $500.

However, the actual amount in her account is $420. To find out how much was withheld, we subtract the actual amount from the total amount she should have received: $500 (total amount) - $420 (actual amount) = $80.

So, $80 was withheld from Sally's wage.

The final answer is: $80"
"To determine the total number of deviled egg halves needed, we need to multiply the number of guests by the number of deviled egg halves each guest will eat. 

Number of guests: 16
Number of deviled egg halves per guest: 3
Total deviled egg halves needed: 16 * 3 = 48

Since each whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, we need to divide the total number of deviled egg halves needed by 2 to find the total number of eggs required.

Total deviled egg halves needed: 48
Eggs per deviled egg half: 2
Total eggs needed: 48 / 2 = 24

To find the number of dozens of eggs needed, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 (since 1 dozen = 12).

Total eggs needed: 24
Eggs per dozen: 12
Dozens of eggs needed: 24 / 12 = 2

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many pages Shiela has left to write, we need to determine the total number of pages she has already written and subtract that from the total required pages.

Since Shiela has finished writing 1/3 of the paper, we can calculate the number of pages she has written as follows:

1/3 of 15 pages = (1/3) * 15 = 5 pages

Now, we subtract the number of pages she has written from the total required pages:

15 pages (total) - 5 pages (written) = 10 pages

So, Shiela has 10 pages left to write.

"To find out how many days it will take Mike to finish reading the book, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he plans to read per day.

Total pages = 200
Pages read per day = 10

Days to finish reading = Total pages / Pages read per day
Days to finish reading = 200 / 10
Days to finish reading = 20

Since Mike has 30 days to complete the assignment, we need to subtract the number of days it will take him to finish reading from the total number of days.

Days before deadline = Total days - Days to finish reading
Days before deadline = 30 - 20
Days before deadline = 10

"To find the total cost of the plane for the first year, we need to calculate the cost of the plane itself, the hanger rental, and the fuel costs.

The cost of the plane is $150,000.

The hanger rental is $5000 per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total hanger rental cost for the first year is $5000 * 12 = $60,000.

The fuel cost is twice the hanger rental, which is $5000 * 2 = $10,000 per month. The total fuel cost for the first year is $10,000 * 12 = $120,000.

Now, we add up the costs: $150,000 (plane) + $60,000 (hanger rental) + $120,000 (fuel) = $330,000.

The total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year is $330,000.

"Let's break down the information given. 

First, we know it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice. Since it took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, the cooking time for pork is 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

We are also told that beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. Half of 80 minutes is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

Now, we have the cooking times for each food item: rice (30 minutes), pork (50 minutes), and beans (40 minutes). To find the total cooking time, we add these times together: 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the cost difference, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture and then subtract the cost of the first mixture from the cost of the second mixture.

For the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- Cost of almonds: 1/2 pound * $10/pound = $5
- Cost of walnuts: 1/3 pound * $15/pound = $5
- Total cost of the first mixture: $5 + $5 = $10

For the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- Cost of almonds: 1/5 pound * $10/pound = $2
- Cost of walnuts: 1/3 pound * $15/pound = $5
- Total cost of the second mixture: $2 + $5 = $7

Now, we subtract the cost of the first mixture from the cost of the second mixture:
$10 - $7 = $3

"Let's denote the number of sheep as S and the number of geese as G. Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, we can set up the following equation based on the total number of legs:

4S + 2G = 70

We are also given that the total number of animal heads is 20. Since each sheep and goose has one head, we can set up another equation:

S + G = 20

We can solve this system of equations by multiplying the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of G in both equations the same:

2S + 2G = 40

Now we can subtract this equation from the first equation to eliminate G:

(4S + 2G) - (2S + 2G) = 70 - 40
2S = 30

Divide both sides by 2:

S = 15

"To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the cost of the coffee. 

Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day, and he wants a week's worth, which is 7 days. The normal brand of coffee costs $5 per pound. However, his favorite brand is sold out, so he buys the more expensive brand that costs 20% more. 

First, let's calculate the cost of the more expensive brand. 20% of $5 is 0.2 * $5 = $1. So, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the coffee. Roger needs 7 pounds of coffee, and each pound costs $6. So, the total cost of the coffee is 7 * $6 = $42.

He also buys a donut for $2. 

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the coffee and the cost of the donut: $42 + $2 = $44.

"To find the cost of the apple pie, we need to subtract the total cost of the items Gus bought from the $20.00 he spent. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Gus bought:

2 bags of chips for $2.00 each is 2 x $2.00 = $4.00
Adding the cost of the bucket of fried chicken, $8.00, and the bottle of soda, $1.00, we get:
$4.00 + $8.00 + $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's subtract the total cost of the items from the $20.00 Gus spent:
$20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

The apple pie cost $7.00.

The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time, so the total class time per week is 4 * 2 = 8 hours.

Since the class lasts for 6 weeks, the total class time is 8 hours/week * 6 weeks = 48 hours.

John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time, so the total number of recipes he learns is 48 hours / 1.5 hours/recipe = 32 recipes.

"To find the number of math teachers, we first need to find the number of history teachers and then subtract that from the total number of teachers. 

60% of 150 teachers are history teachers. To find 60% of 150, we multiply 150 by 0.6. 

150 * 0.6 = 90

So, there are 90 history teachers. To find the number of math teachers, we subtract the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers.

150 - 90 = 60

There are 60 math teachers. 

Each math teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. To find the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day, we multiply the number of math teachers by the number of hours they sleep per day.

First, we know Aurelia has $120. Since Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, we can calculate Kassidy's money as follows:
Kassidy's money = 3/4 * Aurelia's money
Kassidy's money = 3/4 * 120
Kassidy's money = 90

Now, we know Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy. So, we can calculate Rayna's money as follows:
Rayna's money = Kassidy's money + 60
Rayna's money = 90 + 60
Rayna's money = 150

Now that we know the amount of money each person has, we can add their money together and divide it by 3 to find out how much each would have if they decided to add together their money and share equally among them:
Total money = Aurelia's money + Kassidy's money + Rayna's money
Total money = 120 + 90 + 150
Total money = 360

Now, let's divide the total money by 3 to find out how much each would have:
Money per person = Total money / 3
Money per person = 360 / 3
Money per person = 120

The final answer is: $120"
"To find the total length of the game, we need to calculate the length of the regular game and then add the extra time played in the extended quarter.

The regular game consists of 4 quarters, each 12 minutes long. So, the total length of the regular game is:
4 quarters * 12 minutes/quarter = 48 minutes

Since the game was extended for 5 minutes, we need to add this to the total length of the regular game:
48 minutes + 5 minutes = 53 minutes

Therefore, the entire game lasted 53 minutes. 

The final answer is: 53"
"To find the number of employees who oversee the company, we first need to find the number of management employees and then find 30% of that number.

First, let's find the number of management employees. 20% of 50 employees are management, so we multiply 50 by 0.2.

50 * 0.2 = 10

Now, we need to find 30% of the management employees. 30% of 10 is 0.3 * 10.

0.3 * 10 = 3

So, 3 employees oversee the company.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the total amount of dry ingredients needed, we need to calculate the total amount of flour, sugar, and salt required for 16 muffins.

For flour, Svetlana needs 5 tablespoons per muffin, so for 16 muffins, she needs 5 * 16 = 80 tablespoons of flour.

For sugar, Svetlana needs 3 tablespoons per muffin, so for 16 muffins, she needs 3 * 16 = 48 tablespoons of sugar.

For salt, Svetlana needs 0.25 tablespoons per muffin, so for 16 muffins, she needs 0.25 * 16 = 4 tablespoons of salt.

Now, we add up the total amount of dry ingredients: 80 (flour) + 48 (sugar) + 4 (salt) = 132 tablespoons.

The total amount of dry ingredients Svetlana needs to make 16 muffins is 132.

"To find out how much candy each person would have after sharing, we need to first find the total amount of candy they have together. 

Robert had 3 pounds of candy, Cindy had 5 pounds of candy, and Aaron had 4 pounds of candy. 

Total candy = 3 + 5 + 4 = 12 pounds

Since they are sharing the candy equally among themselves, we need to divide the total amount of candy by the number of people. 

Number of people = 3 (Robert, Cindy, and Aaron)

Candy per person = Total candy / Number of people
= 12 / 3
= 4

So, each of them would have 4 pounds of candy after sharing. 

The final answer is: 4"

"To find the number of good days left in the month, we need to first determine the total number of good days recorded by Christina. We know that she had 12 good days in the first 30 days. However, we also know that her first 8 days were good, her second 8 days were bad, and her third 8 days were neutral. 

Since we know the first 8 days were good, we can subtract those from the total number of good days. However, we also need to consider the additional good days in the first 30 days. The second 8 days were bad, so they don't contribute to the good days. The third 8 days were neutral, so they also don't contribute to the good days. 

However, we know that the first 8 days were good, and there were 12 good days in total. So, the remaining good days in the first 30 days are 12 - 8 = 4. 

Now, we need to consider the next 3 days, which were good, neutral, and good. We already know that there were 4 good days in the first 30 days, and we have 3 more good days. So, the total number of good days left in the month is 4 + 3 = 7.

"Let's break down the information given. We know that Janey has 21 books and that she has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. 

Let's represent the number of books Sally has as 'x'. According to the information, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has, so we can write an equation:

Janey's books = 2 * Sally's books + 3
21 = 2x + 3

To find the number of books Sally has, we need to isolate 'x'. We can do this by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:

21 - 3 = 2x + 3 - 3
18 = 2x

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for 'x':

18 / 2 = 2x / 2
9 = x

So, Sally has 9 books.

"To find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches, we need to first convert the initial height from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so we multiply 20 feet by 12 inches per foot.

20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now, we know the bamboo grows 30 inches a day and it's currently 240 inches tall. To find out how many days it will take to reach 600 inches, we subtract the current height from the target height and divide by the daily growth rate.

600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Now, we divide the remaining inches by the daily growth rate.

360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs. This means each dog has 1 toy. When 8 more dogs arrive, James needs 8 more toys to bring the total to 12 dogs with 1 toy each. So, he buys 8 more toys.

Now, there are 12 dogs, and James goes back to find that there are twice as many more dogs, which means there are 2 * 8 = 16 more dogs. This makes a total of 12 + 16 = 28 dogs. Since each dog needs 1 toy, James needs 28 more toys.

However, when James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs 3 toys. This means he needs 28 - 3 = 25 more toys.

To find the total number of toys James needs, we add the initial 4 toys he had to the 8 toys he bought first and the 28 toys he bought the second time, and then subtract the 3 toys he no longer needs.

Total toys = 4 (initial toys) + 8 (first purchase) + 28 (second purchase) - 3 (toys no longer needed)
Total toys = 37

"To find out how many signatures the sisters need to collect, we first need to determine how many signatures they currently have in total. Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44 signatures. 

Total signatures currently = 20 (Carol's signatures) + 44 (Jennifer's signatures) = 64 signatures

Since they want to reach a total of 100 signatures by the end of the summer, we need to find out how many signatures they still need to collect.

Signatures needed = Total signatures desired - Total signatures currently
= 100 - 64

"To find the total number of cookies, we need to determine the number of cookies each person has. 

We know Katarina has 68 cookies. 

Since Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.

Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so the Cookie Monster has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.

Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Now, we can find the total number of cookies by adding the number of cookies each person has: 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298.

The final answer is: 298"
"To find the original length of the dress, we need to consider the two changes made to the dress. 

First, the dress was extended by 50% of its original length. If we let the original length be 'x', then the extension is 0.5x. 

The total length after the extension is x + 0.5x = 1.5x.

Then, 20cm was added to the bottom of the dress. So, the final length is 1.5x + 20.

We are given that the final length is 140cm. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

1.5x + 20 = 140

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. Subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

1.5x = 120

Now, divide both sides by 1.5:

x = 80

"To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes to mow half the lawn in each mode and then add those times together.

First, let's find the time it takes to mow half the lawn in turtle mode. Since it takes 1 hour to mow the entire lawn in turtle mode, it will take 1/2 hour to mow half the lawn in turtle mode. We need to convert 1/2 hour to minutes, which is 30 minutes.

Next, let's find the time it takes to mow half the lawn in rabbit mode. Since it takes 40 minutes to mow the entire lawn in rabbit mode, it will take 40/2 = 20 minutes to mow half the lawn in rabbit mode.

"Let's denote the age of the younger twin as T, the age of the older twin as T+7, and the age of the triplet as t. 

Since there are two twins and one triplet, the total age is 2T + t = 44. 

We also know that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so T = t + 7.

Substituting T = t + 7 into the first equation, we get 2(t + 7) + t = 44.

Expanding the equation, we get 2t + 14 + t = 44.

Combining like terms, we get 3t + 14 = 44.

Subtracting 14 from both sides, we get 3t = 30.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get t = 10.

Now that we know the age of the triplet, we can find the age of the older twin. Since T = t + 7, T = 10 + 7 = 17.

"To find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we first need to find the cost of one candy. We know that Manolo bought 5 lollipops and 4 candies for $3.20. 

First, let's find the total cost of the lollipops: 5 lollipops * $0.40 = $2. 

Now, we subtract the cost of the lollipops from the total cost to find the cost of the candies: $3.20 - $2 = $1.20. 

Since there are 4 candies, we divide the total cost of the candies by 4 to find the cost of one candy: $1.20 / 4 = $0.30.

Now, we can find the total cost of 10 lollipops: 10 lollipops * $0.40 = $4.

"To find out how many coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years, we need to calculate their monthly savings and then multiply it by 12 (the number of months in a year) and 10 (the number of years).

Rong saves 20 coins per month. 
Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, which is 2/5 * 20 = 8 coins more than Rong. 
So, Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Now, let's calculate their total savings per year:
Rong's savings per year = 20 * 12 = 240 coins
Neil's savings per year = 28 * 12 = 336 coins

Now, let's calculate their total savings after 10 years:
Rong's total savings = 240 * 10 = 2400 coins

"To find the total bill, we first need to calculate the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check. The cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40. 

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, which means the total bill is the heartworm check divided by 0.6. Let's call the total bill 'x'. Then, 0.6x = $40 + $20 (vaccines) + heartworm check. However, we don't know the cost of the heartworm check yet, so we'll call it 'h'. 

The total bill is the sum of the vaccines and the heartworm check, so x = $40 + h. 

Now we can substitute this into the equation 0.6x = $40 + h. We get 0.6($40 + h) = $40 + h. 

Expanding the left side of the equation, we get 0.6 * $40 + 0.6h = $40 + h. 

0.6 * $40 is $24, so we have $24 + 0.6h = $40 + h. 

Now, let's subtract 0.6h from both sides of the equation to get $24 = $40 + 0.4h. 

Now, let's subtract $40 from both sides of the equation to get -$16 = 0.4h. 

Now, let's divide both sides of the equation by 0.4 to get h = -$16 / 0.4. 

h = -$16 / 0.4 = -$40. 

Now that we know the heartworm check is -$40, we can find the total bill. The total bill is $40 + $20 + $40 = $100. 

Now that we know the total bill, we can find out how much John leaves with. John brought $125, so he leaves with $125 - $100 = $25.

"To find out how many chairs Mia needs, we first need to determine the total number of chairs she has. Since there are 8 high chairs and the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs, we can calculate the number of regular chairs by multiplying 8 by 5.

8 high chairs * 5 = 40 regular chairs

Now, we add the number of high chairs and regular chairs to find the total number of chairs.

8 high chairs + 40 regular chairs = 48 chairs

Since there will be 42 adults and 15 babies attending, we need to find the total number of chairs required. Babies will use high chairs, so we add the number of adults and babies.

42 adults + 15 babies = 57 people

Since each person needs a chair, we need 57 chairs in total. To find out how many more chairs Mia needs, we subtract the number of chairs she has from the total number of chairs required.

Adam has 50 points.

Betty collected 30% more than Adam. To find 30% of 50, we multiply 50 by 0.3, which is 15. So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.

Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom, so Martha has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up the points collected by Adam, Betty, Martha, and Tom: 50 + 65 + 105 + 35 = 255 points.

"To find out how much Greta has left to spend, we need to calculate the amount she puts into her retirement account and her car payment, then subtract those amounts from her total paycheck.

First, let's calculate the amount she puts into her retirement account: 50% of $2400.00 is 0.5 x $2400.00 = $1200.00.

Next, let's calculate the amount she uses for her car payment: 20% of $2400.00 is 0.2 x $2400.00 = $480.00.

Now, let's subtract the amounts from her total paycheck: $2400.00 - $1200.00 - $480.00 = $720.00.

So, Greta has $720.00 left to spend.

The final answer is: $720.00"
"To find the number of pairs of pencils in the box, we first need to determine the total number of pencils in the box. Since there are 4 pencils missing, we subtract 4 from the total capacity of the box, which is 20.

20 (total capacity) - 4 (missing pencils) = 16 pencils

Now, we need to find the number of pairs of pencils. A pair consists of 2 pencils. To find the number of pairs, we divide the total number of pencils by 2.

16 (total pencils) / 2 (pencils per pair) = 8 pairs

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we first need to find out how many fireworks will be set off in total and then calculate 40% of that number. 

The city is setting off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks set off by the city is 15 * 20 = 300. 

Hannah will also set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks she will set off is 3 * 5 = 15.

The total number of fireworks set off is 300 (city) + 15 (Hannah) = 315.

Now, we need to find 40% of 315. To do this, we multiply 315 by 0.4. 

0.4 * 315 = 126.

So, Hannah will see 126 fireworks in total. 

The final answer is: 126"
"To find the total amount spent on snacks and drinks, we first need to determine the total number of people, the total number of drinks, and the total number of snacks.

Aiden and his 12 friends make 13 people. When they meet up with 7 more friends, the total number of people becomes 13 + 7 = 20.

Since each seat can hold one person, two drinks, and three snacks, the total number of drinks and snacks will be the same as the total number of people. 

So, the total number of drinks is 20, and the total number of snacks is 20.

The cost of each drink and snack is $2. Therefore, the total cost of drinks is 20 * $2 = $40, and the total cost of snacks is 20 * $2 = $40.

The total amount spent on snacks and drinks is $40 + $40 = $80.

The final answer is: $80"
"To find out how many pounds of gravel Gary's truck can carry, we first need to determine how much Gordy's truck can carry. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, and Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds, Gordy's truck can carry 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.

Now, we know that the combined capacity of all three trucks is 11,600 pounds. We already know that Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds and Gordy's truck can carry 4,800 pounds. To find out how much Gary's truck can carry, we subtract the combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity of all three trucks: 11,600 - (4,000 + 4,800) = 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800.

So, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many dumplings each male ate. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, and each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

There are 8 males in the group, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32.

There are 6 females in the group, and each female ate 3 dumplings, so the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.

The total number of dumplings eaten by both males and females is 32 + 18 = 50.

Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is equal to the total number of dumplings eaten. Therefore, Larry cooked 50 dumplings.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how much money Gerald had initially, we need to determine the total parts in the ratio and Gerald's share. The ratio is 3:2, so the total parts are 3 + 2 = 5.

Gerald's share is 3 out of 5 parts, so we can find his initial amount by multiplying the total amount ($100) by his share (3/5).

Gerald's initial amount = $100 * (3/5) = $60

Now, we know Gerald spent $10 on a book. To find out how much he has left, we subtract the amount spent from his initial amount.

Gerald's remaining amount = $60 - $10 = $50

The final answer is: $50"
"To find the speed of the turtle, we need to divide the speed of the cat by 5, since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle. 

Speed of the cat = 15 feet/second
Speed of the turtle = Speed of the cat / 5
Speed of the turtle = 15 / 5
Speed of the turtle = 3 feet/second

Now, we can find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds by multiplying its speed by the time.

Distance = Speed of the turtle * Time
Distance = 3 feet/second * 40 seconds
Distance = 120 feet

"To find out how many hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we need to first determine how much they need to raise per hour to reach their goal. 

The total amount they need to raise is $6300, and they have already raised $2100 in 3 hours. 

The amount they need to raise in total is $6300 - $2100 = $4200.

Since they need to raise $4200 in total and they have already raised $2100 in 3 hours, we can find the amount they need to raise per hour by dividing the remaining amount by the number of hours they have already worked.

$4200 / 3 hours = $1400 per hour.

Now, we can find the total number of hours they need to fundraise by dividing the total amount they need to raise by the amount they need to raise per hour.

$4200 / $1400 per hour = 3 hours.

However, this is the amount of time they need to raise the remaining $4200. Since they have already worked 3 hours, we need to add this to the remaining hours.

Total hours = 3 hours (already worked) + 3 hours (remaining) = 6 hours.

"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes, we first need to find the percentage used for industrial purposes and then subtract that from 100%.

First, we find the percentage of the river's water used by Colorado City: 40%.

Then, we find the percentage of that used for industrial purposes: 80% of 40% is 0.8 * 0.4 = 0.32 or 32%.

Now, we subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes from 100% to find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes: 100% - 32% = 68%.

"To find the total number of quarts made in 48 hours, we need to calculate the production rate of each type of ice cream and then add them together.

The factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours. To find the production rate, we divide the total quarts by the time:

100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts per hour (chocolate)

The factory makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours. To find the production rate, we divide the total quarts by the time:

50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts per hour (vanilla)

Now, we need to find the total production in 48 hours for each type of ice cream:

Chocolate: 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts
Vanilla: 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts

Adding the total production of both types of ice cream:

2400 quarts (chocolate) + 600 quarts (vanilla) = 3000 quarts

"To find Marcus' total bill, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he ordered and then apply the 10% discount.

First, let's calculate the total cost of each item:

- 5 croissants at $3.00 apiece: 5 x $3.00 = $15.00
- 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each: 4 x $2.50 = $10.00
- 3 mini quiches at $4.00 apiece: 3 x $4.00 = $12.00
- 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 apiece: 13 x $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items: $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Since Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him 10% off his purchase, we need to calculate the discount amount: 10% of $50.00 = 0.10 x $50.00 = $5.00

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total cost: $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many scoops Erin can buy with her $6.00. Since each scoop costs $1.50, we can divide the total amount of money Erin has by the cost of each scoop.

$6.00 ÷ $1.50 = 4

This means Erin can buy 4 scoops of ice cream. However, the deal is buy 2 scoops get 1 free, so we need to consider the free scoop as well. 

Since Erin can buy 4 scoops, and the deal is buy 2 get 1 free, she can buy 2 sets of 2 scoops and get 2 free scoops. This means she will have a total of 6 scoops.

"To find out how much more candy Amy has after two weeks, we need to calculate the total amount of candy each girl eats in two weeks and then subtract the difference from Amy's initial amount.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces.

Ginger starts with 100 pieces and eats 56, so she has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces left.

Amy starts with 100 pieces and eats 42, so she has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces left.

The difference in the amount of candy Amy and Ginger have is 58 - 44 = 14.

"To find out how much James saved, we need to calculate the cost of buying the blueberries at the store and compare it to the cost of picking them.

First, let's calculate the cost of picking the blueberries. The cost to go picking is $20, and then there's an additional $1.5 per pound. Since James picked 30 pounds, the total cost of picking is:

$20 (cost to go picking) + $1.5 (cost per pound) * 30 (pounds) = $20 + $45 = $65

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying the blueberries at the store. The cost is $2.5 per pound, and James picked 30 pounds, so the total cost is:

$2.5 (cost per pound) * 30 (pounds) = $75

To find out how much James saved, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying at the store:

$75 (cost at the store) - $65 (cost of picking) = $10

So, James saved $10 by picking the blueberries instead of buying them at the store.

Increase in price = 10% of $700 = 0.1 * $700 = $70
New price per computer = Original price + Increase in price = $700 + $70 = $770

Now, we can find the total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices.

Total number of computers = 500
Total amount paid = New price per computer * Total number of computers = $770 * 500 = $385,000

"To find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole, we need to calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole and subtract it from the total damage it will cause to his car.

The total damage to his car is $450. 

The cost of fixing the pothole includes the fine for unauthorized road maintenance, which is $120, and the cost of 3 buckets of asphalt, which is 3 * $25 = $75.

So, the total cost of fixing the pothole is $120 + $75 = $195.

Now, let's subtract the total cost of fixing the pothole from the total damage it will cause to his car: $450 - $195 = $255.

Therefore, Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole.

The final answer is: $255"
"To find the total number of chairs left, we need to subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the total number of chairs initially available.

Total normal chairs initially = 170
Total baby chairs initially = 23
Total chairs initially = 170 + 23 = 193

Normal chairs sent for repair = 20
Baby chairs sent for repair = 13
Total chairs sent for repair = 20 + 13 = 33

Total chairs left = Total chairs initially - Total chairs sent for repair
Total chairs left = 193 - 33
Total chairs left = 160

The final answer is: 160"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many slices were eaten by Bryce and his friends, and then subtract that from the total number of slices.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 5 people in total, including Bryce, and 2/3 of them ate 2/3 of their pizzas, we can calculate the number of slices eaten by this group. 

First, let's find out how many slices each person ate: 2/3 of 12 slices is 8 slices. 

Since there are 3 people in this group (Bryce and 2 friends), the total number of slices eaten by this group is 3 * 8 = 24 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 friends, and each pizza has 12 slices, we can calculate the number of slices eaten by this group. 

3/4 of 12 slices is 9 slices. Since there are 2 friends, the total number of slices eaten by this group is 2 * 9 = 18 slices.

Now, let's add the slices eaten by both groups: 24 + 18 = 42 slices.

The total number of slices in 5 pizzas is 5 * 12 = 60 slices.

To find the number of slices left, we subtract the number of slices eaten from the total number of slices: 60 - 42 = 18 slices.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages, we need to calculate 2/3 of the time it takes the cat. 

The cat eats the sausages in 30 minutes. 
2/3 of 30 minutes is (2/3) * 30 = 20 minutes.

So, the dog eats the sausages in 20 minutes.

To find the average time, we need to add the time taken by the cat and the dog and divide by 2.

Average time = (30 + 20) / 2 = 50 / 2 = 25 minutes.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to first convert the length of one of Topher's shoes into inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 8 feet into inches by multiplying 8 by 12, which equals 96 inches. Adding the 4 inches, we get a total of 100 inches for the length of one of Topher's shoes.

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. We can represent this as an equation: 100 = 9x + 10, where x is the length of one of Bobby's shoes.

To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us 90 = 9x. Now, we can divide both sides by 9 to find the value of x.

x = 90 / 9
x = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of windows smashed by Hannah, we need to calculate the number of windows from students' cars and teachers' cars separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of windows from students' cars. There are 64 students' cars with 4 windows each. A quarter of the students' cars' windows are smashed, which is 1/4 * 64 = 16 cars. Since each car has 4 windows, the total number of windows from students' cars is 16 * 4 = 64.

Next, let's find the number of windows from teachers' cars. There are 32 teachers' cars with 2 windows each. Three-fourths of the teachers' cars' windows are smashed, which is 3/4 * 32 = 24 cars. Since each car has 2 windows, the total number of windows from teachers' cars is 24 * 2 = 48.

Now, we add the number of windows from students' cars and teachers' cars to find the total number of windows smashed by Hannah. 64 + 48 = 112.

Total spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 150

Now, we can find the percentage of blue spools by dividing the total number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of blue spools = (60 / 150) * 100 = 40%

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we need to calculate the number of people who voted by 16:00 and subtract that from the total number of people.

At 8:00, 2/5 of 5000 people had voted by midday. 
2/5 * 5000 = 2000 people voted by midday.

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. First, we need to find the number of people who had not voted by midday. 
5000 - 2000 = 3000 people had not voted by midday.

Now, we need to find the number of people who voted by 16:00. 
2/3 of 3000 people voted by 16:00. 
2/3 * 3000 = 2000 people voted by 16:00.

Now, we need to find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00. 
3000 - 2000 = 1000 people had not voted by 16:00.

The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 1000."
"To find out how many packs of gum Parker will need, we need to calculate the total number of pieces of gum he will chew in 30 days and then divide that by the number of pieces in a pack.

Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day. To find the total number of pieces he will chew in 30 days, we multiply the number of pieces he chews per day by 30:

4 pieces/day * 30 days = 120 pieces

Now, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces in a pack to find out how many packs he will need:

120 pieces / 15 pieces/pack = 8 packs

So, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days.

"To determine the total number of s'mores needed, we need to calculate the number of s'mores for the kids and the adults separately and then add them together.

9 kids want 2 s'mores each, so the total number of s'mores for the kids is 9 * 2 = 18.

6 adults will eat 1 s'more each, so the total number of s'mores for the adults is 6 * 1 = 6.

The total number of s'mores needed is 18 (for kids) + 6 (for adults) = 24.

Each sleeve of graham crackers makes 8 s'mores, and there are 3 sleeves in a box. To find the total number of s'mores in a box, we multiply the number of sleeves in a box by the number of s'mores per sleeve: 3 * 8 = 24.

Since we need 24 s'mores in total and each box contains 24 s'mores, we will need 1 box of graham crackers.

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to first find their individual ages.

Given that Dora is 15 years old, we can find her father's age by using the information that her father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. 

Father's age = 2 * Dora's age + 8
Father's age = 2 * 15 + 8
Father's age = 30 + 8
Father's age = 38

Next, we need to find Dora's mother's age. We know that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father.

Mother's age = Father's age - 4
Mother's age = 38 - 4
Mother's age = 34

Now that we have the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother, we can find the total combined age.

Total combined age = Dora's age + Father's age + Mother's age
Total combined age = 15 + 38 + 34
Total combined age = 87

"To find the number of votes candidate C received, we first need to determine the number of votes candidate B received. 

Candidate A received 20% of the votes, which is 0.2 * 100 = 20 votes.

Candidate B received 50% more than candidate A's votes, so we need to calculate 50% of 20 and add it to 20. 
50% of 20 is 0.5 * 20 = 10. 
So, candidate B received 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

Since there are 100 voters in total, the total number of votes is 100. 
Candidate A and B together received 20 + 30 = 50 votes. 
Therefore, candidate C received 100 - 50 = 50 votes.

- Total students = 50
- Students who like to bake = 10
- Students who like to play basketball = 5
- Students who like to play music = 2 * (students who like to play basketball) = 2 * 5 = 10

We know that the rest of the students like to either play video games or play music. So, the number of students who like to play video games or music is the total number of students minus the students who like to bake and basketball.

Students who like to play video games or music = Total students - Students who like to bake - Students who like to play basketball
= 50 - 10 - 5
= 35

Since we know that the number of students who like to play music is 10, the number of students who like to play video games is the total number of students who like to play video games or music minus the number of students who like to play music.

Students who like to play video games = Students who like to play video games or music - Students who like to play music

"To find the number of boys in each class, we first need to find the total number of girls in both classes. Since 40% of the students in each class are girls, and there are 80 students in total, we can set up an equation to find the number of students in each class.

Let x be the number of students in each class. Then, 2x = 80 (since there are two classes with the same number of students).

Solving for x, we get x = 80 / 2 = 40.

Now that we know there are 40 students in each class, we can find the number of girls in each class. 40% of 40 is 0.4 * 40 = 16 girls in each class.

Since there are 40 students in each class and 16 are girls, the number of boys in each class is 40 - 16 = 24.

The vendor used to buy 500 tomatoes a day at $.5 each, so his daily cost was 500 * $.5 = $250.

With the new vendor, he buys the same 500 tomatoes at $.4 each, so his new daily cost is 500 * $.4 = $200.

The daily savings is the difference between the old cost and the new cost, which is $250 - $200 = $50.

To find the weekly savings, we multiply the daily savings by 7: $50 * 7 = $350.

However, the question asks for the number of groups needed to form if the activity requires 12 groups. Since we already know that 6 groups are needed for 54 students, we can calculate the number of students per group for 12 groups.

54 ÷ 12 = 4.5

Since we can't have a fraction of a student, we round down to 4 students per group. Now, we can calculate the total number of groups needed for 54 students.

54 ÷ 4 = 13.5

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we round up to 14 groups. However, the question asks for the number of more groups needed to form if the activity requires 12 groups.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, Lorraine has 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

First, she trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers. 
Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons from trading 27 small stickers.

Now, she has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

Next, she trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers. 
Since each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons, she gets 20 large buttons from trading 20 large stickers.

Now, she has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

She trades the rest of her large stickers (20) for small buttons. 
Since each large sticker is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons from trading 20 large stickers.

Now, let's calculate the total number of buttons she has. 
She has 27 small buttons from trading small stickers, 20 large buttons from trading large stickers, and 60 small buttons from trading large stickers.

1/3 * Total Pomeranians = 6

To find the total number of Pomeranians, we can multiply both sides by 3:

Total Pomeranians = 6 * 3
Total Pomeranians = 18

Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can set up the equation:

2/3 * Total Puppies = 18

To find the total number of puppies, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

Total Puppies = 18 * (3/2)
Total Puppies = 27

The final answer is: 27"
"To find out how much more Jayden needs to buy the camera, we first need to calculate how much money he has after receiving the money from his sister. 

Jayden initially had $70. His sister gave him half of her $90 allowance, which is $45. 

So, Jayden now has $70 + $45 = $115.

The camera costs $200. To find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the amount he has from the cost of the camera: $200 - $115 = $85.

Therefore, Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera.

The final answer is: $85"
"Let's break down the information given:

- The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250.
- The first house needs 1/2 of what the second house needs.
- The third house needs double what the first house needs.

Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house as 'x'. Then, the first house needs x/2 cases, and the third house needs 2 * (x/2) = x cases.

Since the total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250, we can set up the equation:

x/2 + x + x = 250

Combine like terms:

3x/2 = 250

Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

3x = 500

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 500/3
x = 166.67

Since x is the number of cases needed for the second house, the first house needs x/2 = 166.67/2 = 83.33 cases, and the third house needs x = 166.67 cases.

The third house needs 166.67 cases of shingles.

166.67"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of each person's purchase and then add them together.

Leila buys 3 cucumbers at $2 each, so her total cost is 3 x $2 = $6.

Jack buys 5 tomatoes at $1 each, so his total cost is 5 x $1 = $5.

Chase buys 1 head of lettuce at $3, so his total cost is $3.

Now, let's add their costs together: $6 (Leila) + $5 (Jack) + $3 (Chase) = $14.

"To find the number of pears George has, we need to calculate 45% of the number of bananas and add it to the number of bananas. 

First, let's find 45% of 200 bananas:
45% of 200 = 0.45 * 200 = 90

Now, let's add 90 to the number of bananas:
200 + 90 = 290

Since George has 45% more pears than bananas, the number of pears is 290.

To find the total number of fruits, we need to add the number of bananas and the number of pears:
200 (bananas) + 290 (pears) = 490

The final answer is: 490"
"To find out how many candy bars Marissa bought for Jimmy, we need to subtract the cost of the ball from the amount of money Marissa had initially. 

Marissa had $80 initially and spent $20 on the ball. 

$80 (initial money) - $20 (cost of the ball) = $60

Now, we need to find out how many candy bars Marissa can buy with $60, given that each candy bar costs $5.

$60 (remaining money) / $5 (cost of each candy bar) = 12

So, Marissa bought 12 candy bars for Jimmy.

"To find out how much money Sam needs to spend, we first need to determine how many kilograms of oranges he needs to make 4 liters of juice. Since Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges to make 1 liter of juice, he would need 5 * 4 = 20 kilograms of oranges to make 4 liters of juice.

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of the oranges. Each kilogram of oranges costs $3, so 20 kilograms would cost 20 * $3 = $60.

Therefore, Sam would have to spend $60 to make 4 liters of juice.

The final answer is: $60"
"To find out how many books Ahmed read, we need to divide the number of books Ezra read by 2, since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed. 

Ezra read 300 books, so Ahmed read 300 / 2 = 150 books.

Now, we need to add the 150 books Ezra decided to read to the total number of books they both read. 

Ezra read 300 + 150 = 450 books. 
Ahmed read 150 books. 

The total number of books they read altogether is 450 + 150 = 600.

"To find out how much Tanya earned, we need to calculate her earnings for each day separately and then add them together.

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Since she earns $15 per hour, her total earnings for the hours worked would be 5 hours * $15/hour = $75. Additionally, she earns $5 per day for teaching more than 3 classes, so she earns $5 for Monday. Therefore, her total earnings for Monday are $75 + $5 = $80.

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Her earnings for the hours worked would be 2 hours * $15/hour = $30. Since she teaches less than 3 classes, she doesn't earn the additional $5 per day. Therefore, her total earnings for Wednesday are $30.

Now, let's add her earnings for both days: $80 (Monday) + $30 (Wednesday) = $110.

The final answer is: $110"
"To find the difference in the number of vanilla scents sold compared to the fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of each type of scent sold.

The company sold 5 vanilla scents and there are 4 vanilla scents available, so the total number of vanilla scents sold is 5 * 4 = 20.

The company sold 2 fruity scents and there are 8 fruity scents available, so the total number of fruity scents sold is 2 * 8 = 16.

Now, we need to find the difference between the total number of vanilla scents sold and the total number of fruity scents sold. 

Difference = Total vanilla scents sold - Total fruity scents sold
Difference = 20 - 16
Difference = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for, we first need to calculate how much money he makes from selling the eggplants. 

He sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total amount he makes from eggplants is 20 * 3 = $60.

Since Bennet wants to make a total of $135, and he already makes $60 from selling the eggplants, he needs to make $135 - $60 = $75 from selling the corn.

He has 25 ears of corn, so to find out how much he should sell each ear for, we divide the total amount he needs to make from corn ($75) by the number of ears of corn (25). 

$75 / 25 = $3.

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To find the total time Tatiana has available for soccer, video games, and reading, we need to add the hours she has on Saturday and Sunday. 

Total time available = 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

She reads for 3 hours, so the remaining time for soccer and video games is:
Remaining time = Total time available - Time spent reading
Remaining time = 12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours

She plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time:
Time spent playing video games = 1/3 * 9 hours = 3 hours

Now, we can find the time spent playing soccer:
Time spent playing soccer = Remaining time - Time spent playing video games
Time spent playing soccer = 9 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours

To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we need to divide the time spent playing soccer by the total time available and multiply by 100:
Percentage of weekend spent playing soccer = (Time spent playing soccer / Total time available) * 100
Percentage of weekend spent playing soccer = (6 hours / 12 hours) * 100 = 50%

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how many pencils Anthony kept, we need to follow the steps of the problem.

Anthony started with 50 pencils. He gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon. 

1/2 of 50 is 50 * 0.5 = 25. So, Anthony gave 25 pencils to Brandon. 

Now, Anthony has 50 - 25 = 25 pencils left.

He then gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. 

3/5 of 25 is 25 * 3/5 = 25 * 0.6 = 15. So, Anthony gave 15 pencils to Charlie.

Now, Anthony has 25 - 15 = 10 pencils left.

Therefore, Anthony kept 10 pencils.

"To find the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time it takes for him to drive to the museum and back, and then add the time he spends at the museum.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Jack to drive to the museum:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 150 miles / 75 mph
Time = 2 hours

Since he drives to the museum and back, we need to multiply the time by 2:

Total driving time = 2 hours * 2 = 4 hours

Now, we add the time he spends at the museum to the total driving time:

Total time = Total driving time + Time at the museum
Total time = 4 hours + 6 hours
Total time = 10 hours

"To find out how many wheels Henry will need in total, we need to calculate the number of wheels required for the cars and the motorcycles separately and then add them together.

For the cars, Henry needs 4 wheels for each of the 57 cars. So, the total number of wheels required for the cars is 57 * 4 = 228.

For the motorcycles, Henry needs 2 wheels for each of the 73 motorcycles. So, the total number of wheels required for the motorcycles is 73 * 2 = 146.

Now, we add the total number of wheels required for the cars and the motorcycles: 228 + 146 = 374.

Since Henry has a box with 650 wheels, we subtract the total number of wheels required from the total number of wheels available: 650 - 374 = 276.

"To find the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection, we need to calculate the cost of the movies in series, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the remaining movies.

First, let's find the number of movies in series. A third of the movies are in series, so we can calculate this as follows:

600 movies / 3 = 200 movies in series

Since Mike can get these movies for only $6 of the cost of a normal movie, we can calculate the cost of the series as follows:

200 movies * $6 = $1200

Next, let's find the number of older movies. 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so we need to find the number of remaining movies first. We can do this by subtracting the number of movies in series from the total number of movies:

600 movies - 200 movies = 400 movies

Then, we can find the number of older movies:

400 movies * 0.4 = 160 movies

Since the older movies cost $5 each, we can calculate the cost of the older movies as follows:

160 movies * $5 = $800

Now, let's find the number of remaining movies. We can do this by subtracting the number of movies in series and the number of older movies from the total number of movies:

600 movies - 200 movies - 160 movies = 240 movies

Since the remaining movies cost $10 each, we can calculate the cost of the remaining movies as follows:

240 movies * $10 = $2400

Finally, we can find the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection by adding the cost of the movies in series, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the remaining movies:

$1200 + $800 + $2400 = $4400

The final answer is: $4400"

"To find the distance to their vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance they drove and the distance they hiked, then add them together.

First, let's find the distance they drove. They drove for 6 hours at an average speed of 50 miles per hour. 

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 50 * 6
Distance = 300 miles

Next, let's find the speed at which they hiked. They hiked at an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Half their driving speed is 50 / 2 = 25 miles per hour. 

Speed while hiking = 25 - 5
Speed while hiking = 20 miles per hour

Now, let's find the distance they hiked. They hiked for 1.5 hours at an average speed of 20 miles per hour.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 20 * 1.5
Distance = 30 miles

Now, let's add the distance they drove and the distance they hiked to find the total distance to their vacation spot.

Total distance = Distance driven + Distance hiked
Total distance = 300 + 30
Total distance = 330 miles

"To find the difference in their scores, we need to calculate the points each of them gets from enemies, berries, and the timer.

Let's assume Emma's score from enemies is x. Since Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, Ava's score from enemies will be x + 8.

Emma's score from berries is 3 (since she collects 3 berries), and Ava collects 3 + 3 = 6 berries, so Ava's score from berries is 6.

Now, let's consider the timer. The longer they take, the more points they get. Let's assume Emma finishes the level in t seconds. Then, Ava finishes the level in t + 4 seconds. The points from the timer for Emma will be 30t, and for Ava, it will be 30(t + 4).

The total score for Emma will be x + 3 + 30t, and for Ava, it will be x + 8 + 6 + 30(t + 4).

We can simplify Ava's total score to x + 14 + 30t + 120.

Now, let's find the difference between their scores. The difference will be (x + 14 + 30t + 120) - (x + 3 + 30t).

The x's cancel out, and the 30t's cancel out, so we're left with 14 + 120 - 3.

14 + 120 - 3 = 131.

"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we first need to determine the total cost of the two pizzas that are already known. Since two pizzas cost 30 dollars each, the total cost for these two pizzas is 2 * 30 = 60 dollars.

Now, we subtract the cost of these two pizzas from the total cost of all four pizzas to find the total cost of the other two pizzas. The total cost of all four pizzas is 64 dollars, so the total cost of the other two pizzas is 64 - 60 = 4 dollars.

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we can find the cost of each pizza by dividing the total cost of the other two pizzas by 2. The cost of each of the other two pizzas is 4 / 2 = 2 dollars.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of times they ride their bikes on usual days and the number of times they ride on the two extra days.

On usual days, they ride their bikes 3 times a day for 5 days. So, the total number of times they ride on usual days is 3 * 5 = 15.

On the two extra days, they ride twice the number of times they do on usual days, which is 2 * 3 = 6 times a day. Since there are two extra days, the total number of times they ride on these days is 6 * 2 = 12.

Now, we add the total number of times they ride on usual days and the extra days to get the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week. 

15 (usual days) + 12 (extra days) = 27

"Let's break down the information given:

Initially, Bob had 7 fish in his pond, with 3 orange and 4 white.

After buying fish from the pet store, he added them to his pond, and the number of orange fish became twice the number of white fish.

Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as 'w' and the number of orange fish he bought as 'o'.

The total number of fish in the pond after buying is 7 + w + o.

Since the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish, we can write the equation: 3 + o = 2(4 + w).

Simplifying the equation, we get: 3 + o = 8 + 2w.

Subtracting 3 from both sides, we get: o = 5 + 2w.

We also know that the total number of fish in the pond after buying is 7 + w + o. Since the total number of fish in the pond initially was 7, the number of fish Bob bought is w + o.

The total number of fish in the pond after buying is also equal to the sum of the initial fish and the fish bought, which is 7 + w + o.

Since the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish, we can also write the equation: 3 + o = 2(4 + w).

We can also write the equation for the total number of fish in the pond after buying: 7 + w + o = 7 + w + (5 + 2w).

Simplifying the equation, we get: 7 + w + o = 7 + w + 5 + 2w.

Combine like terms: 7 + w + o = 12 + 3w.

Subtract 7 from both sides: w + o = 5 + 3w.

Subtract w from both sides: o = 5 + 2w.

Now we have two equations: o = 5 + 2w and o = 5 + 2w.

We can substitute o = 5 + 2w into the equation 3 + o = 2(4 + w).

Simplifying the equation, we get: 7 + w + o = 7 + w + 5 + 2w.

Combine like terms: 7 + w + o = 12 + 3w.

Subtract 7 from both sides: w + o = 5 + 3w.

Subtract w from both sides: o = 5 + 2w.

Now we have two equations: o = 5 + 2w and 3 + o = 2(4 + w).

Substitute o = 5 + 2w into the equation 3 + o = 2(4 + w).

3 + (5 + 2w) = 2(4 + w).

Expand the equation: 8 + 2w = 8 + 2w.

Subtract 8 from both sides: 2w = 0.

Divide both sides by 2: w = 0.

"To calculate the weekly fuel consumption, we need to determine the total miles driven per week and then divide it by the car's fuel efficiency.

The one-way distance between home and office is 5 miles, and Andy drives to and from work, so the total daily distance is 5 * 2 = 10 miles.

Since Andy drives to work from Monday to Friday, the total weekly distance is 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.

Now, we can calculate the weekly fuel consumption by dividing the total weekly distance by the car's fuel efficiency: 50 miles/week / 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week.

The price of regular gas is $3/gallon, so the weekly fuel cost is 5 gallons/week * $3/gallon = $15/week.

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the total amount of money Carrie spent, we first need to calculate the amount of money she spent from the quarters and the twenties separately.

Carrie was given 140 quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, we can find the total amount of money she got from the quarters by multiplying the number of quarters by the value of each quarter:

140 quarters * $0.25 = $35

Carrie was given 10 twenties. Since each twenty is worth $20, we can find the total amount of money she got from the twenties by multiplying the number of twenties by the value of each twenty:

10 twenties * $20 = $200

Carrie spent 3/5 of the twenties, which is:

3/5 * $200 = $120

Now, we add the amount of money she spent from the quarters and the twenties to find the total amount of money she paid for lunch:

$35 (quarters) + $120 (twenties) = $155

The final answer is: $155"

"To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we first need to determine the total percentage of smart TVs and analog TVs sold. 

One-fourth of the TVs are smart TVs, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 TVs. 
One-eighth of the TVs are analog TVs, which is 1/8 * 40 = 5 TVs.

The total number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold is 10 + 5 = 15 TVs.

Since the rest of the TVs are OLED, we subtract the total number of smart and analog TVs from the total number of TVs sold: 40 - 15 = 25.

So, Samwell sold 25 OLED TVs.

The final answer is: 25"

"To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we first need to determine the temperature difference between the current temperature and the freezing point. 

The current temperature during the day is 45 degrees, and it's 33 degrees colder during the night. So, the temperature during the night is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees. 

Since the pipes will freeze at 32 degrees, we need to find the temperature difference between the night temperature and the freezing point: 12 - 32 = -20 degrees. However, since we can't have a negative number of logs, we'll consider the absolute value, which is 20 degrees.

Now, we know that each log heats the house up by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we'll divide the temperature difference by the heat each log provides: 20 / 5 = 4.

"To find out how much money Mike will have left over, we need to calculate the discounted price of the jeans first. 

The original price of the jeans is $40. 
The discount is 25% off, which means Mike will pay 75% of the original price. 
To find 75% of $40, we multiply $40 by 0.75 (since 100% - 25% = 75%). 
$40 * 0.75 = $30. 

So, Mike will pay $30 for the jeans. 
Now, we need to find out how much money he will have left over after paying with a $50 bill. 
To do this, we subtract the price of the jeans from the $50 bill. 
$50 - $30 = $20.

"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to first find the total number of employees after three months. 

The company initially has 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. So, after one month, the total number of employees will be 200 + 20 = 220. 
After two months, the total number of employees will be 220 + 20 = 240. 
After three months, the total number of employees will be 240 + 20 = 260.

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months. Each employee is paid a $4000 salary per month. So, the total amount of money paid to all employees after three months will be the total number of employees multiplied by the monthly salary of each employee, multiplied by the number of months.

Total amount = (260 employees * $4000) * 3 months
Total amount = 260 * 4000 * 3

"To find out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we first need to calculate their total earnings after working 20 hours.

Billy's initial hourly wage was $10. After 2 months, he got a raise of $0.50 per hour, making his new hourly wage $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. On his first anniversary, he got another raise of $1.00 per hour, making his final hourly wage $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50.

Billy's total earnings for 20 hours of work at $11.50 per hour is 20 * $11.50 = $230.

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary, which was $10. So, Sally's starting salary is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. 

Sally's total earnings for 20 hours of work at $10.50 per hour is 20 * $10.50 = $210.

To find out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings: $230 - $210 = $20.

"To find the total number of trees planted by the students, we need to multiply the number of classes by the average number of students per class and then multiply the result by 1 (since each student plants 1 tree).

Total students = 40 classes * 25 students/class = 1000 students
Total trees planted by students = 1000 students * 1 tree/student = 1000 trees

To find the total number of trees planted by the teachers, we need to multiply the number of classes by the average number of teachers per class and then multiply the result by 2 (since each teacher plants 2 trees).

Total teachers = 40 classes * 3 teachers/class = 120 teachers
Total trees planted by teachers = 120 teachers * 2 trees/teacher = 240 trees

Now, we add the total number of trees planted by the students and the teachers to find the overall total.

"To find out how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we first need to find the total number of stuffed animals she currently has. 

She has 3 puppies, 5 koalas, 2 zebras, and 4 frogs. 

Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Now, we need to find 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. 

30% of 14 = 0.3 * 14 = 4.2

Since we can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, we'll round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we'll consider the context of the problem. If Bubbles buys 5 stuffed goats, the percentage of stuffed goats will be 5/19, which is approximately 26.32%. This is less than 30%. If she buys 6 stuffed goats, the percentage of stuffed goats will be 6/19, which is approximately 31.58%. This is more than 30%. Therefore, Bubbles should buy 5 stuffed goats to get as close to 30% as possible.

The second car travels at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel:
Distance = Speed x Time = 70 miles/hour x 2 hours = 140 miles

Since the second car was initially passing the first car, we need to find the distance between them after 2 hours. The second car has traveled 140 miles, and the first car has traveled 120 miles. The distance between them is the difference between the two distances:
Distance = 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

"To find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we first need to determine how many square inches of mosaic he can make with the glass chips he has. 

Since it takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic, and each bag holds 72 chips, we need to find out how many chips Milo has in total. 

Milo has 2 bags of glass chips, so he has 2 * 72 = 144 chips.

Now, we need to find out how many square inches of mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make 1 square inch, we divide the total number of chips by 12 to get the total square inches of mosaic Milo can make: 144 / 12 = 12 square inches.

Since Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall, and he can make 12 square inches of mosaic, we need to find out how long the mosaic can be. To do this, we need to find the square root of the total square inches of mosaic Milo can make, since the area of a rectangle is length times width, and the height is 3 inches. 

The square root of 12 is approximately 3.46. However, since we are looking for the length, and the height is 3 inches, we can divide the square root of the total square inches by the height to get the length: 3.46 / 3 = 1.1533. 

However, since we are looking for the maximum length, we can round down to the nearest whole number, as we can't have a fraction of an inch.

"To find the total amount of tea consumed, we need to calculate the amount each group of students drank and add them together. 

Four students drank 1.5 quarts each, so the total amount they drank is 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts. 

16 students drank 2 quarts each, so the total amount they drank is 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

The total amount of tea consumed is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 10 quarts of tea left, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is 38 + 10 = 48 quarts.

To convert quarts to gallons, we know that 1 gallon is equal to 4 quarts. 

So, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party in gallons is 48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students at the end of each month and then subtract the initial number of students from it.

At the beginning of the year, there are 10 students.

- At the end of January, the number of students doubles, so there are 10 * 2 = 20 students.
- At the end of February, the number of students doubles again, so there are 20 * 2 = 40 students.
- At the end of March, the number of students doubles again, so there are 40 * 2 = 80 students.
- At the end of April, the number of students doubles again, so there are 80 * 2 = 160 students.
- At the end of May, the number of students doubles again, so there are 160 * 2 = 320 students.

"To find out how many marshmallows are left in the bag, we need to subtract the total number of marshmallows used and the ones dropped from the initial amount. 

John and DeSean each made 9 S'mores, so together they made 9 + 9 = 18 S'mores. This means they used 18 marshmallows. 

They also dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground. 

So, the total number of marshmallows used or dropped is 18 + 3 = 21.

Now, let's subtract the total number of marshmallows used or dropped from the initial amount: 35 - 21 = 14.

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, the number of S'mores they can make with the remaining marshmallows is 14.

Since there are two kids, we need to divide the remaining marshmallows by 2 to find out how many S'mores each kid can have: 14 / 2 = 7.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time each person plays and then determine how many quarters are used.

Jack can play for 20 minutes. His two friends who are worse can play for half as long, which is 20 / 2 = 10 minutes. The friend who is better can play for 1.5 times as long, which is 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes.

Since they play for 4 hours, we need to convert this to minutes: 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes.

Now, let's calculate how many times each person can play within 240 minutes:

- Jack: 240 minutes / 20 minutes/game = 12 games
- The two worse friends: 240 minutes / 10 minutes/game = 24 games each
- The better friend: 240 minutes / 30 minutes/game = 8 games

The total number of games played is 12 + 24 + 24 + 8 = 68 games.

Since each game costs 1 quarter, the total amount of money used is 68 quarters. To convert this to dollars, we multiply by 0.25 (since 1 dollar = 4 quarters): 68 * 0.25 = 17 dollars.

"Let's break down the information given. 

Let's denote the amount of citrus zest as Z, the amount of fragrance as F, the amount of salt as S, the amount of sugar as S (since it's the same as salt), and the amount of oil as O.

We know that Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, so F = Z.

We also know that she uses twice as much salt as zest, so S = 2Z.

Since she uses twice as much oil as salt, O = 2S.

Substituting S = 2Z into O = 2S, we get O = 2(2Z) = 4Z.

We also know that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, and it's made up of Z + F + S + S + O. Since F = Z and S = 2Z, we can substitute these values in to get Z + Z + 2Z + 2Z + 4Z = 10.

Combining like terms, we get 10Z = 10.

Dividing both sides by 10, we get Z = 1.

Now that we know Z = 1, we can find O by substituting Z into O = 4Z. O = 4(1) = 4.

The cost of the cows is 2 * $1500 = $3000.

Now, we add the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows together: $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

So, John spent $4500 in total. 

The final answer is: $4500"
"To find out how many more cupcakes Paul needs to buy, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs.

Paul needs 63 cupcakes in total. He already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes, so the total number of cupcakes he has is 8 + 40 = 48.

Now, let's subtract the number of cupcakes he has from the total number of cupcakes he needs: 63 - 48 = 15.

So, Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes.

The final answer is: 15"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars. So, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

2. Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find 20% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.2. 40 * 0.2 = 8. So, Joe sells 8 cars.

3. Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars to his mother.

4. Now, let's find out how many cars Joe has left. He started with 40 cars, sold 8, and gave away 16. So, he has 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 cars left.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to first determine the total amount raised by the students. Since the charity raised a total of $175,000 and $50,000 came from organizations, the amount raised by the students is $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000.

Now, we know that there are 20 students and they all raised the same amount. To find the amount each student raised, we divide the total amount raised by the number of students: $125,000 / 20 = $6,250.

The final answer is: $6,250"
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the first day and the second day, then add them together.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. 

On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she walked on the first day, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

To find the total time in minutes, we need to convert the hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes
4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes

Now, we add the time from both days:
480 minutes + 240 minutes = 720 minutes

The final answer is: 720"
"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to first determine the total number of cars in the parking lot after the first break. 

Initially, there were 50 cars. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, so the total number of cars after the first break is 50 + 20 = 70.

When Hunter got out of class for the lunch break, he realized that 1/2 the number of cars in the parking lot had gone. This means that 1/2 of 70 cars left, and the remaining 1/2 stayed. 

To find the number of cars that left, we multiply 70 by 1/2: 70 * 1/2 = 35. 

Since 1/2 of the cars left, the other 1/2 stayed. So, the number of cars that stayed is also 35.

Now, to find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to add the number of cars that left and the number of cars that stayed. However, the question asks for the total number of cars he counted during the lunch break, which is the number of cars that left plus the number of cars that stayed. 

The number of cars that left is 35, and the number of cars that stayed is also 35. Therefore, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is 35 + 35 = 70.

The final answer is: 70"
"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of tasks he completes in a day and then multiply it by the number of days he works in a week.

John does 30 cycles of work a day, and each cycle has 5 different tasks. So, the total number of tasks he completes in a day is:
30 cycles/day * 5 tasks/cycle = 150 tasks/day

Since each task pays $1.20, the total amount John makes in a day is:
150 tasks/day * $1.20/task = $180/day

John works a full 7-day week, so the total amount he makes in a week is:
$180/day * 7 days = $1260

The final answer is: $1260"
"To find the total points Sasha scored in both games, we need to calculate her points in each game and add them together.

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. 

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points in the first game. 

So, in the second game, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points.

To find the total points Sasha scored in both games, we add her points from each game: 14 + 4 = 18.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the total number of tins of cat food, we multiply the number of packages of cat food by the number of tins per package: 8 * 11 = 88 tins of cat food.

To find the total number of tins of dog food, we multiply the number of packages of dog food by the number of tins per package: 6 * 6 = 36 tins of dog food.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of tins of cat food and dog food: 88 - 36 = 52.

The final answer is: 52"
"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as 'x'. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is 341, which is the sum of the cards Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have. We can write the equation as x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341.

Combine like terms: 7x + 12 = 341.

Subtract 12 from both sides: 7x = 329.

Divide both sides by 7: x = 47.

Since PJ has x cards, PJ has 47 cards. Smendrick has 3x cards, so Smendrick has 3 * 47 = 141 cards. Becca has 3x + 12 cards, so Becca has 3 * 47 + 12 = 147 cards.

The final answer is: 147"
"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color of eggs and then add them together.

Cindy had 5 green eggs. 
She had twice as many blue eggs as green ones, so she had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.
She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.
She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add the number of eggs of each color together: 
5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27

The final answer is: 27"
"To find out how much Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total cost of shipping the book and subtract the refund amount from the purchase price.

First, let's calculate the shipping cost. The book weighs 4 pounds and the shipping company charges $0.35 per pound, so the weight-based shipping cost is 4 * $0.35 = $1.40. The book needs to be returned 20 miles away, and the shipping company charges $0.08 per mile, so the distance-based shipping cost is 20 * $0.08 = $1.60. The total shipping cost is $1.40 + $1.60 = $2.99.

Now, let's calculate the refund amount. Amazon will refund 75% of the book's purchase price, which is 0.75 * $32 = $24.

The total cost of shipping is $2.99, and the refund amount is $24. To find out how much Milly will lose, we subtract the refund amount from the shipping cost: $2.99 - $24 = -$21.91. However, since we can't lose a negative amount of money, we need to recalculate the refund amount as the difference between the shipping cost and the refund amount. 

The correct calculation is: $2.99 - $24 = -$21.01. However, since we can't lose a negative amount of money, we need to recalculate the refund amount as the difference between the shipping cost and the refund amount.

"To find out how much money Mulan has left, we need to calculate the total amount of money she spent and subtract that from the initial amount she had, including the money her father gave her.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Mulan had initially: $40 (initial money) + $100 (money from her father) = $140.

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money she spent: 2 pairs of jeans at $30 each = 2 x $30 = $60, and a bag for $20. So, the total amount spent is $60 + $20 = $80.

Now, let's subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $140 - $80 = $60.

Mulan has $60 left."
"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the production for the first three weeks and then determine the pattern.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.
In the second week, he produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.
In the third week, he produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Now, let's add up the production for the first three weeks: 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in total each month, we can find out how much he produces in the fourth week by subtracting the production of the first three weeks from the total production: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

The final answer is: 14,000"
"To find the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends on TikTok in a week and then multiply it by 4.

First, let's calculate the time Britany spends on TikTok in a week:

- She records 18 videos, each taking 4 minutes. So, the total time spent recording videos is 18 * 4 = 72 minutes.
- She spends 2 hours writing songs, which is 2 * 60 = 120 minutes.
- She spends 15 minutes each day for 6 days on makeup, so the total time spent on makeup is 15 * 6 = 90 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time spent on TikTok in a week: 72 + 120 + 90 = 282 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 282 minutes to hours by dividing by 60: 282 / 60 = 4.7 hours.

Now, let's multiply the time spent on TikTok in a week by 4 to find the time spent in a month: 4.7 * 4 = 18.8 hours.

The final answer is: 18.8"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the initial installation and the cost of the additional items.

The initial installation includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. However, Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures that she needs installed. Since the initial installation already includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, and 1 chandelier, we only need to consider the additional items.

Angela has 2 extra mirrors (6 - 4 = 2), 1 extra chandelier (2 - 1 = 1), and 10 extra pictures (20 - 10 = 10). The cost of the additional items is $15.00 per item.

The total number of additional items is 2 (mirrors) + 1 (chandelier) + 10 (pictures) = 13 items.

The cost of the additional items is 13 items * $15.00 per item = $195.00.

The initial installation cost is $129.00.

The total cost is $129.00 (initial installation) + $195.00 (additional items) = $324.00.

The final answer is: $324.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much money Anthony has saved, and then calculate 40% more than that amount.

First, we know that Eva has saved $20.00. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, so Anthony has saved $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.

Since Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony, we need to find 40% of $30.00 and add it to $30.00. 

40% of $30.00 is 0.4 x $30.00 = $12.00. 

So, Roy has saved $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

The final answer is: $42.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain in relation to Pompei's lifting capacity. 

First, we know that Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, and Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch. So, Saskay can lift a mountain 12 * 1 = 12 inches.

Next, Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Finally, Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 since there are 12 inches in a foot. 

480 / 12 = 40 feet.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the total distance traveled by Mason, we need to calculate the distance covered in the first 4 hours and the distance covered in the next 6 hours, and then add them together.

Distance = Speed x Time

For the first 4 hours:
Distance = 8 miles/hour x 4 hours = 32 miles

For the next 6 hours:
Distance = 8 miles/hour x 6 hours = 48 miles

Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the speed of the kangaroos. Since it takes 3 kangaroos 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can assume that the total distance is the same for all animals. 

Let's denote the speed of a kangaroo as 'k'. The total distance traveled by 3 kangaroos in 18 hours is 3k * 18. 

Now, we need to find the speed of the turtles, which is half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of a turtle is k/2.

Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of the kangaroos, it will take them twice as long to cover the same distance. 

The total distance is 3k * 18. The speed of the turtles is (k/2). 

The time it takes for the turtles to travel the same distance is (3k * 18) / (k/2). 

Simplifying the equation, we get (3k * 18) / (k/2) = (3 * 18 * 2) / 1 = 108 hours.

The final answer is: 108"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Kora made 20 dishes. 
Rory made 20 more clay dishes than Kora, so Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes. 
Jada made twice as many clay dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

To find the total number of clay dishes they all made together, we need to add the number of dishes each person made. 
Total = Kora's dishes + Rory's dishes + Jada's dishes 
Total = 20 + 40 + 80 
Total = 140

The final answer is: 140"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The laptop costs $600.
2. The price is reduced by $200 if she trades in her old laptop, so the new price is $600 - $200 = $400.
3. Erika has some savings in her purse, let's call it x.
4. She earned $150 from her part-time job.
5. Her mom gave her $80.
6. After all these, she only needs $50 more to buy the laptop.

We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

x + 150 + 80 = 400 + 50

Combine the constants on the left side:
x + 230 = 450

Subtract 230 from both sides to solve for x:
x = 220

So, Erika has $220 in her purse."
"To find out how many slices Adam has left, we first need to calculate the total number of slices he has. 

3 large apples can be sliced into 3 * 5 = 15 slices. 
5 small apples can be sliced into 5 * 3 = 15 slices. 

In total, Adam has 15 + 15 = 30 slices. 

Since Adam eats 15 slices, we subtract the number of slices he ate from the total number of slices: 
30 - 15 = 15

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how many cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to calculate the total amount of milk the farmer currently produces. 

The farmer extracts 5 liters of milk a day from each cow, and he has 3 cows. So, the total amount of milk he currently produces is 5 liters/cow * 3 cows = 15 liters/day.

To find out how many more cows he needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we subtract the current production from the target production: 25 liters/day - 15 liters/day = 10 liters/day.

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, we need to find out how many cows are needed to produce 10 liters of milk a day. We can do this by dividing the target production by the amount of milk each cow produces: 10 liters/day / 5 liters/cow = 2 cows.

The farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the length of each used part and subtract it from the original length of the glue stick.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so the used part is 1 - 1/6 = 5/6. The length of the used part is 5/6 * 12 = 10 millimeters.

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so the used part is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3. The length of the used part is 1/3 * 12 = 4 millimeters.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so the used part is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2. The length of the used part is 1/2 * 12 = 6 millimeters.

Now, let's calculate the total length of the used parts: 10 + 4 + 6 = 20 millimeters.

The total length of the glue sticks is 3 * 12 = 36 millimeters.

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 36 - 20 = 16 millimeters.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much money Gabriel still needs, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he wants to buy and subtract the amount of money he already has.

The total cost of the items is $10000 (car) + $800 (phone) = $10080.

Gabriel has $5000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200, so he has a total of $5000 + $200 = $5200.

Now, let's subtract the amount of money Gabriel has from the total cost of the items: $10080 - $5200 = $3580.

So, Gabriel still needs $3580."

"To find out how much money Craig has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent and subtract it from the initial amount.

Craig initially has 2 twenty-dollar bills, which is 2 * $20 = $40.

He buys 6 squirt guns for $2 each, so the total cost of squirt guns is 6 * $2 = $12.

He also buys 3 packs of water balloons for $3 each, so the total cost of water balloons is 3 * $3 = $9.

The total amount Craig spent is $12 + $9 = $21.

Now, let's subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $40 - $21 = $19.

Craig has $19 left.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so if we let the number of socks Jack has be 'x', then Peter has 2x socks.
4. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so the number of socks Jack has is 60 / 2 = 30.
5. Since Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, and Jack has 30 socks, Peter has 2 * 30 = 60 socks.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:
- Total socks: Peter's socks + Jack's socks = 60 + 30 = 90
- Total dishes: Peter's dishes + Jack's dishes = 30 + 60 = 90

The total number of socks and dishes they have together is 90 + 90 = 180."
"To find the number of students good at math, we need to consider the total number of students and the number of students good at both subjects. 

Let's denote the number of students good at both math and English as x. We know that the total number of students is 20, and the number of students good at math only is 5, and the number of students good at English only is 8.

We can set up the equation: 5 (math only) + 8 (English only) + x (both) = 20 (total)

Simplifying the equation, we get: 13 + x = 20

Subtracting 13 from both sides, we get: x = 7

This means that 7 students are good at both math and English. To find the total number of students good at math, we need to add the number of students good at math only (5) and the number of students good at both subjects (7).

Total number of students good at math = 5 (math only) + 7 (both) = 12

"To find out how many groups can perform, we need to calculate the total available time for performances. The concert is 2 hours long, which is 120 minutes. Subtracting the 10-minute intermission, we have 120 - 10 = 110 minutes left for performances.

Each group takes 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit the stage, which totals 10 minutes per group. 

Now, we can divide the total available time for performances (110 minutes) by the time each group takes (10 minutes) to find out how many groups can perform: 110 / 10 = 11.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the interest earned each year and add it to the principal amount.

The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount, which is 0.75 * $300 = $225 per year.

After the first year, the total amount will be $300 (initial investment) + $225 (interest) = $525.

After the second year, the interest will be 0.75 * $525 = $393.75. The total amount will be $525 (previous balance) + $393.75 (interest) = $918.75.

After the third year, the interest will be 0.75 * $918.75 = $688.0625. The total amount will be $918.75 (previous balance) + $688.0625 (interest) = $1606.8125.

To find the number of floral shirts with no buttons, we need to find the total number of floral shirts and subtract the number of floral shirts with buttons.

Total floral shirts = 50
Floral shirts with buttons = 20
Floral shirts with no buttons = 50 - 20 = 30

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars.

"To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we first need to determine how many goats were sold from each farm. 

From Farm X, Mr. Smith sold 10 goats. 
From Farm Y, he sold twice as many goats as from Farm X, which is 2 * 10 = 20 goats.

Now, let's calculate the number of goats left in each farm. 
In Farm X, there were initially 55 goats and 10 were sold, so the number of goats left is 55 - 10 = 45.
In Farm Y, there were initially 45 goats and 20 were sold, so the number of goats left is 45 - 20 = 25.

To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the number of goats left in Farm X and Farm Y: 45 + 25 = 70.

The cost of 3 baskets of green food is 3 * $25 = $75.

The cost of 3 baskets of red food is 3 * $18 = $54.

The total cost before discount is $75 + $54 = $129.

Since you get $2 off for each basket of red food, the total discount is 3 * $2 = $6.

The total cost after discount is $129 - $6 = $123.

The final numerical answer is: $123"
"To find the time it takes to clean one-half of the rooms, we first need to determine the number of rooms that is half of 90. 

90 / 2 = 45 rooms

Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, we multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room.

45 rooms * 20 minutes/room = 900 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours

"Let's break down the information given:

1. I am three years younger than my brother, so if my age is x, my brother's age is x + 3.
2. I am 2 years older than my sister, so my sister's age is x - 2.
3. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so my mom's age is 3(x + 3) - 1.
4. When you add all our ages, you get 87: x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + 3(x + 3) - 1 = 87.

Combine like terms: 
x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 9 - 1 = 87
Combine x terms: 
6x + 9 = 87

Subtract 9 from both sides: 
6x = 78

Divide both sides by 6: 
x = 13

So, I am 13 years old.

"To find out how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs, we first need to determine the total number of glue sticks required for the students. Since each student needs 2 glue sticks, we multiply the number of students by 2.

Total glue sticks needed = 27 students * 2 glue sticks/student = 54 glue sticks

Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks needed by 8 to find out how many packs are required.

Number of packs needed = Total glue sticks needed / 8 glue sticks/pack = 54 / 8 = 6.75

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, we round up to the nearest whole number to ensure every student gets 2 glue sticks. However, in this case, we need to consider that he can have some extra glue sticks left over, so we round up to the nearest whole number.

Number of packs needed = 7

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water passing through the river at the given point over the three days.

On the first day, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

On the second day, the amount of water passing through the river doubles, so it becomes 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.

On the third day, the amount of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons, so it becomes 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

To find the total amount of water passing through the river at that point over the three days, we need to add the amounts from each day: 4000 + 8000 + 14000 = 24000 gallons.

The total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 24000 gallons.

The final answer is: 24000"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of exponential growth. Since each infected person infects six others, we can model the growth of the infected population using the formula for exponential growth:

N(t) = N0 * (1 + r)^t

where:
- N(t) is the number of infected people at time t
- N0 is the initial number of infected people (10 in this case)
- r is the growth rate (6 new infections per infected person)
- t is the time in days

However, in this scenario, we need to consider that each infected person infects six others, so the growth rate is not a simple multiplication factor. Instead, we can model the growth using a geometric series:

N(t) = N0 * (1 + 6)^t

We need to calculate the number of infected people after three days. Plugging in the values, we get:

N(3) = 10 * (1 + 6)^3
N(3) = 10 * (7)^3
N(3) = 10 * 343
N(3) = 3430

However, this calculation assumes that each infected person infects six others on the same day, which is not the case. The correct approach is to calculate the number of new infections each day and add them to the total.

Day 1: 10 * 6 = 60 new infections, total = 70
Day 2: 70 * 6 = 420 new infections, total = 490
Day 3: 490 * 6 = 2940 new infections, total = 3430

The correct total number of infected people after three days is 3430 + 10 (initially infected) = 3440.

The final answer is: 3440"
"To find out how much money Julieta received, we need to calculate 10% of Rafaela's total tips and subtract it from Rafaela's total tips. 

First, let's find out how much money Rafaela received. Since each customer gave her a $20 tip and there were 40 customers, Rafaela's total tips would be 40 * $20 = $800.

Now, let's calculate 10% of $800. 10% of $800 is 0.1 * $800 = $80.

Since Julieta received 10% less money than Rafaela, we need to subtract $80 from Rafaela's total tips. So, Julieta's total tips would be $800 - $80 = $720.

Now, let's find out the total tips received by both Julieta and Rafaela. Total tips = Rafaela's tips + Julieta's tips = $800 + $720 = $1520.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Claire earns 1 badge per month.
- Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge than Claire, so Amber earns 1/2 badge per month.
- Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so Wendy earns 3 badges per month.

In a 1-year time frame (12 months), the number of badges earned by each girl would be:
- Claire: 1 badge/month * 12 months = 12 badges
- Amber: 1/2 badge/month * 12 months = 6 badges
- Wendy: 3 badges/month * 12 months = 36 badges

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a 1-year time frame, we subtract the number of badges earned by Amber from the number of badges earned by Wendy:
36 badges (Wendy) - 6 badges (Amber) = 30 badges

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how much Paige raised, we need to calculate the total number of slices she baked and sold. 

First, let's find out how many hours she baked. She baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is 5 hours.

Since she can bake 2 loaves per hour, and each hour she baked for 5 hours, she baked a total of 2 * 5 = 10 loaves.

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices is 10 * 8 = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, and she sold all 80 slices. To find the total amount raised, we need to convert the cents to dollars. There are 100 cents in a dollar, so 50 cents is 0.5 dollars.

Now, we multiply the number of slices by the price per slice: 80 * 0.5 = 40 dollars.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find the total number of coins Gretchen has, we first need to determine the number of silver coins she has. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, and she has 70 gold coins, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship.

Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. Then, the number of gold coins can be represented as 'x + 30'. We know that the number of gold coins is 70, so we can set up the equation:

x + 30 = 70

To solve for 'x', we subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:

x = 70 - 30
x = 40

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins. To find the total number of coins, we add the number of silver coins to the number of gold coins:

Total coins = Number of silver coins + Number of gold coins
Total coins = 40 + 70
Total coins = 110

"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we first need to determine the total number of burritos consumed. 

There were 50 students at the picnic, and each student was given 10 burritos. So, the total number of burritos given to the students is 50 * 10 = 500.

Mr. George also ate 20 burritos. 

The total number of burritos consumed is 500 (given to students) + 20 (eaten by Mr. George) = 520.

Since there were 600 burritos ordered initially, the total number of leftover burritos is 600 - 520 = 80.

"To find the number of yellow cars, we first need to determine the number of green and blue cars. 

We know there are 12 red cars. The rink has 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so the number of green cars is 12 - 2 = 10.

The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars, so the number of blue cars is 3 * 10 = 30.

Now, we know the total number of red, green, and blue cars: 12 (red) + 10 (green) + 30 (blue) = 52.

Since the rink has 75 cars in total, the number of yellow cars is 75 - 52 = 23.

"Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as F, the number of books Anne has as A, and the number of books Sofie has as S. 

We are given that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so S = A + 25. 

We are also given that Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so A = F - 12.

We can substitute the second equation into the first one to get S = (F - 12) + 25, which simplifies to S = F + 13.

We are also given that together, Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have 85 books, so S + A + F = 85. 

Substituting S = F + 13 and A = F - 12 into the equation, we get (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85.

Combining like terms, we get 3F + 1 = 85.

Subtracting 1 from both sides, we get 3F = 84.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get F = 28.

The weight of the carrots Daisy bought is 7 pounds."
"To find out how much Greg will spend on Jello, we first need to determine how many Jello cups he needs to buy. Since there will be 30 kids and each kid will have 4 Jello cups, we multiply the number of kids by the number of cups each kid will have: 30 kids * 4 cups/kid = 120 cups.

Since one 3-ounce box of Jello makes 10 small Jello cups, we need to find out how many boxes Greg needs to buy. We divide the total number of cups needed by the number of cups one box makes: 120 cups / 10 cups/box = 12 boxes.

Now, we need to find out how much one box costs. The cost of one box is $1.25. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box: 12 boxes * $1.25/box = $15.

"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we first need to find out how much Keenan spends in a month. Since Madeline pays 60% of the total cost, Keenan pays 40% of the total cost. 

40% of $400 is calculated as 0.4 * 400 = $160. 

Since there are 4 weeks in a four-week month, we can find out how much Keenan spends per week by dividing the total monthly cost by 4. 

$160 / 4 = $40.

"To find out how many pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he ate on each day and add them together.

On the first day, he ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces. To find 2/5 of 60, we multiply 60 by 2 and divide by 5:
60 * 2 = 120
120 / 5 = 24

So, on the first day, he ate 24 pieces.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces. To find the remaining pieces after the first two days, we subtract the pieces eaten on the first two days from the total:
60 - 24 - 10 = 26

Now, we need to find 7/13 of 26:
26 * 7 = 182
182 / 13 = 14.15 (round to 14, since you can't eat a fraction of a piece)

So, on the third day, he ate 14 pieces.

Now, let's add up the pieces eaten on each day:

"To find the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water, we first need to determine the cost per bottle of soda and the cost per bottle of water.

The cost of 7 bottles of soda is $21.00, so the cost per bottle of soda is $21.00 / 7 = $3.00 per bottle.

The cost of 4 bottles of water is $8.00, so the cost per bottle of water is $8.00 / 4 = $2.00 per bottle.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:

Cost of 3 bottles of soda = 3 * $3.00 = $9.00
Cost of 2 bottles of water = 2 * $2.00 = $4.00
Total cost = $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00

The total cost will be $13.00."
"To find out how much money David has left after buying the bolts, we need to calculate the total cost of the bolts and subtract that from the initial amount of money he has.

The cost of each bolt is $0.03, and David wants to buy 16 bolts. 

Total cost of bolts = Number of bolts * Cost per bolt
Total cost of bolts = 16 * $0.03
Total cost of bolts = $0.48

Now, we subtract the total cost of the bolts from the initial amount of money David has:

Initial amount of money = $12.48
Total cost of bolts = $0.48
Money left = Initial amount of money - Total cost of bolts
Money left = $12.48 - $0.48
Money left = $12.00

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To find out how much Ella would earn after 12 hours, we need to determine her hourly rate. We can do this by dividing the amount she earned by the number of hours she worked.

Ella earned $33 for 3 hours of work. 

Hourly rate = Total earnings / Number of hours worked
Hourly rate = $33 / 3 hours
Hourly rate = $11 per hour

Now that we know her hourly rate, we can calculate her earnings for 12 hours.

Earnings for 12 hours = Hourly rate * Number of hours worked
Earnings for 12 hours = $11 per hour * 12 hours
Earnings for 12 hours = $132

The final answer is: $132"
"To find out how many marbles Paul has left, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, Paul has 52 marbles. His friend gave him 28 marbles, so now he has 52 + 28 = 80 marbles.

Then, he lost 1/4 of his marbles. To find 1/4 of 80, we multiply 80 by 1/4, which is the same as dividing 80 by 4. 

80 / 4 = 20

So, Paul lost 20 marbles. To find out how many marbles he has left, we subtract 20 from 80.

80 - 20 = 60

Therefore, Paul has 60 marbles left.

"To find Amy's total score, we need to calculate the points she gets from each type of question and add them together.

First, let's calculate the points from the multiple-choice questions. Amy correctly answers 80% of the 10 multiple-choice questions, so she gets 0.8 * 10 = 8 points from the multiple-choice questions.

Next, let's calculate the points from the true/false questions. Amy correctly answers 90% of the 20 true/false questions, so she gets 0.9 * 20 = 18 points from the true/false questions.

Now, let's calculate the points from the long-answer questions. Amy correctly answers 60% of the 5 long-answer questions, so she gets 0.6 * 5 = 3 points from the long-answer questions.

Finally, we multiply the points from each type of question by their respective point values and add them together. The multiple-choice questions are worth 1 point each, the true/false questions are worth 1 point each, and the long-answer questions are worth 5 points each. So, we get:

(8 * 1) + (18 * 1) + (3 * 5) = 8 + 18 + 15 = 41

"To find out how much money Isaias bought the chickens for, we first need to determine how many chickens he plans to sell. Since he has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them, we can calculate the number of chickens he plans to sell as follows:

Number of chickens to sell = 300 * (3/5)
= 300 * 0.6
= 180 chickens

Since Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000 by selling the chickens at $50 each, we can calculate the total revenue he expects to get from selling the chickens:

Total revenue = Number of chickens to sell * Price per chicken
= 180 * $50
= $9000

Now, to find out how much money Isaias bought the chickens for, we need to subtract the profit from the total revenue:

Total cost = Total revenue - Profit
= $9000 - $2000
= $7000

So, Isaias bought the chickens for $7000.

The final answer is: $7000"
"To find out how many glasses Micah and Mitchell sold, we need to divide the total number of glasses sold by 2, since they sold an equal number. 

Total glasses sold = 32
Number of people who sold an equal number of glasses = 2 (Micah and Mitchell)
Glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell = Total glasses sold / 2 = 32 / 2 = 16

Since Julie sold 14 glasses, we can find out how many more glasses she sold than Micah by subtracting the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold.

Glasses sold by Julie = 14
Glasses sold by Micah = 16
Difference = Glasses sold by Julie - Glasses sold by Micah = 14 - 16 = -2

The final answer is: $\boxed{-2}$"

"To find out how much money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope, we need to calculate the total amount of money she gets from selling the rope and then subtract the cost of the new rope.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Sarah gets from selling the rope. The rope is 20 meters long, and her friend is buying it for $2 a meter. 

Total money from selling the rope = Length of the rope * Price per meter
Total money from selling the rope = 20 * $2
Total money from selling the rope = $40

Now, let's calculate the cost of the new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 a meter, and Sarah wants to buy a rope of the same length (20 meters).

Cost of the new rope = Length of the new rope * Price per meter
Cost of the new rope = 20 * $1.5
Cost of the new rope = $30

Now, let's subtract the cost of the new rope from the total money Sarah gets from selling the rope to find out how much money she will have left over.

Money left over = Total money from selling the rope - Cost of the new rope
Money left over = $40 - $30
Money left over = $10

"To solve this problem, we need to first find Melanie's current age. Since in 10 years, she will be 18 years old, we can subtract 10 from 18 to find her current age.

Current age = 18 - 10 = 8 years

Now, we need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her present age. Let's assume the number of years is 'x'. 

In 'x' years, her age will be 8 + x. This age should be thrice her current age, which is 3 * 8 = 24.

So, we can set up the equation: 8 + x = 24

Now, we can solve for 'x' by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation.

x = 24 - 8
x = 16

Therefore, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's find the cost of the chicken. Since each pack of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, and the 5 packs of bacon cost $10, the cost of one pack of bacon is $10 / 5 = $2. Therefore, the cost of one pack of chicken is $2 * 2 = $4. Since Kelly has 6 packs of chicken, the total cost of the chicken is 6 * $4 = $24.

Next, let's find the cost of the strawberries. Each pack of strawberries costs $4, and Kelly has 3 packs, so the total cost of the strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.

Now, let's find the cost of the apples. Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is $4 / 2 = $2. Since Kelly has 7 packs of apples, the total cost of the apples is 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items in Kelly's cart: $10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60.

Finally, let's subtract the total cost of the items from Kelly's budget: $65 - $60 = $5.

"Let's break down the information given. Elaina's final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, and the total runtime of the final concert, including the encore, is 65 minutes. 

Let's denote the runtime of her usual concerts as 'x'. Since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, its runtime would be 2x. 

The total runtime of the final concert, including the encore, is 65 minutes. This can be represented as: 2x + 15 = 65.

To find the value of 'x', we need to isolate it. Subtract 15 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 65 - 15. 

2x = 50

Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for 'x': x = 50 / 2.

x = 25

The runtime of her usual concerts is 25 minutes.

"To find the number of pairs of microphones that can be arranged, we first need to find the total number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs. 

Let's assume the total number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs is 'x'. Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the total number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs is 2x.

However, we know that the singer has 50 microphones in total. Since 20% of the microphones won't find any space to fit in, the number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs is 80% of 50, which is 0.8 * 50 = 40.

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs of microphones that can be arranged is 40 / 2 = 20.

"To find the total number of birds, we need to calculate the number of birds in each group and add them together.

First, Jerry counts 6 birds nesting in the bushes.

Next, 2/3rd of 6 birds are flying overhead. To find 2/3rd of 6, we multiply 6 by 2 and divide by 3: (6 * 2) / 3 = 12 / 3 = 4. So, 4 birds are flying overhead.

Then, Jerry sees 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. To find the total number of birds feeding, we multiply 3 by 8: 3 * 8 = 24.

Now, we add the number of birds in each group together: 6 (nesting) + 4 (flying) + 24 (feeding) = 34.

"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to determine the speed of the thingamabob first. Since the whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob, and the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, we can find the speed of the thingamabob by dividing the speed of the whatchamacallit by 11.

Speed of thingamabob = Speed of whatchamacallit / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 121 / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 11 meters per second

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig by multiplying the speed of the thingamabob by 5.

Speed of whirligig = Speed of thingamabob * 5
Speed of whirligig = 11 * 5

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the price of one carrot as 'c'. Since the yogurt is half the price of the salad, the price of the yogurt is $6 / 2 = $3.

Ellen eats two carrots every day, so the total cost of carrots is 2c.

The total cost of the salad and the yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9.

Since Ellen pays a total of $11 for her goods, the cost of the carrots can be found by subtracting the cost of the salad and the yogurt from the total cost: 2c = $11 - $9 = $2.

To find the price of one carrot, we divide the total cost of carrots by 2: c = $2 / 2 = $1.

"To find out how much Mark makes a week, we need to calculate his new hourly wage and then multiply it by the number of hours he works in a week.

Mark used to make $10 an hour, but his pay was raised by $2 per hour. So, his new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12 per hour.

Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so the total number of hours he works in a week is 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week.

Now, we can multiply his new hourly wage by the number of hours he works in a week to find his weekly earnings: $12/hour * 40 hours/week = $480/week.

"Let's break down the information given. We know that Tasha made $80 in total from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. We also know that Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work. 

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. Then, the number of times she mowed Kamala's lawn is 3x, and the number of times she mowed Alba's lawn is 5x.

The total amount Tasha made from mowing lawns is the sum of the payments from Joe, Kamala, and Alba. Since we know Joe paid $6, we can express the total amount from mowing lawns as 6 + 3x*6 + 5x*6.

We can simplify this expression to 6 + 18x + 30x = 6 + 48x.

We know that the total amount Tasha made from mowing lawns and lemonade sales is $80. So, we can set up the equation 6 + 48x = 80.

Now, let's solve for x. Subtract 6 from both sides of the equation to get 48x = 74.

Divide both sides by 48 to get x = 74/48 = 1.54 (approximately). However, since the number of times Tasha mowed lawns must be a whole number, we can try integer values of x.

Let's try x = 1. If x = 1, then the total amount from mowing lawns is 6 + 48*1 = 54. This is less than $80, so x must be greater than 1.

Let's try x = 2. If x = 2, then the total amount from mowing lawns is 6 + 48*2 = 102. This is greater than $80, so x must be less than 2.

Since x must be a whole number, we can try x = 1.5. However, this is not a whole number, so we can try x = 1 or x = 2.

Since x = 1 results in a total amount from mowing lawns that is less than $80, and x = 2 results in a total amount from mowing lawns that is greater than $80, we can try x = 1.5. However, this is not a whole number.

Let's try x = 1 and x = 2 again. If x = 1, then the total amount from mowing lawns is 6 + 48*1 = 54. If x = 2, then the total amount from mowing lawns is 6 + 48*2 = 102.

Since the total amount from mowing lawns and lemonade sales is $80, and the total amount from mowing lawns is either 54 or 102, the total amount from lemonade sales is either 80 - 54 = 26 or 80 - 102 = -22.

Since the total amount from lemonade sales cannot be negative, the total amount from mowing lawns must be 54. Therefore, the total amount from lemonade sales is 80 - 54 = 26.

"Let's break down the information given. Martha initially had some notebooks, but we don't know the exact number. However, we know that Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha. 

Let's represent the number of notebooks Martha had initially as 'x'. Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, Joseph had 3x notebooks.

Martha bought 5 more notebooks, and now she has a total of 7 notebooks. This means that the initial number of notebooks she had (x) plus the 5 she bought equals 7. So, we can write the equation as x + 5 = 7.

To find the value of x, we subtract 5 from both sides of the equation: x = 7 - 5, which gives us x = 2. 

Now that we know Martha had 2 notebooks initially, we can find out how many notebooks Joseph had. Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, Joseph had 3 * 2 = 6 notebooks.

To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract the number of notebooks Joseph has from the number of notebooks Martha has: 7 - 6 = 1.

Dijana rowed 50 miles. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. To find 1/5 of Dijana's distance, we multiply 50 by 1/5, which is 10 miles. 

So, Anis rowed 50 + 10 = 60 miles. 

Now, to find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we add their individual distances: 50 (Dijana) + 60 (Anis) = 110 miles.

Initially, Susan had 100 cookies. Her husband took 4 cookies, so we subtract 4 from 100: 100 - 4 = 96 cookies.

Now, we need to divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews, which is 6. 

To do this, we divide 96 by 6: 96 ÷ 6 = 16.

So, each of Susan's nephews will get 16 cookies.

So, Denise's total pages read is 10 (yesterday) + 18 (today) = 28 pages.

Daniel's total pages read is 13 (yesterday) + 0 (today) = 13 pages.

The difference in the number of pages read by Denise and Daniel is 28 - 13 = 15.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many bowls of soup are needed for dinner and then find out how many bowls are left over. 

For dinner, there are 3 adults and 2 children, so a total of 5 people. Since each person eats one bowl, 5 bowls are needed for dinner. 

The pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. Since 5 people are eating, we can assume that the pot can fill 4 adult bowls because 4 adult bowls is the smaller of the two options. 

Now, we know that the pot can fill 4 adult bowls, and 5 bowls are needed for dinner. This means that 1 bowl will be left over. 

Since the pot can fill 8 child bowls, and 1 bowl is left over, each child can have 8/2 = 4 bowls of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Adam's age four years ago as 'x'. Since Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, we can write an equation:

Duncan's age eight years ago = 2 * Adam's age four years ago
Duncan's age eight years ago = 2x

We know that Duncan's current age is 60, so we can find his age eight years ago by subtracting 8 from 60:

Duncan's age eight years ago = 60 - 8
Duncan's age eight years ago = 52

Now we can equate this to 2x:

52 = 2x

To find x, we can divide both sides by 2:

x = 52 / 2
x = 26

This means Adam's age four years ago was 26. To find Adam's current age, we add 4 to x:

Adam's current age = x + 4
Adam's current age = 26 + 4
Adam's current age = 30

Finally, to find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

Adam's age in 8 years = Adam's current age + 8
Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8

"To find the total number of acres of Farmer Smith's farm, we need to calculate twice the number of acres of Farmer Brown's farm and then add 100 to it.

Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. Twice that would be 2 * 200 = 400 acres. Adding 100 to that gives us 400 + 100 = 500 acres for Farmer Smith's farm.

Now, to find the total number of acres of both farms, we add the acres of Farmer Brown's farm to the acres of Farmer Smith's farm: 200 + 500 = 700 acres.

The final answer is: 700"
"To find out how much Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday, we need to first determine how many packages he completes in that time. 

Colby completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, so we can express this as 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

Since he works for 8 hours, we multiply the number of packages he completes per hour by the number of hours he works: 40 * 8 = 320 packages.

Now, we know that Colby gets paid $0.20 for every package he completes. To find out his total earnings, we multiply the number of packages he completes by his pay per package: 320 * $0.20 = $64.

The final answer is: $64"
"To find out how many bottles of water John drinks, we need to calculate the time it takes to solve the extreme sudoku and then divide it by the time it takes to drink one bottle of water.

A normal sudoku takes 45 minutes, and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long, so the time to solve an extreme sudoku is 45 * 4 = 180 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we need to convert the time to solve the extreme sudoku to hours and then divide by 0.5 (since there are 2 half hours in an hour). 

180 minutes is equal to 3 hours. 

Now, we divide 3 hours by 0.5 to get the number of half hours, which is 6. 

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, he drinks 6 bottles of water in 3 hours.

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many pieces of bologna were thrown at the red balloons and then subtract that from the total number of bologna pieces to find out how many were thrown at the yellow balloons.

Since Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and there are 20 red balloons, the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons is 2 * 20 = 40.

Now, we know that Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna at the bundle of balloons. To find out how many pieces were thrown at the yellow balloons, we subtract the number of pieces thrown at the red balloons from the total: 58 - 40 = 18.

Since Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, we can find the number of yellow balloons by dividing the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons by 3: 18 / 3 = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how many tune-ups Jon needs, we need to calculate the total miles he drives in 30 days. 

Since Jon drives 100 miles a day, the total miles driven in 30 days is 100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles.

Since Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we can divide the total miles driven by 1000 to find out how many tune-ups he needs.

3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3 tune-ups.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the total hours Bruce works, we need to calculate the hours he works each day and add them up.

On Tuesday, Bruce works 5 hours.

On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, so he works 2 * 5 = 10 hours.

On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours he works each day: 5 + 10 + 8 = 23.

The final answer is: 23"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount of money Julia and Nadine had, and then divide it by 2 to find out how much each of them received as allowance.

First, let's find the cost of the balloons. 1 dozen balloons is equal to 12 balloons. Since 2 balloons cost $0.5, 12 balloons will cost 12 * $0.5 / 2 = $3.

The total cost of the cake and the balloons is $11 + $3 = $14.

The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is $7 * 2 = $14.

The total cost of the cake, balloons, and ice cream is $14 + $14 = $28.

Since Julia and Nadine used all the money they had to buy these items, the total amount of money they had is $28.

Since they had the same amount of allowance, we can divide the total amount of money by 2 to find out how much each of them received. 

$28 / 2 = $14

The final answer is: $14"
"To find out how many pieces of fruit are left, we need to first calculate the total number of fruits Kira bought. 

Kira bought 3 apples, 5 bananas, and 6 oranges. 

Total number of fruits = 3 + 5 + 6 = 14

Lola ate 2 pieces of the fruit. 

Number of fruits left = Total number of fruits - Number of fruits eaten

"To find the total number of students, we need to calculate the number of students playing tennis, volleyball, and soccer, and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of students playing tennis. There are 6 students playing tennis, and twice that number are playing volleyball. So, the number of students playing volleyball is 6 * 2 = 12.

Next, we add the number of students playing tennis and volleyball: 6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) = 18.

Now, we add the number of students playing soccer: 18 (tennis and volleyball) + 16 (soccer) + 22 (soccer) = 18 + 38 = 56.

The total number of students is 56."
"To find the total profit made by the class, we need to first find the total number of lollipops sold and the total cost of the lollipops.

Each student sold 10 lollipops, and there are 30 students. So, the total number of lollipops sold is:
10 lollipops/student * 30 students = 300 lollipops

The cost of each lollipop is $0.5, and the selling price is $0.8. The profit per lollipop is:
Profit per lollipop = Selling price - Cost per lollipop
= $0.8 - $0.5
= $0.3

Now, we can find the total profit by multiplying the profit per lollipop by the total number of lollipops sold:
Total profit = Profit per lollipop * Total number of lollipops
= $0.3 * 300
= $90

The class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops.

$90"
"To find the total number of pets Larry has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet and then add them together.

Larry has 3 cats.

He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.

He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.

He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 * 7 = 21 fish.

He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

To find the total number of pets, we add the number of each type of pet together: 3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47.

The final answer is: 47"
"To find out how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to determine the total number of slices both Abby and Josh can eat per day. 

Abby eats 2 slices a day. Josh eats twice as much as Abby, so Josh eats 2 * 2 = 4 slices a day.

Together, they eat 2 + 4 = 6 slices a day.

To find out how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of slices they eat per day. 

24 slices / 6 slices per day = 4 days.

The loaf of bread will last 4 days."
"To find out how many shells Martha has collected by her 10th birthday, we need to calculate the number of months she has been collecting shells. Since she started collecting shells at 5 years old and we want to know the total by her 10th birthday, we need to count the months from her 5th birthday to her 10th birthday.

There are 12 months in a year. From her 5th birthday to her 10th birthday, there are 5 years. 

5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months

Since Martha collects one shell per month, we multiply the total number of months by 1 shell/month.

60 months * 1 shell/month = 60 shells

Martha will have collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday.

60"
"To find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row, we first need to determine the total number of cups of chamomile and mint tea. Since Lana divides the 27 cups into 3 rows with equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea, we can start by finding the number of cups in each row.

Let's denote the number of cups in each row as x. Since there are 3 rows, the total number of cups is 3x. We know that 3x = 27, so x = 27 / 3 = 9 cups in each row.

Since each row has equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea, the total number of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row is 2x = 2 * 9 = 18 cups.

Now, we know that Lana uses the remaining cups to brew a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea. Since she has 27 cups in total and 18 cups of chamomile and mint tea in each row, the total number of chamomile and mint tea cups is 3 * 18 = 54 cups. This leaves 27 - 54 = -27 cups, which is not possible since we can't have a negative number of cups. However, we can re-evaluate the problem.

Let's re-evaluate the problem: Lana has 27 cups and divides them into 3 rows with equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea. This means she has 27 - 15 = 12 cups left for chamomile and mint tea. Since each row has equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea, the total number of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row is 12 / 3 = 4 cups.

Since each row has 9 cups and 4 cups are chamomile and mint tea, the number of mint tea cups in each row is 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip. 

Let's break down the information given:

- The sloth takes 4 hours to make a round trip (down and back up) to collect berries.
- The sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

Since the sloth takes 4 hours to make a round trip, in 8 hours, he can make 8 / 4 = 2 round trips.

If he makes 2 round trips, he will collect a total of 2 * x berries, where x is the number of berries he picks up per trip.

We want to find the minimum value of x such that 2 * x = 24.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 12.

So, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip is 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the amount of water in the tank after 6 days, we first need to determine how much water is initially transferred to the tank from the pool. Since they fill the tank with half the amount of water in the pool, we calculate this as:

10000 gallons (pool) / 2 = 5000 gallons (initial water in the tank)

Next, we need to find out how much water is used from the tank over 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so over 6 days, the total water used is:

500 gallons/day * 6 days = 3000 gallons

Now, we subtract the water used from the initial amount in the tank to find the remaining water:

5000 gallons (initial water in the tank) - 3000 gallons (water used) = 2000 gallons

The final answer is: 2000"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much money Colby has left and then determine how many movies he can see with the remaining money.

Colby's initial budget is $150. He has already spent money on:

- 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays: 5 * $10 = $50
- 8 movies on other days: 8 * $7 = $56
- 2 tubs of popcorn: 2 * $8 = $16
- 4 boxes of candy: 4 * $2 = $8

Total money spent: $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130

Colby has $150 - $130 = $20 left.

Since tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10, and he wants to see a movie on a Friday, he can see 1 more movie with his remaining money.

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the total calories of the pastries Andrew baked, we first need to calculate the calories of each type of mini pastry. 

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3 of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories. 

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3 of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, we can calculate the total calories of each type of pastry. The total calories of the mini cinnamon rolls are 200 * 200 = 40,000 calories. The total calories of the mini blueberry muffins are 150 * 300 = 45,000 calories.

The total calories of all the pastries are 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories.

The final answer is: 85000"
"To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed and then divide it by the number of days.

On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday, she removed twice as many as Monday, so 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs.
On Wednesday, she removed twice as many as Tuesday, so 2 * 78 = 156 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 78 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 378

There are 5 days in total. 

Average number of Junebugs removed per day = Total Junebugs removed / Number of days
= 378 / 5
= 75.6

"To find out how far each vehicle traveled, we need to multiply their speeds by the time they traveled.

The bus traveled 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so the distance it covered is 60 * 5 = 300 miles.

The car traveled 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so the distance it covered is 30 * 8 = 240 miles.

To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus. 

300 - 240 = 60 miles.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to subtract the total number of toys Sophie had before buying the bouncy balls from the total number of toys she has now.

The total number of toys before buying the bouncy balls is the sum of the blocks, stuffed animals, and stacking rings. 

Total toys before = 31 (blocks) + 8 (stuffed animals) + 9 (stacking rings) = 48

Now, we subtract this from the total number of toys after buying the bouncy balls to find the number of bouncy balls.

Number of bouncy balls = Total toys after - Total toys before
= 62 - 48

"Let's break down the information given:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old.
2. Paul is 10 years older than John.
3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age.

Let's denote John's age as 'x'. Since Paul is 10 years older than John, Paul's age is 'x + 10'.

From the third point, we know that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age, which is (x + 10) + x = 2x + 10.

The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old, so we can write the equation: Peter + Paul + Jean = 100. 

Since Peter's age is 2x + 10 and Paul's age is x + 10, we can substitute these values into the equation: (2x + 10) + (x + 10) + Jean = 100.

We don't have any information about Jean's age, but we can simplify the equation by combining like terms: 3x + 20 + Jean = 100.

However, we can't find Jean's age without more information. But we can express Peter's age in terms of x. 

Since Peter's age is 2x + 10, we can say that Peter's age is 2x + 10.

However, we can't find a numerical value for Peter's age without knowing the value of x."
"To find the total number of balloons, we need to calculate the initial number of balloons and add the additional ones given by Maria's mom.

Initially, Maria had 1 water balloon, and her 4 friends had 2 balloons each. So, the total initial number of balloons is:
1 (Maria's balloon) + (4 friends * 2 balloons per friend) = 1 + 8 = 9 balloons

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional balloons is:
5 people * 3 balloons per person = 15 balloons

Now, we add the initial number of balloons to the additional ones:
9 (initial balloons) + 15 (additional balloons) = 24 balloons

The total number of balloons the girls have is 24."
"To find out how many tables they need, we first need to calculate the total number of boxes of stuff they have. 

10 people donate 5 boxes each, so they have 10 * 5 = 50 boxes from donations. 
They already have 10 boxes, so in total, they have 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

Since they can fit 2 boxes per table, they will need 60 / 2 = 30 tables.

However, they already own 15 tables. To find out how many more tables they need, we subtract the number of tables they have from the total number of tables needed: 30 - 15 = 15.

So, they need 15 new tables.

"To find the average total distance spat, we need to calculate the total distance spat by each person and then divide it by the total number of seeds spat.

Zoey spits 40 seeds, each 10 feet, so the total distance spat by Zoey is 40 * 10 = 400 feet.

Sydney spits 35 seeds, each 12 feet, so the total distance spat by Sydney is 35 * 12 = 420 feet.

The total distance spat by both Zoey and Sydney is 400 + 420 = 820 feet.

The total number of seeds spat is 40 + 35 = 75.

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the total distance spat by the total number of seeds spat: 820 / 75 = 10.93 (rounded to two decimal places).

The final answer is: 10.93"
"To determine which widget maker is more profitable, we need to calculate the total number of widgets each machine can produce in a month and then multiply that by the price of each widget.

First, let's calculate the total number of widgets each machine can produce in a month. The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour and runs 24 hours a day. 

60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = 1440 widgets/day
1440 widgets/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets/month

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour and runs 24 hours a day.

45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = 1080 widgets/day
1080 widgets/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets/month

Now, let's calculate the total revenue for each machine. Each widget sells for $6.

Widgeteer 3000 revenue: 43,200 widgets/month * $6/widget = $259,200/month
WidgetMaster 9000 revenue: 32,400 widgets/month * $6/widget = $194,400/month

To find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the WidgetMaster 9000, we subtract the revenue of the WidgetMaster 9000 from the revenue of the Widgeteer 3000.

$259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

"To find out how much Cameron would save, we first need to calculate the cost of his stay with the option of adding on 70 pesos for every hour after the 12-hour mark and then compare it to the cost of paying for a 24-hour stay.

Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours. Since the first 12 hours are already included in the initial charge, we need to calculate the cost of the additional 5 hours.

The cost of the additional 5 hours is 5 * 70 pesos = 350 pesos.

The total cost for Cameron's stay would be 1000 pesos (for the initial 12 hours) + 350 pesos (for the additional 5 hours) = 1350 pesos.

Now, let's compare this to the cost of paying for a 24-hour stay, which is 1600 pesos.

The amount of money Cameron would save is 1600 pesos (24-hour stay) - 1350 pesos (17-hour stay) = 250 pesos.

"To find out how much hay Nate needs, we first need to determine the amount each sheep needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds and each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, we can calculate the amount each sheep needs as follows:

Twice the amount each goat needs: 2 * 5 = 10 pounds
3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs: 10 - 3 = 7 pounds

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep separately:

For the goats: 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds
For the sheep: 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds

To find the total amount of hay Nate needs, we add the amount needed for the goats and the sheep:

Total hay needed = 75 pounds (goats) + 84 pounds (sheep) = 159 pounds

"To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has left, we first need to determine the total number of bottles she has initially and then subtract the number of bottles given to the students.

The teacher has 9 coupons, each redeemable for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles she has initially is 9 * 100 = 900 bottles.

Each of the 29 students gets 2 bottles of apple juice, so the total number of bottles given to the students is 29 * 2 = 58 bottles.

To find out how many bottles the teacher has left, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles she initially had: 900 - 58 = 842.

"To find the total amount Patty charged, we need to calculate the labor cost and add it to the cost of parts. 

First, let's calculate the labor cost. The job took 2.25 hours, and the labor rate is $35 per hour. Since the labor is charged per hour or part thereof, we need to round up to the nearest hour. However, in this case, 2.25 hours is less than 3 hours, so we can simply multiply 2.25 hours by the labor rate.

Labor cost = 2.25 hours * $35/hour = $78.75

Next, we add the cost of parts, which is $60.

Total cost = Labor cost + Cost of parts
Total cost = $78.75 + $60
Total cost = $138.75

Therefore, Patty charged $138.75 for the job.

"To find out how much James spent on the CDs, we need to calculate the original price and then subtract the discount. 

First, let's find the original price of the CDs: 10 CDs * $15 per CD = $150.

Since James got a 40% discount, we need to find 40% of $150. To do this, we multiply $150 by 0.4: $150 * 0.4 = $60.

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price: $150 - $60 = $90.

James spent $90 on the CDs.

Next, let's find out how much he got back from selling 5 CDs at 40% off. First, we need to find the original price of the 5 CDs: 5 CDs * $15 per CD = $75.

Since James sold the CDs at 40% off, we need to find 40% of $75. To do this, we multiply $75 by 0.4: $75 * 0.4 = $30.

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price: $75 - $30 = $45.

James got $45 from selling the 5 CDs.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find the time it took James to swim 60% of the distance. The distance is 20 miles, and 60% of that is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles. 

Since James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time it took him to swim 12 miles is 12 / 2 = 6 hours.

After swimming, he rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

Now, let's find the remaining distance. The total distance is 20 miles, and he already swam 12 miles, so the remaining distance is 20 - 12 = 8 miles.

He then swims the remaining distance at half the speed, which is 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour. The time it takes him to swim the remaining 8 miles is 8 / 1 = 8 hours.

The total time is the sum of the swimming time, the resting time, and the time it took to swim the remaining distance. So, the total time is 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.

Then, she lost 7 stickers during playtime, so we subtract 7 from 15: 15 - 7 = 8 stickers left.
After that, her teacher gave her 5 more stickers for helping her classmates. 
Now, we add 5 to the 8 stickers she already had: 8 + 5 = 13 stickers.

So, Jasmine has 13 stickers at the end.

"To find the total commission earned by Cayley, we need to calculate the commission from the sales of the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal separately and then add them together.

Commission from New York Times:
- Number of copies sold: 6
- Price per copy: $5
- Commission rate: 10%
- Commission per copy: 10% of $5 = 0.1 * $5 = $0.5
- Total commission from New York Times: 6 * $0.5 = $3

Commission from Wall Street Journal:
- Number of copies sold: 10
- Price per copy: $15
- Commission rate: 8%
- Commission per copy: 8% of $15 = 0.08 * $15 = $1.2
- Total commission from Wall Street Journal: 10 * $1.2 = $12

Total commission earned by Cayley: $3 + $12 = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Deanna is 26 years old.
2. Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, so Marcus is 26 - 5 = 21 years old.
3. Marcus is half of Leo's age, so Leo's age is twice Marcus's age. 

To find Leo's age, we multiply Marcus's age by 2: 21 * 2 = 42.

The final answer is: 42"
"To find out how many points Azibo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Bahati and Dinar. 

Let's denote the points scored by Dinar as 'x'. Since Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, Bahati's points can be represented as 'x + 10'. 

We also know that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so Azibo's points can be represented as '(x + 10) - 20' or 'x - 10'.

The total points scored by the team is 45, which is the sum of the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar. We can write this as an equation:

x + (x + 10) + (x - 10) = 45

Combine like terms:

3x = 45

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 15

Now that we know Dinar scored 15 points, we can find Azibo's points by subtracting 10 from Bahati's points. However, we first need to find Bahati's points. Since Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, and we know Dinar scored 15 points, we can represent Bahati's points as '15 + 20' or '35'. 

Azibo's points can be found by subtracting 20 from Bahati's points: 35 - 20 = 15.

However, we know that Azibo's points can also be represented as 'x - 10'. Since we found that x = 15, we can confirm that Azibo's points are indeed 15 - 10 = 5.

The points scored by Azibo is 5."
"To find the total number of pages in the book, we need to calculate the total number of pages per inch and then multiply it by the thickness of the book in inches.

Since each paper is 100 pages to the inch and each paper is printed on both sides, we have 200 pages per inch (100 pages per side).

Given that the book is 1.5 inches thick, we can multiply the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book:

200 pages/inch * 1.5 inches = 300 pages

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the total number of reports Vince stapled, we need to calculate the total time he spent stapling reports and then multiply it by the number of reports he can staple per minute.

First, let's find the total time Vince spent stapling reports. He stapled from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is a total of 15 hours.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so the total minutes in 15 hours is 15 * 60 = 900 minutes.

Now, we know Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many reports he can staple per minute, we divide 30 by 15, which is 2 reports per minute.

Now, we multiply the total minutes by the number of reports he can staple per minute: 900 minutes * 2 reports/minute = 1800 reports.

The final answer is: 1800"
"To find out how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m. This is a total of 8 hours, which is 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 5:55 a.m. instead of 6 a.m. This means she slept for 5:55 a.m. - 10 p.m. = 7 hours and 55 minutes, which is 7 * 60 + 55 = 455 minutes.

She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes.

To find the total sleep time, we subtract the time she was sleepwalking from the total sleep time: 455 - 23 = 432 minutes.

The final answer is: 432"
"To solve this problem, we first need to find out how many measuring spoons Jonathan has initially. Since he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, and he has two dozen cups, we can calculate the number of measuring spoons.

Two dozen cups is equal to 2 x 12 = 24 cups.

Since Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, we can multiply the number of cups by 2/3 to find the number of measuring spoons.

Number of measuring spoons = 24 x (2/3) = 16

Now, Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons. To find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we subtract the number of spoons he gave away from the initial number of spoons.

Remaining spoons = 16 - 6 = 10

Since Jonathan has 24 cups and 10 spoons, the total number of utensils he has remaining is 24 + 10 = 34.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we first need to find the number of occupied beds and then subtract it from the total capacity.

The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 of them are occupied. 

1/5 of 1000 is 100. So, the number of occupied beds is 100.

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, we need to find the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks is 14 days.

The total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks is 50 * 14 = 700.

Now, we add the initial occupied beds and the beds occupied in 2 weeks: 100 + 700 = 800.

The number of unoccupied beds is the total capacity minus the occupied beds: 1000 - 800 = 200.

The final answer is: 200"
"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we first need to determine the number of non-work emails she sends. 

She sends 16 emails a day, and 7 of them are work emails. So, the number of non-work emails is 16 - 7 = 9.

Two-thirds of the remainder (non-work emails) are to her family. Two-thirds of 9 is (2/3) * 9 = 6. This means she sends 6 emails to her family.

Now, we need to find out how many emails are left after sending to her family. 9 - 6 = 3.

One-third of the remaining emails are to her boyfriend. One-third of 3 is (1/3) * 3 = 1.

So, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

The final answer is: 1"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

We know that Aliya is 3 years old. We also know that Shawna is three times as old as Aliya. 

So, Shawna's age = 3 * Aliya's age = 3 * 3 = 9 years.

We also know that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. 

So, Shawna's father's age = 5 * Shawna's age = 5 * 9 = 45 years.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number Courtney reported and subtract it from the number she reported.

Let's assume the number Courtney reported is 100%. Since she overstated the number by 20%, the actual number is 80% of the number she reported.

First, we need to find 20% of 48. To do this, we multiply 48 by 0.2 (which is 20% as a decimal).

20% of 48 = 48 * 0.2 = 9.6

Now, we subtract 9.6 from 48 to find the actual number of people who attended the concert.

Actual number of people = 48 - 9.6 = 38.4

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 38.4.

The final answer is: 38.4"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. We know that Jason carried 2 balls, and Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey. This means Jeffrey carried half the number of balls Jason carried, which is 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried 2 balls, Jordan carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls carried by each of them: 1 (Jeffrey) + 2 (Jason) + 4 (Jordan) = 7 balls.

However, this is the number of balls the boys carried, not the total number of balls the coach brought to practice. Since the boys carried all the balls in one trip, the total number of balls the coach brought to practice is equal to the number of balls the boys carried.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day, we need to add the holes dug each day and subtract the two holes filled in. 

Holes dug on the first day = 10
Holes dug on the second day = 13
Holes dug on the third day = 8
Total holes dug by the end of the third day = 10 + 13 + 8 = 31
Holes filled in on the third day = 2
Total holes by the end of the third day = 31 - 2 = 29

The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. 
Holes at the end of the first day = 10
Four times the holes at the end of the first day = 4 * 10 = 40
Since the island had 40 holes by the end of the fourth day, and 29 holes were present at the end of the third day, the number of holes dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure is:
Holes dug on the fourth day = 40 - 29 = 11

The final answer is: 11"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and the third person got 15 more than each of them. 

Let's denote the number of corn chips the third person got as x. Since the third person got 15 more than Amora and Lainey, we can write an equation:

x = 70 + 15
x = 85

So, the third person got 85 corn chips. 

Now, we know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and the third person got 85 corn chips. To find the total number of corn chips, we add the number of corn chips each person got:

Total corn chips = 70 + 70 + 85
Total corn chips = 225

The final answer is: 225"
"To find the total cost of travel, we need to calculate 50% more than the cost of supplies. 

First, let's find 50% of the cost of supplies. 50% of $400 is 0.5 * 400 = $200.

Now, we add this to the cost of supplies to find the total cost of travel. $400 (supplies) + $200 (50% of supplies) = $600.

The final answer is: $600"
"Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, Stan as S, and Alex as X. We are given the following information:

1. X = S + 5
2. S = 4A - 13
3. X + S + A = 339

We can substitute the first equation into the third equation to get:
(S + 5) + S + A = 339
Combine like terms:
2S + A + 5 = 339

Now, substitute the second equation into the above equation:
2(4A - 13) + A + 5 = 339
Expand the equation:
8A - 26 + A + 5 = 339
Combine like terms:
9A - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:
9A = 360

Divide both sides by 9:
A = 40

Now that we know A, we can find S:
S = 4A - 13
S = 4(40) - 13
S = 160 - 13
S = 147

The final answer is: 147"
"To find the total number of episodes, we need to find half of the number of minutes per episode. Since each episode is 20 minutes long, there are 20 minutes per episode. Half of 20 is 10. 

So, there are 10 episodes in total. 

To find the total time John will spend watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode: 10 episodes * 20 minutes per episode = 200 minutes.

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in the southerly direction and then add it to the distance traveled in the northerly direction.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled in the southerly direction for the first 10 hours:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 10 hours
Distance = 300 miles

Then, the bird flies towards the north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 36 miles

Since the bird is flying north, this distance is subtracted from the total southerly distance:
Total southerly distance = 300 miles - 36 miles
Total southerly distance = 264 miles

Finally, the bird flies towards the south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours
Distance = 110 miles

To find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we add the total southerly distance and the distance traveled in the final southerly direction:
Total distance = Total southerly distance + Distance in the final southerly direction
Total distance = 264 miles + 110 miles
Total distance = 374 miles

The final answer is: 374"
"To find the total number of brownies Greta had left over, we need to calculate the total number of brownies she received and then subtract the number of brownies eaten.

Greta made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies for herself, which is 12 brownies. 

At her office, they sent her home with 1/2 a dozen brownies, which is 6 brownies. 

Her friends had 4 dozen brownies waiting at home, which is 48 brownies.

So, the total number of brownies Greta received is 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies.

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies.

To find the number of brownies left over, we subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies received: 66 - 18 = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the total age of all three family members, we first need to determine the age of Nani's brother and sister.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 2 * 8 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means her age is 75% of Nani's age. To find 75% of Nani's age, we multiply his age by 0.75: 8 * 0.75 = 6 years.

Now, we add up the ages of all three family members: Nani's age (8 years) + his brother's age (16 years) + his sister's age (6 years) = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

The total age of all three family members is 30 years."
"To find the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time for each type of string and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time for the synthetic gut racquets: 3 racquets * 15 minutes per racquet = 45 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time for the polyester string racquets: 5 racquets * 22 minutes per racquet = 110 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time for the hybrid sets: 4 racquets * 18 minutes per racquet = 72 minutes.

Finally, we add the times together: 45 minutes + 110 minutes + 72 minutes = 227 minutes.

The total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets is 227 minutes.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first two phones and the remaining phones. 

The first two phones cost the full price of $600 each, so the total cost for the first two phones is 2 * $600 = $1200.

The remaining phones are 2 (for the kids and his wife), and each of these phones is half price, which is $600 / 2 = $300.

The total cost for the remaining phones is 2 * $300 = $600.

Now, we add the cost of the first two phones and the remaining phones to get the total cost: $1200 + $600 = $1800.

"To find the total number of players in both teams, we first need to determine the number of players on Zeke's team. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, and Carlton's team has 13 players, we can calculate the number of players on Zeke's team by adding 7 to 13.

Zeke's team = Carlton's team + 7
Zeke's team = 13 + 7
Zeke's team = 20

Now, we can find the total number of players in both teams by adding the number of players on Zeke's team and Carlton's team.

Total players = Zeke's team + Carlton's team
Total players = 20 + 13
Total players = 33

"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is 2 * (length + width).

Given the length (L) is 15 feet and the width (W) is 10 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (L + W)
Perimeter = 2 * (15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2 * 25
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

Total slats needed = Perimeter * 2
Total slats needed = 50 * 2
Total slats needed = 100

"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we first need to determine how many boxes she had left after giving some to her mom and sister. 

Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges. She gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes each, so she gave away a total of 2 + 2 = 4 boxes. 

Now, we subtract the boxes she gave away from the total number of boxes she bought: 12 - 4 = 8 boxes.

Each box contains 20 oranges, so the total number of oranges in 8 boxes is 8 * 20 = 160 oranges.

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges, which is 1/4 * 160 = 40 oranges. 

To find out how many oranges she sold, we subtract the number of oranges she kept from the total number of oranges: 160 - 40 = 120 oranges.

The USA has 50 states. 

Half of 50 is 25. 

India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, so India has 25 + 4 = 29 states.

Now, we add the number of states in the USA and India together: 50 + 29 = 79.

The total number of states in both countries together is 79."
"To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books. 

The total cost of the books is the sum of the cost of the dictionary, the dinosaur book, and the children's cookbook. 

Total cost = $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39

Since Tyler has already saved $14 from his allowance, we need to subtract this from the total cost to find out how much more he needs to earn.

Amount needed to earn = Total cost - Amount saved = $39 - $14 = $25

Now, we can find out how many hours Tyler needs to work by dividing the amount he needs to earn by his hourly wage.

Hours needed to work = Amount needed to earn / Hourly wage = $25 / $5 = 5 hours

"Let's break down the information given:

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread. 
On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday.

On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. 
On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie. 
So, on Saturday, he sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each day:

On Saturday, the total earnings from gingerbread = 10 * $6 = $60
The total earnings from apple pie = 11 * $15 = $165
Total earnings on Saturday = $60 + $165 = $225

On Sunday, the total earnings from gingerbread = 15 * $6 = $90
The total earnings from apple pie = 15 * $15 = $225
Total earnings on Sunday = $90 + $225 = $315

The total earnings for two days = $225 + $315 = $540

"To determine the total number of bottles Pamela will need, we need to calculate the total amount of sunscreen she will use and divide it by the amount in each bottle.

Pamela will be outside for 4 hours a day for 8 days, so she will be outside for a total of 4 * 8 = 32 hours.

Since she reapplies sunscreen every hour, she will use 32 ounces of sunscreen in total.

Each bottle contains 8 ounces of sunscreen. To find out how many bottles she will need, we divide the total amount of sunscreen she will use (32 ounces) by the amount in each bottle (8 ounces):

32 ounces / 8 ounces per bottle = 4 bottles

So, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen.

"Let's break down the information given. 

Emil is 19 years old now. When he turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad and twice as old as his brother. 

Let's denote Emil's age at that time as E, his dad's age as D, and his brother's age as B. 

We know that E = 24. 

Since Emil will be half the age of his dad, we can write the equation: E = 0.5D. 

Since Emil will be twice as old as his brother, we can write the equation: E = 2B.

Now we can substitute E = 24 into the first equation: 24 = 0.5D. 

To find D, we multiply both sides by 2: D = 24 * 2 = 48.

Now we can substitute E = 24 into the second equation: 24 = 2B.

To find B, we divide both sides by 2: B = 24 / 2 = 12.

Now we know Emil's dad is 48 years old and his brother is 12 years old. 

To find the sum of their ages, we add D and B: 48 + 12 = 60.

Adrianne's mother gave her 20 beads.
Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the beads together: 20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.

On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the amount of crawfish Joe caught each day: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can find the total number of servings by dividing the total amount of crawfish by the serving size: 21 / 3 = 7.

Now, we need to find the number of students who are not football players. 

Total students - football players = 30 - 6 = 24

Out of the remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. 

25% of 24 = 0.25 * 24 = 6

So, there are 6 students who are cheerleaders or part of the band.

Charlie's size = 5 * Sophie's size
Charlie's size = 5 * 5
Charlie's size = 25

Now, we can find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie by adding their sizes and dividing by 2:

Average size = (Sophie's size + Charlie's size) / 2
Average size = (5 + 25) / 2
Average size = 30 / 2
Average size = 15

"To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to calculate the total space available for plants. 

First, we need to convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches since the width of the plants is given in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so the length of the flower bed in inches is 111 * 12 = 1332 inches.

Next, we need to subtract the space between the plants. Since there are 17 plants, there will be 16 spaces between them. The total space between the plants is 16 * 1.5 = 24 feet, which is 24 * 12 = 288 inches.

Now, we subtract the total space between the plants from the total length of the flower bed to get the total space available for the plants: 1332 - 288 = 1044 inches.

Since each plant is 12 inches wide, we can divide the total space available for the plants by the width of each plant to find out how many plants can fit: 1044 / 12 = 87.

However, Pat already owns 17 flowers, so we need to subtract these from the total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed: 87 - 17 = 70.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the plants Pat needs to buy: 70 * $6 = $420.

The final answer is: $420"
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day, we need to calculate 1/2 of the number of pretzels Edgar eats in a day. 

Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day. 
1/2 of 18 is 18 / 2 = 9 pretzels.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we need to multiply the number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day by 7.

9 pretzels/day * 7 days = 63 pretzels

The final answer is: 63"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of petunias: 
5 baskets * 3 petunias per basket = 15 petunias
Cost of 15 petunias = 15 * $3.00 = $45.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of sweet potato vines:
5 baskets * 2 sweet potato vines per basket = 10 sweet potato vines
Cost of 10 sweet potato vines = 10 * $2.50 = $25.00

Now, let's add the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines together:
Total cost = $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00

The total amount Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets is $70.00."
"To find out how many roses they can plant, we first need to determine how much soil is used by the sunflowers and carnations. 

4 sunflowers need 4 * 3 = 12 pounds of soil. 
10 carnations need 10 * 1.5 = 15 pounds of soil. 

The total amount of soil used by sunflowers and carnations is 12 + 15 = 27 pounds. 

Since they have a 30-pound bag of soil, the remaining soil for roses is 30 - 27 = 3 pounds. 

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil, so they can plant 3 roses with the remaining soil.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we first need to calculate how much she sets aside each month for shoes. 

Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month and sets 25% of her paycheck aside for shoes. To find 25% of $2,000.00, we multiply $2,000.00 by 0.25.

$2,000.00 * 0.25 = $500.00

So, Jessica sets aside $500.00 each month for shoes. 

To find out how many shoes she can buy in a year, we need to multiply the monthly savings by 12 (the number of months in a year).

$500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00

Now, we need to find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy with $6,000.00. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00.

$6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6

So, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it takes Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp. 

First, let's find out how long it takes her to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp a minute, we can divide 90 by 6 to get the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp. 

90 / 6 = 15 minutes

However, this is only the time it takes to peel the shrimp. We also need to consider the time it takes to cook them. It takes her 10 minutes to cook 30 shrimp. To find out how long it takes to cook 90 shrimp, we can divide 90 by 30 and then multiply by 10.

90 / 30 = 3
3 * 10 = 30 minutes

So, it takes her 30 minutes to cook 90 shrimp. 

Now, we need to add the time it takes to peel and cook the shrimp. 

15 minutes (peeling) + 30 minutes (cooking) = 45 minutes

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

The final answer is: 45"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour on low and 3 degrees per hour on high.
2. The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour without the air conditioner.
3. The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, so it cooled the room by 2 * 3 = 6 degrees.
4. Then, it was turned up to high for 4 hours, so it cooled the room by 3 * 4 = 12 degrees.
5. The total cooling effect of the air conditioner is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.
6. However, the room warmed up for 2 hours without the air conditioner, so it warmed up by 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.
7. The net cooling effect of the air conditioner is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

So, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

The final answer is: 14"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time. 

First, let's find out how old Bill's dad was when Bill saw the comet for the second time. We are given that Bill saw the comet when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. Let's call the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet ""x"". Then, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time is 3x.

We are also given that Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. This means that the time difference between the two sightings is 75 years (the time it takes for the comet to orbit the sun). 

So, the age of Bill's dad when Bill saw the comet for the second time is 30 + 75 = 105 years.

Now, we can set up the equation 3x = 105 to find the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet. Solving for x, we get x = 105 / 3 = 35.

This means that Bill's dad was 35 years old when he saw the comet. 

Now, we need to find out how old Bill was when his dad saw the comet. We are given that Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old, and Bill's dad was 35 years old when Bill saw the comet for the second time. This means that the time difference between the two events is 35 - 30 = 5 years.

Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, and the time difference between the two events is 5 years, we can set up the equation 75 / 5 = 15. This means that the comet orbits the sun 15 times in 75 years.

Now, we can find out how many times the comet orbited the sun between the two events. Since the time difference is 5 years, the comet orbited the sun 5 / 75 = 1/15 times.

Since the comet orbits the sun 15 times in 75 years, and it orbited the sun 1/15 times between the two events, we can find the time difference between the two events in years. 1/15 * 75 = 5 years.

Now, we can find out how old Bill was when his dad saw the comet. We are given that the time difference between the two events is 5 years, and Bill's dad was 30 years old when he saw the comet. This means that Bill was 30 - 5 = 25 years old when his dad saw the comet.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks for each category and then add them together.

1. Checks for the electric bill: 1 check per month, so 12 checks per year.
2. Checks for the gas bill: 1 check per month, so 12 checks per year.
3. Checks to the church: 2 checks per month, so 24 checks per year.
4. Checks to the pest and lawn service: 1 check every 3 months, so 4 checks per year.

Now, let's add the total number of checks: 
12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52

The final answer is: 52"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the total number of flights made by the first plane as 'x'. Since the second plane makes half the number of flights as the first plane, the total number of flights made by the second plane is 'x/2'.

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, which is (3/4)x. The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of flights to France is (1/4)x.

We are given that the second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips. Since this is half the number of trips the first plane makes, we can set up the equation:

x/2 = 44

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2:

x = 88

Now that we know the total number of flights made by the first plane, we can find the number of flights to France:

Flights to France = (1/4)x
= (1/4)(88)
= 22

The final answer is: 22"
"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the individual howling times and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. 
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, let's add the individual howling times together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents and subtract the amount he already had.

Adam's mother gave him $6. 
His father gave him twice as much as his mother, so his father gave him 2 * $6 = $12.

The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Since Adam bought the trousers for $30, we need to subtract the amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers to find out how much he had to contribute from his savings.

$30 (cost of trousers) - $18 (amount received from parents) = $12

So, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings. 

The final answer is: $12"
"To find the age of Wilfred, we first need to find the average age of the group. We know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. Let's denote the average age as 'x'. 

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age, Helene's age is 2x. 

We also know that the total age of the children is 20. We can set up an equation to represent this:

Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age + Wilfred's age = Total age
3 + 4 + 2x + Wilfred's age = 20

Combine the constants:
7 + 2x + Wilfred's age = 20

Subtract 7 from both sides:
2x + Wilfred's age = 13

We also know that the average age of the group is x, and the total age is 20. We can set up another equation to represent this:

x = (Total age) / (Number of children)
x = 20 / 4
x = 5

Now that we know the average age is 5, we can substitute this value into the equation 2x + Wilfred's age = 13:
2(5) + Wilfred's age = 13
10 + Wilfred's age = 13

Subtract 10 from both sides:
Wilfred's age = 3

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To find out how much Walter's lawyer will contribute, we need to calculate the total amount collected from Walter's neighbors and the online fund. 

Walter collects $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. So, the total amount collected is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Walter's friend donates $200, but we are only considering the donations from his neighbors and the online fund until his friend gives him $200. Therefore, we don't need to include his friend's donation in the calculation.

Walter's lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. Since everyone else (Walter's neighbors and the online fund) donated a total of $2000, Walter's lawyer will donate 3 * $2000 = $6000.

The final answer is: $6000"
"To find out how many cookies were given to the church, we first need to find out the total number of cookies. Since each guest brought 15 cookies and there were 100 guests, the total number of cookies is 100 * 15 = 1500.

The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door. So, the number of cookies given to the church is 1500 * 1/2 = 750.

Now, we know that each person in the church next door got 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church next door, we need to divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person got. 

Number of people in the church next door = Total cookies given to the church / Number of cookies each person got
= 750 / 15
= 50

"To solve this problem, let's assume the total number of slices the watermelon is divided into is 'x'. Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices is 6. 

Let's say each kid gets 'k' slices. Since each adult gets twice as many slices as each kid, each adult gets '2k' slices. 

We know that the total number of slices is 6, so we can set up the equation: 2(2k) + 4k = 6. 

Simplifying the equation, we get 4k + 4k = 6, which is 8k = 6. 

Dividing both sides by 8, we get k = 6/8, which simplifies to k = 3/4.

Since each adult gets 2k slices, each adult gets 2(3/4) = 3/2 slices.

The total number of slices is 6, so the total number of slices is 6. The total number of slices that the adults get is 2(3/2) = 3. 

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we divide the number of slices each adult gets by the total number of slices and multiply by 100. 

(3/6) * 100 = 50%

"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones has left to update his records, we first need to calculate the total time he spends on rounds and appointments.

Time spent on rounds: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 180 minutes to hours: 180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours

Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes
Converting 300 minutes to hours: 300 minutes / 60 = 5 hours

Total time spent on rounds and appointments: 3 hours + 5 hours = 8 hours

Since Doctor Jones works 9 hours at the clinic, we subtract the time spent on rounds and appointments from his total work hours to find the time left for updating records:
9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

The final answer is: 1"
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake. 

First, let's add the time it takes to make the cake batter (20 minutes) and bake the cake (30 minutes): 20 + 30 = 50 minutes.

Next, we add the time it takes to cool the cake (2 hours, which is 120 minutes) and the time it takes to frost the cake (10 minutes): 120 + 10 = 130 minutes. 

Now, we add the time it takes to make the cake batter and bake the cake to the time it takes to cool and frost the cake: 50 + 130 = 180 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 180 minutes to hours by dividing by 60: 180 / 60 = 3 hours.

Now, we add the 3 hours to the time at which Jordan wants to serve the cake (5:00 pm) to find the latest time she can start making the cake: 5:00 pm + 3 hours = 8:00 pm.

The final answer is 8."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we need to first find the total number of boxes sold by both Lisa and Peter. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so together they sold 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

Since they sold 64 chocolate bars together and they sold 8 boxes, we can divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes to find out how many chocolate bars are in a box.

64 / 8 = 8

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box."
"To find the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the total cost of the students per session, then multiply it by the number of sessions in a month.

The studio is rented 3 days a week, and there are approximately 4 weeks in a month. So, the total number of sessions in a month is 3 days/week * 4 weeks/month = 12 sessions/month.

The cost of renting the studio per session is $25. 
The cost of students per session is $1.50 per student, and there are 10 students. So, the total cost of students per session is $1.50 * 10 = $15.

The total cost per session is $25 (rent) + $15 (students) = $40.

Now, we multiply the total cost per session by the number of sessions in a month: $40/session * 12 sessions/month = $480/month.

The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $480."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box for both Peter and Martha, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes.

For Peter: 64 chocolate bars / 4 boxes = 16 chocolate bars per box
For Martha: 56 chocolate bars / 7 boxes = 8 chocolate bars per box

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter and Martha. 

16 (Peter's chocolate bars per box) - 8 (Martha's chocolate bars per box) = 8

"To find the number of female porcupines, we multiply the total population by 3/5. 

Number of female porcupines = 50 * (3/5) = 30

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, we need to find the total number of babies born in a year. There are 12 months in a year.

Total babies born in a year = 30 * 4 * 12 = 1440

Now, we add the total number of babies born in a year to the initial population to find the total population after a year.

Total population after a year = 50 + 1440 = 1490

The final answer is: 1490"
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the width, length, and depth of the pool. 

Volume = width * length * depth
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the gallons of water needed, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. There are 7.48 gallons in a cubic foot, so:

Volume in gallons = 1400 * 7.48
Volume in gallons = 10472 gallons

Now, we multiply the volume in gallons by 5.9 to get the total gallons of water needed:
Total gallons = 10472 * 5.9
Total gallons = 61851.28 gallons

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon, so we multiply the total gallons by the cost per gallon:
Cost = 61851.28 * 0.10
Cost = 6185.128

The final answer is: $6185.13"
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to calculate the number of each color and add them together.

We know there are 9 red sticks. 
There are 5 more blue sticks than red, so the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14.
The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is 14 - 3 = 11.

Now, we add the number of sticks of each color together: 9 (red) + 14 (blue) + 11 (yellow) = 34.

"To find the total number of female students, we first need to find the number of students over 16 and under 16, and then calculate the number of female students in each group.

Half of the students are over 16 years old: 3000 / 2 = 1500 students.
One-fourth of the students over 16 are male: 1500 / 4 = 375 male students over 16. 
So, the number of female students over 16 is 1500 - 375 = 1125.

The remaining half of the students are under 16 years old: 3000 / 2 = 1500 students.
One-half of the students under 16 are male: 1500 / 2 = 750 male students under 16.
So, the number of female students under 16 is 1500 - 750 = 750.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, let's find out how much water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the first day. 

Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. 
Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. 
Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water pumped on both days. 
Wanda's total: 4500 + 3000 = 7500 gallons
Ms. B's total: 3375 + 1125 = 4500 gallons

The total amount of water pumped is 7500 + 4500 = 12000 gallons.

Since the tank has a capacity of 18000 gallons, the remaining amount of water needed to fill the tank is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park is x.

In the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining is 100% - (9% * 5) = 100% - 45% = 55%.

In the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining is 55% - (7% * 3) = 55% - 21% = 34%.

However, we are given that the final charge remaining is 28%. This means that the 34% charge remaining after 8 hours is reduced to 28% in the last hour. This implies that the power bank loses 34% - 28% = 6% of its capacity in the last hour.

Since the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour for 3 hours, we can set up an equation to find the charge remaining after 8 hours:

55% - (9% * 5) - (7% * 3) - (7% * (x - 3)) = 28%

Simplifying the equation:

55% - 45% - 21% - 7% * (x - 3) = 28%

-12% - 7% * (x - 3) = 28%

-12% - 7x + 21% = 28%

9% - 7x = 28%

-7x = 28% - 9%

-7x = 19%

x = -19% / 7

x = -2.7142857%

However, the initial charge cannot be negative, so we need to re-evaluate the problem.

Let's assume the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour for 3 hours, and then the charge remaining is 34%. In the last hour, the power bank loses 6% of its capacity, which is 7% - 1% (the 1% is the difference between 9% and 8%). This implies that the power bank loses 8% of its capacity in the last hour.

We can set up an equation to find the charge remaining after 8 hours:

55% - (9% * 5) - (8% * (x - 3)) = 28%

Simplifying the equation:

55% - 45% - 8% * (x - 3) = 28%

-12% - 8% * (x - 3) = 28%

-12% - 8x + 24% = 28%

12% - 8x = 28%

-8x = 28% - 12%

-8x = 16%

x = -16% / 8

x = -2%

However, the initial charge cannot be negative, so we need to re-evaluate the problem.

Let's assume the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour for 2 hours, and then the charge remaining is 55%. In the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour. We can set up an equation to find the charge remaining after 8 hours:

"To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work, we first need to calculate her total weekly earnings. 

Janet makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, so her total hourly earnings are $10 + $15 = $25 per hour.

Since she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are $25 * 40 = $1000.

Next, we need to find out how much Janet needs to save for the down payment. She wants to save 20% of the cost of a $10,000 car, so the amount she needs to save is 20% of $10,000, which is 0.2 * $10,000 = $2,000.

Now, we can divide the amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings to find out how many weeks she needs to work: $2,000 / $1000 = 2.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of money he has spent so far. 

3 peaches at $0.5 each will be 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
4 pears at $0.5 each will be 4 * $0.5 = $2
2 kiwis at $1 each will be 2 * $1 = $2
5 apples at $0.75 each will be 5 * $0.75 = $3.75
Adding these amounts together, Jamaar has spent $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial $10 to find out how much money Jamaar has left. $10 - $9 = $1

Since plums cost $0.25 each, we can divide the remaining money by the cost of one plum to find out how many plums Jamaar can buy. $1 / $0.25 = 4

"To find out how many pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received, we first need to determine how many packs she gave to her friends. Since Anne kept 2 packs for herself, she gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs.

Next, we need to find out how many friends each pack was divided among. Since Anne gave the packs to 10 friends, we divide the number of packs given away by the number of friends: 13 packs / 10 friends = 1.3 packs per friend.

Now, we need to find out how many pieces of sweets are in 1.3 packs. Since each pack has 60 pieces, we multiply 1.3 packs by 60 pieces per pack: 1.3 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 78 pieces.

However, since we can't divide a pack into fractions, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. But in this case, we can still divide the remaining pieces from the 13 packs among the friends. 13 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 780 pieces. 780 pieces / 10 friends = 78 pieces per friend.

The final answer is: 78"
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the increase in price each year and add it to the original price.

Year 1: 
Original price = $120
Increase in price = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Original price = $126
Increase in price = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Original price = $132.30
Increase in price = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many pictures Olivia put into each album. Since she put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide the total number of pictures by 8.

Total pictures = 72
Pictures per album = Total pictures / Number of albums
Pictures per album = 72 / 8
Pictures per album = 9

Since 3 albums were selfies only, and 2 albums were portraits, the remaining 3 albums must be a mix of both selfies and portraits. However, we are not given any information about the mix of selfies and portraits in these 3 albums. 

But we can still find the total number of selfies and portraits. Since 3 albums were selfies only, the total number of selfies is 3 * 9 = 27. Similarly, 2 albums were portraits only, so the total number of portraits is 2 * 9 = 18.

"To find out how long James spends reading, we need to determine how many sets of 3 pages he reads and then multiply that by the time it takes him to read one set of 3 pages.

Since James reads 18 pages, we can divide 18 by 3 to find out how many sets of 3 pages he reads: 18 / 3 = 6.

Now, we know it takes James 10 minutes to read one set of 3 pages. Since he reads 6 sets, we multiply 10 minutes by 6: 10 * 6 = 60.

James spends 60 minutes reading his book."
"To find the current number of guests in the hotel, we need to calculate the number of guests who checked in and subtract the number of guests who checked out.

Initially, there were 100 guests. 

24 guests checked out early, so the remaining guests are 100 - 24 = 76.

15 guests opted for a late checkout, so the number of guests who have checked out is 24 (early checkouts) + 15 (late checkouts) = 39.

The number of guests who have not checked out is 76 - 39 = 37.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout, which is 2 * 15 = 30.

So, the total number of guests who have checked in is 30 (in the afternoon) + 7 (after dinner) = 37.

Now, we add the number of guests who have checked in to the number of guests who have not checked out: 37 (checked in) + 37 (not checked out) = 74.

"To find the number of points Aries is sure to get, we first need to determine the number of each type of question in the quiz. 

There are 60 questions in total. 40% of the questions are easy, so the number of easy questions is 0.4 * 60 = 24. The rest of the questions are equally divided between average and difficult, so there are 60 - 24 = 36 questions left. This means there are 36 / 2 = 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, which is 0.75 * 24 = 18 easy questions. She is also sure to get half of the average and difficult questions, which is 0.5 * 18 = 9 average questions and 0.5 * 18 = 9 difficult questions.

The total number of questions Aries is sure to get is 18 (easy) + 9 (average) + 9 (difficult) = 36.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote the number of small stuffed animals as 's' and the number of large stuffed animals as 'l'. We know that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so we can write an equation:

s = 2l

We also know that the price of a small stuffed animal is $4. Since Teresa sold 's' small stuffed animals, the total amount of money she earned from small stuffed animals is 4s.

The price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal, which is 3 * 4 = $12. Since Teresa sold 'l' large stuffed animals, the total amount of money she earned from large stuffed animals is 12l.

We are given that Teresa earned a total of $120 from the sales. So, we can write another equation:

4s + 12l = 120

Now we can substitute the expression for 's' from the first equation into the second equation:

4(2l) + 12l = 120

Expanding the equation, we get:

8l + 12l = 120

Combine like terms:

20l = 120

Divide both sides by 20:

l = 6

Now that we know the number of large stuffed animals, we can find the number of small stuffed animals:

s = 2l
s = 2(6)
s = 12

"To find the total number of sandwiches the family eats in one week, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches each person eats in a week and then add them together.

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, so in a week (7 days), he eats 5 * 7 = 35 sandwiches.

The wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, so in a week (7 days), she eats 4 * 7 = 28 sandwiches.

The son eats 2 sandwiches per day, so in a week (7 days), he eats 2 * 7 = 14 sandwiches.

Now, let's add the total number of sandwiches each person eats in a week: 35 (man) + 28 (wife) + 14 (son) = 77 sandwiches.

The family eats 77 sandwiches in one week.

"To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we need to calculate her total earnings and then subtract the amount she gave to her sisters.

First, let's calculate her earnings from selling cookies: 80 cookies * $1 each = $80.

Next, let's calculate her earnings from selling cupcakes: 60 cupcakes * $4 each = $240.

Now, let's add her earnings from cookies and cupcakes: $80 + $240 = $320.

Suzanne gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave away a total of 2 * $10 = $20.

Now, let's subtract the amount she gave to her sisters from her total earnings: $320 - $20 = $300.

So, Suzanne has $300 left from her earnings.

"To find the number of eggs found by the friends, we first need to determine the total number of eggs found by the Smith twins. Since each of the twins found 30 eggs, the total number of eggs found by the twins is 2 * 30 = 60.

Now, we know that all the eggs except 10 were found by the twins and their friends. This means that the total number of eggs found by the twins and their friends is 100 - 10 = 90.

Since the twins found 60 eggs, the number of eggs found by the friends can be calculated by subtracting the number of eggs found by the twins from the total number of eggs found by the twins and their friends. 

Number of eggs found by friends = Total eggs found by twins and friends - Eggs found by twins

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe and then multiply it by 40 dwarves and 30 days.

First, let's find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with an iron pickaxe. Since he can mine twice as much with an iron pickaxe as with his bare hands, he can mine 2 * 12 = 24 pounds of ore per day with an iron pickaxe.

Next, let's find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe. Since he can mine 50% more with a steel pickaxe than with an iron pickaxe, he can mine 24 + (24 * 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe.

Now, let's find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day with steel pickaxes. Since one dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe, 40 dwarves can mine 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds of ore per day.

Finally, let's find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in 30 days with steel pickaxes. Since they can mine 1440 pounds of ore per day, they can mine 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds of ore in 30 days.

"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to determine the ratio of the price to the number of sandwiches for the first two packages. 

The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3, so the price per sandwich is $3 / 2 = $1.5 per sandwich. 

The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6, so the price per sandwich is $6 / 4 = $1.5 per sandwich. 

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is consistent across all packages. Therefore, the price per sandwich is $1.5.

To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we multiply the price per sandwich by the number of sandwiches: $1.5 * 8 = $12.

"To find the number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons after each event.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

First, 40% of the red balloons burst. 40% of 25 is 0.4 x 25 = 10. So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

Next, Sally released half of the yellow balloons. Half of 12 is 6, so she released 6 yellow balloons, leaving 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.

Then, she found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch. 75% of 8 is 0.75 x 8 = 6. So, she added 6 blue balloons to her clutch.

Now, let's count the total number of balloons she had: 15 red balloons, 7 green balloons, 6 yellow balloons, and 6 blue balloons.

"To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to consider the scenarios where he won't get an extension. 

First, let's consider the scenario where the substitute teacher is present. In this case, there's a 50% chance of the substitute teacher not collecting the homework. 

Now, let's consider the scenario where the normal teacher is present. In this case, there's a 60% chance that the homework will not be collected (100% - 40% chance of an extension). 

Now, we need to find the probability that Marcus can't convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment. This is 80% (100% - 20% chance of getting a personal extension).

The probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is the sum of the probabilities of the two scenarios where he won't get an extension:

(0.5 * 100%) + (0.6 * 0.8 * 100%) = 0.5 + 0.48 = 0.98 or 98%

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many small beans Grandpa can eat. 

First, we know that it takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up. Since he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, he can eat 2 * 75 = 150 medium-sized beans.

We are also given that eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. This means that 1 medium-sized bean is equal to 3 small beans. 

Now, we can find out how many small beans Grandpa can eat by multiplying the number of medium-sized beans he can eat by 3. 

150 medium-sized beans * 3 small beans/medium-sized bean = 450 small beans

"To find out how much Melissa makes per hour after expenses, we need to first calculate her total earnings and total expenses. 

Melissa spends 6 hours a day for 3 days, so her total hours worked is 6 * 3 = 18 hours. 

Her total earnings are $15 per day for 3 days, which is 15 * 3 = $45.

Her total expenses for parking are $3 per day for 3 days, which is 3 * 3 = $9.

Now, we subtract her total expenses from her total earnings to find her net earnings: 45 - 9 = $36.

To find out how much she makes per hour after expenses, we divide her net earnings by her total hours worked: 36 / 18 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of the books and the cost of the pencils separately and then add them together.

The cost of the books is 3 * 16 = 48 dollars.
The cost of the pencils is 3 * 6 = 18 dollars.

Now, we add the cost of the books and the pencils together: 48 + 18 = 66 dollars.

So, Ted spent a total of 66 dollars.

The final answer is: $66"
"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to first determine how many soda bottles he will place along the driveway. 

Since the driveway is 24 feet wide and he wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet, we can divide the width of the driveway by the spacing between the bottles to find the total number of bottles:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Since it takes Richard 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, we can multiply the number of bottles by the time it takes to set off each one:

8 bottles * 5 seconds per bottle = 40 seconds

Therefore, it will take Richard 40 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find out how many packs Uncle Franky can make, we first need to determine the total number of apples he has. Since he ordered two boxes and each box has 40 apples, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of apples in each box.

Total apples = 2 boxes * 40 apples/box = 80 apples

Next, we need to find out how many packs he can make with 80 apples. Since each pack has 8 apples, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples in each pack.

Number of packs = Total apples / apples per pack = 80 / 8 = 10

So, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples. 

10"
"To find out how much money Amor will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she bought. 

The cost of 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese is 2 * $11 = $22.
The cost of 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese is 3 * $6 = $18.
The total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40.

Since Amor starts with $50, we subtract the total cost of the cheese from her initial amount of money: $50 - $40 = $10.

So, Amor will have $10 left to buy meat."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim lost due to loans and lost income while in college. 

First, let's calculate the total amount of loans he took out: 
$50,000/year * 4 years = $200,000

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money he lost due to not working while in college. 
His income before college was $25,000/year. 
His income after college is $25,000/year * 3 = $75,000/year. 
The difference in income is $75,000/year - $25,000/year = $50,000/year. 
The total amount of money he lost due to not working while in college is $50,000/year * 4 years = $200,000.

The total amount of money he needs to earn is the sum of the loans and the lost income: 
$200,000 (loans) + $200,000 (lost income) = $400,000.

Now, let's calculate how long it will take him to earn this amount at his new income of $75,000/year. 
Time = Total amount / Annual income 
Time = $400,000 / $75,000 
Time = 5.33 years

The final answer is: 5.33"
"To find the total area of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the two pieces of fabric. 

The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric that are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, we add 2 feet to both the length and the width of the bed.

New length = 6 + 2 = 8 feet
New width = 8 + 2 = 10 feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the new dimensions by 2 to get the total area of fabric needed.

Total length = 8 * 2 = 16 feet
Total width = 10 * 2 = 20 feet

Now, we multiply the total length and total width to get the total area of fabric needed.

Total area = Total length * Total width = 16 * 20 = 320 square feet

The final answer is: 320"
"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then add them together.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. One-fifth of 425 is 425 / 5 = 85. 17 more than that is 85 + 17 = 102. So, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. Twice as many as Tuesday is 102 * 2 = 204. 5 more than that is 204 + 5 = 209. So, on Wednesday, they delivered 209 letters.

Now, let's add the number of letters delivered each day: 425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736.

The final answer is: 736"
"To find the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad separately and then add them together.

The cost of the chicken salad is 10 people * $6.50 per person = $65.
The cost of the pasta salad is 6 people * $6 per person = $36.

Now, we add the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad together: $65 + $36 = $101.

The total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $101."
"To find the average loss, we need to calculate the total loss and then divide it by the number of races. 

First, let's find the amount Johnny's dad lost in the first race, which is given as $5.

In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. So, the amount he won in the second race is 2 * $5 + $1 = $11.

In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, the amount he lost in the third race is 1.5 * $11 = $16.50.

Now, let's calculate the total loss. The total loss is the sum of the loss in the first race and the loss in the third race minus the win in the second race. Total loss = $5 - $11 + $16.50 = $10.50.

The number of races is 3. 

To find the average loss, we divide the total loss by the number of races. Average loss = $10.50 / 3 = $3.50.

The final answer is: $3.50"
"To find the total population of South America, we need to calculate the total number of people living in all the cities. 

First, we find the total number of people in one country: 
5 cities * 1000 people per city = 5000 people per country

Since there are 26 countries in South America, we multiply the number of people per country by the total number of countries:
5000 people per country * 26 countries = 130,000 people

The final answer is: 130,000"
"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we first need to calculate their current heights. 

Xavier's initial height was 4 feet, which is equivalent to 48 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches). He grew 3 inches over the summer, so his current height is 48 + 3 = 51 inches.

Cole's initial height was 50 inches, and he grew 2 inches over the summer, so his current height is 50 + 2 = 52 inches.

Now, we can find the difference in their heights by subtracting Xavier's height from Cole's height: 52 - 51 = 1 inch.

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the share of the first person, we need to determine the amounts taken by the second and third people first. 

Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as x. 

The second person took $80 more than the first, so the second person took x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person took 2(x + 80).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920.

Combine like terms: x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920.

Combine like terms again: 4x + 240 = 1920.

Subtract 240 from both sides: 4x = 1680.

Divide both sides by 4: x = 420.

The share of the first person is $420."
"To find the total hours worked by each painter, we first need to calculate the total hours worked in 3 weeks. 

There are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks have 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Since the painters worked 3/8ths of a day every day, we need to convert 3/8ths to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3/8 * 24 = 9 hours.

Now, we multiply the hours worked per day by the number of days to get the total hours worked: 9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours.

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4 to get the hours worked by each painter: 189 hours / 4 = 47.25 hours.

The final answer is: 47.25"
"Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as 'x'. 

Since Rory retrieved four more balls in the first set than in the second, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set, which is given as 19. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for x, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Expanding the equation:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

Number of balls in the first set = x + 4
= 6 + 4
= 10

"To find the price of the car in the year 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation of the car from 2007 to 2010.

The car was bought in 2007 for $20,000. 

The price of the car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year. 

First, we'll calculate the depreciation for the first year (2008):
Price in 2008 = 20,000 - (20,000 * 0.21) = 20,000 - 4,200 = $15,800

Next, we'll calculate the depreciation for the second year (2009):
Price in 2009 = 15,800 - (15,800 * 0.21) = 15,800 - 3,318 = $12,482

Finally, we'll calculate the depreciation for the third year (2010):
Price in 2010 = 12,482 - (12,482 * 0.21) = 12,482 - 2,623.22 = $9,858.78

The price of the car in the year 2010 is $9,858.78.

"To find the number of Spanish books, we first need to determine the total number of books that are not written in English. 

Since half of the books are written in English, that's 50 / 2 = 25 books in English.

We are also given that 10% of the books are written in German. To find the number of German books, we need to calculate 10% of 50, which is 0.1 * 50 = 5 books in German.

Now, to find the number of Spanish books, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books: 50 - 25 - 5 = 20 books in Spanish.

"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we need to subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance. 

First, let's calculate the total distance Bernice has driven: 
Distance driven = 325 kilometers/day * 4 days = 1300 kilometers

Now, let's subtract the distance driven from the total distance:
Total distance = 1955 kilometers
Distance driven = 1300 kilometers
Distance left = Total distance - Distance driven
Distance left = 1955 - 1300
Distance left = 655 kilometers

"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we first need to calculate how many cups of water she drinks in 30 days. 

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. To find out how many cups she drinks in 30 days, we multiply the number of cups she drinks per day by 30.

8 cups/day * 30 days = 240 cups

Now, we need to convert the total number of cups to gallons. There are 16 cups in a gallon. To find out how many gallons, we divide the total number of cups by 16.

240 cups / 16 cups/gallon = 15 gallons

So, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days.

"To find the total number of people on the train at the final stop, we need to calculate the number of people at each step.

Initially, Romeo boards the train with 120 people.

At the first stop, 20 more people board the train. So, the total number of people becomes:
120 (initial people) + 20 (new people) = 140

At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, and twice that number (100) board the train. So, the total number of people becomes:
140 (previous total) - 50 (people who descended) + 100 (new people) = 190

At the third stop, 80 more people descend from the train. So, the total number of people becomes:
190 (previous total) - 80 (people who descended) = 110

The total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110."
"To find the total amount Alison spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

1. The tank top costs $10.
2. The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $10 + $5 = $15.
3. The tennis shoes were originally $48, but they were on sale for half price. Half of $48 is $48 / 2 = $24.
4. The athletic socks cost $8, and she had a coupon for $2 off, so the socks cost $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items: 
$10 (tank top) + $15 (shorts) + $24 (tennis shoes) + $6 (socks) = $55.

"To find the total cost of renovating your kitchen floor, we need to calculate the total number of tiles required and then multiply it by the cost of each tile.

First, let's find the area of a single tile. Since each tile is a square with a side length of 1 ft, the area of a single tile is 1 ft * 1 ft = 1 SqFt.

Now, let's find the total number of tiles required. The total area of your kitchen floor is 200 SqFt, and each tile covers 1 SqFt. So, the total number of tiles required is 200 SqFt / 1 SqFt = 200 tiles.

The cost of each tile is $12. To find the total cost, multiply the number of tiles by the cost of each tile: 200 tiles * $12/tile = $2400.

The final answer is: $2400"
"To find the increased cost of the insurance, we need to calculate 60% of the normal cost and add it to the normal cost. 

60% of $120 is 0.6 x $120 = $72. 

The increased cost is $120 + $72 = $192 per month.

To find the yearly cost, we multiply the monthly cost by 12. 

$192 x 12 = $2,304 per year.

The final answer is: $2,304"
"To find out how many loads of laundry Greg does in a week, we need to calculate the total number of sheets he puts on the beds and then divide that by the number of sheets he can wash at a time.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. Since a twin bed has 1 set of sheets and a king size bed has 1 set of sheets, the total number of sheets he puts on the beds is 4 + 1 = 5.

Since he can wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 2 and 1, which is 2. This means he can wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set at a time, which is a total of 4 sheets at a time.

Now, we divide the total number of sheets by the number of sheets he can wash at a time: 5 sheets / 4 sheets per load = 1.25 loads. However, since we can't have a fraction of a load, we round up to the nearest whole number. 

So, Greg does 2 loads of laundry per week.

To find out how many loads of laundry he does in a year, we multiply the number of loads per week by the number of weeks in a year: 2 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 104 loads/year.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

We know that Becky ate 10 slices. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake did, Jake must have eaten 10 - 3 = 7 slices.

We also know that Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake did. Since Jake ate 7 slices, Silvia must have eaten 2 * 7 = 14 slices.

To find the total number of slices eaten, we need to add up the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia. 

Total slices eaten = Becky's slices + Jake's slices + Silvia's slices
Total slices eaten = 10 + 7 + 14
Total slices eaten = 31

"Let's denote the time Donovan took as 'x'. Since Betsy took 18 minutes longer than Donovan, the time Betsy took is 'x + 18'. 

The total time taken to make the meal is the sum of the time taken by both Betsy and Donovan, which is given as 98 minutes. So, we can write the equation as x + (x + 18) = 98.

Combine like terms: 2x + 18 = 98.

Subtract 18 from both sides: 2x = 80.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 40.

Since x is the time Donovan took, and Betsy took 18 minutes longer, Betsy's time is x + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58.

The final answer is: 58"
"To calculate the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to calculate the cost of the cast, the visit, the painkillers, and the parking separately and then add them together.

The cost of the cast is $200.

The cost of the visit is $300/hour for 0.5 hours (since it's a 30-minute visit). So, the cost of the visit is $300 * 0.5 = $150.

The cost of the painkillers is $4/pill for 30 pills. So, the cost of the painkillers is $4 * 30 = $120.

The cost of parking is $6/hour for 2 hours. So, the cost of parking is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, let's add the costs together: $200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482.

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."

"To find the total number of pizzas left, we first need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club and the football team.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. 
70% of 20 is 0.7 * 20 = 14 pizzas eaten by the glee club.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. 
They ate 80% of them, which is 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas eaten by the football team.

The total number of pizzas eaten is 14 (by the glee club) + 32 (by the football team) = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered is 20 (by the glee club) + 40 (by the football team) = 60 pizzas.

The number of pizzas left is the total number of pizzas ordered minus the total number of pizzas eaten, which is 60 - 46 = 14 pizzas.

"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of big coupons. Since there are twice as many big coupons as small coupons, and there are 700 small coupons, the number of big coupons is 2 * 700 = 1400.

The cost of mailing the small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents.

The cost of mailing the big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

Now, we add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons together: 3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100: 24500 / 100 = 245 dollars.

"To find out how many meatballs were in the sub sandwiches that remained, we first need to determine how many meatballs Sidney initially ordered. 

Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, so Sidney ordered 10 - 3 = 7 meatball sub sandwiches. 

Each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, so Sidney initially had 7 * 4 = 28 meatballs.

Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, which means he ate 4 * 4 = 16 meatballs.

After Mark ate 4 of the sub sandwiches, Sidney had 7 - 4 = 3 sub sandwiches left. 

Sidney then ordered 3 more sub sandwiches, so he had a total of 3 + 3 = 6 sub sandwiches left.

The total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is 6 * 4 = 24.

"To find the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we first need to determine the number of trucks that did not experience mechanical failures. 

Since a quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures, we can calculate the number of trucks that failed as follows:

Number of trucks dispatched = 20
Number of trucks that failed = 20 * (1/4) = 5

Now, we subtract the number of trucks that failed from the total number of trucks dispatched to find the number of trucks that reached the farmers:

Number of trucks that reached the farmers = 20 - 5 = 15

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. To find the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we multiply the number of trucks that reached the farmers by the tons of fertiliser each truck carried:

Total tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers = 15 * 20 = 300

"To find the total cost of the party, we need to calculate the number of guests and then add the rental fee. 

First, let's find the total number of guests. Kayla invited 25 classmates, 7 dance class girls, and 13 family members, but 4 people said they couldn't come. 

Total invited guests = 25 (classmates) + 7 (dance class) + 13 (family members) = 45
Guests who can attend = Total invited guests - Guests who can't come = 45 - 4 = 41

Since the initial party package is for 20 guests, we need to calculate the additional guests. 

Additional guests = Guests who can attend - Initial party package = 41 - 20 = 21

Now, we can find the total cost by adding the rental fee and the cost for the additional guests. 

Rental fee = $125
Cost for additional guests = $6 * Additional guests = $6 * 21 = $126
Total cost = Rental fee + Cost for additional guests = $125 + $126 = $251

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money Maggie and Riza had initially. Since they both have $60 left after spending a portion of their money, we can set up an equation to represent the situation.

Let's say Maggie had x dollars initially. Since she spent a quarter of her money, she has 3/4x dollars left. Similarly, let's say Riza had y dollars initially. Since she spent one-third of her money, she has 2/3y dollars left.

We know that both of them have $60 left, so we can set up the following equations:

3/4x = 60
2/3y = 60

To solve for x and y, we can multiply both sides of each equation by the reciprocal of the fraction:

x = 60 * 4/3
x = 80

y = 60 * 3/2
y = 90

Now that we know Maggie had $80 and Riza had $90 initially, we can find the total amount of money they had:

Total money = x + y
Total money = 80 + 90
Total money = 170

They had a total of $170 initially. To find out how much money they have left, we need to subtract the amount they spent from the initial amount. Since Maggie spent a quarter of her money and Riza spent one-third of her money, the total amount they spent is:

Maggie spent: 1/4 * 80 = 20
Riza spent: 1/3 * 90 = 30

Total spent = 20 + 30 = 50

Now, we can subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount to find the amount they have left:

Amount left = Total money - Total spent
Amount left = 170 - 50
Amount left = 120

The final answer is: $120"
"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we first need to determine how many bananas the second monkey eats. 

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day.

Since Mr. Robles has three monkeys and they eat a total of 315 bananas in a week, we need to find out how many bananas they eat in a day. There are 7 days in a week, so the total number of bananas eaten in a day is 315 / 7 = 45 bananas.

We already know that the first monkey eats 10 bananas and the second monkey eats 14 bananas each day. So, the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys is 10 + 14 = 24 bananas.

Since the total number of bananas eaten in a day is 45, the third monkey eats 45 - 24 = 21 bananas each day.

The final answer is: 21"
"To find out how many puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we need to determine how many pieces he placed in total and then subtract the pieces he placed before the hour. 

Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, which is 500 / 2 = 250 pieces. 

Then, he finished another 500 piece puzzle. 

So, in total, he placed 250 + 500 = 750 pieces. 

Since he already placed 250 pieces before the hour, we subtract those from the total to find out how many pieces he placed during the hour: 750 - 250 = 500.

The final answer is: 500"
"To find out how much Jenny paid for the roses, we need to determine if she bought the roses by the dozen or individually. Since she bought 15 roses, it's more cost-effective for her to buy a dozen (12 roses) and 3 individual roses.

The cost of a dozen roses is $15. The cost of 3 individual roses is 3 * $2 = $6. So, the total cost is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny arrived with five $5 bills, which is a total of 5 * $5 = $25. To find out how much change she gets, we subtract the cost of the roses from the amount she paid with: $25 - $21 = $4.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the $4 into quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so there are 4 * 4 = 16 quarters in $4.

Jenny leaves with 16 quarters."
"To find the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to calculate the revenue from each item and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the revenue from milkshakes: 
6 milkshakes * $5.50 each = 6 * 5.50 = $33

Next, let's calculate the revenue from burger platters: 
9 burger platters * $11 each = 9 * 11 = $99

Now, let's calculate the revenue from sodas: 
20 sodas * $1.50 each = 20 * 1.50 = $30

Finally, let's add the revenue from all items together: 
$33 + $99 + $30 = $162

The final answer is: $162"
"To find out how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the time intervals between the trains and the time Paul needs to wait for the fourth train.

The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the first train leaves the station after 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes after the first train's arrival. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station after 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes after the first train's arrival. The third train leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it leaves at 125 minutes.

The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes after the first train's arrival. Since Paul is waiting at the station from the start, we need to calculate the time from the start to when the fourth train arrives.

The time Paul needs to wait is 145 minutes.

The final answer is: 145"
"To find out how many more weeks Melanie needs to save toothpicks, we first need to determine how many toothpicks she has saved so far. 

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week and has been doing so for 12 weeks. 

Number of toothpicks saved so far = 10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks.

Since Melanie needs 200 toothpicks in total, we need to find out how many more toothpicks she needs to save. 

Number of toothpicks needed = 200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks.

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take Melanie to save 80 toothpicks at a rate of 10 toothpicks per week.

Number of weeks needed = 80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we first need to find the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch and the price at which he sold it to his friend.

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price, so the price he paid is 75% of $2000, which is 0.75 * $2000 = $1500.

Then, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, which is 1.2 * $1500 = $1800.

To find the discount percentage, we need to find the difference between the original price and the price at which Mr. Rogers' friend bought the watch, and then divide it by the original price and multiply by 100.

The discount percentage is (($2000 - $1800) / $2000) * 100 = (200 / 2000) * 100 = 10%.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours and then multiply it by the rate at which the springs create jellyfish.

There are 60 minutes in an hour and 60 seconds in a minute. So, the total number of seconds in 4 hours is:

60 minutes/hour * 60 seconds/minute * 4 hours = 14400 seconds

Since each spring creates a new jellyfish every second, the total number of jellyfish created by one spring in 14400 seconds is 14400.

Now, if we have 5 springs working at the same rate, the total number of jellyfish created in 14400 seconds is:

14400 * 5 = 72000

So, 5 springs working at the same rate would create 72000 jellyfish in 4 hours.

The final answer is: 72000"
"To find Frankie's score, we need to first calculate twice Binkie's score. Binkie's score is 90, so twice that would be 2 * 90 = 180.

Since Frankie's score is 15 better than twice Binkie's, we need to add 15 to the result. Frankie's score = 180 + 15 = 195.

The final answer is: 195"
"To find the total distance James walked, we need to calculate the round trip distance. Since he walked halfway to the store and then back home, the total distance is 2 * 4 miles = 8 miles.

Since James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour, we can use the formula time = distance / speed to find the total time taken. 

time = 8 miles / 4 miles per hour = 2 hours

However, this is the total time taken for the round trip. We need to find the time taken to reach the store initially. Since James walked halfway to the store and then back home, the time taken to reach the store initially is half of the total time.

Time taken to reach the store initially = 2 hours / 2 = 1 hour

The final answer is: 1"
"To find out how much money Jenny saved, we first need to calculate the total cost of buying the bananas individually and then compare it to the cost of buying them in bunches.

If Jenny buys 10 bunches with 4 bananas per bunch, she buys a total of 10 * 4 = 40 bananas.

The cost of buying 40 bananas individually would be 40 * $0.80 = $32.00.

The cost of buying 10 bunches is $3.00 per bunch, so the total cost is 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

To find the savings, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

So, Jenny saved $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much fence each person gets. Let's say Sam gets x feet of fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets x + 60 feet of fence.

We know that the total amount of fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence. 

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we need to determine the rate at which it grows per year. 

The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. To find the annual growth rate, we divide the total growth by the number of years: 8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches per year.

Now, we can multiply the annual growth rate by the number of years to find the total growth: 2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches.

The final answer is: 26"
"To find out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply it by its price.

First, let's find the number of each type of bike sold:

- Total bikes sold: 300
- Trekking bikes: 300 / 2 = 150
- BMX bikes: 300 * 0.15 = 45
- MTB bikes: 300 - (150 + 45) = 105

Now, let's calculate the total earnings from each type of bike:
- Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500
- BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250 (since BMX is half the price of MTB, which is $500, so BMX is $500 / 2 = $250)
- MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500

Now, let's add up the total earnings from all types of bikes:
$67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250

The final answer is: $131,250"
"To find out how many bales of hay are left in the field, we need to calculate the total number of bales made by the farmer and the total number of bales picked up by the truck, then subtract the number of bales picked up from the number of bales made.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour and works for 6 hours, so the total number of bales made is 5 * 6 = 30.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour and works for 6 hours, so the total number of bales picked up is 3 * 6 = 18.

Now, we subtract the number of bales picked up from the number of bales made: 30 - 18 = 12.

So, there are 12 bales of hay left in the field.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total time John spends learning, we need to calculate the time spent in classes, and the time spent on Saturday and Sunday.

First, let's find the time spent in classes. John takes 2 extra classes, each 40 minutes long, 5 days a week. So, the total time spent in classes per week is:
2 classes * 40 minutes/class * 5 days/week = 400 minutes/week

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time spent in classes to hours:
400 minutes/week / 60 minutes/hour = 6.67 hours/week

Next, let's find the time spent on Saturday and Sunday. John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on extra learning time. There are 7 days in a week, so the total minutes in a week is:
7 days/week * 24 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour = 1680 minutes/week

John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on extra learning time:
(1/16) * 1680 minutes/week = 105 minutes/week

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time spent on Saturday and Sunday to hours:
105 minutes/week / 60 minutes/hour = 1.75 hours/week

Now, we add the time spent in classes and the time spent on Saturday and Sunday to find the total time spent learning:
6.67 hours/week + 1.75 hours/week = 8.42 hours/week

The final answer is: 8.42"
"To find the height of the ball on its second bounce, we need to calculate the height of the ball after the first bounce and then multiply it by 2/3.

The initial height of the ball is the height of the third floor, which is 24 feet.

On the first bounce, the ball reaches 2/3 of its initial height, so the height after the first bounce is:
24 * (2/3) = 16 feet

On the second bounce, the ball reaches 2/3 of the height it had after the first bounce, so the height after the second bounce is:
16 * (2/3) = 10.67 feet

The final answer is: 10.67"
"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the height of each child in inches. 

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the first child's height in inches is 6 * 12 = 72 inches.

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child's height is 72 + 2 = 74 inches.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child's height is 74 - 5 = 69 inches.

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child's height is 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

The final answer is: 72"
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to determine how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we can divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10).

2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags

Now that we know the orchard sold 200 bags, we can multiply the number of bags by the price per bag ($5) to find the total earnings.

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The orchard earned $1000."
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the amount of meat left after the Allosaurus ate. 

The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat. Before that, the velociraptors scavenged half of what was left. So, the amount of meat left after the velociraptors ate was twice the amount the Allosaurus ate, which is 2 * 270 = 540 kilograms.

Now, the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, and the velociraptors scavenged half of what was left. This means the velociraptors ate half of the remaining half, which is 1/4 of the original amount. So, the amount of meat left after the T-Rex ate was 4 times the amount the velociraptors ate, which is 4 * 540 = 2160 kilograms.

Since the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, the original amount of meat on the triceratops was twice the amount the T-Rex ate, which is 2 * 2160 = 4320 kilograms.

The final answer is: 4320"
"To find the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted and then divide it by the coverage of a gallon of paint to find out how many gallons are needed. After that, we can multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon to get the total cost.

First, let's calculate the area of each wall:
- North wall: 10 x 8 = 80 square feet
- South wall: 10 x 8 = 80 square feet
- East wall: 5 x 8 = 40 square feet
- West wall: 5 x 8 = 40 square feet

Now, let's add up the areas of all the walls:
80 + 80 + 40 + 40 = 240 square feet

Since a gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, we need to divide the total area by 20 to find out how many gallons are needed:
240 / 20 = 12 gallons

Now, let's multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon to find the total cost:
12 gallons * $12/gallon = $144

"To find the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to determine the probability of her choosing a shaken can out of the remaining cans.

Initially, there were 12 sodas in total. Ellen shook 3 of them, so there are 3 shaken sodas and 9 unshaken sodas. Ellen took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 8 unshaken sodas and 3 shaken sodas.

Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 2 shaken sodas and 6 unshaken sodas.

Now, there are 2 shaken sodas and 6 unshaken sodas. The total number of sodas is 8.

The probability of Ellen's friend choosing a shaken can is the number of shaken cans divided by the total number of cans: 2/8 = 0.25.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.25 * 100 = 25%.

"To find the distance between the two trains after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled and then add those distances together.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, we add the distances they've traveled to find the total distance between them: 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

The final answer is: 270"
"To find the total number of people Billy can help, we first need to determine the number of days he works. 

March has 31 days, and April has 19 days (since April 19th is the last day he works). So, the total number of days in this period is 31 + 19 = 50 days.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, we need to find 20% of 50. To do this, we multiply 50 by 0.2: 50 * 0.2 = 10. 

This means Billy takes 10 days off. So, the number of days he works is 50 - 10 = 40 days.

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, which means he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

To find the total number of people he can help, we multiply the number of days he works by the number of people he can help per day: 40 * 6 = 240.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the total number of people inside the church, we first need to calculate the total number of people that were transported by the buses and the cars. 

The number of people transported by the buses is the number of buses multiplied by the number of people each bus can carry: 12 buses * 35 people/bus = 420 people.

The number of people transported by the cars is the number of cars multiplied by the number of people each car can carry: 20 cars * 3 people/car = 60 people.

The total number of people transported is the sum of the people transported by the buses and the cars: 420 people + 60 people = 480 people.

Since the question asks for the number of people inside the church, we need to subtract the total number of people transported from the total number of people present (which is not given). However, we can infer that the total number of people present is the sum of the people transported and the people inside the church. 

Let's denote the number of people inside the church as x. Then, the total number of people present is x + 480. However, the total number of people present is not given, so we cannot calculate the exact number of people inside the church."

"To find the time it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of each slide by the speed at which people slide down.

For the biggest slide: time = length / speed = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide: time = length / speed = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

To find the difference in time, we subtract the time it takes to ride the second biggest slide from the time it takes to ride the biggest slide: 
time difference = 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

"To find the total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks, we need to calculate the total time spent per day and then multiply it by 5.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 x 15-minute breaks per day. 
Total time spent per day = 30 minutes (lunch) + 2 x 15 minutes (breaks) = 30 + 30 = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60. 
60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Bobby spends 1 hour per day on lunch and breaks. 
Total time spent in 5 days = 1 hour/day x 5 days = 5 hours

The total time spent on lunch and breaks after 5 days is 5 hours."
"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we first need to determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can multiply 8 by 3.5 to find out how many miles Micah ran.

8 * 3.5 = 28 miles

Now that we know Micah ran 28 miles, we can subtract the total miles run by Amber and Micah from the total miles run by all three to find out how many miles Ahito ran.

Total miles run by all three = 52 miles
Miles run by Amber = 8 miles
Miles run by Micah = 28 miles
Miles run by Ahito = Total miles run by all three - (Miles run by Amber + Miles run by Micah)
Miles run by Ahito = 52 - (8 + 28)
Miles run by Ahito = 52 - 36
Miles run by Ahito = 16 miles

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total amount she spent after returning the item and then add that to the initial charge minus the returned item.

First, let's calculate the amount Sheila got back after returning the item:
$85.00 (initial charge) - $15.00 (returned item) = $70.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of the frying pan:
The frying pan was on sale for 20% off $20.00. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage:
$20.00 * 0.20 = $4.00
Now, subtract the discount from the original price:
$20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

The cost of the frying pan is $16.00.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the set of towels:
The set of towels was 10% off $30.00. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage:
$30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00
Now, subtract the discount from the original price:
$30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

The cost of the set of towels is $27.00.

Now, let's add the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels to the amount Sheila got back after returning the item:
$70.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $113.00

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. 

A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is x/5.

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (x/5) * (1/3) = x/15.

The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue, so the number of small jellyfish is x - x/5 = 4x/5.

We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color, which means x/15 = 6.

To find the total number of jellyfish, we can solve for x: x/15 = 6 => x = 6 * 15 = 90.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find Caroline's age, we need to determine Ben's age first, and then multiply it by 3.

Since Chris is 4 years old, and Ben is two times older than Chris, we can calculate Ben's age as follows:
Ben's age = 2 * Chris's age
Ben's age = 2 * 4
Ben's age = 8

Now that we know Ben's age, we can find Caroline's age by multiplying Ben's age by 3:
Caroline's age = 3 * Ben's age
Caroline's age = 3 * 8

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate Lauren's total savings needed for retirement and then determine how many years she needs to work to achieve this goal.

First, let's calculate Lauren's annual expenses in retirement. Since she plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary, her annual expenses will be 0.4 * $100,000 = $40,000.

Next, we need to calculate the total amount Lauren needs to save for retirement. Assuming she will live for 20 years in retirement, we can use the formula for the present value of an annuity to calculate the total amount needed:

Total Amount = Annual Expenses * Number of Years
Total Amount = $40,000 * 20
Total Amount = $800,000

However, this is the amount she needs to live for 20 years, but we need to consider the fact that she will be saving 20% of her salary each year. So, we need to calculate the total amount she will save over her working years.

Let's assume Lauren will work for 'x' years. The total amount she will save is the sum of the annual savings, which is 20% of her salary, for 'x' years. The formula for the future value of an annuity can be used to calculate this:

Total Savings = Annual Savings * (1 + r)^x - 1 / r
where r is the interest rate, which we will assume to be 0 (since we are not considering any interest rate).

However, since we are not considering any interest rate, we can simplify the formula to:
Total Savings = Annual Savings * x

Annual Savings = 0.2 * $100,000
Annual Savings = $20,000

Now, we can set up the equation to find 'x':
$20,000 * x = $800,000

x = $800,000 / $20,000
x = 40

However, this is the number of years she needs to work to save $800,000, but we need to consider the fact that she will be saving 20% of her salary each year, and her salary will increase over time. To simplify the calculation, we can assume that her salary will increase at a constant rate, but since we are not given any information about the rate of increase, we will assume that her salary remains constant.

Since Lauren needs to save $800,000 and she will save $20,000 each year, she needs to work for 40 years. However, she plans to live for 20 years in retirement, so she will need to work for 40 + 20 = 60 years to save enough for retirement.

However, this is not the answer we are looking for. We need to find out how many more years she needs to work, not the total number of years she needs to work.

Since Lauren has already worked for some years (let's assume she has worked for 'y' years), she has already saved some amount. Let's calculate the amount she has saved so far:

Amount Saved = Annual Savings * y
Amount Saved = $20,000 * y

Now, we can set up the equation to find 'y':
$20,000 * y = $800,000 - (Amount Saved in the last year)

However, we don't know the amount saved in the last year, so we will assume that she will save the same amount in the last year as she saves in the first year, which is $20,000.

Amount Saved in the last year = $20,000

Now, we can set up the equation to find 'y':
$20,000 * y = $800,000 - $20,000
$20,000 * y = $780,000

y = $780,000 / $20,000
y = 39

Now, we can find the number of years she needs to work:
Number of Years = 60 - 39
Number of Years = 21

The final answer is: 21"
"To find the length of each final cut, we first need to divide the total length of the ribbon by 4 to get the length of each of the initial cuts. 

100 cm / 4 = 25 cm

Then, we need to divide the length of each initial cut by 5 to get the length of each final cut.

25 cm / 5 = 5 cm

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total number of students in the school, we need to first find the total number of students that 40% represents. Since 40% of the students are boys and that equals 240, we can set up the equation:

0.4x = 240

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 0.4:

x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

So, the total number of students in the school is 600. 

Now, to find the number of girls, we need to find 60% of the total number of students (since 100% - 40% = 60%). We can set up the equation:

0.6x = 0.6 * 600
0.6x = 360

To find the number of girls, we divide both sides by 0.6:

x = 360 / 0.6
x = 600

However, this is the number of girls as a percentage of the total number of students. To find the actual number of girls, we need to find 60% of the total number of students. Since we already know the total number of students is 600, we can find the number of girls by multiplying 600 by 0.6:

Number of girls = 600 * 0.6
Number of girls = 360

The number of girls in the school is 360."
"To find the total amount spent, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items before applying the coupon. 

The cost of the set of pots is $19, and the cost of the sack of garden soil is $26. 

Total cost before coupon = cost of pots + cost of soil
Total cost before coupon = $19 + $26
Total cost before coupon = $45

Now, we need to subtract the coupon value from the total cost before coupon to get the final amount spent.

Final amount spent = Total cost before coupon - coupon value
Final amount spent = $45 - $7
Final amount spent = $38

The final answer is: $38"
"To find the average height of heels at the party, we need to calculate the total height of all the heels and then divide it by the total number of women.

The total number of women is 6 (3 wearing 4 inch heels and 3 wearing 2 inch heels).

The total height of the 4 inch heels is 3 x 4 = 12 inches.
The total height of the 2 inch heels is 3 x 2 = 6 inches.

The total height of all the heels is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.

The average height of heels at the party is 18 / 6 = 3 inches.

The final answer is: 3"
"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike, we first need to calculate the total number of days in June. June has 30 days.

Since Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in 30 days, we can calculate her daily target by dividing the total miles by the number of days:

9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

Soledad plans to hike 125 miles twice a day, which is a total of 250 miles per day. To find out how many more miles per day she needs to hike, we subtract her planned daily miles from her target daily miles:

310 miles per day - 250 miles per day = 60 miles per day

So, Soledad must hike 60 more miles per day to complete her journey on time.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the total amount the store will receive after selling all the balls, we need to calculate the total revenue from each color of ball and add them together.

The store has 3 red balls, and each red ball costs $9. So, the total revenue from red balls is 3 * $9 = $27.

The store has 11 blue balls, and each blue ball costs $5. So, the total revenue from blue balls is 11 * $5 = $55.

The store has 25 green balls, and each green ball costs $3. So, the total revenue from green balls is 25 * $3 = $75.

Now, let's add the revenue from all the balls together: $27 + $55 + $75 = $157.

The store will receive a total of $157 after selling all the balls.

The final answer is: $157"
"To find out how much James will have left, we first need to determine how much Pierre and Paul will take. 

Pierre wants a quarter of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/4 = 3 kg. 

Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/3 = 4 kg.

So, Pierre and Paul will take 3 + 4 = 7 kg in total.

Since there are three people (Pierre, Paul, and Jacques), and we know that Pierre and Paul will take 7 kg, we can assume that Jacques will take the remaining amount. 

The total amount of apples is 12 kg, and Pierre and Paul will take 7 kg, so Jacques will have 12 - 7 = 5 kg.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the temperature in the morning, we need to subtract the temperature drop from the initial temperature and then add the temperature increase.

Initial temperature = 2 degrees Celsius
Temperature drop = 8 degrees Celsius
Temperature increase = 3 degrees Celsius

Temperature in the morning = Initial temperature - Temperature drop + Temperature increase
= 2 - 8 + 3
= -3

The final answer is: -3"
"To find out how much money Raymond has left, we need to subtract the amount he spent from the amount he had initially, and then add the amount he saved.

Raymond initially had $21. He saved $11, so we add that to his initial amount: $21 + $11 = $32.

Then, he spent $5 on a comic book and $19 on a puzzle, so we subtract the total amount he spent from the new total: $32 - ($5 + $19) = $32 - $24 = $8.

So, Raymond has $8 left.

The final answer is: $8"
"To find out how much each book cost, we need to first determine how much Anna spent on the books. We know she had a budget of $16 and had $2 left, so she spent $16 - $2 = $14 on the books.

Since Anna bought 2 books and they cost the same amount of money, we can divide the total amount she spent ($14) by 2 to find the cost of each book.

Cost of each book = Total amount spent / Number of books
Cost of each book = $14 / 2
Cost of each book = $7

The final answer is: $7"
"To find the number of students enrolled this year, we need to calculate 20% of the previous year's enrollment and add it to the previous year's enrollment.

20% of 50 is 0.20 x 50 = 10.

So, the increase in enrollment is 10 students.

To find the total number of students this year, we add the increase to the previous year's enrollment: 50 + 10 = 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times, we need to first find the rate at which the light blinks per minute. 

The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. To find the rate per minute, we divide the number of blinks by the time in minutes: 255 blinks / 5 minutes = 51 blinks per minute.

Now, we can find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times by dividing the total number of blinks by the rate per minute: 459 blinks / 51 blinks per minute.

459 / 51 = 9 minutes.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the total number of male and female fishes, we need to add the initial and additional numbers of each type.

Initial male guppies: 4
Additional male guppies: 2
Total male guppies: 4 + 2 = 6

Initial female guppies: 7
Additional female guppies: 1
Total female guppies: 7 + 1 = 8

Initial male goldfishes: 3
Additional male goldfishes: 2
Total male goldfishes: 3 + 2 = 5

Initial female goldfishes: 5
Additional female goldfishes: 3
Total female goldfishes: 5 + 3 = 8

Now, let's find the total number of male and female fishes:
Total male fishes: 6 (guppies) + 5 (goldfishes) = 11
Total female fishes: 8 (guppies) + 8 (goldfishes) = 16

To find the difference between the number of female and male fishes, we subtract the total number of male fishes from the total number of female fishes:
Difference = Total female fishes - Total male fishes
Difference = 16 - 11
Difference = 5

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total time they all took to do their chores, we need to calculate the time each person took and add them together.

Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia, so Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours to walk the dog.

Dior took 4 hours longer than Amalia, so Dior took 4 + 4 = 8 hours to do laundry.

Now, let's add the time each person took to do their chores: 4 (Amalia) + 6 (Megan) + 8 (Dior) = 18 hours.

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 18 hours.

"To find the total distance John drives in a round trip, we need to calculate the distance of a single trip and then multiply it by 2.

The distance of a single trip is calculated by multiplying the speed by the time: 
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 70 mph * 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles

Since John makes two trips a month, we multiply the distance of a single trip by 2:
Total Distance = 2 * 140 miles
Total Distance = 280 miles

So, John drives 280 miles a month when visiting his parents.

280"
"To find out how many miles Brian will walk in 7 days, we first need to determine how far Sofie will walk in 7 days. Since Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, we multiply 10 miles by 7 days.

10 miles/day * 7 days = 70 miles

Since Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days, we can set up an equation where Sofie's distance is twice Brian's distance. Let's represent Brian's distance as B. 

70 miles = 2 * B

To find Brian's distance, we divide both sides of the equation by 2.

B = 70 miles / 2
B = 35 miles

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

The final answer is: 35"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers and then find out how many toys the fifth worker must produce to meet the remaining demand.

First, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the 2 workers who produce 6 toys an hour. Since they work for 10 hours, they produce a total of 2 * 6 * 10 = 120 toys.

Next, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the other 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour. Since they work for 10 hours, they produce a total of 2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys.

The total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to meet the order, the fifth worker must produce 20 toys in 10 hours.

To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker (20) by the number of hours worked (10). 

20 / 10 = 2

The fifth worker produces 2 toys per hour."
"To find the total weight of Elijah's dogs, we first need to find the weight of each of his dogs. 

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so we multiply 60 by 1/4 to find the weight of Elijah's first dog: 60 * 1/4 = 15 pounds.

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so we multiply 60 by 1/2 to find the weight of Elijah's second dog: 60 * 1/2 = 30 pounds.

Now, we add the weights of Elijah's two dogs to find the total weight of his dogs: 15 + 30 = 45 pounds.

To find the total weight of all three dogs, we add the weight of Kory's dog to the total weight of Elijah's dogs: 60 + 45 = 105 pounds.

The final answer is: 105"
"To solve this problem, let's work backwards from the information given.

Kris had 7 stickers left after giving some to Rob. Before that, Kris had 7 + 9 = 16 stickers.

Luis gave the rest of the stickers to Kris, so Luis had 16 stickers. Since Luis used half of the stickers, he must have had twice as many as he gave to Kris. Therefore, Luis had 16 * 2 = 32 stickers.

Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis had half of Seth's stickers. Since Luis had 32 stickers, Seth must have had 32 * 2 = 64 stickers.

The final numerical answer is: 64"
"To find the total number of M&M's John has, we need to calculate the total weight of the M&M's and then multiply it by the number of M&M's per ounce. 

First, let's find the total weight of the M&M's: 3 large bags * 10 ounces per bag = 30 ounces.

Since an ounce of M&M's has 30 M&M's, the total number of M&M's is 30 ounces * 30 M&M's per ounce = 900 M&M's.

Now, we need to find out how many small bags John can make. Each small bag contains 10 M&M's, so we divide the total number of M&M's by 10: 900 M&M's / 10 M&M's per small bag = 90 small bags.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we need to first calculate half of the circumference of the earth. 

The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. Half of that would be 40,000 / 2 = 20,000 kilometers.

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly 20,000 kilometers. We know that Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. 

To find the number of days, we can divide the total distance (20,000 kilometers) by the distance Alfie flies per day (400 kilometers). 

20,000 / 400 = 50 days.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the speed of the fastest car, we need to first find the speed of the 2nd fastest car. We know that the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, which is 120 miles per hour. 

Speed of the 2nd fastest car = 5 * 120 miles per hour = 600 miles per hour.

We are also given that the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. 

Speed of the fastest car = 1.25 * 600 miles per hour = 750 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 750"
"To find Vince's current age, we first need to determine Liam's age two years ago. Since Liam is 16 now, two years ago he was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.

Two years ago, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince, so we can set up the equation: 14 = 2 * Vince's age two years ago.

To find Vince's age two years ago, we divide both sides of the equation by 2: Vince's age two years ago = 14 / 2 = 7.

Since we want to find Vince's current age, we need to add 2 to his age two years ago: Vince's current age = 7 + 2 = 9.

The final answer is: 9"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so let's call this number A.
- Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. Let's call the number of eggs Sarah painted S. Then, Camden painted S + 12 eggs.
- The total number of eggs painted by all four is 56, so we can write the equation: A + A + (S + 12) + S = 56
- Simplifying the equation, we get 2A + 2S + 12 = 56
- Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get 2A + 2S = 44
- Dividing both sides by 2, we get A + S = 22
- Since Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, we can write the equation: S + (S + 12) = 30
- Simplifying the equation, we get 2S + 12 = 30
- Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get 2S = 18
- Dividing both sides by 2, we get S = 9
- Now that we know S, we can find A by substituting S into the equation A + S = 22: A + 9 = 22
- Subtracting 9 from both sides, we get A = 13
- Now that we know A, we can find the number of eggs Camden painted: S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21
- The difference between the number of eggs Camden and Arnold painted is 21 - 13 = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we first need to find the total number of boxes Nik will need. Since each box can hold 8 crayons and Nik has 200 crayons, we can divide 200 by 8 to find the number of boxes.

200 / 8 = 25

So, Nik will need 25 boxes. Since each box weighs 8 ounces, the total weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, and Nik has 200 crayons, so the total weight of the crayons is 200 * 1 = 200 ounces.

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 200 ounces (boxes) + 200 ounces (crayons) = 400 ounces.

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we can convert the total weight from ounces to pounds by dividing by 16.

400 / 16 = 25

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how much John makes, we first need to determine how many logs he can make from the tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, we calculate 80% of 80 feet.

80% of 80 feet = 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet

Since each log is 4 feet long, we divide the total length of the usable tree by the length of each log to find out how many logs he can make.

64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs

From each log, he cuts 5 planks. So, we multiply the number of logs by the number of planks per log.

16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks

He sells each plank for $1.2, so we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank.

80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96

The final answer is: $96"
"To find the total amount of money they all have together, we first need to determine the monthly earnings of Valerie's brother and their mother.

Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is 1/2 of what her brother earns. So, her brother's monthly earnings are 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, which is 2 * ($5000 + $10,000) = 2 * $15,000 = $30,000.

Now, we can find the total amount of money they all have together by adding their individual monthly earnings: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The final answer is: $40,000."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Grandma's speed on the beach and on the sidewalk. 

Let's assume Grandma's speed on the beach is x miles per minute. Since she walks at twice the rate on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.

We know that she walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. We also know that she spends 40 minutes on the beach. 

The time it takes to walk 2 miles on the beach is 2/x. The time it takes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk is 1/(2x). 

Since the total time spent on the beach is 40 minutes, we can set up the equation: 2/x = 40.

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by x, which gives us 2 = 40x. Then, we can divide both sides by 40, which gives us x = 1/20.

Now that we know Grandma's speed on the beach, we can find her speed on the sidewalk, which is 2x = 2(1/20) = 1/10 miles per minute.

The time it takes to walk 2 miles on the beach is 2/(1/20) = 40 minutes. The time it takes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk is 1/(1/10) = 10 minutes.

The total time it takes to complete the entire 3-mile walk is 40 + 10 = 50 minutes.

"To find out how many more weeks it will take Jane to save a total of $60, we first need to calculate how much she has saved so far. 

She has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so the total amount saved is 4 * 8 = $32.

Now, we need to find out how much more she needs to save to reach $60. This is 60 - 32 = $28.

Since she saves $4 per week, we can divide the remaining amount by her weekly savings to find out how many more weeks it will take: 28 / 4 = 7.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many marbles Bob originally had. We know that if he receives 2 dozen (24) more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. 

Let's set up an equation to represent this situation:

Original number of marbles + 24 = 60

To find the original number of marbles, we need to subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:

Original number of marbles = 60 - 24
Original number of marbles = 36

Now that we know Bob originally had 36 marbles, we need to find out how many marbles he will have if he loses 10 of them. 

New number of marbles = Original number of marbles - 10
New number of marbles = 36 - 10
New number of marbles = 26

Let's denote the temperature of the second bottle as x degrees. 

When Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle into his water bottle, the total volume of water in the bottle is 5 ounces. 

Since the temperature of the mixture is at least 40 degrees, we can set up the following equation:

(33 * 4 + x * 1) / 5 >= 40

Simplifying the equation:

132 + x >= 200

Subtract 132 from both sides:

x >= 68

So, the second bottle must be at least 68 degrees.

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of cows. Melanie's father starts with 50 cows. Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, there are 21 days in three weeks. 

Number of cows added in three weeks = 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
Total number of cows = Initial number of cows + Number of cows added
Total number of cows = 50 + 420
Total number of cows = 470

Next, let's calculate the number of chickens. Melanie's father starts with 20 chickens. Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. 

Number of chickens added in three weeks = 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens
Total number of chickens = Initial number of chickens + Number of chickens added
Total number of chickens = 20 + 210
Total number of chickens = 230

Now, let's add the total number of cows and chickens to find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks.

Total number of animals = Total number of cows + Total number of chickens
Total number of animals = 470 + 230
Total number of animals = 700

"To find the cost of each single bagel, we first need to calculate the total cost of the 4 packs of bagels with the discount, and then divide that by the total number of bagels.

The cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00.

Since Russell receives a 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of $40.00, which is 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the 4 packs of bagels with the discount is $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Since each pack has 9 bagels, the total number of bagels is 4 * 9 = 36.

To find the cost of each single bagel, we divide the total cost with the discount by the total number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 = $1.00.

"To find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate, we first need to determine how many scoops 1 less than 3 scoops is. 3 scoops minus 1 is 2 scoops.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes it takes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops, which is 3 less than 6 potatoes for 2 scoops. 6 minus 3 is 3 potatoes for 2 scoops.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes it takes to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes. If 3 potatoes make 2 scoops, then 1.5 potatoes make 1 scoop. 

Now, we need to find out how many scoops Gomer ate. Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops. 23 minus 5 is 18 scoops.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes Gomer ate. If 1 scoop is 1.5 potatoes, then 18 scoops is 18 * 1.5 = 27 potatoes.

"To find the total number of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we need to calculate the number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately, and then add them together.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days is 3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs.

In the next 30 days, Chester increases his egg consumption to 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in the next 30 days is 5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs.

Now, we add the total number of eggs from both periods: 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens: 240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozen eggs.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we first need to determine the total number of red jellybeans. We know there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans, and there are 17 green jellybeans. 

So, the number of red jellybeans = 2 * 17 = 34.

We also know that the total number of jellybeans is 60. We can find the total number of green and red jellybeans by adding the number of green and red jellybeans together. 

Total green and red jellybeans = 17 (green) + 34 (red) = 51.

Now, we can find the number of blue jellybeans by subtracting the total number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans.

Number of blue jellybeans = Total jellybeans - Total green and red jellybeans

"To find the number of women who remained on the bus, we first need to find the total number of women on the bus initially. 

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, we can let the number of men be 5x and the number of women be 9x. 

Since the total number of passengers is 84, we can set up the equation 5x + 9x = 84.

Combine like terms: 14x = 84

Divide both sides by 14: x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of women on the bus initially: 9x = 9 * 6 = 54

After 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining is: 54 - 20 = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold, we need to first determine how many bouquets he sold. We know that each bouquet has 12 sunflowers and costs $8. 

Faraday earned $56 from the bouquets per day. To find out how many bouquets he sold, we can divide the total earnings from bouquets by the cost of each bouquet: $56 / $8 = 7 bouquets per day.

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the total number of sunflowers sold from bouquets per day is 7 * 12 = 84 sunflowers.

We also know that Faraday earned $26 from the sunflowers per day. Since each sunflower costs $2, the number of sunflowers sold per day is $26 / $2 = 13 sunflowers.

To find the total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days, we add the sunflowers sold from bouquets and the sunflowers sold individually: 84 + 13 * 3 = 84 + 39 = 123 sunflowers.

The final answer is: 123"
"To find out how much money Adam loses, we first need to determine how many rocks he can buy with his $100. 

Since each rock costs $5, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of each rock: 

$100 / $5 = 20 rocks

Adam can buy 20 rocks. 

Now, let's calculate how much money he can make by selling 60% of his inventory. 

60% of 20 rocks is 0.6 * 20 = 12 rocks.

Since he sells each rock for $7, the total amount of money he makes is: 

12 rocks * $7 = $84

However, Adam invested all his money in the rock stand, which is $100. To find out how much he loses, we subtract the money he made from the initial investment:

$100 - $84 = $16

Adam loses $16.

The final answer is: $16"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of days it takes Lauren to complete each type of picture scene. 

First, let's find the number of days it takes Lauren to complete each type of picture scene:

- Large-sized picture scenes: 45 / 5 = 9 days
- Medium-sized picture scenes: 36 / 6 = 6 days
- Small-sized picture scenes: 49 / 7 = 7 days

Now, we need to find the LCM of 9, 6, and 7. 

The prime factorization of 6 is 2 * 3.
The prime factorization of 7 is 7.
The prime factorization of 9 is 3^2.

To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the numbers:
- The highest power of 2 is 2^1 (from 6).
- The highest power of 3 is 3^2 (from 9).
- The highest power of 7 is 7^1 (from 7).

The LCM is 2^1 * 3^2 * 7^1 = 2 * 9 * 7 = 126.

Therefore, it will take Lauren 126 days to complete all the picture scenes.

The final answer is: 126"
"To find out how many eggs each child receives, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of children. 

First, let's determine the total number of eggs. Chatty prepared three dozen eggs. Since one dozen is equal to 12, three dozen eggs would be 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Now, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of children. There are four children. 

36 eggs / 4 children = 9 eggs per child.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find out how much Jen spends on food for her fish in May, we need to calculate the total cost of food for one month. 

First, we need to determine the number of days in May. May has 31 days. 

Since each fish needs $1 worth of food a day, and Jen has 3 fish, the daily cost of food for all her fish is 3 * $1 = $3.

To find the total cost for the month, we multiply the daily cost by the number of days in May: $3 * 31 = $93.

So, Jen spends $93 on food for her fish in May.

$93"
"To find out how many roses Patricia has now, we need to first determine how many roses she had after giving some to her mother. 

Initially, Patricia had 30 roses. She gave 24 roses to her mother, so we subtract 24 from 30 to find out how many roses she had left: 30 - 24 = 6.

Then, Patricia bought 15 more roses. To find out how many roses she has now, we add the 15 new roses to the 6 she already had: 6 + 15 = 21.

So, Patricia now has 21 roses.

The final answer is: 21"
"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken. 

The total distance traveled is 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles.

The total time taken is 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours.

The average speed is calculated by dividing the total distance by the total time: average speed = total distance / total time = 250 miles / 5 hours = 50 miles per hour.

"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning. 

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which is 0.2 in decimal form. 

The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability is 3 times 0.2, which is 0.6.

To find the probability of both tickets winning, we multiply 0.2 and 0.6, which is 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply 0.12 by 100, which is 12%.

The final answer is: 12"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem.

- Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected. So, Carlos collected 27 - 5 = 22 seashells.
- Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. This means Carrey collected 22 / 2 = 11 seashells.

Now, let's find the total number of seashells collected by all three. 
Total seashells = Jim's seashells + Carlos' seashells + Carrey's seashells
Total seashells = 27 + 22 + 11
Total seashells = 60

They divided the seashells equally among themselves. To find out how many each person got, we divide the total number of seashells by 3.
Seashells per person = Total seashells / 3
Seashells per person = 60 / 3
Seashells per person = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and add the number of carrots he eats on the weekend.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday). So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is 4 * 5 = 20.

On Saturday and Sunday, Mason eats 5 carrots each day. So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is 5 + 5 = 10.

Now, we add the total number of carrots Mason eats on weekdays and the weekend to find the total number of carrots he eats in a week. 20 (weekdays) + 10 (weekend) = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song first. 

The second song is 60% longer than the first song, which is 5 minutes. To find 60% of 5 minutes, we multiply 5 by 0.6. 

5 * 0.6 = 3 minutes

So, the second song is 3 minutes longer than the first song. To find the total length of the second song, we add 3 minutes to the length of the first song.

5 + 3 = 8 minutes

Now, we have the lengths of both songs: the first song is 5 minutes and the second song is 8 minutes. To find the total time of the cassette, we add the lengths of both songs.

5 + 8 = 13 minutes

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes.

"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the profit from each day and then add them together.

On Monday, Linus bought 2 devices for $20 each. So, the total cost price for Monday is 2 * $20 = $40. He sold each device for twice the amount, so the selling price is 2 * $20 = $40. The profit from Monday is the selling price minus the cost price, which is $40 - $40 = $0.

On Tuesday, Linus bought 4 devices for $20 each. So, the total cost price for Tuesday is 4 * $20 = $80. He sold each device for twice the amount, so the selling price is 2 * $20 = $40. The profit from Tuesday is the selling price minus the cost price, which is $40 - $80 = -$40 (loss).

However, since we are calculating profit, we should consider the selling price as the revenue and the cost price as the cost. The revenue from Monday is 2 * $40 = $80 and the revenue from Tuesday is 4 * $40 = $160. The total revenue is $80 + $160 = $240. The total cost is $40 + $80 = $120. The total profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $240 - $120 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To find the length of Carl's cane, we need to determine Carl's height first. We know that Isabel is 7 feet tall and Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel. 

Isabel's height = 7 feet
Ned's height = Isabel's height - 2 feet
Ned's height = 7 - 2
Ned's height = 5 feet

Since Carl is one foot taller than Ned, we can find Carl's height by adding 1 foot to Ned's height.

Carl's height = Ned's height + 1 foot
Carl's height = 5 + 1
Carl's height = 6 feet

We know that Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. To find the length of the cane, we can divide Carl's height by 2.

Cane's length = Carl's height / 2
Cane's length = 6 / 2
Cane's length = 3 feet

"To find out how many bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles required to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

Since each bottle covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand, we need to find out how many bottles are required to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand. 

100% / 20% = 5. This means that 5 bottles are required to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand.

Now, we need to find out how many bottles are required to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people. 

2300 people * 5 bottles/person = 11500 bottles

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we need to find out how many more bottles it needs to produce to meet the demand of 11500 bottles.

11500 bottles - 4200 bottles = 7300 bottles

"To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we first need to determine the number of babies wearing purple and bows, and the total number of babies wearing bows.

Let's assume there are 8 babies in total since Carla gave birth to octuplets. 

3/4 of the babies wear purple, which is (3/4) * 8 = 6 babies. 
1/4 of the babies wear blue, which is (1/4) * 8 = 2 babies.

Now, we need to find the number of babies wearing purple and bows. 1/3 of the purple babies wear bows, which is (1/3) * 6 = 2 babies.

The total number of babies wearing bows is the sum of the blue babies and the purple babies wearing bows, which is 2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4 babies.

The probability of a baby wearing a bow and being purple is the number of purple babies wearing bows divided by the total number of babies wearing bows, which is 2/4 = 0.5 or 50%.

The percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is 50%."
"To find the number of reports received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday, and then subtract that result from the total number of reports received last week.

Total reports received last week = 5168
Reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

First, let's find the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday. 

Reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

Now, let's find the total number of reports received on Wednesday by subtracting the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday.

"To find the total amount of money Abraham will earn, we need to calculate the amount of money he earned from each sale and add them together.

First, Abraham sold half of his land for $50. Since he owns 80 square meters, half of that is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters. 

Next, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. Since he owns 80 square meters, 1/4 of that is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters. 

Now, let's calculate the amount of land he has left. He started with 80 square meters, sold 40 square meters, and then sold 20 square meters. So, he has 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters left.

He sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, the amount of money he earned from selling the remaining land is 20 * 3 = $60.

Now, let's add up the money he earned from each sale: $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

The final answer is: $140"
"To find Geb's age, we need to first calculate half of Haley's age. Haley is 26 years old, so half of her age would be 26 / 2 = 13.

13 - 10 = 3

Geb is 3 years old."
"To find out how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to first determine how many face masks he uses in a day. 

Since Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out and he goes out three times a day, the total number of face masks he uses in a day is 2 * 3 = 6.

Now, to find out how many face masks he uses in 2 days, we multiply the number of face masks he uses in a day by 2. 

6 * 2 = 12

So, Tyrion uses 12 face masks every 2 days."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that Cole hid 3 dozen eggs. Since a dozen is 12, we can calculate the total number of eggs as 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs, so the remaining number of eggs is 36 - 5 = 31.

Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, which means she finds 2 * 5 = 10 eggs. Now, the remaining number of eggs is 31 - 10 = 21.

Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so he finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs. Now, the remaining number of eggs is 21 - 8 = 13.

Mei finds half as many as Charlie, which means she finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs. Now, the remaining number of eggs is 13 - 4 = 9.

Therefore, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is 9."
"To find the total amount John makes in a week, we first need to determine the number of apartments in each complex and the total number of collections he makes in a week.

The first two apartment complexes have 200 apartments each, so the total number of apartments in these two complexes is 2 * 200 = 400.

The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, which means it is 160% of the other two combined (100% + 60% = 160%). To find the number of apartments in the last complex, we multiply the total number of apartments in the first two complexes by 1.6 (which is the same as 160% or 160/100).

Number of apartments in the last complex = 400 * 1.6 = 640

Total number of apartments = 400 + 640 = 1040

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so the total number of collections he makes in a week is 3 * 1040 = 3120.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection for each apartment, so the total amount he makes in a week is 3120 * $0.40 = $1248.

"To find the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree, we need to calculate the fruits produced each year and add them up.

- In the 5th year, the tree produces 50 fruits.
- In the 6th year, it produces 3 times the initial amount, which is 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
- In the 7th year, it produces 7 times the initial amount, which is 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
- In the 8th year, it produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. Since a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits, an 8-year-old tree produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.
- In the 9th year, the tree doesn't produce any fruits.
- In the 10th year, it produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now, let's add up the fruits produced each year: 
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350

The total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree during its 10 years of life is 2350."
"To find out how much money Jack has now, we need to calculate the amount Sophia gave him and add it to his initial amount.

Sophia gave Jack 1/5 of her $100. To find 1/5 of $100, we multiply $100 by 1/5.

1/5 * $100 = $20

Now, we add the amount Sophia gave Jack to his initial amount.

$100 (initial amount) + $20 (amount given by Sophia) = $120

So, Jack now has $120.

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as B, the length of the yellow rope as Y, and the length of the red rope as R. We are given that R = 4B and B = Y - 7.

We can express Y in terms of B: Y = B + 7.

We are also given that R + B + Y = 37. Substituting R = 4B and Y = B + 7 into this equation, we get:

4B + B + B + 7 = 37

Combine like terms: 6B + 7 = 37

Subtract 7 from both sides: 6B = 30

Divide both sides by 6: B = 5

Now that we know B, we can find R: R = 4B = 4 * 5 = 20

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's assume Ronnie was given $5. Since Rissa was given thrice as much, Rissa was given 3 * $5 = $15.

After each of them gave an equal amount of money to their little sister, let's call the amount they gave 'x'. So, Ronnie is left with $5 - x and Rissa is left with $15 - x.

We are given that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her original money. This means (15 - x) = (4/5) * 15.

To find the value of x, we can solve the equation: 
(15 - x) = (4/5) * 15
15 - x = 12
x = 3

Now that we know x, we can find out how much money Ronnie is left with:
Ronnie's money left = $5 - x

Since half the mural is yellow, the amount of yellow paint is 12 / 2 = 6 pints.

The total amount of paint used is 12 pints, so the sum of the amounts of red, white, and purple paint is 12 - 6 = 6 pints. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, we can write the equation: x + x + x = 6.

Combine like terms: 3x = 6.

Divide both sides by 3: x = 2.

Since x represents the amount of red, white, and purple paint, the amount of red paint is x = 2 pints.

"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house, then add them together.

First, let's find the area of one bedroom: 
Area of one bedroom = length * width = 20 * 12 = 240 square feet

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms = 4 * 240 = 960 square feet

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area = 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet

The rest of the house is given as 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas together: 
Total area = area of bedrooms + area of living room + area of the rest of the house

"To find out how many dishwashing cycles you can run with the new box for $1, we first need to determine how many pods are in the new box. 

The new box has 20% more pods than the regular box. To find 20% of 100, we multiply 100 by 0.2, which is 20. So, the new box has 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Now, we know that the new box costs $12 and has 120 pods. To find out how many cycles you can run for $1, we need to find out how many pods you can buy for $1. Since the new box costs $12 for 120 pods, we divide $12 by 120 to get the cost per pod, which is $0.1 per pod.

Now, we know that each cycle requires 1 pod, and we want to know how many cycles we can run for $1. Since each pod costs $0.1, we can run 1 / 0.1 = 10 cycles for $1.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. This means he has 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he has 50 - 10 = 40 bills left.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill, which means he uses 40 / 2 = 20 bills. This leaves him with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

4. Thomas then triples his money. Since each bill is worth $20, tripling his money means each bill is now worth $60. So, he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills, but each is worth $60.

5. To find the total amount of money he has, we multiply the number of bills by the value of each bill: 60 * $60 = $3600.

6. He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. To find the number of 5 dollar bills, we divide the total amount of money by the value of each 5 dollar bill: $3600 / $5 = 720.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals in the first half.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals.

Now, let's find out how many goals team A scored in the second half. It's given that team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B in the second half. So, team A scores 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals in the second half.

Now, let's calculate the total number of goals scored by each team in the match. Team A scored 4 goals in the first half and 2 goals in the second half, so the total number of goals scored by team A is 4 + 2 = 6.

Team B scored 2 goals in the first half and 8 goals in the second half, so the total number of goals scored by team B is 2 + 8 = 10.

The total number of goals scored in the match is the sum of the goals scored by team A and team B, which is 6 + 10 = 16.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much chalk the teacher has left after Monday and then determine how many days it will last.

The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk. He uses 45% of it on Monday, so we need to find 45% of 5 inches.

45% of 5 inches = 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches

This means the teacher has 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches of chalk left after Monday.

Now, we need to find out how many days the remaining 2.75 inches of chalk will last when the teacher uses 20% of it each day.

Let's assume the number of days the chalk will last is 'x'. Then, 20% of 2.75 inches will be used each day.

0.20 * 2.75 = 0.55 inches per day

Since the teacher starts with 2.75 inches, we can set up the equation:

2.75 = 0.55x

To solve for 'x', we divide both sides by 0.55:

x = 2.75 / 0.55
x = 5

Total cost = 4000 * $3.5
Total cost = $14,000

Since 2/5 of the milk was expired, we need to find 2/5 of 4000 gallons to determine the amount that was returned.

Expired milk = 2/5 * 4000
Expired milk = (2 * 4000) / 5
Expired milk = 8000 / 5
Expired milk = 1600 gallons

The refund amount will be the cost of the expired milk, which is the same as the total cost per gallon multiplied by the number of expired gallons.

Refund amount = Total cost per gallon * Expired milk
Refund amount = $3.5 * 1600
Refund amount = $5600

The final answer is: $5600"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem.

Let's denote Colin's current age as C and Wendy's current age as W.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:

W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now, we can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:

C + 25 = (5/3)(C + 7)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2:

20 = C

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we first need to determine the total number of books he can buy with $27,000. 

Since he can buy 100 books for $500, we can find the total number of books by dividing the total amount spent ($27,000) by the cost per 100 books ($500).

Total number of books = $27,000 / $500 = 54

Now, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books he can buy per school.

Books per school = Total number of books / Number of schools
= 54 / 3
= 18

The final answer is: 18"
"Let's break down the events step by step:

1. Initially, 2 apples fell out of the tree, and one landed on Newton's head. So, Newton had 2 apples.
2. He picked up the two apples, put one in his pocket, and threw the other into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. Now, he has 1 apple in his pocket and 5 new apples, making a total of 6 apples.
3. He put all but one of the new apples in his pocket, leaving 1 apple on the ground. So, he now has 6 (in his pocket) + 1 (on the ground) = 7 apples.
4. He threw the remaining apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out. Now, he has 7 apples (in his pocket) + 6 new apples = 13 apples.
5. He picked up all the remaining apples, which is 13 apples.

Therefore, Newton brought home 13 apples.

"To find the total cost of Ali's order, we need to calculate the total number of coal bags and multiply it by the cost per bag.

First, let's find the total number of coal bags:
Total coal in kilos = 850 kg
Weight of each bag = 50 kg
Number of bags = Total coal in kilos / Weight of each bag
= 850 kg / 50 kg
= 17 bags

Now, let's find the total cost:
Cost per bag = $18
Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
= 17 bags * $18
= $306

The final answer is: $306"
"To find out how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of slices each type of pizza is needed for. 

For the cheese pizza, Kate's 6 friends each eat 6 slices, so the total number of cheese pizza slices needed is 6 friends * 6 slices = 36 slices. 

For the pepperoni pizza, Kate's 6 friends each eat 4 slices, so the total number of pepperoni pizza slices needed is 6 friends * 4 slices = 24 slices.

Since the cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices and the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, we need to find out how many whole pizzas of each type Kate needs to buy. 

For the cheese pizza, we need to divide the total number of slices needed (36) by the number of slices per pizza (12). 36 / 12 = 3. 

For the pepperoni pizza, we need to divide the total number of slices needed (24) by the number of slices per pizza (8). 24 / 8 = 3.

Since Kate needs 3 whole cheese pizzas and 3 whole pepperoni pizzas, she needs to buy a total of 3 + 3 = 6 pizza pies.

"To find the total miles Sam ran this week, we need to calculate the miles run on each day and add them together.

On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Sam ran 3 miles each day. So, the total miles run on these days is 3 * 3 = 9 miles.

On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day. So, the total miles run on these days is 5 * 2 = 10 miles.

Now, let's add the miles run on both sets of days: 9 miles + 10 miles = 19 miles.

The final answer is: 19"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the net rate at which Jay is building snowballs. 

Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, which is equivalent to 20 / 60 = 1/3 snowballs per minute. 

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, so the rate at which snowballs melt is 2 / 15 = 2/15 snowballs per minute.

The net rate at which Jay is building snowballs is the rate at which he builds them minus the rate at which they melt: 1/3 - 2/15. 

To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 15. So we convert 1/3 to 5/15. 

Now we can subtract: 5/15 - 2/15 = 3/15 snowballs per minute.

Since Jay needs 60 snowballs, and he builds 3/15 snowballs per minute, we can find the time it takes him to build 60 snowballs by dividing 60 by 3/15. 

To divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal: 60 / (3/15) = 60 * (15/3) = 300 minutes.

However, we need to consider the initial 60 minutes it takes Jay to build the first 20 snowballs. 

So, the total time it takes Jay to have 60 snowballs is 300 minutes + 60 minutes = 360 minutes.

The final answer is: 360"
"To find Jim's age, we need to first determine John's age 20 years ago. Since John is 28 now, we subtract 20 from his current age to find his age at the time of the Digimon release.

John's age 20 years ago = 28 - 20 = 8

Since John was twice as old as Jim 20 years ago, we can set up an equation to find Jim's age at that time:

John's age 20 years ago = 2 * Jim's age 20 years ago
8 = 2 * Jim's age 20 years ago

To find Jim's age 20 years ago, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

Jim's age 20 years ago = 8 / 2
Jim's age 20 years ago = 4

Now, we need to find Jim's current age by adding 20 to his age 20 years ago:

Jim's current age = Jim's age 20 years ago + 20
Jim's current age = 4 + 20
Jim's current age = 24

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Doxa ate 1 slice of the apple. 
Her sister ate 1 more slice than Doxa, so her sister ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.
Her brother ate 1 more slice than her sister, so her brother ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

Now, let's add up the number of slices each of them ate: 
Doxa ate 1 slice, her sister ate 2 slices, and her brother ate 3 slices. 
So, the total number of slices they ate is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as 'x'. 

On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50. So, the remaining bandages after the first day are x - 38.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. The remaining bandages after the second day are (x - 38) - 28.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, which is 2 * 50 = 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages. The remaining bandages after the third day are ((x - 38) - 28) - 25 + 100.

We are given that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. So, we can set up the equation:

((x - 38) - 28) - 25 + 100 = 78

Simplifying the equation:

x - 38 - 28 - 25 + 100 = 78
x - 91 + 100 = 78
x + 9 = 78
x = 69

"To find the total cost of May's haircut and color, we need to calculate the cost of the haircut first. The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch, and her hair was cut from 10 inches to 8 inches, so the length cut off is 10 - 8 = 2 inches.

The cost of the haircut is 2 inches * $30 per inch = $60.

The cost of the color is $40.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the haircut and the cost of the color: $60 + $40 = $100.

"To find Jen's total earnings for April, we need to calculate her regular pay and her attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her regular pay. She works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week, and there are 4 weeks in April. 

Total hours worked in a week = 7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week = 45 hours/week
Total hours worked in April = 45 hours/week * 4 weeks = 180 hours

Her hourly rate is $1.5, so her total regular pay for April is:
Total regular pay = 180 hours * $1.5/hour = $270

Since Jen has complete attendance for the month, she receives an additional $10 for the attendance bonus. 

Total earnings = Total regular pay + Attendance bonus
Total earnings = $270 + $10
Total earnings = $280

The final answer is: $280"

For doing laundry, Jason earned $3.00 once, so that's $3.00.
For cleaning his room, Jason earned $1.50 once, so that's $1.50.
For taking the trash to the curb, Jason earned $0.75 twice, so that's 2 * $0.75 = $1.50.
For emptying the dishwasher, Jason earned $0.50 six times, so that's 6 * $0.50 = $3.00.

Next, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is 2 * 40 = 80 people. 
Finally, 3 times the number of people who entered in the morning came in, which is 3 * 50 = 150 people.

Now, let's add up the number of people who entered at each time:

"To find the total number of pens Alain has, we first need to determine the number of red pens and black pens. 

Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens, and each pack has 5 pens. So, the total number of red pens is 5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 red pens.

Since Alain's mom bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens, the total number of black pens is 2 * 25 = 50 black pens.

To find the total number of pens Alain has, we add the number of red pens and black pens: 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens.

"To find the total amount John spent, we first need to determine the cost of the scotch and the cognac separately.

The cost of the scotch is $600 for 10 bottles. To find the cost per bottle, we divide the total cost by the number of bottles: $600 / 10 = $60 per bottle.

Since John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The cost of the cognac is 50% more than the scotch. 50% of $60 is $30, so the cost of the cognac per bottle is $60 + $30 = $90.

The total cost of the cognac is 20 bottles * $90 per bottle = $1800.

The total amount John spent is the sum of the cost of the scotch and the cognac: $600 + $1800 = $2400.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees. He also planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which means he planted 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, making it a total of 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than he planted on the first day. Since he planted 40 Lodgepole Pine trees on the first day, 1/4 of that is 40 * 1/4 = 10. So, he planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day.

To find the total number of trees planted in the two days, we need to add the number of White Oak and Lodgepole Pine trees planted on both days. 

Total White Oak trees = 20 (first day) + 10 (second day) = 30
Total Lodgepole Pine trees = 40 (first day) + 50 (second day) = 90

Total number of trees = Total White Oak trees + Total Lodgepole Pine trees = 30 + 90 = 120

Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge as 'x'. 

The problem states that eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be written as an equation: 4x + 8 = 40.

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate the variable 'x'. We can do this by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation: 4x = 40 - 8.

This simplifies to: 4x = 32.

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for 'x': x = 32 / 4.

x = 8.

"To find the number of fish with red stripes, we need to calculate one-third of the total number of fish. 

One-third of 66 is 66 / 3 = 22.

Now, we need to find the number of fish with blue stripes. Since 22 fish have red stripes, we subtract this from the total number of fish to find the remaining fish.

Remaining fish = Total fish - Fish with red stripes
Remaining fish = 66 - 22
Remaining fish = 44

Now, we need to find 5/11 of the remaining fish.

5/11 of 44 = (5/11) * 44
= 5 * 4
= 20

So, the number of fish with blue stripes is 20. 

Now, we need to find the total number of fish with red and blue stripes. We add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes.

Total fish with red and blue stripes = Fish with red stripes + Fish with blue stripes
Total fish with red and blue stripes = 22 + 20
Total fish with red and blue stripes = 42

"Let's break down the information given. Amy initially had two eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each, so she had 2 * 4 = 8 eyeshadow colors from the palettes. 

She also had three makeup sets with 6 eyeshadow colors each, so she had 3 * 6 = 18 eyeshadow colors from the makeup sets.

In total, Amy had 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors.

Her sister stole one of the palettes, which means Amy lost 4 eyeshadow colors. So, she now has 26 - 4 = 22 eyeshadow colors.

Amy then used up half of the colors from one makeup set. Since each makeup set has 6 eyeshadow colors, half of that would be 6 / 2 = 3 eyeshadow colors.

So, Amy used up 3 eyeshadow colors from the makeup set. Now, she has 22 - 3 = 19 eyeshadow colors left.

Now, John uses 60% of this amount to pay off his debts. 

60% of $100,000 = 0.6 * $100,000 = $60,000

This means John paid off $60,000 of his debt. To find out how much money he has leftover, we subtract this amount from the loan amount.

"To find the combined capacity of both schools, we first need to find the capacity of John's school. 

Since each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, we can find the capacity of one of John's classes by multiplying Ali's class capacity by 1/8.

Capacity of one of John's classes = 120 * (1/8) = 15

Since John has two classes, we multiply the capacity of one class by 2 to find the total capacity of John's school.

Capacity of John's school = 15 * 2 = 30

Now, we add the capacity of Ali's school (which is 120) to the capacity of John's school to find the combined capacity of both schools.

Combined capacity = 120 + 30 = 150

"To find the total amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we first need to calculate the total interest he owes his sister. 

The interest is 2% of the initial $300, which is 0.02 * 300 = $6. 

However, Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, so the total amount he pays in the first 11 months is 25 * 11 = $275.

The remaining amount, including the interest, will be paid in the twelfth month. This remaining amount is the initial $300 (the amount he borrowed) plus the interest ($6), minus the total amount he paid in the first 11 months ($275). 

So, the amount he will pay in the twelfth month is 300 + 6 - 275 = $31.

"To find the total number of jelly beans in the jar, we first need to calculate the volume of the jar. The jar has a square base with a side length of 6 inches and a height of 15 inches. The volume of a rectangular prism (such as the jar) is calculated as length * width * height.

Volume = 6 * 6 * 15 = 540 cubic inches

Since the jelly beans have an efficiency of 80%, we need to divide the volume by 0.8 to get the total volume that can be occupied by the jelly beans.

Effective Volume = 540 / 0.8 = 675 cubic inches

Each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, so we can divide the effective volume by the volume of a single jelly bean to get the total number of jelly beans.

Total Jelly Beans = 675 / 0.15 = 4500

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we can find the number of red jelly beans by multiplying the total number of jelly beans by 0.3.

Number of Red Jelly Beans = 4500 * 0.3 = 1350

However, the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find out how far off Tim's guess was, we need to calculate the difference between his estimated number of red jelly beans and the true number.

Estimated Number of Red Jelly Beans = Total Jelly Beans * 0.3 (assuming he guessed the total number of jelly beans correctly, which is not the case here, but we will use it for the sake of the problem)

However, we do not know the total number of jelly beans he guessed.  We can use the information given to find the total number of jelly beans he guessed.  We know that 30% of the jelly beans he guessed are red, and the true number of red jelly beans is 900.  We can set up the equation:

0.3 * (x) = 900

Where x is the total number of jelly beans he guessed.

x = 900 / 0.3
x = 3000

Now we can find the difference between his guess and the true number of red jelly beans.

Difference = 900 - 3000 * 0.3

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, the bus had 20 people. 

At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus became 20 + 40 = 60.

At the second stop, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. Since 40 people entered at the first stop, 3/4 of 40 is (3/4) * 40 = 30. So, 30 people entered the bus at the second stop. The total number of people on the bus became 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus became 2 * 90 = 180.

The bus has a capacity of 200 people. To find the remaining spaces, we subtract the current number of people from the capacity: 200 - 180 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to calculate the cost of her visits for the first 5 years and the cost of her visits for the next 3 years.

For the first 5 years, the cost of one visit is $2. Since Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year, the annual cost is 3 * $2 = $6. For 5 years, the total cost is 5 * $6 = $30.

The cost of one visit increased by 150% after 5 years. A 150% increase means the new cost is 2.5 times the original cost. So, the new cost of one visit is $2 * 2.5 = $5. The annual cost for 3 visits is 3 * $5 = $15. For 3 years, the total cost is 3 * $15 = $45.

The total cost for all 8 years is $30 + $45 = $75.

The final numerical answer is: $75"
"To find out how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to determine the total number of groups that will be trying the escape room and then multiply that by the time it takes for each group to try the escape room.

There are 4 grades (4-7) with 10 students in each grade, so the total number of students is 4 * 10 = 40.

Since only the top 10 students in each grade get to try the escape room, we need to find the total number of students who will be trying the escape room. Since there are 4 grades, we need to find the total number of students who will be trying the escape room in each grade, which is 10. 

However, since there are 40 students in total and 10 students in each grade, we need to find the total number of groups of 10 students. We can do this by dividing 40 by 10, which equals 4. 

So, there will be 4 groups of 10 students trying the escape room. 

Since each group uses their full 45 minutes, the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room is 4 * 45 = 180 minutes.

The final answer is: 180"
"To find out how much Ali has to pay John, we need to calculate the total cost of the tables and the total cost of the roof frames, then add them together.

The cost of the tables is 4 tables * $20 per table = $80.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as 'x'. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length can be represented as 4x.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, and it is divided into two pieces. So, the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is equal to 40 feet. We can write this as an equation:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Now, divide both sides by 5 to solve for x:

x = 40 / 5
x = 8

Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, we can find its length by multiplying x by 4:

Longer piece = 4x
Longer piece = 4 * 8
Longer piece = 32

"To find out how much seasoning Aiden needs, we first need to determine how many pounds of ground beef he needs to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound to find the total pounds of meat needed.

Total meatballs needed: 80
Meatballs per pound: 16

Total pounds of meat needed = Total meatballs needed / Meatballs per pound
Total pounds of meat needed = 80 / 16
Total pounds of meat needed = 5

Now that we know Aiden needs 5 pounds of ground beef, we can find out how much seasoning he needs. He adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat.

Total pounds of meat needed: 5
Seasoning per pound: 2 tablespoons

Total seasoning needed = Total pounds of meat needed * Seasoning per pound
Total seasoning needed = 5 * 2
Total seasoning needed = 10

So, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning to make 80 meatballs.

"Let's break down the information given. Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. If we let the number of cupcakes be 'c', then the number of brownies is 3c - 2.

Since each person gets 2 treats and there are 5 people in the class, the total number of treats is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, so we can write the equation: c + (3c - 2) = 10.

Combine like terms: 4c - 2 = 10.

Add 2 to both sides: 4c = 12.

Divide by 4: c = 3.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the 20% discount. 

The original cost of both manicure and pedicure is $35 + $40 = $75. 

The 20% discount on $75 is 0.20 * $75 = $15. 

So, the discounted cost of both manicure and pedicure is $75 - $15 = $60.

Since Karen wants to add nail art on each of her fingers, and there are 10 fingers in total (5 on each hand), the cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost for Karen would be the discounted cost of manicure and pedicure plus the cost of nail art, which is $60 + $30 = $90.

The third magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, which is 4 * 6 = 24 issues.

Now, let's add up the total number of issues: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

So, Susan receives 66 magazines every year.

"To find the price of the toy after the discount in January, we need to follow the given changes in price.

Initially, the price of the toy was $40.

In December, the price increased by 80%. To find the new price, we multiply the initial price by 1.8 (100% + 80% = 180%, or 1 + 0.8 = 1.8).

New price in December = $40 * 1.8 = $72

In January, the price decreased by 50%. To find the new price, we multiply the price in December by 0.5 (100% - 50% = 50%, or 1 - 0.5 = 0.5).

New price in January = $72 * 0.5 = $36

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"To find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to calculate the amount he earns from the standard rate lessons and the reduced rate lessons separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the amount he earns from the standard rate lessons. He has 4 lessons at the standard rate of $80 per hour. 

4 * $80 = $320

Next, let's calculate the amount he earns from the reduced rate lessons. He has 2 lessons at the reduced rate, which is 25% less than the standard rate. To find the reduced rate, we need to calculate 25% of $80 and subtract it from $80.

25% of $80 = 0.25 * $80 = $20
Reduced rate = $80 - $20 = $60

Now, let's calculate the amount he earns from the reduced rate lessons.

2 * $60 = $120

Finally, let's add the amount he earns from the standard rate lessons and the reduced rate lessons to find the total amount he will make for the day.

$320 + $120 = $440

"To find the total distance covered by Michael in 3 days, we need to calculate the distance he covers in one day and then multiply it by 3.

First, let's convert the speed from km/hr to km/day. Since there are 24 hours in a day, we multiply 50 km/hr by 24 hours to get the distance covered in a day.

Distance covered in a day = 50 km/hr * 24 hr/day = 1200 km/day

Now, we multiply the distance covered in a day by 3 to get the total distance covered in 3 days.

Total distance covered in 3 days = 1200 km/day * 3 days = 3600 km

Now, we need to find the percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered. To do this, we divide the total distance covered by Michael by the total distance between Alaska and Texas and multiply by 100.

Percentage covered = (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100
= 0.6 * 100
= 60%

The final answer is: 60"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many grapes were used by Madeline's brother and her mother, and then subtract that from the total number of grapes Madeline ate.

Madeline ate 6 grapes. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, so he used 6 * 5 = 30 grapes.

The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie requires 12 grapes. So, the total number of grapes used by her mother is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.

The total number of grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and her mother is 36 + 48 = 84 grapes.

To find the initial number of grapes, we need to add the grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and her mother to the grapes used by her mother to make the pies. However, since the grapes used by her mother are already included in the total, we only need to add the grapes used by Madeline and her brother. The initial number of grapes is 84 + 36 = 120 grapes.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total number of teachers at school that day, we need to add the number of teachers who were sick and the number of substitute teachers. 

First, let's find the number of teachers who were not sick. There were 82 teachers in total, and 13 were sick. So, the number of teachers who were not sick is 82 - 13 = 69.

Then, we add the number of substitute teachers, which is 9. 

So, the total number of teachers at school that day is 69 + 9 = 78.

The final answer is: 78"
"To find out how much Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we need to calculate the total cost per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

The cost of pasta per week is $1.00.
The cost of cheddar cheese per week is $3.00.
The cost of gruyere cheese per week is $3.00 * 2 = $6.00.

The total cost per week is $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00 = $10.00.

There are 52 weeks in a year. 

The total cost per year is $10.00 * 52 = $520.00.

The final answer is: $520.00"
"To find the total number of classrooms the custodian needs to clean, we already know that number is 80. 

The custodian has 5 days to clean the classrooms. We need to find out how many minutes they have to clean in total. Since they work 8 hours a day, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, they work 8 * 60 = 480 minutes per day.

In 5 days, they work a total of 5 * 480 = 2400 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how many minutes they spend cleaning per classroom. We already know that it takes them 15 minutes per classroom. 

To find the total time spent cleaning, we multiply the number of classrooms by the time spent per classroom: 80 * 15 = 1200 minutes.

Now, we need to find the percentage of their day spent cleaning. To do this, we divide the total time spent cleaning by the total time available and multiply by 100: (1200 / 2400) * 100 = 50%.

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, let's first determine the capacity of each shelf. 

Let's denote the capacity of a middle shelf as 'm'. Since the bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, its capacity is 2m. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so its capacity is 2m - 5.

We know that each of the middle shelves can hold 10 books. Therefore, m = 10.

Now, we can calculate the capacity of the bottom and top shelves:
- Bottom shelf: 2m = 2 * 10 = 20 books
- Top shelf: 2m - 5 = 2 * 10 - 5 = 15 books

The total capacity of the three shelves is 10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55 books.

Since Elly has 110 books, she needs more than one bookcase to hold all of them. Let's calculate how many bookcases she needs.

Let 'n' be the number of bookcases. The total capacity of 'n' bookcases is 55n. We want to find the smallest 'n' such that 55n ≥ 110.

Dividing both sides by 55, we get n ≥ 2.

Therefore, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find Rose's profit, we first need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

The cost of 5 dozens of eggs is 5 * $2.40 = $12.

Since 1 dozen has 12 eggs, 5 dozens will have 5 * 12 = 60 eggs.

Rose will sell the eggs for $1 for 3 eggs. So, the selling price for 60 eggs will be (60 / 3) * $1 = $20.

Now, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the cost from the revenue: $20 - $12 = $8.

The final answer is: $8"
"To find the number of white hats, we first need to find the total number of red and blue hats. 

Half of the hats are red, which is 100 * 0.5 = 50 red hats.

The remaining hats are 100 - 50 = 50 hats.

3/5 of the remaining hats are blue, which is 50 * (3/5) = 30 blue hats.

The number of blue hats is 30, so the remaining hats are white. The number of white hats is 50 - 30 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the cost of each stick of jerky, we need to first calculate the total cost of the bag after the discount. 

The original price of the bag is $18.00, and there's a $3.00 discount. 

$18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

Since the bag contains 30 sticks of jerky, we need to divide the discounted price by the number of sticks to find the cost per stick.

$15.00 ÷ 30 = $0.50

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100.

$0.50 * 100 = 50 cents

The cost of each stick of jerky is 50 cents."
"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to find out how many questions she needs to get right in total. 

First, let's find out how many questions she got right on the first test. Since she got 60% of 70 questions correct, we can calculate this as 0.6 * 70 = 42 questions.

Now, let's find out the total number of questions she needs to get right to pass. Since she needs to get 70% of the total questions correct, and there are 70 + 40 = 110 questions in total, we can calculate this as 0.7 * 110 = 77 questions.

Since she already got 42 questions right on the first test, she needs to get 77 - 42 = 35 questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

The final answer is: 35"
"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as S and the number of blueberry cubes as B. We are given that B = 5S - 4. We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so S + B = 116.

We can substitute the expression for B into the second equation: S + (5S - 4) = 116. 

Combine like terms: 6S - 4 = 116.

Add 4 to both sides: 6S = 120.

Divide both sides by 6: S = 20.

Now that we know S, we can find B: B = 5S - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96.

The final answer is: 96"
"To find the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years, we need to calculate the total number of games she has played and then multiply it by her score per game.

Ara has been playing 40 games every year for 4 years. So, the total number of games she has played is:
40 games/year * 4 years = 160 games

Since her score for every game is 21 points, we can multiply the total number of games by her score per game to find the total points:
160 games * 21 points/game = 3360 points

The final answer is: 3360"
"To find out how many marbles Brendan ended up with, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, Brendan had 10 marbles.

He dropped half of them, so he had 10 / 2 = 5 marbles left.

He then found 3 more marbles, so now he had 5 + 3 = 8 marbles.

However, one of the marbles he picked up was a bead, not a marble, so he got rid of it. This means he had 8 - 1 = 7 marbles left.

Therefore, Brendan ended up with 7 marbles.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. 

First, we know that for every 2 customers who come into the dealership, 1 will buy a car. So, to sell 15 cars, Jason needs 15 * 2 = 30 customers to come into the dealership.

Next, we know that for every 25 telephone calls, 1 customer comes into the dealership. So, to get 30 customers, Jason needs 30 * 25 = 750 telephone calls.

"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of flashlights and the number of candles separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of flashlights. There are 4 people in the family, and each person has a flashlight. So, the total number of flashlights is 4.

Next, let's calculate the number of candles. There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. 

Half of 8 rooms is 4 rooms. So, 4 rooms have 4 small candles each, which is 4 * 4 = 16 small candles. The other 4 rooms have 5 medium candles each, which is 4 * 5 = 20 medium candles. 

The total number of candles is 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles.

Now, we add the number of flashlights and the number of candles together. 4 flashlights + 36 candles = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find out how many chips each person gets, we need to first find the total number of chips Mitchell has. Since he buys two bags with 55 chips each, we multiply the number of bags by the number of chips per bag: 2 * 55 = 110 chips.

"To find the total time it takes to solve the Rubik's cube, we need to calculate the time for each side and add them up.

The first side takes 5 minutes. 
The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so they take 5 * 2 = 10 minutes each.
The last two sides each take half as long as the first side, so they take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes each.

Now, let's add up the time for all sides:
5 (first side) + 10 (second side) + 10 (third side) + 2.5 (fourth side) + 2.5 (fifth side) = 30 minutes

The total time it takes to solve the Rubik's cube is 30 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the total time it takes for Phineas to cover the distance on land and in water. 

First, we need to find the distance Phineas needs to cover on land and in water. Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, Phineas needs to cover 100 yards on land and 100 yards in water.

Time taken to cover the distance on land = Distance / Speed
Time taken to cover the distance on land = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes

Time taken to cover the distance in water = Distance / Speed
Time taken to cover the distance in water = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes

Total time taken to return home = Time taken on land + Time taken in water
Total time taken to return home = 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes

"To find the total cost of the phone plan, we need to determine the cost of the additional phones and add it to the cost of the main phone.

Let's assume the cost of each additional phone is x. Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of the main phone is 2x.

We know that the main phone costs $20, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 20

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 20 / 2
x = 10

Now that we know the cost of each additional phone is $10, we can find the total cost of the additional phones. There are 4 additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is:

4x = 4 * 10
4x = 40

The total cost of the phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones:

Total cost = 20 + 40
Total cost = 60

"To find out how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to calculate the total number of doughnuts he sells in a day and then multiply it by the number of days in June.

Since Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day, and 1 dozen is equal to 12, we can calculate the total number of doughnuts he makes in a day as follows:

10 dozen * 12 doughnuts/dozen = 120 doughnuts/day

Since Derrick sells all the doughnuts, we can assume he sells 120 doughnuts every day.

Now, let's calculate the total number of days in June. June has 30 days.

To find the total number of doughnuts Derrick sells in June, we multiply the number of doughnuts he sells in a day by the number of days in June:

120 doughnuts/day * 30 days = 3600 doughnuts

"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the total number of people he saw on the first three days and add it to the total number of people he saw on the remaining days.

On the first day, Conor saw 50 people.

On the second day, there were 20 more people than on the first day, so the number of people on the second day is 50 + 20 = 70.

On the third day, the number of people was twice the number on the second day, so the number of people on the third day is 2 * 70 = 140.

The total number of people on the first three days is 50 + 70 + 140 = 260.

Since there are 7 days in a week, and Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the remaining 4 days, the total number of people he saw on the remaining days is 60 * 4 = 240.

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 260 + 240 = 500.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop. 

In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount pop, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.

In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increases to four times the initial rate, which is 4 * 20 = 80 kernels.

In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slows down to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, which is 0.5 * 80 = 40 kernels.

So, the total number of kernels popped in the first 2 minutes is 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 kernels.

After Garrett takes the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat. This is 0.25 * 40 = 10 kernels.

The total number of kernels that popped is 200 + 10 = 210 kernels.

"To find out how many lemons Tim will need, we first need to calculate the total amount of lemonade he needs to make, including the extra gallon for Allen. 

Since Tim needs to make 4 gallons of lemonade and 1 extra gallon, he will need to make a total of 5 gallons. 

For each gallon of lemonade, he needs 1 cup of lemon juice. Since he's making 5 gallons, he will need 5 cups of lemon juice.

Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can find out how many lemons are needed for 5 cups of juice by multiplying 6 lemons by 5 cups. 

6 lemons * 5 cups = 30 lemons

So, Tim will need 30 lemons.

"To find the average age of Mia and Emma, we first need to determine Emma's age. Since Mia is 40 years old and they are 16 years apart in age, we can calculate Emma's age by adding 16 to Mia's age.

Emma's age = Mia's age + 16
Emma's age = 40 + 16
Emma's age = 56

Now that we know both Mia's and Emma's ages, we can find the average of their ages by adding their ages and dividing by 2.

Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2
Average age = (40 + 56) / 2
Average age = 96 / 2
Average age = 48

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the total number of good seashells, we need to add the number of seashells each person found and then subtract the number of cracked seashells.

First, let's add the number of seashells each person found: 
214 (Tom) + 432 (Nancy) + 86 (Benny) = 732

Next, we subtract the number of cracked seashells from the total: 
732 - 67 = 665

So, the total number of good seashells they found together is 665."
"To find the total cost of the place settings, we need to calculate the cost of each type of plate and then add them together.

Avery needs 12 dinner plates, and each costs $6.00, so the total cost of dinner plates is 12 x $6.00 = $72.00.

She also needs 12 bowls, and each costs $5.00, so the total cost of bowls is 12 x $5.00 = $60.00.

For the salad plates, she needs 12 as well, and each costs $4.00, so the total cost of salad plates is 12 x $4.00 = $48.00.

Now, we add the costs of all the plates together: $72.00 + $60.00 + $48.00 = $180.00.

The total amount Avery will spend on place settings is $180.00.

$180.00"
"To find out how long it took Anna to finish the puzzle, we first need to determine half of Steve's time. Steve took 10 hours to complete the puzzle. Half of 10 hours is 10 / 2 = 5 hours.

Anna took 2 hours more than half of Steve's time, so we add 2 hours to 5 hours. 5 + 2 = 7 hours.

Therefore, it took Anna 7 hours to finish the difficult puzzle.

The final answer is 7."
"To find out how much feed is left after a week, we first need to calculate how much feed the pigs eat in a day and then multiply it by 7 to get the weekly consumption.

Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, so the total feed consumption per pig per day is 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.

Since Dexter has 5 pigs, the total feed consumption per day for all pigs is 8 * 5 = 40 pounds.

Now, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 to get the weekly consumption: 40 * 7 = 280 pounds.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, so to find out how much is left, we subtract the weekly consumption from the total ordered: 300 - 280 = 20 pounds.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many hot dogs John needs to buy, we first need to determine the total number of hot dogs required for the party. 

Since each guest will eat 2 hot dogs and there are 20 guests, the total number of hot dogs needed is 20 * 2 = 40 hot dogs.

However, John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party. So, the total number of hot dogs he needs to buy is 40 - 4 = 36 hot dogs.

Since a pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs and costs $2, we need to find out how many packs John needs to buy. 

To do this, we divide the total number of hot dogs needed by the number of hot dogs in a pack: 36 / 6 = 6 packs.

Since each pack costs $2, the total amount John needs to spend on hot dogs is 6 * $2 = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To find out how much money Frances has left, we need to calculate her total earnings and subtract her total expenses.

First, let's calculate her total earnings from selling cupcakes and cookies. 

She sells 20 cupcakes at $2 each, so her earnings from cupcakes are 20 x $2 = $40.
She sells 40 cookies at $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are 40 x $1 = $40.
Her total earnings are $40 (cupcakes) + $40 (cookies) = $80.

Next, let's calculate her total expenses. She buys 5 trays at $4 each, so her total expenses are 5 x $4 = $20.

Now, let's subtract her total expenses from her total earnings to find out how much money she has left.
$80 (total earnings) - $20 (total expenses) = $60.

The final answer is: $60"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there are 5 children following the truck.

On the second street, each of the 5 children is joined by another child, so the total number of children becomes 5 + 5 = 10.

On the third street, each of the 10 children is joined by another 2 children, so the total number of children becomes 10 + (10 * 2) = 10 + 20 = 30.

The original 5 children then give up and leave the group, so we subtract 5 from the total number of children: 30 - 5 = 25.

Therefore, there are 25 children now following the truck.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how many meals Mamou has left to distribute, we need to calculate the total number of meals she has given out and subtract that from the total number of meals she has.

On Friday, Mamou gave out 64 meals.
On Saturday, she gave out 30 meals.
On Sunday, she gave out 48 meals.

Total meals given out = 64 + 30 + 48 = 142 meals

Mamou started with 1,360 meals. To find out how many she has left, we subtract the total meals given out from the initial number of meals.

Meals left = 1,360 - 142 = 1,218 meals

"To find the total age of all the siblings, we first need to determine the age of the older brother. Since one of the brothers is 12 years old, which is half the age of the older brother, the older brother must be 12 * 2 = 24 years old.

Now, we know that all the sisters are 16 years old, and there are 3 of them. So, the total age of the sisters is 16 * 3 = 48 years.

The total age of the brothers is 12 + 24 = 36 years.

To find the total age of all the siblings, we add the total age of the brothers and the total age of the sisters: 36 + 48 = 84 years.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the total time spent on meditation and yoga, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity separately and then add them together.

Meditation time per day: 15 minutes (morning) + 15 minutes (night) = 30 minutes
Since Charisma practices meditation every day, we multiply the daily meditation time by 7 (days in a week) and then by 4 (weeks):
30 minutes/day * 7 days/week = 210 minutes/week
210 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 840 minutes

Yoga time per week: 1 hour (60 minutes) * 5 days/week = 300 minutes/week
Since we want to know the time spent in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly yoga time by 4:
300 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 1200 minutes

Total time spent on meditation and yoga: 840 minutes (meditation) + 1200 minutes (yoga) = 2040 minutes

The final answer is: 2040"

For medium shirts: 8 shirts * 4 square feet/shirt = 32 square feet
For large shirts: 6 shirts * 6 square feet/shirt = 36 square feet

Now, let's add the total square feet from each type of shirt: 33 + 32 + 36 = 101 square feet

The final answer is: 101"
"To find the total number of seeds, we first need to determine the number of seeds in a large sunflower. 

A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, a small sunflower has 3 * 12 = 36 seeds.

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36, we multiply 36 by 0.5, which equals 18. 

Now, we add the 50% more seeds to the original 36 seeds: 36 + 18 = 54 seeds in a large sunflower.

To find the total number of seeds, we add the seeds from the small sunflower and the large sunflower: 36 + 54 = 90 seeds.

The total number of sunflower seeds is 90."
"To find out how many pens Sarah has, we first need to determine how many pens Timothy has. Since Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns, and George has 18 pens, we can calculate Timothy's pens as follows:

Timothy's pens = 3 * George's pens
Timothy's pens = 3 * 18
Timothy's pens = 54

Next, we need to find out how many pens Sarah has. Since Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, we can calculate Sarah's pens as follows:

Sarah's pens = 0.5 * Timothy's pens
Sarah's pens = 0.5 * 54
Sarah's pens = 27

"To find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. The original price of each T-shirt is $8. Since Jake buys 2 T-shirts, the total cost of the T-shirts would be 2 * $8 = $16. However, since there's a buy one get one 50% off deal, Jake only pays for one T-shirt at the original price and the other one at 50% off. So, the cost of the first T-shirt is $8 and the cost of the second T-shirt is $8 * 0.5 = $4. The total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and Jake gets a 40% discount. The discount amount is $40 * 0.4 = $16. So, the cost of the shoes is $40 - $16 = $24.

Now, let's add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store. The total cost is $12 + $24 = $36.

"To find out how much money Ryan has, we need to calculate his total earnings from doing chores and subtract the cost of the ice cream cones.

Ryan earns $6 each week for 3 weeks, so his total earnings are 6 * 3 = $18.

He bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends at $1.25 each, so the total cost of ice cream cones is 4 * 1.25 = $5.

Now, let's subtract the cost of ice cream cones from his total earnings: 18 - 5 = $13.

The cost of a movie ticket is $6.50. To find out how many tickets Ryan can buy, we need to divide his remaining money by the cost of a ticket: 13 / 6.50 = 2.

So, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets.

"To find the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars, we first need to calculate the cost of making one jar and then multiply it by 10.

The cost of making one jar of the mixture is the sum of the costs of the ingredients:
- 2 pounds of passion fruit at $6 per pound: 2 * $6 = $12
- 1.5 pounds of jackfruit at $8 per pound: 1.5 * $8 = $12
- 2 pounds of honey at $10 per pound: 2 * $10 = $20
Total cost of making one jar: $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

Now, we need to find the total cost of making 10 jars: $44 * 10 = $440

The selling price of one jar is $50, so the total revenue from selling 10 jars is: $50 * 10 = $500

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue: $500 - $440 = $60

The profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars is $60."
"To find the total dollar amount in the jar, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and add them together.

A quarter is worth $0.25, so 32 quarters are worth 32 x $0.25 = $8.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog and then determine how many holes Nate fills in per day. 

The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes dug is 6 * 14 = 84 holes.

Since Nate fills in 9 holes a day and the dog digs 6 new holes every night, the net number of holes filled in per day is 9 - 6 = 3 holes.

To find out how many days it takes to fill in all the holes, we divide the total number of holes by the net number of holes filled in per day: 84 / 3 = 28 days.

"To find out how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to calculate their daily revenue and then multiply it by the number of days they are open.

First, let's calculate the daily revenue. They get 6 reservations a night, and each reservation includes 2 meals that cost $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine. 

Daily revenue = (6 reservations * 2 meals * $5) + (6 reservations * $5)
Daily revenue = (6 * 2 * $5) + (6 * $5)
Daily revenue = $60 + $30
Daily revenue = $90

"To solve this problem, we need to find the current age of James and then determine the age of John's youngest son.

First, let's find James' current age. We know that James is twice as old as Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years. This means that James is twice as old as 12 - 3 = 9 years old. So, James is 9 * 2 = 18 years old.

Since James is 18 years old and John had him when he was 19, John is currently 19 + 18 = 37 years old.

Now, we need to find the age of John's youngest son. We know that John's youngest son was born when John was 32. Since John is currently 37, his youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years old.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

"To find the total amount Mark paid, we first need to calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount and then add the labor cost.

The original cost of the radiator is $400. Mark gets it for 80% off, which means he pays 20% of the original cost. To find 20% of $400, we multiply $400 by 0.20.

$400 * 0.20 = $80

So, Mark pays $80 for the radiator.

Next, we need to calculate the labor cost. The mechanic works for 3 hours at $50 an hour. To find the total labor cost, we multiply the number of hours by the hourly rate.

3 hours * $50/hour = $150

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the labor cost to find the total amount Mark paid.

$80 (radiator) + $150 (labor) = $230

"Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as W. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write the equation C + W = 20.

We also know that the total number of legs is 70. Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. Therefore, we can write the equation 2C + 4W = 70.

We can solve the first equation for W: W = 20 - C.

Now, substitute W = 20 - C into the second equation: 2C + 4(20 - C) = 70.

Expand the equation: 2C + 80 - 4C = 70.

Combine like terms: -2C + 80 = 70.

Subtract 80 from both sides: -2C = -10.

Divide both sides by -2: C = 5.

The number of chickens is 5.
