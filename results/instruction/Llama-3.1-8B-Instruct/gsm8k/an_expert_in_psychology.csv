"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to first determine how many eggs she has left after eating and baking. 

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast and bakes 4 for muffins, so she uses a total of 3 + 4 = 7 eggs. 

To find out how many eggs she has left, we subtract the number of eggs used from the total number of eggs laid: 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.

Janet sells these 9 eggs at $2 each, so she makes 9 x $2 = $18 per day at the farmers' market.

The final answer is: $18"
"To find the total number of bolts needed, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber first. Since it's half the amount of blue fiber, and there are 2 bolts of blue fiber, we can calculate the white fiber as follows:

White fiber = 2 bolts (blue) / 2 = 1 bolt

Now, we add the blue fiber and white fiber to get the total:

Total bolts = 2 bolts (blue) + 1 bolt (white) = 3 bolts

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the profit Josh made, we first need to determine the total value of the house after the repairs. 

The original value of the house was $80,000. Josh put in $50,000 in repairs, which increased the value of the house by 150%. 

To find the new value of the house, we can set up an equation: 

New Value = Original Value + (Original Value * 150%)

New Value = $80,000 + ($80,000 * 1.5)
New Value = $80,000 + $120,000
New Value = $200,000

Now, we need to find the total cost of the house, which is the original price plus the repairs: 

Total Cost = Original Price + Repairs
Total Cost = $80,000 + $50,000
Total Cost = $130,000

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the new value of the house: 

Profit = New Value - Total Cost
Profit = $200,000 - $130,000
Profit = $70,000

The final answer is: $70,000"
"To find the total number of meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total meters he runs in one sprint session and then multiply it by the number of sessions he has in a week.

Since James runs 3 sprints in one session, and each sprint is 60 meters, the total meters he runs in one session is:
3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/session

Since James runs 3 sessions a week, the total meters he runs in a week is:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

The final answer is: 540"
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to determine the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon meals. 

In the morning, Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups of feed. In the afternoon, she gives them 25 cups of feed. 

The total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon meals is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

Since Wendi feeds each chicken 3 cups of feed per day, and she has 20 chickens, the total amount of feed needed per day is 3 * 20 = 60 cups.

To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we subtract the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon meals from the total amount of feed needed per day. 

60 - 40 = 20 cups.

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the glasses. 

First, let's find out how many glasses Kylar needs to buy at the full price and how many at the discounted price. Since every second glass costs 60% of the price, we can consider the glasses as being bought in pairs. 

Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, so he will buy 8 pairs of glasses. 

The cost of one pair of glasses is $5 + (60% of $5) = $5 + $3 = $8. 

Now, we multiply the cost of one pair by the number of pairs: 8 * $8 = $64.

The final answer is: $64"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of sheep in Toulouse and Charleston first. 

Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, and Seattle has 20 sheep, we can calculate the number of sheep in Charleston as follows:
Charleston = 4 * Seattle = 4 * 20 = 80

Now, we know that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. So, we can calculate the number of sheep in Toulouse as follows:
Toulouse = 2 * Charleston = 2 * 80 = 160

Now, we have the number of sheep in Toulouse (160), Charleston (80), and Seattle (20). To find the total number of sheep, we add these numbers together:
Total = Toulouse + Charleston + Seattle = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260

The final answer is: 260"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, let's calculate the time it takes to download 40% of the file. Since Carla can download 2 GB/minute, we can find the time it takes to download 80 GB (40% of 200 GB) by dividing 80 GB by 2 GB/minute.

80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes

Now, Carla has to restart the download from the beginning. The remaining 60% of the file is 120 GB (200 GB - 80 GB). We can find the time it takes to download the remaining 120 GB by dividing 120 GB by 2 GB/minute.

120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes

However, we also need to add the 20 minutes it takes to install the updates. 

Total time = 40 minutes + 60 minutes + 20 minutes
Total time = 120 minutes

The final answer is: 120"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and calculate the distance covered in each segment.

1.  First, John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph. The distance covered in this segment is:
   Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles

2.  Then, he spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so no distance is covered in this segment.

3.  Next, he drives for 0.5 hours at 30 mph. The distance covered in this segment is:
   Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles

4.  Finally, he drives for the remaining 1.5 hours (4 - 2.5 hours) at 80 mph. The distance covered in this segment is:
   Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 1.5 = 120 miles

5.  To find the total distance from home, we need to add the distances covered in each segment and subtract the distance he drove away from home initially:
   Total distance from home = Distance covered away from home - Distance covered towards home
   Total distance from home = 180 + 15 + 120 - 180
   Total distance from home = 35 miles

The final answer is: 35"
"To find Eliza's total earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately, then add them together.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings are:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours, she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours. Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, so her overtime rate is $10 * 1.2 = $12/hour. Her overtime earnings are:
5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Her total earnings for the week are:
$400 + $60 = $460

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and then add them together.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the downloads were reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which is 54. Then, we subtract 54 from 180 to get 126 downloads in the third month.

Now, we add the downloads from each month together: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The final answer is: 366"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts: 3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen is 3 x $68 = $204.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes: 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen is 2 x $80 = $160.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes: 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen is 6 x $55 = $330.

Finally, let's add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost is $694."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of planting the tree and the annual expenses, and then find the point at which the total earnings from selling lemons exceed these costs.

The initial cost of planting the tree is $90. The annual expenses are $3 for watering and feeding. 

The tree grows 7 lemons per year, and each lemon can be sold for $1.5. So, the total annual earnings from selling lemons are 7 * $1.5 = $10.5.

The net annual profit is the total earnings minus the annual expenses: $10.5 - $3 = $7.5.

To find the number of years it takes for the tree to start earning money, we need to calculate how many years it takes for the total earnings to exceed the initial cost of planting the tree.

Let's denote the number of years as 'n'. The total earnings after 'n' years will be $10.5n. The total cost will be the initial cost plus the annual expenses multiplied by 'n': $90 + $3n.

We want to find the smallest 'n' for which the total earnings exceed the total cost: $10.5n > $90 + $3n.

Subtracting $3n from both sides gives us $7.5n > $90. 

Dividing both sides by $7.5 gives us n > $90 / $7.5.

Calculating $90 / $7.5 gives us 12.

Since 'n' must be an integer (you can't have a fraction of a year), the smallest 'n' for which the inequality holds is 13.

Therefore, it will take 13 years for the tree to start earning money.

The final answer is: 13"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume Melanie started with x vacuum cleaners.

At the green house, she sold a third of her vacuum cleaners, which is x/3.

At the red house, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners.

At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, which is (x - x/3 - 2)/2.

We know that after selling at all three houses, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the equation:

x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

To simplify the equation, let's first simplify the fraction (x - x/3 - 2)/2:

(x - x/3 - 2)/2 = (2x/3 - 6)/2 = x/3 - 3

Now, let's rewrite the equation:

x - x/3 - 2 - (x/3 - 3) = 5

Combine like terms:

x - 2x/3 - 2 + x/3 - 3 = 5

Combine like terms:

x - 2x/3 + x/3 - 5 = 5

Combine like terms:

x - x/3 - 5 = 5

Combine like terms:

2x/3 - 5 = 5

Add 5 to both sides:

2x/3 = 10

Multiply both sides by 3/2:

x = 15

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to find the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance and jazz dance.

20% of 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance:
20% of 20 = 0.2 * 20 = 4 students

The remaining students are 20 - 4 = 16 students.

25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:
25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

The number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is the remaining students after subtracting the students who enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance:
16 - 4 = 12 students

To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100:
(12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is: 60"
"To determine the profit, we need to calculate the potential value of each option after the market fluctuation. 

For the jewelry option, the value after the market fluctuation would be $5,000 + ($5,000 * 0.025) = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125.

For the electronic gadgets option, the value after the market fluctuation would be $8,000 + ($8,000 * 0.012) = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096.

Since the merchant wants to maximize profit, we need to choose the option with the higher value after the market fluctuation. In this case, the electronic gadgets option is worth $8,096, which is higher than the jewelry option worth $5,125.

To calculate the profit, we need to know the initial cost of the electronic gadgets, which is $8,000. The profit would be the value after the market fluctuation minus the initial cost: $8,096 - $8,000 = $96.

The final answer is: $96"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance covered on the first day and the distance covered on the second day.

On the first day, both trains travel 80 miles westward. Since they are traveling in the same direction, they cover the same distance. 

On the second day, they travel 150 miles northward. Again, since they are traveling in the same direction, they cover the same distance.

So, the distance covered by each train in the two days is:

- Day 1: 80 miles (westward)
- Day 2: 150 miles (northward)

The total distance covered by each train in the two days is the sum of the distances covered on each day, which is 80 + 150 = 230 miles.

The final answer is: 230"
"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:

- Hourly wage: $20
- Hours worked per week: 35
- Weeks worked per year: 50
- Total hours worked per year: 35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year
- Annual earnings from teaching: 1750 hours/year * $20/hour = $35,000/year

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:

- Hourly wage: $30
- Hours worked per week: 15
- Weeks worked per year: 50
- Total hours worked per year: 15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year
- Annual earnings from coaching: 750 hours/year * $30/hour = $22,500/year

Now, let's add her earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary:

Annual salary = Annual earnings from teaching + Annual earnings from coaching
= $35,000/year + $22,500/year
= $57,500/year

The final answer is: $57,500"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks and then convert that number to dozens.

First, let's calculate the number of days in 4 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so:

4 weeks * 7 days/week = 28 days

Since Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning, she eats 3 eggs per day. To find the total number of eggs she eats in 28 days, we multiply the number of eggs per day by the number of days:

3 eggs/day * 28 days = 84 eggs

Now, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide the total number of eggs by 12:

84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozen eggs

Therefore, Claire will eat 7 dozen eggs in 4 weeks.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total time Marissa has already spent walking and the total distance she has covered. 

She has already walked 4 miles in 1 hour and 2 miles in another hour, so the total distance covered is 4 + 2 = 6 miles. 

The total time spent walking so far is 1 + 1 = 2 hours.

The total distance of the trail is 12 miles, and she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour. 

To find the total time required to cover the entire trail at an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed. 

time = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour = 3 hours.

Since she has already spent 2 hours walking, she has 3 - 2 = 1 hour left to cover the remaining distance.

The remaining distance is 12 - 6 = 6 miles.

To find the speed required to cover the remaining distance in 1 hour, we can use the formula: speed = distance / time.

speed = 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the amount of water in the orange drink, we first need to calculate two-thirds of 10 liters. Two-thirds of 10 liters is (2/3) * 10 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters. Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, this means 6.67 liters of the orange drink is water.

Next, we need to find the amount of water in the pineapple drink. Three-fifths of 15 liters is (3/5) * 15 = 45/5 = 9 liters. Since the pineapple drink is three-fifths water, this means 9 liters of the pineapple drink is water.

Now, we need to subtract the spilled liter of orange drink from the total amount of orange drink. 10 - 1 = 9 liters of orange drink remain.

The total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is the sum of the water in the remaining orange drink and the pineapple drink. This is 6.67 + 9 = 15.67 liters.

The final answer is: 15.67"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the age of Raymond when Samantha is 31 years old. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, we can calculate his age as follows:

Samantha's age - 6 = Raymond's age
31 - 6 = 25

Now, we know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago the son was born, we need to subtract the age at which the son was born from Raymond's current age.

Raymond's current age - Age at which son was born = Years ago son was born
25 - 23 = 2

Therefore, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago.

"To find the total number of DVDs sold by Billy, we need to calculate the number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers separately, and then add them together.

The first 3 customers buy one DVD each, so they bought a total of 3 DVDs.

The next 2 customers buy 2 DVDs each, so they bought a total of 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs.

Now, we add the number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers: 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs.

The last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs, so we don't need to add anything for them.

Therefore, Billy sold a total of 7 DVDs on Tuesday.

So, the total number of centimeters the candle will be shorter is 4 hours * 2 centimeters/hour = 8 centimeters.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the original price of the book, we need to determine the amount of the discount and add it to the discounted price. 

First, let's find the amount of the discount: 
Discount = 25% of the original price
Let's denote the original price as 'x'. 
Then, the discount is 0.25x.

The discounted price is the original price minus the discount: 
Discounted price = x - 0.25x = 0.75x

We know the discounted price is $19.50. 
So, we can set up the equation: 
0.75x = 19.50

To find 'x', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 0.75: 
x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book was $26.

The final answer is: $26"
"To find the total cost of the items Marie ordered excluding the pizza, we need to calculate the cost of the chicken meal, the packs of milk, and the apples.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3 = $15.
The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6.

The total cost of the items excluding the pizza is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the cost of the pizza boxes is $50 - $33 = $17.

To find the number of pizza boxes, we need to divide the cost of the pizza boxes by the cost of each box. 

Number of pizza boxes = $17 / $8.50 = 2.

"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream, we need to calculate the total number of cartons she buys and multiply it by the cost per carton.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she will go through 60 servings in 60 days. 

Each carton has 15 servings, so to find out how many cartons she buys, we divide the total number of servings by the number of servings per carton: 
60 servings / 15 servings per carton = 4 cartons

Now, we multiply the number of cartons by the cost per carton to find the total cost:
4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00

The final answer is: $16.00"
"To find the distance Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to determine the distance between the two stops. 

First, let's find the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip. Since Henry's second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip is 60 - 15 = 45 miles.

Now, we know that Henry traveled 20 miles before his first stop. To find the distance between the first and second stops, we need to subtract the distance traveled before the first stop from the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip. 

Distance between the first and second stops = Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip - Distance traveled before the first stop
= 45 - 20
= 25 miles

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the cost of the more expensive pair of heels as x. Since the other pair costs twice as much, the cost of the less expensive pair is 2x.

We know that the two pairs of heels together cost $5 less than the boots. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = boots - 5

Combine like terms:

3x = boots - 5

We also know that one pair of heels costs $33. Since the other pair costs twice as much, the cost of the more expensive pair is 2 * 33 = 66.

Now we can substitute x = 66 into the equation:

3(66) = boots - 5

Simplify the equation:

198 = boots - 5

Add 5 to both sides:

203 = boots

The boots cost $203.

The final answer is: $203"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given ratio and total age. Let's assume Darrell's age is 7x and Allen's age is 11x, where x is a common multiplier.

Since their total age is 162, we can write the equation: 7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms: 18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18: x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Darrell's and Allen's current ages:
Darrell's age = 7x = 7(9) = 63
Allen's age = 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

"To find the average guess, we need to calculate the total number of guesses and divide it by the number of people who made a guess.

The first person guesses 80 jelly beans.
The second person guesses 20 more than half of 80, which is (80 / 2) + 20 = 60.
The third person guesses 25% more than 80, which is 80 + (80 * 0.25) = 100.

Now, let's add up all the guesses: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

There are 3 people who made a guess. To find the average, we divide the total by 3: 240 / 3 = 80.

"To find the total hours John spends taking care of dogs per week, we need to first calculate the total hours he spends per day. 

Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day, and John takes care of 10 dogs. 

Total hours per day = 0.5 hours/dog * 10 dogs = 5 hours/day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the total hours per day by 7 to get the total hours per week.

Total hours per week = 5 hours/day * 7 days/week = 35 hours/week

The final answer is: 35"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations. Let's denote the number of silver coins as S and the number of gold coins as G. We are given two pieces of information:

1. The total number of coins is 110: S + G = 110
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins: G = S + 30

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for S:

S + (S + 30) = 110

Combine like terms:

2S + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:

2S = 80

Divide both sides by 2:

S = 40

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins by substituting S into the second equation:

G = S + 30
G = 40 + 30
G = 70

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

The final answer is: 70"

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of money John spent on video games.

Number of video games bought: 8
Price per video game: $20
Total money spent: 8 * 20 = $160

Since John had $5 left after buying the video games, we can calculate the total amount of money he had before buying the video games.

Total money before buying video games: Total money made - Total money spent + Money left
= $195 - $160 + $5
= $40

However, this is the total amount of money John had before buying the video games, not the amount of money he had before selling the Lego sets. Since he used the money from selling the Lego sets to buy the video games, the total amount of money he had before selling the Lego sets is the same as the total amount of money he had before buying the video games.

Now, we know that John sold 13 Lego sets for $195. To find the price per Lego set, we can divide the total money made by the number of Lego sets sold.

Price per Lego set: $195 / 13
= $15

This is consistent with the given information that John sells his Lego sets for $15 each.

To find the number of Lego sets John still has, we need to subtract the number of Lego sets he sold from the initial number of Lego sets.

Initial number of Lego sets: 13
Number of Lego sets sold: 13
Number of Lego sets left: 13 - 13
= 0

John still has 0 Lego sets."
"To find John's running speed, we first need to calculate the total hours he runs per week. 

He runs 3 hours on the first day. The other two days, he runs half as much as the first day, which is 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours per day. 

So, the total hours he runs per week is 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours.

Since John runs 60 miles a week and runs for 6 hours a week, we can find his speed by dividing the total miles by the total hours: 

Speed = Total miles / Total hours = 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine Dana's running and walking speeds. 

Given that Dana can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run, and she can skip at 3 miles per hour, we can calculate her running speed as follows:

Running speed = 2 * Skipping speed
Running speed = 2 * 3 miles per hour
Running speed = 6 miles per hour

We are also given that Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk. Let's denote her walking speed as 'x'. Then, her running speed is 4x. We already know her running speed is 6 miles per hour, so we can set up the equation:

4x = 6
x = 6 / 4
x = 1.5 miles per hour

Now that we know Dana's walking speed (1.5 miles per hour) and running speed (6 miles per hour), we can calculate the distance she travels in six hours.

Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. So, the time spent running is 2 hours and the time spent walking is 4 hours.

Distance traveled while running = Speed * Time
Distance traveled while running = 6 miles per hour * 2 hours
Distance traveled while running = 12 miles

Distance traveled while walking = Speed * Time
Distance traveled while walking = 1.5 miles per hour * 4 hours
Distance traveled while walking = 6 miles

Total distance traveled = Distance traveled while running + Distance traveled while walking
Total distance traveled = 12 miles + 6 miles
Total distance traveled = 18 miles

The final answer is: 18"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old.
2. Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, so Ben's iPhone is 2 * 1 = 2 years old.
3. Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, so Brandon's iPhone is 4 * 2 = 8 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the distance Polly can throw the javelin when holding the gemstone and then subtract the dragon's reach from that distance.

When Polly holds the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone. Since she can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone, she can throw it 3 * 400 = 1200 feet with the gemstone.

The dragon's reach is 1000 feet, so Polly can stand 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet outside of the dragon's reach and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

The final answer is: 200"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of pie pieces initially available and subtract the number of pieces remaining to determine the number of pieces taken by the guests.

First, let's find the total number of pie pieces initially available. Since Grandma Jones baked 5 pies and cut each pie into 8 pieces, the total number of pie pieces is:

5 pies * 8 pieces per pie = 40 pieces

Now, we know that there were 14 pieces of pie remaining at the end of the evening. To find the number of pieces taken by the guests, we subtract the number of remaining pieces from the total number of pieces:

40 pieces (initially available) - 14 pieces (remaining) = 26 pieces

Therefore, the number of pieces taken by the guests is 26.

The final answer is: 26"
"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to first calculate how many calories you have left for the day. 

Your daily calorie target is 2000, and you have already consumed 1800 calories. 

2000 (daily target) - 1800 (calories consumed) = 200 calories left for the day.

Since each serving of chips has 250 calories, we can calculate how many servings you can have:

200 calories left / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings

Since a 300g bag has 5 servings, we can calculate the total weight of chips you can eat by multiplying the number of servings by the weight of the bag per serving. However, we need to know the weight of one serving first. 

To find the weight of one serving, we divide the total weight of the bag by the number of servings:

300g (total weight) / 5 (number of servings) = 60g per serving

Now, we can calculate the total weight of chips you can eat:

0.8 servings * 60g per serving = 48g

The final answer is: 48"
"To find Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

First, let's calculate the total cost. Since one pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10.00, and Charlie makes 10 candles per pound, the cost per candle is $1.00 ($10.00 / 10 candles). 

To make 20 candles, the total cost would be 20 candles * $1.00 per candle = $20.00.

Next, let's calculate the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, and he makes 20 candles. The total revenue would be 20 candles * $2.00 per candle = $40.00.

Now, let's calculate the net profit. The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.

The final answer is: $20.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of articles Meredith wrote each day and then multiply it by the time it takes to write an article (4 hours).

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. To find this, we multiply 5 by 2/5:
5 * (2/5) = 2
So, on Tuesday, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday:
7 * 2 = 14 articles.

Now, we add up the number of articles she wrote each day:
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles.

Since each article takes 4 hours to write, we multiply the total number of articles by 4:
26 * 4 = 104

The final answer is: 104"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of Post-it notes Candice had at the beginning and the end, and then subtract the initial number from the final number to find out how many she used. 

Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes. At the end, she had 23 Post-it notes remaining. 

The total number of Post-it notes she used is 80 - 23 = 57. 

Since she used 57 Post-it notes at work, and she placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 cups of coffee, we can conclude that she used 220 Post-it notes at work. 

Now, to find out how many Post-it notes were in the package she purchased, we need to subtract the number of Post-it notes she initially had from the total number of Post-it notes she used. 

The number of Post-it notes in the package = 57 (used) + 23 (remaining) = 80. However, this is the total number of Post-it notes she had initially. We need to subtract the initial number from the total number of Post-it notes she used at work. 

The number of Post-it notes in the package = 220 (used at work) - 80 (initial) = 140.

The final answer is: 140"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of blue ties John bought and the cost of the red ties.

Since John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

Number of blue ties = Total cost of blue ties / Cost per blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is:

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
= 2 * 5
= 10

The cost of the red ties is 50% more than the cost of the blue ties. Since the blue ties cost $40 each, the cost of the red ties is:

Cost of red ties = Cost of blue ties + (50% of cost of blue ties)
= $40 + (0.5 * $40)
= $40 + $20
= $60

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the red ties:

Total cost of red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of red ties
= 10 * $60
= $600

The total amount John spent on ties is the sum of the cost of the blue ties and the cost of the red ties:

Total cost = Cost of blue ties + Total cost of red ties
= $200 + $600
= $800

The final answer is: $800"
"To find the number of pieces Tracy obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches, since the pieces are cut in inches. 

1 foot is equal to 12 inches. 

So, 4 feet is equal to 4 x 12 = 48 inches.

Now, we need to divide the total length of the wire (48 inches) by the length of each piece (6 inches) to find the number of pieces.

Number of pieces = Total length / Length of each piece
= 48 / 6
= 8

"To find the total number of units in the building, we need to multiply the number of floors by the number of units per floor. 

Number of floors: 15
Number of units per floor: 8

Total number of units = Number of floors * Number of units per floor
Total number of units = 15 * 8
Total number of units = 120

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we need to find 1/4 of the total number of units to determine the number of unoccupied units.

1/4 of the total number of units = (1/4) * 120
1/4 of the total number of units = 30

The total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"To find out how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to calculate the total number of eggs produced per week and then multiply it by the price per dozen.

First, let's find out how many eggs are produced per week: 
252 eggs per day * 7 days per week = 1764 eggs per week

Since eggs are sold in dozens, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens: 
1764 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 147 dozen eggs per week

Now, let's calculate the total revenue per week: 
147 dozen eggs per week * $2 per dozen = $294 per week

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Tom spends traveling from 1 to 4 PM and then the time he spends traveling back.

First, let's calculate the distance Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM. Since he travels at 10 miles per hour, we can use the formula: distance = speed * time. However, we don't know the time he spends traveling from 1 to 4 PM. 

Since he travels from 1 to 4 PM, we can assume he travels for 3 hours (from 1 to 4 PM is 3 hours). 

Distance = speed * time = 10 miles/hour * 3 hours = 30 miles.

Now, let's calculate the time he spends traveling back. We know the distance is 30 miles and his speed is 6 miles per hour. 

Time = distance / speed = 30 miles / 6 miles/hour = 5 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he removes 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Since Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds, and the comic books already account for 7.5 pounds, the remaining weight to be removed is 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we can find the number of toys to be removed by dividing the remaining weight by the weight of each toy: 7.5 / 0.5 = 15.

"To find the revenue earned on each day, we need to calculate the total revenue from truck tires and car tires separately for both days.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. The revenue from truck tires is 6 * $60 = $360. The revenue from car tires is 4 * $40 = $160. The total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires. The revenue from car tires is 12 * $40 = $480. Since there are no truck tires, the total revenue on Friday is $480.

To find the day with higher revenue, we compare the revenues: $520 (Thursday) and $480 (Friday). Thursday has higher revenue.

Now, to find how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we subtract the lower revenue from the higher revenue: $520 - $480 = $40.

To find out how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to divide the total amount of money he has ($42) by the cost of a movie outing ($14).

$42 ÷ $14 = 3

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times."
"To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck, we need to subtract the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit, and then divide the result by the weight of each box.

First, let's calculate the remaining weight capacity of the bridge:

Bridge's weight limit: 5000 pounds
Combined weight of the driver and the empty truck: 3755 pounds
Remaining weight capacity: 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds

Next, let's divide the remaining weight capacity by the weight of each box:

Weight of each box: 15 pounds
Maximum number of boxes: 1245 / 15 = 83

So, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83.

"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to follow the order of operations. 

First, we need to calculate the 25% fee on the final total of $40.00. To do this, we multiply $40.00 by 0.25 (which is the decimal equivalent of 25%). 

$40.00 * 0.25 = $10.00

Next, we add the delivery fee of $3.00 to the 25% fee of $10.00.

$10.00 + $3.00 = $13.00

Now, we add the 25% fee and the delivery fee to the original total of $40.00.

$40.00 + $13.00 = $53.00

Finally, we add the $4.00 tip to the new total of $53.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the value of the pension after 30 years and then determine the annual pension Marcy will receive.

First, let's calculate the value of the pension after 30 years. Since Marcy works for 40 years and becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year after 20 years, she will have worked for 10 years at the full pension rate and 10 years at the increased rate.

The value of the pension after 30 years can be calculated as follows:

- 10 years at the full pension rate: 10 * $50,000 = $500,000
- 10 years at the increased rate: 10 * 5% * $500,000 = $250,000
- Total value of the pension after 30 years: $500,000 + $250,000 = $750,000

Now, let's calculate the annual pension Marcy will receive after 30 years. Since she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year after 20 years, she will receive 5% of the total value of the pension after 30 years.

Annual pension = 5% * $750,000 = 0.05 * $750,000 = $37,500

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount Aleena paid for the first half of the year and the second half of the year separately, and then add them together.

The first half of the year is 6 months, so the amount charged for the first half is 6 * $140 = $840.

For the second half of the year, the company charges 10% less than the initial amount. To find 10% of $140, we multiply $140 by 0.1, which is $14. Then, we subtract this amount from the initial amount to get the reduced amount: $140 - $14 = $126. Since the second half of the year is also 6 months, the amount charged for the second half is 6 * $126 = $756.

Now, we add the amounts charged for the first and second half of the year to get the total amount paid: $840 + $756 = $1596.

The final answer is: $1596"
"To determine how far Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to calculate the miles per gallon (mpg) of her car. We can do this by dividing the distance she traveled since the last fill-up (100 miles) by the amount of gas she used to fill up (4 gallons).

mpg = distance / gallons = 100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 mpg

Now that we know the mpg, we can calculate the total distance Sophia can drive on a full tank by multiplying the mpg by the tank capacity (12 gallons).

Total distance = mpg * tank capacity = 25 mpg * 12 gallons = 300 miles

Therefore, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas.

The amount of dog food the puppy needs in the first 180 days is 180 * 1 = 180 cups. The amount of dog food the puppy needs for the rest of its life is 185 * 2 = 370 cups.

The total amount of dog food the puppy needs in the first year is 180 + 370 = 550 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the total number of bags Cecilia will use in the first year is 550 / 110 = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the amount of laundry that Raymond and David do.

Since Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, and she does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can calculate David's laundry as follows:

David's laundry = Sarah's laundry / 4
= 400 / 4
= 100 pounds

Since Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, we can calculate Raymond's laundry as follows:

Raymond's laundry = Sarah's laundry / 2
= 400 / 2
= 200 pounds

Now, we need to find the difference in the amount of laundry that Raymond and David do:

Difference = Raymond's laundry - David's laundry
= 200 - 100
= 100 pounds

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the better price, we need to calculate the cost per flower for each package option. 

For the package of 3 flowers, the cost per flower is $2.50 / 3 = $0.8333 per flower.

For the package of 2 flowers, the cost per flower is $1 / 2 = $0.5 per flower.

Since $0.5 per flower is less than $0.8333 per flower, the package of 2 flowers is the better option.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price. 18 flowers / 2 flowers per package = 9 packages. The cost of 9 packages of 2 flowers is 9 * $1 = $9.

To find the cost of buying 18 flowers at the package of 3 flowers, we calculate 18 flowers / 3 flowers per package = 6 packages. The cost of 6 packages of 3 flowers is 6 * $2.50 = $15.

The difference in cost is $15 - $9 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To find the cost of the grooming after the discount, we need to calculate 30% of the original price and subtract it from the original price.

The original price is $100. 
30% of $100 is 0.3 x $100 = $30.

Now, subtract the discount from the original price: $100 - $30 = $70.

The final cost of the grooming is $70.

The final answer is: $70"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much water the two girls got in total. Each girl got 1/6 of 24 liters, so together they got 2 * (1/6) * 24 = 8 liters.

Now, we subtract the total amount of water the girls got from the initial 24 liters to find out how much water was left before the boy got any. 24 - 8 = 16 liters.

Then, the boy got 6 liters of water, so we subtract that from the remaining 16 liters. 16 - 6 = 10 liters.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many stickers Charlie has left, we need to calculate the total number of stickers he had initially and then subtract the number of stickers he gave away or used.

Initially, Charlie had 10 stickers.

He bought 21 stickers from a store, so now he has 10 + 21 = 31 stickers.

He got 23 stickers for his birthday, so now he has 31 + 23 = 54 stickers.

Then, he gave 9 stickers to his sister, so now he has 54 - 9 = 45 stickers.

Finally, he used 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card, so now he has 45 - 28 = 17 stickers.

Therefore, Charlie has 17 stickers left.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find Alex's weight, we need to calculate 4 times Grace's weight and then subtract 2 pounds from that result. 

First, we multiply Grace's weight by 4: 125 * 4 = 500 pounds. 

Then, we subtract 2 pounds from that result: 500 - 2 = 498 pounds.

Now, we know Alex's weight is 498 pounds. 

To find their combined weights, we add Grace's weight and Alex's weight: 125 + 498 = 623 pounds.

"To find the total number of thorns, we need to calculate the total number of roses and then multiply it by the number of thorns per rose.

First, let's find the total number of roses: 
3 rose bushes * 25 roses per bush = 3 * 25 = 75 roses

Now, let's find the total number of thorns:
75 roses * 8 thorns per rose = 75 * 8 = 600 thorns

The final answer is: 600"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let's denote the number of games the team lost as 'x'. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games they won is 'x + 8'.

We know that the total number of games played is 22, which is the sum of the games won and lost. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:

2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 7

Since x represents the number of games lost, the number of games won is x + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total number of quilt blocks, we need to calculate the total number of years Gene has been vacationing and multiply it by the number of vacations he goes on per year.

Gene has been vacationing since he was 23 years old and is now 34, so he has been vacationing for 34 - 23 = 11 years.

Since he goes on four vacations a year, the total number of quilt blocks is 11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 quilt blocks.

The final answer is: 44"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of times the alarm rang. 

The first time, the alarm rang 4 times. 
The second time, it rang 3 times as long as the first time, so it rang 4 * 3 = 12 times. 
The third time, it rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we add the number of times it rang each time: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To find Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate her salary after the 5th year and then calculate the increase for the next three years.

Initially, Sylvie's salary is $600. 

After 5 years, her salary will increase by 10% of $600 for each year. 
Year 1: $600 + (10% of $600) = $600 + $60 = $660
Year 2: $660 + (10% of $660) = $660 + $66 = $726
Year 3: $726 + (10% of $726) = $726 + $72.60 = $798.60
Year 4: $798.60 + (10% of $798.60) = $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46
Year 5: $878.46 + (10% of $878.46) = $878.46 + $87.85 = $966.31

Now, for the next three years, her salary will increase by 10% of the salary at the end of the 5th year, which is $966.31.

Year 6: $966.31 + (10% of $966.31) = $966.31 + $96.63 = $1062.94
Year 7: $1062.94 + (10% of $1062.94) = $1062.94 + $106.29 = $1169.23
Year 8: $1169.23 + (10% of $1169.23) = $1169.23 + $116.92 = $1286.15

Her annual salary after three more years of service is $1286.15."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation. Let's say Harald sold x copies. Since Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, Marilyn sold 10x copies.

We know that the total number of copies sold is 88,000, so we can set up the equation:

x + 10x = 88,000

Combine like terms:

11x = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:

x = 8,000

So Harald sold 8,000 copies.

The final answer is: 8000"
"To find out how many gift bags Christina needs, we first need to calculate the number of guests she expects to attend. Since 1/4 of the invited guests don't show up, we can find the number of expected attendees by subtracting 1/4 from the total number of invited guests.

Number of invited guests: 16
Number of guests not showing up: 16 * (1/4) = 4
Number of expected attendees: 16 - 4 = 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we multiply the number of expected attendees by 0.75 to find the total number of gift bags needed.

Number of gift bags needed: 12 * 0.75 = 9

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of gift bags needed by the cost per gift bag.

Cost per gift bag: $2
Total cost: 9 * $2 = $18

The final answer is: $18"
"To determine the total amount of potato salad needed, we need to calculate the amount an adult and a child will eat, then multiply by the number of adults and children, and finally add the two amounts together.

An adult will eat 10 lbs of potato salad, and a child will eat half as much as an adult, which is 10 / 2 = 5 lbs.

There are 20 adults, so the total amount of potato salad needed for adults is 20 * 10 = 200 lbs.

There are 5 children, so the total amount of potato salad needed for children is 5 * 5 = 25 lbs.

To find the total amount of potato salad needed, we add the amount for adults and children: 200 + 25 = 225 lbs.

The final answer is: 225"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of pets each person has and then add them together.

We know that Cindy has 4 pets. Since Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.

Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets.

To find the total number of pets, we add the number of pets each person has: 4 (Cindy) + 6 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan) = 28.

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationships between the ages of the children. 

Let's denote the age of Jackson as J, Amy as A, Corey as C, and James as M. We know that M = 10.

From the information given, we have the following equations:
1. A = J + 5 (Amy is 5 years older than Jackson)
2. A = C - 2 (Amy is 2 years younger than Corey)
3. C = M + 1 (James is 1 year younger than Corey)

We can substitute equation 3 into equation 2 to get:
A = (M + 1) - 2
A = 10 + 1 - 2
A = 9

Now that we know Amy's age, we can substitute A into equation 1 to find Jackson's age:
9 = J + 5
J = 9 - 5
J = 4

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it takes Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles before his diet change. Since Lee runs 2 seconds faster than Gerald, we can set up an equation:

Time it takes Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles = Time it takes Lee to run the 400-meter hurdles + 2 seconds

We know that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds. So, the time it takes Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles before his diet change is:

Time it takes Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles = 38 + 2 = 40 seconds

Now, we know that Gerald's diet improved his speed by 10%. To find out how much time he will save, we need to calculate 10% of 40 seconds:

10% of 40 seconds = 0.1 x 40 = 4 seconds

Since Gerald's speed improved by 10%, he will save 4 seconds from his original time. To find out how long it takes Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles with his improved diet, we subtract 4 seconds from his original time:

Time it takes Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles with his improved diet = 40 - 4 = 36 seconds

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of cats, then the number of rabbits, and finally add them up with the number of dogs to get the total number of pets.

Given that there are two cats for every dog, and the number of dogs is 60, we can find the number of cats by multiplying the number of dogs by 2.

Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
= 2 * 60
= 120

Now, we know that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. We can find the combined number of dogs and cats by adding the number of dogs and cats.

Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
= 60 + 120
= 180

Now, we can find the number of rabbits by subtracting 12 from the combined number of dogs and cats.

Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
= 180 - 12
= 168

Finally, we can find the total number of pets in the neighborhood by adding the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits.

Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
= 60 + 120 + 168
= 348

"To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we first need to find the total number of girls and then subtract the number of girls in the girl scout.

First, let's find the number of boys and girls. We know that 2/5 of the students are boys. 

Number of boys = (2/5) * 200 = 80

Since there are 200 students in total, the number of girls can be found by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students.

Number of girls = 200 - 80 = 120

Now, we know that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. 

Number of girls in the girl scout = (2/3) * 120 = 80

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls.

Number of girls not in the girl scout = 120 - 80 = 40

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many 16-ounce cans of tomatoes Freda used to make 32 ounces of sauce. Since the sauce is made from the tomatoes in the cans, and each can contains 16 ounces of tomatoes, we can divide the total amount of sauce (32 ounces) by the amount of sauce per can (16 ounces) to find the number of cans used.

32 ounces (sauce) / 16 ounces (per can) = 2 cans

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, we can multiply the number of cans by 3 to find the total number of tomatoes used.

2 cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 6 tomatoes

"To find out how many potted plants Mary will have left, we first need to determine the total number of potted plants she has initially. She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, so the total number of potted plants she has is 2 * 40 = 80.

She received 18 new potted plants from the nursery, so the total number of potted plants she has now is 80 + 18 = 98.

However, she has decided to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to her friends and family, which means she will give away 40 potted plants.

To find out how many potted plants she will have left, we subtract the number of potted plants she gave away from the total number of potted plants she has: 98 - 40 = 58.

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to find the inner volume of one box and then multiply it by 3.

The dimensions of the box are given as 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches, but the walls are 1 inch thick. This means that the inner dimensions of the box will be (5-2) inches by (6-2) inches by (4-2) inches, since 1 inch is subtracted from each side for the wall thickness.

So, the inner dimensions of the box are 3 inches by 4 inches by 2 inches.

The formula to find the volume of a rectangular prism is length x width x height. 

Inner volume of one box = 3 x 4 x 2 = 24 cubic inches.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 2 episodes of a 1-hour show, which is 2 * 1 = 2 hours.

On Thursday, he watched 1 hour and 30 minutes of TV, which is 1.5 hours.

On Friday, he watched 2 episodes of a 1-hour show, which is 2 * 1 = 2 hours.

So far, Frankie has watched 2 + 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 7.5 hours of TV, but we know he actually watched 7 hours. This means that the remaining time is 7.5 - 7 = 0.5 hours.

On Wednesday, Frankie watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. Let's call the number of episodes x. Since each episode is 30 minutes, or 0.5 hours, the total time he watched on Wednesday is 0.5x hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many sets of 10 feet Julia rows in 64 seconds, and then multiply that by the amount of water taken on per set.

First, let's find out how many sets of 10 feet Julia rows in 16 seconds. Since it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can find the time it takes her to row 10 feet by dividing 16 by 2 (since 20 feet is twice 10 feet). 

16 / 2 = 8 seconds to row 10 feet.

Now, we can find out how many sets of 10 feet Julia rows in 64 seconds by dividing 64 by 8.

64 / 8 = 8 sets of 10 feet.

Since it takes 2 liters of water to take on 10 feet, we can multiply the number of sets by 2 to find the total amount of water taken on.

8 sets * 2 liters/set = 16 liters.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold as B, and the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as D.

We know that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, so we can write an equation:

Jamal's phone = 6 * Brittany's phone
1800 = 6 * B

To find the number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold, we can divide both sides of the equation by 6:

B = 1800 / 6
B = 300

Now, we know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph. We can write another equation:

B = 50 * D
300 = 50 * D

To find the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph, we can divide both sides of the equation by 50:

D = 300 / 50
D = 6

The total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $16 = $80. 
The total cost of all the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since prices have gone up by 50%, the new price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each. 
The new price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 each.

The total selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $15 = $150. 
The total selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $24 = $120. 
The total selling price of all the lumber is $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit is the total selling price minus the total cost, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of ratios and proportions. The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, which means for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, there are 13 cups of water. 

Let's assume the common multiple for the ratio is x. This means the total parts in the ratio are 7 + 13 = 20 parts. 

We know that the total amount of sugar and water used is 120 teaspoons. Since sugar is 7 parts of the ratio, we can set up the equation: 7/20 * x = 120.

To find x, we multiply both sides by 20/7: x = 120 * (20/7) = 342.86 (approximately). However, since x represents the total number of parts, we can ignore the decimal part for this problem.

Now, we can find the number of teaspoons of sugar used by multiplying the total parts by the fraction of sugar in the ratio: 7/20 * 342.86 ≈ 120. 

However, since the total parts must be a whole number, we can find the exact number of teaspoons of sugar by dividing 120 by the greatest common divisor of 7 and 13, which is 1. Then multiply the result by 7. 

The exact number of teaspoons of sugar used is 120 / 1 * 7 = 840 / 1 = 120."
"To find the total amount John paid, we need to calculate the cost of the shoes for all 3 children. 

First, we find the cost of shoes for one child: 2 pairs * $60 per pair = $120.

Then, we multiply this by the number of children: $120 * 3 = $360.

So, John paid $360 in total.

The final answer is: $360"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of vehicles that were already present at the port on the first day. Since there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, the total number of vehicles on the first day is 2 * 5 = 10.

Now, we know that the total number of vehicles on the second day is 30. To find the number of vehicles that were added on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles on the first day from the total number of vehicles on the second day: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is 20 / 5 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Lylah's salary four years ago. 

Let's assume Lylah's salary four years ago was 'x'. Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can express Adrien's salary as 1.3x. We are given that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000, so we can set up the equation:

1.3x = 40000

To find 'x', we can divide both sides by 1.3:

x = 40000 / 1.3
x = 30769.23

So, Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30769.23.

Now, we need to find Adrien's salary four years later. We are given that his salary increased by 40% of his original salary. To find the increase, we can multiply his original salary by 0.4:

Increase = 40000 * 0.4
Increase = 16000

Now, we add the increase to his original salary to find his new salary:

Adrien's new salary = 40000 + 16000
Adrien's new salary = 56000

We also need to find Lylah's new salary. Since their salaries increased simultaneously, we can assume the percentage increase for Lylah is the same as Adrien's, which is 40%. We can find the increase in Lylah's salary by multiplying her original salary by 0.4:

Increase = 30769.23 * 0.4
Increase = 12307.69

Now, we add the increase to her original salary to find her new salary:

Lylah's new salary = 30769.23 + 12307.69
Lylah's new salary = 43076.92

Now, we can find the total salary of both Adrien and Lylah four years later by adding their new salaries:

Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary
Total salary = 56000 + 43076.92
Total salary = 99076.92

The final answer is: $99077"
"To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we need to first calculate how many sheets he uses in a week and then multiply that by the number of weeks in a month.

Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad has 30 sheets. So, the number of sheets he uses in a week is 2 pads * 30 sheets/pad = 60 sheets.

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we can multiply the number of sheets Miguel uses in a week by 4 to find out how many sheets he uses in a month: 60 sheets/week * 4 weeks/month = 240 sheets/month.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the total number of fruits, we first need to determine the number of fruits each person brought. 

Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges. 

Kael brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette, which is 2 * 5 = 10 apples. 
Kael brought half the number of oranges as Morisette, which is 8 / 2 = 4 oranges.

Now, we need to find the total number of fruits each person brought. 
Morisette brought 5 + 8 = 13 fruits. 
Kael brought 10 + 4 = 14 fruits.

To find the total number of fruits, we add the number of fruits each person brought: 13 + 14 = 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"To find the total number of hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we need to calculate her sleep hours for each day and add them up.

On Monday, Sadie slept 8 hours.

For the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday), she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours each day.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Sunday), she slept 1 hour more than the previous two days, so she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours each day.

Now, let's calculate the total hours for each part of the week:

- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday and Wednesday: 2 days * 6 hours = 12 hours
- Thursday to Sunday: 5 days * 7 hours = 35 hours

Adding up the total hours: 8 + 12 + 35 = 55 hours

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour and the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour.

First, let's calculate the distance Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours. 

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour x 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, let's calculate the remaining time after 3 hours. 
Total time = 7 hours
Time already run = 3 hours
Remaining time = Total time - Time already run
Remaining time = 7 hours - 3 hours
Remaining time = 4 hours

Next, let's calculate the distance Rosie runs at 5 miles per hour for the remaining 4 hours.

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour x 4 hours
Distance = 20 miles

Now, let's add the distances Rosie runs at both speeds to find the total distance.

Total distance = Distance at 10 miles per hour + Distance at 5 miles per hour
Total distance = 30 miles + 20 miles
Total distance = 50 miles

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand that Jennie put stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps. This means that the number of letters she stamped is one-third of 60, which is 60 / 3 = 20 letters.

Since there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters, this means that the 20 letters Jennie stamped were added to the pile. Therefore, the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters before Jennie started is 30 - 20 = 10 letters.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Julia initially bought a package of spoons, but we don't know the quantity yet. Let's call this quantity 'x'.
2. Her husband bought a package of 5 new spoons and gave them to Julia.
3. Julia used 3 spoons while making the stew.
4. When she went to set the table, she had a total of 12 spoons.

Now, let's set up an equation to represent the situation:

Initial spoons (x) + spoons from her husband (5) - spoons used (3) = total spoons (12)

x + 5 - 3 = 12

Simplifying the equation:

x + 2 = 12

Subtracting 2 from both sides:

x = 10

So, Julia bought a package of 10 spoons.

"To find the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we need to add the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages. 

First, let's find the number of fish sausages. Since Dylan bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, and he bought 38 chicken sausages, the number of fish sausages is 38 + 6 = 44.

Now, let's add the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages to find the total number of sausages: 38 (chicken sausages) + 44 (fish sausages) = 82.

The final answer is: 82"
"To find the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together, we first need to determine the number of friends Amy has. Since Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, and Lily has 50 friends, we can calculate Amy's friends by adding 20 to Lily's total.

Amy's friends = Lily's friends + 20
Amy's friends = 50 + 20
Amy's friends = 70

Now, to find the total number of friends they have together, we add the number of friends Lily and Amy have.

Total friends = Lily's friends + Amy's friends
Total friends = 50 + 70
Total friends = 120

The final answer is: 120"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the cost of each item and then calculate the total amount Dillon will spend.

First, we know that each pepper costs $15. Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, the cost of a watermelon is 3 * $15 = $45.

Next, we know that an orange costs 5 dollars less than a watermelon, so the cost of an orange is $45 - $5 = $40.

Now, we can calculate the total amount Dillon will spend:

- 4 watermelons: 4 * $45 = $180
- 20 peppers: 20 * $15 = $300
- 10 oranges: 10 * $40 = $400

The total amount Dillon will spend is $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

"To calculate the hospital's profit, we need to first determine the total time spent by doctors and the total amount charged to patients.

The hospital sees 500 people a day, and each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes. 

First, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 24 minutes is 24/60 = 0.4 hours.

The total time spent by doctors is 500 patients * 0.4 hours per patient = 200 hours.

The doctors charge $150 an hour, so the total amount charged by doctors to the hospital is 200 hours * $150 per hour = $30,000.

The hospital charges the patients $200 an hour, and the total time spent by patients is 500 patients * 0.4 hours per patient = 200 hours.

The total amount charged to patients is 200 hours * $200 per hour = $40,000.

The hospital's profit is the difference between the amount charged to patients and the amount charged by doctors, which is $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.

The hospital makes a profit of $10,000 from these visits."
"To find the number of elves left, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, Nissa hires 60 elves.

A third of the elves quit after children vomit on them. To find a third of 60, we divide 60 by 3:
60 / 3 = 20

So, 20 elves quit after being vomited on. The remaining number of elves is:
60 - 20 = 40

Then, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. The number of elves left is:
40 - 10 = 30

"To find the total number of tickets used, we need to calculate the total number of rides each person took and then multiply it by the cost per ride.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, so she rode a total of 2 + 2 = 4 rides.
Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, so he rode a total of 4 + 2 = 6 rides.

The total number of rides is 4 (Pam's rides) + 6 (Fred's rides) = 10 rides.

Since each ride costs 6 tickets, the total number of tickets used is 10 rides * 6 tickets per ride = 60 tickets.

The final answer is: 60"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.
2. On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday. So, he walked 6 * 4 = 24 miles on Tuesday.
3. The total mileage from Monday to Tuesday is 4 + 24 = 28 miles.
4. The total mileage from Monday through Wednesday is 41 miles. To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we need to subtract the total mileage from Monday to Tuesday from the total mileage from Monday through Wednesday.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W.

We are given that there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so B = 2Q.

We are also given that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so W = 2B.

We know that the total number of bees in the hive is 700, so Q + B + W = 700.

Substituting B = 2Q and W = 2B into the equation, we get Q + 2Q + 2(2Q) = 700.

Simplifying the equation, we get Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700, which is 7Q = 700.

Dividing both sides by 7, we get Q = 100.

Now that we know Q = 100, we can find B by substituting Q into the equation B = 2Q, so B = 2(100) = 200.

Finally, we can find W by substituting B into the equation W = 2B, so W = 2(200) = 400.

"To calculate the total profit, we first need to determine the total income and total expenses. 

Kim has 3 current clients and 5 potential clients, making a total of 8 clients. Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. 

Total bottles of bleach needed per week: 8 clients * 2 bottles/client = 16 bottles
Total packs of cloths needed per week: 8 clients * 1 pack/client = 8 packs

The cost of bleach per week: 16 bottles * $2/bottle = $32
The cost of cloths per week: 8 packs * $5/pack = $40

Total expenses per week: $32 (bleach) + $40 (cloths) = $72

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of the bees that left in the first 6 hours return. So, 1/2 * 30 = 15 bees return.
3. The number of bees that have left but not returned so far is 30 - 15 = 15 bees.
4. In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees as the ones that left in the first 6 hours fly out of the hive. So, 2 * 30 = 60 bees leave.
5. The total number of bees that left but not returned is now 15 (from the first 6 hours) + 60 (in the next 6 hours) = 75 bees.
6. In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left but not returned come back. So, 75 bees return.

Charlie's friends = 3 * Dorothy's friends
12 = 3 * Dorothy's friends

To find Dorothy's friends, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

Dorothy's friends = 12 / 3
Dorothy's friends = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find James' friends. James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, so we multiply Dorothy's friends by 4:

"To determine the time it takes for each person to get home, we need to calculate the time it takes for Steve and Tim to cover their respective distances.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet, since the speeds are given in feet per minute. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15,840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10,560 feet

Now, let's calculate the time it takes for each person to get home:

Steve's time: distance / speed = 15,840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: distance / speed = 10,560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 36 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve will be the winner. To find out how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to subtract the winner's time from the loser's time.

Waiting time = Tim's time - Steve's time = 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

"To find out how much Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total cost of inflating all the tires. 

First, let's calculate the cost of inflating the bicycle tires. Each bicycle has 2 tires, and there were 5 bicycles. So, the total number of bicycle tires is 5 * 2 = 10. The cost of inflating each tire is 25 cents, so the total cost for the bicycle tires is 10 * 25 cents = 250 cents. 

Next, let's calculate the cost of inflating the tricycle tires. Each tricycle has 3 tires, and there were 3 tricycles. So, the total number of tricycle tires is 3 * 3 = 9. The cost of inflating each tire is 25 cents, so the total cost for the tricycle tires is 9 * 25 cents = 225 cents.

Now, let's calculate the cost of inflating the unicycle tire. A unicycle has 1 tire, and there was 1 unicycle. So, the total number of unicycle tires is 1 * 1 = 1. The cost of inflating each tire is 25 cents, so the total cost for the unicycle tire is 1 * 25 cents = 25 cents.

Now, let's add up the total cost of inflating all the tires: 250 cents + 225 cents + 25 cents = 500 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100. So, 500 cents is equal to 500 / 100 = 5 dollars.

The final answer is: $5"
"To find the total cost of the cookies, we need to multiply the number of packs by the number of cookies per pack and then multiply that by the cost per cookie.

Number of packs: 10
Cookies per pack: 6
Cost per cookie: $0.10

Total number of cookies: 10 packs * 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies
Total cost: 60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6

Since Carl pays with a $10 bill, the change he receives is the difference between the $10 bill and the total cost of the cookies.

Change = $10 - $6 = $4

The final answer is: $4"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Dave ate 14 french fries initially.
2. The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 french fries.
   Now, the total amount eaten by Dave and the seagull is 14 + 7 = 21 french fries.
3. Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate a total of 3 * 3 = 9 french fries.
   Now, the total amount eaten is 21 + 9 = 30 french fries.
4. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries. Let's denote the initial number of fries as x. 
   After Dave and the seagull ate, (x - 21) fries were left. 
   After the pigeons ate, (x - 21 - 9) = (x - 30) fries were left.
   The raccoon stole two-thirds of (x - 30), which is (2/3)(x - 30).
   So, the remaining amount after the raccoon ate is (x - 30) - (2/3)(x - 30).
   Simplifying this, we get (1/3)(x - 30).
5. Ants carried off a final french fry, leaving 5 behind. 
   So, (1/3)(x - 30) - 1 = 5.
   Solving for x, we get (1/3)(x - 30) = 6.
   Multiplying both sides by 3, we get x - 30 = 18.
   Adding 30 to both sides, we get x = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in a semester, we need to calculate the total hours he spends in a week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a semester.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes, each lasting 1 hour. So, the total hours he spends on these days in a week is 3 * 1 = 3 hours.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes, each lasting 2 hours. So, the total hours he spends on these days in a week is 2 * 2 = 4 hours.

The total hours Kimo spends in a week is 3 + 4 = 7 hours.

Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, the total hours Kimo spends attending classes in a semester is 7 * 16 = 112 hours.

The final answer is: 112"
"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the total length of each type of baked good and then add them together.

First, let's convert the length of the baguettes from feet to inches, since the lengths of the rolls and croissants are given in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so each baguette is 2 * 12 = 24 inches long.

Now, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good:

- Rolls: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches
- Croissants: 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches
- Baguettes: 60 baguettes * 24 inches/baguette = 1440 inches

Now, let's add the total lengths together: 1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 inches.

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot): 3360 / 12 = 280 feet.

The final answer is: 280"
"To determine the total number of bananas needed for 2 months, we need to calculate the total number of bananas needed for each type of ape and then add them together.

The monkeys need 200 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 200 * 2 = 400 bananas.

The gorillas need 400 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 400 * 2 = 800 bananas.

The baboons need 100 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 100 * 2 = 200 bananas.

To find the total number of bananas needed, we add the bananas needed for each type of ape: 400 (monkeys) + 800 (gorillas) + 200 (baboons) = 1400 bananas.

The zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"To determine the distance each person runs, we need to calculate the total distance for both Blake and Kelly.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Since he runs back and forth, the total distance he covers is 2 times the length of the field for each run. So, the total distance for Blake is 15 * 2 * 100 = 3000 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 2 * 100 = 200 yards. Then, she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 2 * 40 = 80 yards. She does this 34 times, so the total distance for Kelly is 200 + (34 * 80) = 200 + 2720 = 2920 yards.

To find out who the winner is, we compare the distances. Blake runs 3000 yards, and Kelly runs 2920 yards. Blake is the winner.

To find out how much farther the winner runs than the loser, we subtract the loser's distance from the winner's distance: 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

The final answer is: 80"

"To find the number of tadpoles Finn can see in the pond now, we need to subtract the number of tadpoles that hid from the number of tadpoles that came out of hiding.

Initially, Finn saw 11 tadpoles. 
6 tadpoles came out of hiding, so the total number of tadpoles he can see is 11 + 6 = 17.
Then, 2 tadpoles hid under a rock, so we need to subtract 2 from 17. 
17 - 2 = 15

The final answer is: 15"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the depth of the water on Tuesday and then find two-thirds of that depth.

On Monday, the tank had a depth of 17 feet. On Tuesday, it had 7 feet more water, so the depth on Tuesday is 17 + 7 = 24 feet.

To find the depth on Wednesday, we need to calculate two-thirds of the depth on Tuesday. Two-thirds of 24 is calculated as (2/3) * 24 = (2 * 24) / 3 = 48 / 3 = 16.

The final answer is: 16"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of fish caught by each person and then add them together.

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. 

Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.

Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.

Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Now, let's add up the total number of fish caught by each person:

Anakin's total: 10 (starfish) + 6 (sea horses) + 3 (clownfish) = 19 fish
Locsin's total: 5 (starfish) + 3 (sea horses) + 5 (clownfish) = 13 fish

The total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin is 19 + 13 = 32.

The final answer is: 32"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the price increase every two months and add it to the original price. 

The original price of the bag of marbles is $20. 

After 2 months, the price increases by 20% of $20, which is 0.20 * $20 = $4. 
The new price after 2 months is $20 + $4 = $24.

After 4 months, the price increases by 20% of $24, which is 0.20 * $24 = $4.80.
The new price after 4 months is $24 + $4.80 = $28.80.

After 6 months, the price increases by 20% of $28.80, which is 0.20 * $28.80 = $5.76.
The new price after 6 months is $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56.

After 8 months, the price increases by 20% of $34.56, which is 0.20 * $34.56 = $6.912.
The new price after 8 months is $34.56 + $6.912 = $41.472.

"To find the total worth of all the toys, we need to calculate the cost of each type of toy and then add them together.

The doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and since an action figure costs $5, the doll costs 3 * $5 = $15.

One red car costs $4, and there are 5 red cars, so the total cost of the red cars is 5 * $4 = $20.

The total cost of the action figures is 3 * $5 = $15.

Now, we add the cost of the doll, the red cars, and the action figures together: $15 (doll) + $20 (red cars) + $15 (action figures) = $50.

The total worth of all the toys is $50.

The final answer is: $50"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the difference in income between the two options. If Jackie does her taxes herself, she'll lose $35/hour in missed income for 3 hours, resulting in a loss of $35 * 3 = $105. 

If she hires the accountant, she'll have to pay $90, but she won't lose any income. 

The difference in income between the two options is $105 (lost income) - $90 (accountant's fee) = $15. 

So, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we need to calculate the total number of eggs required for 15 Spanish flans and divide it by the number of eggs she receives per babysitting session.

Each Spanish flan requires 3 eggs, so for 15 flans, the total number of eggs needed is:
15 * 3 = 45 eggs

Since Sandra receives 9 eggs per babysitting session, we need to divide the total number of eggs required by the number of eggs she receives per session:
45 eggs / 9 eggs per session = 5 sessions

Therefore, Sandra needs to babysit 5 times to have enough eggs for 15 Spanish flans.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Let's denote Brooke's current age as B and Seth's current age as S. We know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write an equation:

S = 2B

We are also given that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. This means that in 2 years, Seth's age will be S + 2 and Brooke's age will be B + 2. The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write another equation:

S + 2 + B + 2 = 28

Combine like terms:

S + B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

S + B = 24

Now we can substitute the first equation (S = 2B) into this equation:

2B + B = 24

Combine like terms:

3B = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B into the first equation (S = 2B):

S = 2(8)
S = 16

The final answer is: 16"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much money Jimmy has in relation to Ethel's amount. 

Since Ethel has $8, we can calculate Jimmy's money by doubling Ethel's amount and then adding $2.

"To find the total miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to calculate the miles he walks on weekdays and weekends separately and then add them together.

Pancho walks 20 miles a day from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days. So, the total miles he walks on weekdays is 20 * 5 = 100 miles.

On weekends, he walks 10 miles a day for 2 days. So, the total miles he walks on weekends is 10 * 2 = 20 miles.

Now, we add the miles walked on weekdays and weekends to get the total miles walked in a week: 100 + 20 = 120 miles.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of the hat, jacket, and pants separately and then add them together.

The cost of the hat is given as $25.

The cost of the jacket is three times as much as the hat, so it is 3 * $25 = $75.

The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. To find the average, we add the costs of the hat and jacket and divide by 2. The average cost of the pants is ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50.

Now, we add the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants together to find the total cost of each uniform: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
2. Since Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.
4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we have the ages of three birds: Sally Four (8), Granny Red (16), and Sally Two (19). The only bird left is the Caboose, but it's not a bird, it's a train car. The question seems to be referring to the four birds, which are Sally Two, Sally Four, Granny Red, and Sally Thirtytwo.

"To find out how much Jessica pays in a year, we first need to calculate her monthly payments for each debt. 

For the student loans, 50% of the minimum payment is $300 * 0.5 = $150. So, the total payment for the student loans is $300 + $150 = $450.

For the credit card, 50% of the minimum payment is $200 * 0.5 = $100. So, the total payment for the credit card is $200 + $100 = $300.

For the mortgage, 50% of the minimum payment is $500 * 0.5 = $250. So, the total payment for the mortgage is $500 + $250 = $750.

Now, we add up the total monthly payments: $450 + $300 + $750 = $1500.

To find the total amount paid in a year, we multiply the monthly payment by 12: $1500 * 12 = $18,000.

"To find the total time it takes Billy to peel and cut all the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel one potato and multiply it by the total number of potatoes, and then add the time it takes to cut one potato multiplied by the total number of potatoes.

Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds = 5/60 minutes (converting seconds to minutes)

Total time to peel all potatoes: 60 potatoes * 1.5 minutes/potato = 90 minutes
Total time to cut all potatoes: 60 potatoes * (5/60) minutes/potato = 5 minutes

Adding both times together: 90 minutes + 5 minutes = 95 minutes

However, since the question asks for the total time to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to consider that peeling and cutting are sequential tasks. Therefore, we should add the time it takes to peel one potato and the time it takes to cut one potato, and then multiply by the total number of potatoes.

Time to peel and cut one potato: 1.5 minutes + 5/60 minutes = 1.5 + 0.0833 = 1.5833 minutes
Total time to peel and cut all potatoes: 60 potatoes * 1.5833 minutes/potato = 95 minutes

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much they made in total from selling lemonade and then subtract the cost of sugar to find the cost of lemons.

Let's start by finding the total revenue from selling lemonade. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. So, the revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10.

Since they made $25 in profit, and we know that profit is revenue minus cost, we can set up an equation to find the total revenue. Let's denote the number of gallons as 'g'. The total revenue is $10g. The cost of lemons and sugar per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5. The total cost is $5g. The profit is $25, so we can set up the equation:

$10g - $5g = $25

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$5g = $25

Dividing both sides by 5, we get:

g = 5

So, they made 5 gallons of lemonade.

Now, we know that the cost of lemons per gallon is $3. The total cost of lemons is $3 * 5 = $15.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations and calculate the remaining amount after each expense.

1. Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent: 
   1/4 of 6000 = 6000 * 1/4 = 1500
   Remaining amount after rent = 6000 - 1500 = 4500

2. He spends 1/3 on car fuel:
   1/3 of 4500 = 4500 * 1/3 = 1500
   Remaining amount after car fuel = 4500 - 1500 = 3000

3. He donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity:
   Half of 3000 = 3000 * 1/2 = 1500
   Remaining amount after donation = 3000 - 1500 = 1500

4. He gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$:
   Total given to family = 200 + 700 = 900
   Remaining amount after giving to family = 1500 - 900 = 600

Therefore, Zaid will have 600 dollars left after all these expenses and donations.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of crabs each person has. 

Since Bo has 40 crabs, and Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, we can calculate Monic's crabs as follows:
Monic's crabs = Bo's crabs - 4
Monic's crabs = 40 - 4
Monic's crabs = 36

Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so we can calculate Rani's crabs as follows:
Rani's crabs = Monic's crabs + 10
Rani's crabs = 36 + 10
Rani's crabs = 46

Now, we can calculate the total number of crabs the three have together by adding the number of crabs each person has:
Total crabs = Bo's crabs + Monic's crabs + Rani's crabs
Total crabs = 40 + 36 + 46
Total crabs = 122

"To find out how much Lloyd earned in the first two weeks, we need to calculate his earnings for each week and then add them together.

For the first week, Lloyd tutored 5 hours at $10 per hour, so his earnings for the first week are:
5 hours * $10/hour = $50

For the second week, Lloyd tutored 8 hours at $10 per hour, so his earnings for the second week are:
8 hours * $10/hour = $80

Now, we add his earnings for the first and second weeks together:
$50 + $80 = $130

Therefore, Lloyd earned $130 for the first two weeks.

"To find the number of votes the loser got, we first need to find the total number of votes the winner got. Since the winner got 3/4 of the votes, we can calculate this as follows:

Total votes = 80
Winner's votes = 3/4 * Total votes
Winner's votes = 3/4 * 80
Winner's votes = 60

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser got can be found by subtracting the winner's votes from the total votes:

Loser's votes = Total votes - Winner's votes
Loser's votes = 80 - 60
Loser's votes = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. According to the problem, Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, so the number of red roses is 4x.

It's also mentioned that Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations. This means the number of white carnations (x) is 200 / 5 = 40.

Now that we know the number of white carnations (x) is 40, we can find the number of red roses, which is 4x = 4 * 40 = 160.

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

The final answer is: 160"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jean is two years older than Mark.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age.
3. Jan is 30 years old.

From point 3, we know Jan's current age is 30. 

Two years ago, Jan's age would have been 30 - 2 = 28.

From point 2, we know that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. Half of Jan's age two years ago would be 28 / 2 = 14. 

So, two years ago, Mark's age would have been 14 + 5 = 19.

Since Mark's age two years ago was 19, his current age would be 19 + 2 = 21.

From point 1, we know Jean is two years older than Mark. Therefore, Jean's current age would be 21 + 2 = 23.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total time for each team, we need to calculate the time for each runner and add them together.

The well-rounded team's total time is 4 x 55 seconds = 220 seconds.

The less well-rounded team's first runner runs 60 seconds. The second runner is 3 seconds faster, so they run 60 - 3 = 57 seconds. The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so they run 57 - 3 = 54 seconds. The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so they run 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

The less well-rounded team's total time is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 162 seconds.

The difference in time between the two teams is 220 - 162 = 58 seconds.

The faster team will win by 58 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, and then find the difference between these two probabilities.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die is the probability of rolling a 4, 5, or 6. There are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, 6) out of 6 possible outcomes, so the probability is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5 or 50%.

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5, since there are 3 even numbers (2, 4, 6) out of 6 possible outcomes. Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 = 0.25 or 25%.

To find the difference in probability, we subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3: 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 or 25%.

The final answer is: 25"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of apples Jenna picked. Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, and her mom got 20 apples, we can calculate Jenna's share by dividing her mom's total by 2.

Jenna's apples = 20 / 2
Jenna's apples = 10

Now, to find the total number of apples they both picked, we need to add Jenna's apples to her mom's apples.

Total apples = Jenna's apples + her mom's apples
Total apples = 10 + 20
Total apples = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of small rodents (rats and hamsters) and the total number of straw pieces distributed among them. 

Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as 'r'. Since there are 3 cages of rats, the total number of rats is 3r. 

The total number of hamsters is 10. 

The total number of straw pieces distributed among the small rodents is 160. Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw and each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw.

"To calculate the total amount Mandy should pay, we need to calculate the interest for 3 months and add it to the initial amount.

The monthly interest rate is 2%, which as a decimal is 0.02. 

The interest for the first month is $100 * 0.02 = $2.
The interest for the second month is $102 * 0.02 = $2.04.
The interest for the third month is $104.04 * 0.02 = $2.0808.

The total interest is $2 + $2.04 + $2.0808 = $6.1208.

The total amount Mandy should pay is the initial amount plus the total interest: $100 + $6.1208 = $106.1208.

Rounding to two decimal places, the total amount Mandy should pay is $106.12.

The final answer is: $106.12"
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total cost incurred by the trader and then find the total revenue. 

Let's denote the number of bags as 'x'. 

The total cost incurred by the trader is the cost of buying the bags plus the cost of transportation. The cost of buying the bags is $20x, and the cost of transportation is $2x. So, the total cost is 20x + 2x = 22x.

The total revenue is the selling price of each bag multiplied by the number of bags, which is 30x.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is given as $400. So, we can set up the equation:

30x - 22x = 400

Combine like terms:

8x = 400

Now, divide both sides by 8:

x = 400 / 8
x = 50

The trader sold 50 bags.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets, food, and rides, and then divide it by 3 to find out how much each friend paid.

First, let's find the cost of the food. The cost of the tickets is $20.25, and they spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. So, the cost of the food is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.

The cost of the rides is 2 rides * $33 per ride = $66.

Now, let's add up the total cost: $20.25 (tickets) + $15.75 (food) + $66 (rides) = $102.

Since they agreed to split the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3: $102 / 3 = $34.

"To find the total number of peaches John collects, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends collecting peaches and then multiply it by the number of peaches he collects per minute.

John collects peaches for 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 3 hours by 60 minutes per hour to get the total minutes:

3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Now, we know John collects 2 peaches per minute. To find the total number of peaches, we multiply the total minutes by the number of peaches per minute:

180 minutes * 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches

"To find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ducks needs per day, we first need to calculate the total pounds of insects needed per week for the entire flock. 

Since each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week, and there are ten ducks, the total pounds of insects needed per week is 3.5 pounds/duck * 10 ducks = 35 pounds/week.

To find out how many pounds of insects the flock needs per day, we need to divide the total pounds of insects needed per week by 7 (the number of days in a week). 

35 pounds/week / 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net change in the number of trees Tom has each year. 

Tom plants 10 trees a year and chops down 2 trees a year, so the net change is 10 - 2 = 8 trees per year.

Since Tom starts with 50 trees, we need to calculate the total number of trees after 10 years. 

In 10 years, the net change is 8 trees/year * 10 years = 80 trees.

So, the total number of trees after 10 years is 50 (initial trees) + 80 (net change) = 130 trees.

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find the number of trees that die, we multiply 130 by 0.3 (which is 30% as a decimal).

Number of trees that die = 130 * 0.3 = 39 trees.

Now, we subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees after 10 years to find the final number of trees.

Number of trees left = 130 - 39 = 91 trees.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos on Sue's front yard.

On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. They painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back out on Sue's front yard. So, now there are 6 white flamingos and 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos.

On Sunday morning, the neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection. Now, there are 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos.

The total number of flamingos on Sue's front yard is 30 pink + 6 white = 36 flamingos.

To find out how many more pink plastic flamingos were out than white plastic flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

"To find the cost of a pen, we need to add the cost of a pencil and an eraser, since a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined. 

Cost of a pencil = $1.20
Cost of an eraser = $0.30
Cost of a pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser = $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50

"To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we first need to calculate the total pounds of carrots that will be used by the restaurants. 

Each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants. 

Total pounds of carrots used = Number of restaurants * Pounds per restaurant
Total pounds of carrots used = 40 * 2
Total pounds of carrots used = 80 pounds

Now, we subtract the total pounds of carrots used from the total pounds of carrots available to find out how many pounds will not be used.

Pounds of carrots not used = Total pounds of carrots - Total pounds of carrots used
Pounds of carrots not used = 200 - 80
Pounds of carrots not used = 120

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Elaine had 20 Pokemon cards.

In the first month, she collected three times the number of cards she initially had: 3 * 20 = 60 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month: 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months: (60 + 40) * 2 = 200 cards.

Now, let's add up the total number of cards Elaine has: 20 (initial cards) + 60 (first month) + 40 (second month) + 200 (third month) = 320 cards.

The final answer is: 320"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Mark edits 1000 sentences each week.
2. He edits an equal number of sentences for two publishers, so he edits 1000 / 2 = 500 sentences for each publisher.
3. Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence, so the total amount he earns from Publisher A is 500 * 5 = 2500 cents.
4. Publisher B pays him twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays 2 * 5 = 10 cents per sentence.
5. The total amount he earns from Publisher B is 500 * 10 = 5000 cents.
6. To find the total amount Mark makes in a week, we add the amounts from both publishers: 2500 + 5000 = 7500 cents.

"To find the total amount of water Baldur gets every day, we need to calculate the total number of pails he gets in a day and then multiply it by the amount of water in each pail.

Baldur gets 5 pails of water every morning and 6 pails of water every afternoon. So, the total number of pails he gets in a day is 5 + 6 = 11 pails.

Since each pail contains 5 liters of water, the total amount of water he gets every day is 11 pails * 5 liters/pail = 55 liters.

"To calculate John's total earnings for the year, we need to consider both the one-time monetary reward and the 5% raise in salary.

First, let's calculate the total amount John earns from his regular salary for the year. Since he makes $2000 per week and works every week of the year (52 weeks), his total earnings from his regular salary would be:

2000 * 52 = 104,000

Now, let's calculate the 5% raise in salary. A 5% raise on his current salary of $2000 would be:

2000 * 0.05 = 100

So, his new salary would be:

2000 + 100 = 2100

Now, let's calculate his total earnings for the year with the new salary:

2100 * 52 = 109,200

In addition to this, he also received a one-time monetary reward of $5000.

Therefore, his total earnings for the year would be:

109,200 + 5000 = 114,200

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of slices of cheese Carl used for his sandwiches, omelets, and macaroni and cheese.

For the sandwiches, Carl ate 7 days' worth of sandwiches (since he ate one every day for a week) and used 2 slices per sandwich. So, the total number of slices used for sandwiches is 7 * 2 = 14.

For the omelets, Carl ate 3 days' worth of omelets and used one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 3 slices per omelet. So, the total number of slices used for omelets is 3 * 3 = 9.

For the macaroni and cheese, Carl used 8 slices.

To find the total number of slices used, we add the slices used for sandwiches, omelets, and macaroni and cheese: 14 + 9 + 8 = 31.

The final answer is: 31"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of pens Janet had initially and then add the number of pens she bought.

Initially, Janet had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, so the total number of pens she had was 22 + 10 = 32.

She bought 6 bags of blue pens, with 9 pens in each bag, so the total number of blue pens she bought is 6 x 9 = 54.

She also bought 2 bags of red pens, with 6 pens in each bag, so the total number of red pens she bought is 2 x 6 = 12.

Now, let's add the number of pens she bought to the initial number of pens she had: 32 (initial pens) + 54 (blue pens) + 12 (red pens) = 98.

However, we also need to consider the green and yellow pens she already had. The problem doesn't mention her buying any green or yellow pens, so we can assume she still has the same number of green and yellow pens. Therefore, the total number of pens Janet has now is 98 + 22 (green pens) + 10 (yellow pens) = 130.

The final answer is: 130"
"To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we first need to find the total score she needs for the semester. Since there are six tests and she wants an average of 93, we multiply the desired average by the number of tests: 93 * 6 = 558.

Since Brinley can remove the lowest score, we need to find the lowest score among the five tests she has taken so far. The scores are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. The lowest score is 71.

Now, we subtract the lowest score from the total score needed: 558 - 71 = 487.

The sum of the scores of the first five tests is 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 338. To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we subtract the sum of the first five tests from the total score needed: 487 - 338 = 149.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance covered by Michael in two different scenarios and then add them together.

Scenario 1: Michael rode the bike 5 times a week for 4 weeks, covering 25 kilometers each time.

Distance covered in 1 week = 5 * 25 = 125 kilometers
Distance covered in 4 weeks = 125 * 4 = 500 kilometers

Scenario 2: Michael rode the bike 2 times a week for 3 weeks, covering 60 kilometers each time.

Distance covered in 1 week = 2 * 60 = 120 kilometers
Distance covered in 3 weeks = 120 * 3 = 360 kilometers

Total distance covered = Distance covered in Scenario 1 + Distance covered in Scenario 2
Total distance covered = 500 + 360
Total distance covered = 860 kilometers

"To find the total weight of the bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the weight of the chocolate bars. Since there are 25 chocolate bars and each weighs 40g, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
25 * 40g = 1000g

Next, let's find the weight of the candied apples. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, the weight of each candied apple is:
40g / 2 = 20g

Now, let's find the total weight of the candied apples:
80 * 20g = 1600g

Finally, let's add the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag of candy:

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since each plate costs $6000, half a dozen plates would cost 6 * $6000 = $36,000.

We are also given that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, the total cost of twenty dozen cups is $36,000 - $1200 = $34,800.

Since twenty dozen cups is equivalent to 240 cups, we can find the cost of each cup by dividing the total cost by the number of cups: $34,800 / 240 = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy and the total amount of money she has earned so far. 

The total cost of the items is the cost of the jacket plus the cost of 2 pairs of shoes: 
$30 (jacket) + 2 * $20 (shoes) = $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved before she started babysitting. She earns $5 each time she babysits the kids, so the total amount she has earned from babysitting is:
$5 * number of times she babysits.

Let's denote the number of times she babysits as 'x'. Then, the total amount she has earned from babysitting is $5x.

She also earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. Let's denote the number of times she mows the lawn as 'y'. Then, the total amount she has earned from mowing the lawn is $4y.

The total amount of money she has is the sum of the money she already had, the money she earned from babysitting, and the money she earned from mowing the lawn:
$10 (initial savings) + $5x (babysitting) + $4y (mowing the lawn).

Since she wants to buy the jacket and shoes, the total amount of money she has must be greater than or equal to the total cost of the items:
$10 + $5x + $4y ≥ $70.

We want to find the minimum number of times she must mow the lawn, so we want to find the smallest value of 'y' that satisfies the inequality. To do this, we can first subtract $10 from both sides of the inequality:
$5x + $4y ≥ $60.

Since we want to find the minimum value of 'y', we can try to find the smallest value of 'x' that satisfies the inequality. We know that $5x must be less than or equal to $60 - $4y. 

However, we are trying to find the minimum 'y', so we will try to find the maximum 'x' that satisfies the inequality. We can do this by setting $5x = $60 - $4y and solving for 'x':
$5x = $60 - $4y
x = ($60 - $4y) / $5
x = 12 - 0.8y

Since 'x' must be a whole number (you can't babysit a fraction of a time), we can try different values of 'y' to find the smallest value that makes 'x' a whole number.

If y = 5, then x = 12 - 0.8(5) = 12 - 4 = 8, which is a whole number.

If y = 6, then x = 12 - 0.8(6) = 12 - 4.8 = 7.2, which is not a whole number.

If y = 7, then x = 12 - 0.8(7) = 12 - 5.6 = 6.4, which is not a whole number.

If y = 8, then x = 12 - 0.8(8) = 12 - 6.4 = 5.6, which is not a whole number.

If y = 9, then x = 12 - 0.8(9) = 12 - 7.2 = 4.8, which is not a whole number.

If y = 10, then x = 12 - 0.8(10) = 12 - 8 = 4, which is a whole number.

Since 'x' is a whole number when y = 5 or y = 10, we can try these values to see which one gives the smallest value of 'y'. 

If y = 5, then x = 8, and the total amount of money she has is:
$10 + $5(8) + $4(5) = $10 + $40 + $20 = $70.

If y = 10, then x = 4, and the total amount of money she has is:
$10 + $5(4) + $4(10) = $10 + $20 + $40 = $70.

Both values of 'y' give the same total amount of money, so we can choose either one. However, we want to find the minimum number of times she must mow the lawn, so we choose the smaller value of 'y', which is 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of red chickens as 'r' and the number of white chickens as 'w'. We know that w = r + 2, since Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens.

We also know that the total number of eggs collected is 42. Since each red chicken produces 3 eggs and each white chicken produces 5 eggs, we can set up the following equation:

3r + 5w = 42

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens. 

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total time Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park and then divide it by his walking speed.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

l = 6 miles
w = 1.5 miles

P = 2(l + w)
= 2(6 + 1.5)

Since Gary walks at 3 miles/hour, the time he spends walking is given by:
Time = Distance / Speed

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. On the first day, Sloane counts 100 customers.
2. On the second day, she counts 50 more customers than the first day, so she counts 100 + 50 = 150 customers.
3. The total number of customers by the third day is 500.
4. To find the number of customers on the third day, we need to subtract the total number of customers on the first two days from the total number of customers by the third day. 
   Total customers by the third day = Customers on the first day + Customers on the second day + Customers on the third day
   500 = 100 + 150 + Customers on the third day
   Customers on the third day = 500 - 250
   Customers on the third day = 250

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as 'x' gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the initial amount of water in the big pool is 2x gallons.

Since both pools leak at 4 gallons/minute, the rate of water loss for both pools is the same. 

Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as 's' gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as 'b' gallons.

We know that the difference in the amount of water between the two pools is 4 times the initial difference. This can be expressed as:

b - s = 4(x - x/2)

Since both pools leak at the same rate, the difference in the amount of water between the two pools is the same as the difference in the amount of water leaked from each pool. The amount of water leaked from each pool is 4 minutes * 4 gallons/minute = 16 gallons. 

So, the difference in the amount of water between the two pools is 16 gallons. This can be expressed as:

b - s = 16

We also know that the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool now. This can be expressed as:

b = 4s

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for s:

4s - s = 16
3s = 16
s = 16/3

The current amount of water in the small pool is 16/3 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5.33}$"
"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn, which is the sum of the cost of the shoes and the belt. 

Total cost = Cost of shoes + Cost of belt

Total cost = $352.00

Since Lori earns $8.00 per hour, we can divide the total cost by her hourly wage to find out how many hours she needs to work.

Hours worked = Total cost / Hourly wage
Hours worked = $352.00 / $8.00
Hours worked = 44 hours

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the current ages of Adrian and Zack. 

Since Harriet is 21 years old, and she is half the age of Zack, Zack's age is twice Harriet's age. 
Zack's age = 2 * Harriet's age = 2 * 21 = 42 years.

Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, so Adrian's age = 3 * Harriet's age = 3 * 21 = 63 years.

In three years, their ages will be:
- Harriet's age in three years = 21 + 3 = 24 years
- Zack's age in three years = 42 + 3 = 45 years
- Adrian's age in three years = 63 + 3 = 66 years

To find the average age of the three in three years, we need to add their ages and divide by 3.
Average age = (24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45 years.

"To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we need to first calculate the total number of cards James has after losing 8 water type and buying 14 grass type.

Initially, James has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards. 

After losing 8 water type cards, he has:
- 30 (fire type) + 20 (grass type) + (40 - 8) (water type) = 30 + 20 + 32 = 82 cards

After buying 14 grass type cards, he has:

"To solve this problem, we need to find the combined rate at which Kalinda and her mom can add pieces to the puzzle, and then divide the total number of pieces by this rate.

Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute. Her mom can add half as many pieces per minute, which is 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute.

The combined rate is 4 (Kalinda's rate) + 2 (her mom's rate) = 6 pieces per minute.

Since there are 360 pieces in the puzzle, we need to divide 360 by the combined rate of 6 pieces per minute to find the time it will take to complete the puzzle in minutes.

360 / 6 = 60 minutes

1. Total cost of the cars: 12 cars * $20,000 per car = $240,000
2. Tax on the cars: 10% of $240,000 = 0.10 * $240,000 = $24,000
3. Registration fees: 12 cars * $1000 per car = $12,000

Now, we add the total cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees to find the total cost.

Total cost = $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000

The final answer is: $276,000"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many shells Kylie collected on Monday. We know that Robert collected 20 shells on Monday, and Kylie collected 5 more than Robert. 

So, Kylie collected 20 + 5 = 25 shells on Monday.

On Tuesday, Kylie collected 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. To find out how many shells Kylie collected on Tuesday, we need to multiply the number of shells she collected on Monday by 2.

25 * 2 = 50

Therefore, Kylie collected 50 shells on Tuesday.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total number of insects in the garden, we first need to determine the number of bugs. Since Dax found half as many bugs as ants, and there were 50 ants, we can calculate the number of bugs as follows:

Number of bugs = Number of ants / 2
Number of bugs = 50 / 2
Number of bugs = 25

Now, to find the total number of insects in the garden, we add the number of ants and bugs:

Total number of insects = Number of ants + Number of bugs
Total number of insects = 50 + 25
Total number of insects = 75

The final answer is: 75"
"To find the number of penguins left sunbathing, we need to determine how many penguins are not in the ocean or the cave. 

First, let's find out how many penguins jump in the ocean. One-third of 36 is 36 / 3 = 12 penguins. 

Next, let's find out how many penguins go inside the cave. One-third of 36 is 36 / 3 = 12 penguins.

Now, we need to find the total number of penguins that are either in the ocean or the cave. This is 12 (ocean) + 12 (cave) = 24 penguins.

To find the number of penguins left sunbathing, we subtract the number of penguins in the ocean and the cave from the total number of penguins. This is 36 (total) - 24 (ocean and cave) = 12 penguins.

The final answer is: 12"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many tomatoes Steve eats in a week and then divide that number by the number of tomatoes a vine can produce per week.

Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, he eats 6 * 7 = 42 tomatoes per week.

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats half as much as Steve, which is 42 / 2 = 21 tomatoes per week.

The total number of tomatoes they eat per week is 42 (Steve) + 21 (girlfriend) = 63 tomatoes per week.

Since each vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week, the number of vines needed is 63 / 3 = 21 vines.

The final answer is: 21"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of slices required and then divide that by the number of slices per pizza.

First, let's calculate the total number of slices needed: 
20 friends * 4 slices per friend = 80 slices

Since pizzas are sold in 8 slices, we need to divide the total number of slices by 8 to find out how many pizzas John needs to order:
80 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 10 pizzas

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the process of how Ram is using the pens. He starts with 25 pens and uses them to make new pens. Each time he uses 5 empty pens to make 1 new pen, he effectively reduces the total number of pens by 4 (since 5 pens are used to make 1 new pen).

Let's break it down:

1. Initially, Ram has 25 pens.
2. He uses 5 pens to make 1 new pen, so he has 25 - 4 = 21 pens left.
3. He uses 5 pens to make 1 new pen, so he has 21 - 4 = 17 pens left.
4. He uses 5 pens to make 1 new pen, so he has 17 - 4 = 13 pens left.
5. He uses 5 pens to make 1 new pen, so he has 13 - 4 = 9 pens left.
6. He uses 5 pens to make 1 new pen, so he has 9 - 4 = 5 pens left.
7. He uses 5 pens to make 1 new pen, so he has 5 - 4 = 1 pen left.

After the 6th cycle, Ram has 1 pen left. However, he can still use the remaining 5 empty pens to make 1 new pen, so he will have 1 + 1 = 2 pens.

Therefore, the total number of pens Ram gets to have is 2."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps of the scenario. 

First, Johnny starts with his allowance of $20 and adds an extra $10 to it. This means he now has a total of $20 + $10 = $30.

Next, he invests this sum of money, which triples in a year. This means the $30 he invested becomes 3 times its original value. 

To find the new value, we multiply the original amount by 3: $30 * 3 = $90.

Therefore, after a year, Johnny has $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the sum of the ages of the three girls, we need to determine the ages of Mary and Joan first.

Since Jessa is 20 years old, and Joan is five years older than Jessa, we can calculate Joan's age by adding 5 to Jessa's age: 20 + 5 = 25.

Mary is two years younger than Joan, so we can calculate Mary's age by subtracting 2 from Joan's age: 25 - 2 = 23.

Now that we have the ages of all three girls, we can find the sum of their ages by adding their individual ages together: 20 (Jessa) + 25 (Joan) + 23 (Mary) = 68.

The final answer is: 68"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Initially, there are 1000 students in the hall.

First, 30% of the students went out through exit A. 
30% of 1000 is 0.3 * 1000 = 300 students.

Now, there are 1000 - 300 = 700 students remaining in the hall.

3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B. 
3/5 of 700 is (3/5) * 700 = 420 students.

Now, there are 700 - 420 = 280 students remaining in the hall.

The rest of the students went out through exit C, which is 280 students.

The final answer is: 280"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of candies Robert has. Since John has twice as many candies as Robert and John has 54 candies, we can set up the equation:

2x = 54, where x is the number of candies Robert has.

To find x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 54 / 2
x = 27

Now that we know Robert has 27 candies, we can find out how many candies James has. James has 6 more candies than Robert, so:

James' candies = Robert's candies + 6
James' candies = 27 + 6
James' candies = 33

Now that we know James has 33 candies and John has 54 candies, we can find out how many more candies John has than James:

Difference = John's candies - James' candies
Difference = 54 - 33
Difference = 21

The final answer is: 21"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Dolly has 2 books and Pandora has 1 book. 

Dolly will read her own 2 books and Pandora's 1 book, so Dolly will read a total of 3 books.

Pandora will read her own 1 book and Dolly's 2 books, so Pandora will read a total of 3 books.

In total, they will read 3 (Dolly's total) + 3 (Pandora's total) = 6 books.

However, we need to consider that they also read each other's books. This means that Dolly will read Pandora's book and Pandora will read Dolly's book, but this is already included in the count of 6 books.

Therefore, the total number of books they will collectively read by the end is 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how many hours Mike spends writing a week, we need to calculate the total number of letters he writes and then multiply it by the time it takes him to write one page.

First, let's find out how many letters Mike writes in a week. He has 3 pen pals left, and each of them sends 2 letters a week. So, the total number of letters he receives is 3 * 2 = 6 letters. Since he responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters.

Each letter is 5 pages long, so the total number of pages he writes in a week is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

Since Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time he spends writing a week is 30 pages * 6 minutes/page = 180 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). So, 180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours.

Therefore, Mike spends 3 hours writing a week. 

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many minutes Jason has left, we need to calculate the total minutes he used for his daily calls and the extra minutes, and then subtract that from his total plan minutes.

First, let's calculate the total minutes Jason used for his daily calls: 
15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes

Next, let's add the extra minutes he used: 
450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes

Now, let's subtract the total minutes used from his total plan minutes: 
1000 minutes - 750 minutes = 250 minutes

Jason has 250 minutes left."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Griffin had 24 fries.

Kyle took 5 fries from Griffin. So, Griffin was left with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.

Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, which means Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Now, Griffin is left with 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

Ginger gave Griffin some fries, and then Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had taken. Since Kyle took 5 fries, Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries.

After Colby took 2 fries, Griffin was left with 9 - 2 = 7 fries. However, we know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. This means that Ginger gave Griffin 27 - 7 = 20 fries.

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as x. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28.

According to the problem, this difference is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums, so we can set up the equation:

28 = 2(2x)

To solve for x, we can start by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

14 = 2x

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2 again to isolate x:

7 = x

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the total hours worked. The makeup artist works 6 hours a day, 4 times a week, for 5 weeks. 

Total hours worked per week = 6 hours/day * 4 days/week = 24 hours/week
Total hours worked in 5 weeks = 24 hours/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours

The makeup artist charges $250 per hour. 

Total cost before discount = 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000

After the movie is done, the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount. 

Discount amount = 10% of $30,000 = 0.1 * $30,000 = $3,000

Total amount Jean paid = Total cost before discount - Discount amount
= $30,000 - $3,000
= $27,000

The final answer is: $27,000"
"To find out how much each person paid, we need to first calculate the total cost of the party supplies. 

Total cost = cost of ingredients + cost of presents + cost of decorations + cost of invitations + cost of goodie bags
Total cost = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22
Total cost = $96

Since Isabelle split the cost evenly with her two parents, there are 3 people in total. 

To find out how much each person paid, we divide the total cost by 3.

Amount each person paid = Total cost / 3
Amount each person paid = $96 / 3
Amount each person paid = $32

The final answer is: $32"
"To find out how much the chef spent, we need to calculate the total weight of the onions and then multiply it by the cost per pound.

The chef bought 4 bags of onions, each weighing 50 pounds. So, the total weight of onions is:
4 bags * 50 pounds/bag = 200 pounds

Since a pound of onions costs $1.50, the total cost is:
200 pounds * $1.50/pound = $300

The chef spent $300."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cookies Sue ate on both days and then calculate the total calories she consumed. 

On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 5 cookies, so Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday.

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 13 cookies, so Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.

Total cookies eaten by Sue = 20 (Monday) + 26 (Tuesday) = 46 cookies.

Her sister ate 5 + 13 = 18 cookies in total.

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, Sue consumed 46 * 200 = 9200 calories and her sister consumed 18 * 200 = 3600 calories.

The difference in calories consumed by Sue and her sister is 9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories.

The final answer is: 5600"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of girls in the school and then determine the number of boys. 

Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, and there are 3 classes with 20 students each, the total number of students in the school is 3 * 20 = 60.

Given that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls, the total number of girls in the school is 15 + 12 = 27.

Since the school is 50% girls, the number of boys is also 50% of the total number of students, which is 60. So, the number of boys is 60 * 0.5 = 30.

Now, we know that the total number of students in the school is 60, and the total number of girls is 27. Therefore, the number of boys in the school is 60 - 27 = 33.

Since the third class has 20 students, and we want to find the number of boys in the third class, we need to find out how many boys are in the first two classes. The first class has 20 - 15 = 5 boys, and the second class has 20 - 12 = 8 boys. 

The total number of boys in the first two classes is 5 + 8 = 13. 

To find the number of boys in the third class, we subtract the total number of boys in the first two classes from the total number of boys in the school: 30 - 13 = 17.

The final number of apps on Travis's tablet is 70."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars. 

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's represent the number of cougars killed today as 'x'. Then, the number of wolves killed today is 3x.

We also know that Rick killed three fewer cougars today than the previous night. So, the number of cougars killed today is 15 - 3 = 12.

Since we know the number of cougars killed today is 12, we can set up the equation 3x = 12 to find the number of wolves killed today. Solving for x, we get x = 4. 

However, we already know that the number of cougars killed today is 12, so we don't need to use x. 

Now, we can find the total number of animals killed by adding the number of animals killed last night and the number of animals killed today. 

Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars, for a total of 25 animals. Today, Rick killed 12 cougars and 3x wolves, but we already know that 3x = 12, so the number of wolves killed today is 12. 

The total number of animals killed today is 12 cougars + 12 wolves = 24 animals.

The total number of animals killed is 25 (last night) + 24 (today) = 49.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many times Anne went down the slide and then multiply that by 4 to find out how many times Robert went down the slide.

First, we know that Mitchel went down the slide 30 times. Anne went down 30% less than Mitchel. To find 30% of 30, we multiply 30 by 0.3 (which is the decimal form of 30%). 

30 * 0.3 = 9

So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Now, we know that Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. To find out how many times Robert went down the slide, we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4.

21 * 4 = 84

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we first need to determine the total number of cows Mr. Sylas has after buying 40 cows. 

Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, so the total number of cows is 10 * 20 = 200.

Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows, so the total number of cows becomes 200 + 40 = 240.

Since he divides the 40 new cows equally among the 10 stalls, each stall gets 40 / 10 = 4 new cows.

Now, each stall has 20 (initial cows) + 4 (new cows) = 24 cows.

To find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows in one stall by 8: 24 * 8 = 192.

"To find the total amount of money Brady has in his piggy bank, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and bill, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the value of each type of coin:
- 100 pennies = 100 x $0.01 = $1.00
- 40 nickels = 40 x $0.05 = $2.00
- 20 dimes = 20 x $0.10 = $2.00

Next, let's calculate the value of the dollar bills:
- 40 dollar bills = 40 x $1.00 = $40.00

Now, let's add the values together:
$1.00 (pennies) + $2.00 (nickels) + $2.00 (dimes) + $40.00 (dollar bills) = $45.00

The final answer is: $45.00"
"To find the total weight of the redwood tree, we first need to calculate the total number of 10-foot sections. Since the tree is 200 feet tall, we divide 200 by 10 to get the number of sections.

200 / 10 = 20 sections

Each section weighs 400 pounds, so we multiply the number of sections by the weight per section to get the total weight.

20 sections * 400 pounds/section = 8000 pounds

However, termites ate 30% of the wood, so we need to calculate 30% of 8000 pounds and subtract it from the total weight.

30% of 8000 pounds = 0.3 * 8000 = 2400 pounds

Now, we subtract 2400 pounds from the total weight to get the final weight of the redwood tree.

8000 - 2400 = 5600 pounds

"To find the total amount Nancy has to pay, we need to calculate the total cost of the overdue books and add the flat fee.

The cost of the overdue books is $0.50 per book, and she has 8 books. So, the total cost of the overdue books is 8 * $0.50 = $4.00.

In addition to the cost of the overdue books, there is a flat fee of $2.00 for having at least one book that's over a week overdue. 

The total amount Nancy has to pay is the sum of the cost of the overdue books and the flat fee: $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of apples Andrea has as A, the number of bananas Andrea has as B, and the number of bananas Jamal has as J.

We know that Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, so we can write an equation: A = J + 8.

We also know that Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so we can write another equation: B = J/2.

We are also given that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so we can write a third equation: J = A + 4.

Since we know that Andrea has 52 apples, we can substitute this value into the first equation: 52 = J + 8.

Now, we can solve for J: J = 52 - 8 = 44.

Now that we know J, we can find B: B = J/2 = 44/2 = 22.

Now that we know J and B, we can find A: A = J - 4 = 44 - 4 = 40.

However, the question asks for the total number of fruits, which is the sum of the number of apples and bananas that Andrea and Jamal have. 

Andrea has 52 apples and 22 bananas, so the total number of fruits Andrea has is 52 + 22 = 74.

Jamal has 44 bananas and 40 apples, so the total number of fruits Jamal has is 44 + 40 = 84.

The total number of fruits is the sum of the total number of fruits Andrea has and the total number of fruits Jamal has: 74 + 84 = 158.

The final answer is: 158"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of cups of flour needed for each day and then add them together.

For today, Carla is making 36 cookies. Since two cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many dozens are in 36 cookies. 

36 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 3 dozen cookies

Since 2 cups of flour are needed for 1 dozen cookies, we multiply the number of dozens by 2 to find the total cups of flour needed for today:

3 dozen cookies * 2 cups per dozen = 6 cups of flour

For tomorrow, Carla is making 30 cookies. Again, we need to find out how many dozens are in 30 cookies:

30 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 2.5 dozen cookies

Since 2 cups of flour are needed for 1 dozen cookies, we multiply the number of dozens by 2 to find the total cups of flour needed for tomorrow:

2.5 dozen cookies * 2 cups per dozen = 5 cups of flour

Now, we add the total cups of flour needed for both days:

6 cups of flour (today) + 5 cups of flour (tomorrow) = 11 cups of flour

"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two-thirds of the pennies in the cup, we need to first calculate two-thirds of 9,300 pennies.

Two-thirds of 9,300 can be calculated as (2/3) * 9,300.

To find the dollar amount, we need to convert the number of pennies to dollars. Since there are 100 pennies in a dollar, we can divide the number of pennies by 100.

First, let's calculate two-thirds of 9,300:
(2/3) * 9,300 = 6,200

Now, let's convert the number of pennies to dollars:
6,200 / 100 = 62

So, the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two-thirds of the pennies in the cup is $62.

"To find the total price of the house, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and the transfer fee, and then add them to the selling price.

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, which is 0.05 x $350,000 = $17,500.

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price, which is 0.12 x $350,000 = $42,000.

The total price of the house is the sum of the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee: $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

To find out how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we subtract her budget from the total price: $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500.

"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to calculate the total amount he paid in fees and subtract it from the selling price, then subtract the remaining loan amount.

First, let's calculate the transfer fees: 3% of $400,000 = 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000.

Next, let's calculate the brokerage fee: 5% of $400,000 = 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000.

The total fees paid by Mr. Tan is the sum of the transfer fees and the brokerage fee: $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000.

Now, let's subtract the total fees from the selling price: $400,000 - $32,000 = $368,000.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. It takes 20 minutes for the oil to heat up to 300 degrees.
2. It then takes 40% longer for the oil to heat up to 400 degrees. 
   To find the additional time, we need to calculate 40% of 20 minutes and add it to 20 minutes.
   40% of 20 minutes = 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes
   So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat up to 400 degrees.
3. After warming the oil, it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil.
   Since it took 28 minutes to warm up the oil, it will take 28 - 5 = 23 minutes to cook.

Now, let's add up the time it took to warm up the oil and the time it took to cook:
Time to warm up the oil: 28 minutes
Time to cook: 23 minutes
Total time = 28 + 23 = 51 minutes

The final answer is: 51"
"To find the total amount spent on newspaper ads, we multiply the cost of each newspaper ad by the number of newspaper ads: $5 * 50 = $250.

To find the total amount spent on television ads, we multiply the cost of each television ad by the number of television ads: $75 * 15 = $1125.

To find the total amount spent on all ads, we add the total amount spent on newspaper ads and the total amount spent on television ads: $250 + $1125 = $1375.

"To find the total number of M&Ms Mary got, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and then add them together.

The first bag has 300 M&Ms.

The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.

The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, let's add the number of M&Ms in each bag together: 300 + 312 + 150 = 762.

The final answer is: 762"
"To find the total number of windows, we need to calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows in each house.

Each house has 3 bedrooms, and each bedroom has 2 windows. So, the total number of windows in the bedrooms of one house is 3 * 2 = 6.

There are 4 additional windows in each house not connected to bedrooms.

So, the total number of windows in one house is 6 (from bedrooms) + 4 (additional) = 10.

Since John has 2 houses, the total number of windows is 10 * 2 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost of the items, we need to add the cost of the cocoa, laundry, and pasta. 

Total cost = $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35 = $14.00

Change = Amount paid - Total cost
Change = $20 - $14.00
Change = $6.00

The final answer is: $6.00"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
2. The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches the body takes, which is 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.
3. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.
4. The total number of stitches for the body, collar, and rosette is 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches.
5. Since the whole sweater is a 1800-stitch project, the remaining stitches for the sleeves are 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches.
6. Since there are two sleeves, we divide the remaining stitches by 2 to find the number of stitches each sleeve takes: 630 / 2 = 315 stitches.

The total cost of the seeds is $800 + $2400 = $3200.

The final numerical answer is: $3200"
"To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the lines for each scene and the song, and then add them together.

The solo song has 54 lines.

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. However, only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has (4/5) * 60 = 48 lines from the second scene.

To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

The final answer is: 138"
"To find the number of cards with the letter D, we need to calculate the number of cards that had the letters A, B, and C, and then subtract that from the total number of cards.

First, we find the number of cards with the letter A: 2/5 of 80 is (2/5) * 80 = 32.

Next, we find the number of cards with the letter B. The remaining cards after A are 80 - 32 = 48. 1/2 of 48 is (1/2) * 48 = 24.

Now, we find the number of cards with the letter C. The remaining cards after B are 48 - 24 = 24. 5/8 of 24 is (5/8) * 24 = 15.

The total number of cards with the letters A, B, and C is 32 + 24 + 15 = 71.

To find the number of cards with the letter D, we subtract the total number of cards with A, B, and C from the total number of cards: 80 - 71 = 9.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time it takes to dig the small holes and the total time it takes to dig the large holes, and then add those two times together.

First, let's calculate the total time to dig the small holes: 
3 minutes per hole * 30 holes = 90 minutes

Next, let's calculate the total time to dig the large holes: 
10 minutes per hole * 15 holes = 150 minutes

Now, let's add the two times together: 
90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 
240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the current ages of Mico and Marco. Let's denote Mico's age as M and Marco's age as m. We know that the sum of their ages is 20, so we can write the equation:

M + m = 20

Since we don't have any information about their individual ages, we can't determine their exact ages. However, we can express one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve for M:

M = 20 - m

Now, we need to find the sum of their ages in 10 years. In 10 years, Mico's age will be M + 10, and Marco's age will be m + 10. The sum of their ages in 10 years will be:

(M + 10) + (m + 10)

Substituting M = 20 - m into the equation, we get:

(20 - m + 10) + (m + 10)
= 30

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Ruby's current age as R and Sam's current age as S.

From the first statement, we know that Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, so we can write an equation:

R = 6S

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9, and Sam's age will be S + 9. According to the second statement, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can write another equation:

R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Now, let's simplify the second equation:

R + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtract 9 from both sides:

R = 3S + 18

Now we have two equations:

R = 6S
R = 3S + 18

Since both equations are equal to R, we can set them equal to each other:

6S = 3S + 18

Subtract 3S from both sides:

3S = 18

Divide both sides by 3:

S = 6

So, Sam is 6 years old now.

The final answer is: 6"

"To find the total number of spots on the cobras, we need to multiply the number of cobras by the number of spots per cobra. Since the cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, and the mamba has 70 / 2 = 35 spots, the cobra has 70 spots.

Total spots on cobras = 40 * 70 = 2800

To find the total number of spots on the mambas, we multiply the number of mambas by the number of spots per mamba.

Total spots on mambas = 60 * 35 = 2100

Now, we add the total spots on the cobras and mambas to find the combined total.

Total spots = 2800 + 2100 = 4900

Half the number of spots they all have combined is 4900 / 2 = 2450.

"To find out how many pizzas Maddy will need, we first need to calculate the total number of people attending the soccer game. There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, so the total number of people from the team and coaches is 12 + 3 = 15. Each team member brings 2 guests, so the total number of guests is 12 * 2 = 24. The total number of people attending the game is 15 (team and coaches) + 24 (guests) = 39.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, we need to divide the total number of people by 3 to find out how many pizzas are needed. 39 / 3 = 13. 

Now, we know that Maddy needs 13 pizzas. Each pizza costs $15, so the total cost will be 13 * 15 = $195.

"To find the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace, we first need to calculate the total space occupied by the topaz gemstones and the remaining space that will be filled by the sterling silver beads.

Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and there are 8 gemstones per necklace. So, the total space occupied by the gemstones is 8 inches.

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches. To find the remaining space for the sterling silver beads, we subtract the space occupied by the gemstones from the total length of the necklace:

25 inches (total length) - 8 inches (space occupied by gemstones) = 17 inches

Each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long. To find the number of beads that can fit in the remaining space, we divide the remaining space by the length of each bead:

17 inches / (1/4 inch) = 17 / 0.25 = 68

So, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

The final answer is: 68"
"To find the total number of stories written in the first week, we need to add the number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot. 

Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week.
Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week.
Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week.

Total stories in the first week = 20 + 40 + 60 = 120

In the second week, each of them doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week. 

Alani doubled her 20 stories, so she wrote 20 * 2 = 40 stories in the second week.
Braylen doubled his 40 stories, so he wrote 40 * 2 = 80 stories in the second week.
Margot doubled her 60 stories, so she wrote 60 * 2 = 120 stories in the second week.

Total stories in the second week = 40 + 80 + 120 = 240

To find the total number of stories written altogether, we need to add the total number of stories written in the first week and the second week.

Total stories altogether = 120 + 240 = 360

"To find the number of rows of 5-star, we first need to determine the total number of stars and then subtract the number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows.

The total number of stars in the 8-star rows is 3 * 8 = 24.
The total number of stars in the 6-star rows is 2 * 6 = 12.

The total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows is 24 + 12 = 36.

The total number of stars in the flag is 76.

The number of stars in the 5-star rows is 76 - 36 = 40.

Since each row has 5 stars, the number of rows of 5-star is 40 / 5 = 8.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the speed of the car in the slow lane. Since it's traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, we can calculate it as follows:

Speed of the car in the fast lane = 60 miles/hour
Speed of the car in the slow lane = 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour

Now, we know the distance covered by both cars is the same, which is 480 miles. We can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed to find the time taken by the car in the slow lane.

Time taken by the car in the slow lane = Distance / Speed
= 480 miles / 30 miles/hour
= 16 hours

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Ali has 22 medals.
2. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.
3. Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.
4. They have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting, which means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have together. Let's call the total number of medals given out 'x'. So, we can write the equation as x = 10 * 39.
5. To find the total number of medals given out, we multiply 10 by 39, which is 390.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of chocolate bars available. Since each packet contains 5 chocolate bars and there are 8 packets, the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

We know that each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, and there are 4 adults. So, the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 * 6 = 24.

Now, we need to find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children. This can be calculated by subtracting the number of chocolate bars given to adults from the total number of chocolate bars: 40 - 24 = 16.

Since there are 8 children, and the remaining chocolate bars are to be shared equally among them, we can find out how many chocolate bars each child will get by dividing the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children: 16 / 8 = 2.

Therefore, each child will get 2 chocolate bars.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Susan works and then multiply it by her hourly wage.

First, let's find the total time she works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total time.

Total time worked = 3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to convert the total time to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Now, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes:

150 minutes / 10 minutes/interval = 15 intervals

Since she earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by her earnings per interval:

15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

Therefore, Susan earns $75 for the online task.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the points each player has after the third round and then calculate the extra points they receive in the fourth round.

After the third round, Mike has 21 points. 
Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

In the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. 
Mike has 21 points, which is not over 20, so he gets 0 extra points.
Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so he gets 0 extra points.
Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so he gets 1 extra point.

Now, let's calculate the total points for each player after the fourth round:
Mike: 21 + 0 = 21
Jim: 18 + 0 = 18
Tony: 42 + 1 = 43

The total points for all three players is 21 + 18 + 43 = 82.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many oranges the sons will wash and then subtract that from the total number of oranges Will bought.

The oldest son is 8 years old, and the youngest son is half as old as the oldest, so the youngest son is 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

The sons will wash as many oranges as they are years old, so the oldest son will wash 8 oranges and the youngest son will wash 4 oranges. 

In total, the sons will wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we subtract the number of oranges washed from the total number of oranges: 15 - 12 = 3.

- 20 dumbbell presses

On the second day, he does:
- 20 more pushups than the first day, so 100 + 20 = 120 pushups
- 10 fewer squats than the first day, so 50 - 10 = 40 squats
- Doubles the number of dumbbell presses, so 20 * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses

Now, let's calculate the total count of each activity over the two days:
- Total pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Total squats: 50 + 40 = 90

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day and then divide the total amount of rice available by this daily consumption.

First, let's calculate the daily consumption of rice per person: 0.2 kg (per meal) * 3 meals (lunch and dinner) = 0.6 kg per person per day.

Since there are 5 members in the household who eat rice every lunch and dinner, the total daily consumption is: 0.6 kg/person * 5 people = 3 kg per day.

Now, let's convert the total amount of rice available from kilograms to grams: 42 kg * 1000 g/kg = 42,000 g.

To find out how many days the rice will last, we divide the total amount of rice available by the daily consumption: 42,000 g / 3000 g (3 kg) = 14 days.

Since we want to know how many weeks the rice will last, we need to convert the number of days to weeks: 14 days / 7 days per week = 2 weeks.

"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we first need to calculate the total number of crates he sold in the week. 

Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he sold bread for 5 days (Tuesday to Thursday and the weekend). 

He sold 20 crates over the weekend, 15 crates on Tuesday, 12 crates on Wednesday, and 18 crates on Thursday. 

Total crates sold = 20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65 crates.

Since Sam's target was 120 crates and he sold 65 crates, we need to find the difference between the target and the actual number of crates sold.

Difference = Target - Actual number of crates sold
Difference = 120 - 65
Difference = 55

"To calculate the total cost, we need to break it down into two parts: the cost of driving and the bonus.

First, let's calculate the total miles driven per year. Since John drives to work and back each day, the total miles driven per day is 2 * 30 = 60 miles. He drives 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year, so the total miles driven per year is 60 * 5 * 50 = 15,000 miles.

The cost of driving per year is the total miles driven per year multiplied by the cost per mile, which is $2. So, the cost of driving per year is 15,000 * $2 = $30,000.

John also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus per year is $150 * 12 = $1,800.

The total cost per year is the sum of the cost of driving and the bonus, which is $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. 

When folding a piece of paper to create a tabloid, we essentially create a single sheet with two sides (front and back) and two layers (left and right). 

In a standard 32-page tabloid, we have 32 pages. However, when folded, these pages are arranged in a way that each page is printed on both sides. 

Since each page is printed on both sides, we can consider each page as two separate pages. Therefore, we have 32 pages * 2 sides = 64 pages in total.

However, we also need to consider the fact that we are folding a single sheet of paper. When folded, the front and back sides of the paper are created, but the left and right sides are also created. 

In this case, we have two identical sides (front and back) and two identical sides (left and right). This means that we can use a single sheet of paper to create a tabloid with 32 pages.

Therefore, the number of pieces of paper required for a 32-page tabloid is 1.

"To find out how much money Annika has left, we need to calculate the amount she spent on food and snacks, and then subtract that from the initial amount she brought.

Annika spent half of $50 on food and snacks, which is 50 / 2 = $25.

She also spent an additional $10 on rides.

So, the total amount she spent is $25 (food and snacks) + $10 (rides) = $35.

Now, let's subtract the total amount she spent from the initial amount she brought: $50 - $35 = $15.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of books sold in the current year as x. Since Elise sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, the number of books sold in the first year is 2x.

We know that there are 50 unsold books left, and the total number of books is 250. So, the total number of books sold is 250 - 50 = 200.

We also know that the number of books sold in the current year is 45, so we can set up the equation: x + 2x = 200.

Combine like terms: 3x = 200.

Divide both sides by 3: x = 200 / 3 = 66.67 (round down to 66.67, but since we can't sell a fraction of a book, we'll round down to 66 books sold in the current year).

Now that we know the number of books sold in the current year, we can find the number of books sold in the first year: 2x = 2 * 66 = 132.

The total amount of money earned in the first year is 132 * 20 = 2640.

The total amount of money earned in the second year is 45 * 20 = 900.

"To calculate Watson's total earnings for April, we need to calculate his earnings from his hourly wage and his weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate his earnings from his hourly wage. Watson works 10 hours a day, 5 days a week, which is a total of 50 hours per week. Since there are 4 weeks in April, his total hours worked in April is 50 hours/week * 4 weeks = 200 hours.

His hourly wage is $10, so his total earnings from his hourly wage in April is 200 hours * $10/hour = $2000.

Next, let's calculate his earnings from his weekly bonus. He gets a $300 bonus each week, and since the company performed well for the whole month, he gets this bonus for all 4 weeks in April. His total earnings from his weekly bonus is $300/week * 4 weeks = $1200.

Now, let's add his earnings from his hourly wage and his weekly bonus to get his total earnings for April. $2000 + $1200 = $3200.

1. The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day.
2. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. 
   To find out how many loaves are sold in the morning, we need to calculate two-thirds of 60.
   Two-thirds of 60 = (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves.

3. Now, we need to find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales.
   Total loaves - loaves sold in the morning = 60 - 40 = 20 loaves.

4. Half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening.
   To find out how many loaves are sold in the afternoon, we need to calculate half of the remaining loaves.
   Half of 20 = 20 / 2 = 10 loaves.

So, 10 loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much weight Joey loses per week and then multiply that by the number of weeks it takes Sandy to lose the same amount of weight.

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. To find out how much weight Joey loses per week, we divide the total weight lost by the number of weeks:

8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, we multiply the weight lost per week by the number of weeks it takes Sandy:

2 pounds per week * 4 weeks = 8 pounds

However, the question asks how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, which is 8 pounds. Since Sandy loses 2 pounds per week, we can find the number of weeks it takes Sandy to lose 8 pounds by dividing the total weight by the weight lost per week:

8 pounds / 2 pounds per week = 4 weeks

So, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey loses in a single week.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total savings, we need to calculate the savings on the tubs of ice cream and the packets of milk separately and then add them together.

The original price of one tub of ice cream is $13, and it's now sold at $11. The discount is $13 - $11 = $2 per tub.

If you buy 2 tubs of ice cream, the total discount will be 2 * $2 = $4.

The original price of one packet of milk is not given, but we know that it was sold at a discount of $0.5. Let's assume the original price of one packet of milk is x. The discounted price will be x - $0.5.

Since you're buying 4 packets of milk, the total discount on milk will be 4 * ($x - $0.5).

However, we don't know the original price of the milk packet. To find the total savings, we need to know the original price of the milk packet. 

But, we can express the total savings as an equation: Total Savings = (2 * $2) + 4 * ($x - $0.5).

Since we don't have the value of x, we can't provide a numerical answer."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of new arms and legs grown by the person after 15 days.

The person grows an extra arm every 3 days. To find out how many arms they will grow in 15 days, we divide 15 by 3. 

15 / 3 = 5

So, the person will grow 5 extra arms.

The person grows an extra leg every 5 days. To find out how many legs they will grow in 15 days, we divide 15 by 5.

15 / 5 = 3

So, the person will grow 3 extra legs.

To find the total number of new limbs, we add the number of new arms and legs.

5 (new arms) + 3 (new legs) = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Theo buys 6 business suits at $100 each, so the total cost of the suits is 6 x $100 = $600.

2. He buys 3 suitcases at $50 each, so the total cost of the suitcases is 3 x $50 = $150.

3. The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. Since a business suit costs $100, 5 times that is 5 x $100 = $500. Adding $700 to this makes the flight ticket cost $500 + $700 = $1200.

4. So far, Theo has spent $600 on suits, $150 on suitcases, and $1200 on a flight ticket, for a total of $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950.

5. Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip, so he has $6000 - $2000 = $4000 left to spend.

6. Since he has already spent $1950, he has $4000 - $1950 = $2050 left to spend on gifts for his business partners.

The final answer is: $2050"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a day and then multiply it by 7 to get the total number of eggs consumed in a week.

First, let's find out how many people eat 3 eggs each day and how many people eat 2 eggs each day. 

There are 5 people in the family, and 3 people eat 3 eggs each day. So, the number of people eating 3 eggs each day is 3. The remaining people eat 2 eggs each day, which is 5 - 3 = 2 people.

Now, let's calculate the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a day:

- 3 people eat 3 eggs each, so they consume 3 * 3 = 9 eggs.
- 2 people eat 2 eggs each, so they consume 2 * 2 = 4 eggs.
- Total eggs consumed in a day = 9 + 4 = 13 eggs.

Now, let's multiply the total number of eggs consumed in a day by 7 to get the total number of eggs consumed in a week:

Total eggs consumed in a week = 13 * 7 = 91 eggs.

The final answer is: 91"
"To find Trent's age, we need to first determine Jane's age, and then add 5 to it. 

Since Quinn is 30 and Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, Jane's age can be calculated as 30 - 3 = 27.

Now, Trent is 5 years older than Jane, so Trent's age is 27 + 5 = 32.

The final answer is: 32"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. Let's denote Noah's current age as N. Since Cera is 46 years old, six years ago, Cera's age was 40. According to the problem, six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so we can write the equation: N - 6 = 0.5 * (40).

2. Solving the equation, we get N - 6 = 20, which means N = 26. So, Noah is currently 26 years old.

3. The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah, which is 3000 * 20 = 60,000.

4. Since the population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now, the current population of Chile is 2 * 60,000 = 120,000.

The final answer is: 120,000"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of players on the defense as D. 

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2D.

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is D/2.

We know that the total number of players on the team is 105. Therefore, the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams is equal to 105:

D + 2D + D/2 = 105

To simplify the equation, we can multiply all terms by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2D + 4D + D = 210

Combine like terms:

7D = 210

Now, divide both sides by 7:

D = 210 / 7
D = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total number of people invited, we first need to calculate the number of people from the 2 families with 6 people and the 3 families with 4 people.

For the 2 families with 6 people, the total number of people is 2 * 6 = 12.
For the 3 families with 4 people, the total number of people is 3 * 4 = 12.
The total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.

However, 8 people couldn't come due to illness. So, we subtract 8 from the total number of people invited: 24 - 8 = 16.

Then, 1/4 of the people who couldn't come had previous commitments. 1/4 of 8 is 2. So, we subtract 2 from the number of people who couldn't come due to illness: 8 - 2 = 6.

Now, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come due to illness and previous commitments from the total number of people invited: 24 - 6 = 18.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store, we need to calculate the total number of marbles first.

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and added them to a store that had 50. So, the total number of marbles in the store after buying from Johanna is 20 + 50 = 70.

His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna, his father gave him 2/5 * 20 = 8 marbles.

Now, the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store is 70 (initial marbles) + 20 (bought from Johanna) + 8 (given by his father) = 98 marbles.

Since each marble weighs 2kgs, the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store is 98 * 2 = 196 kgs.

The final answer is: 196"
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth of the pool. 

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 5
Volume = 120 cubic feet

Since it costs $0.1 per cubic foot to fill, we can multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot to find the total cost.

Total cost = Volume * cost per cubic foot
Total cost = 120 * 0.1
Total cost = 12

The final answer is: $12"
"To find the total number of children in the classroom, we need to calculate the number of girls, nongendered children, and then add them to the number of boys.

Given that there are 30 boys, and the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, the number of girls can be calculated as:
Girls = 3 * Boys = 3 * 30 = 90

The classroom has 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, so the number of nongendered children can be calculated as:
Nongendered children = (1/10) * Boys = (1/10) * 30 = 3

Now, we can find the total number of children by adding the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
Total children = Boys + Girls + Nongendered children = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123

The final answer is: 123"
"To solve this problem, we need to use the given ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This means that for every 1 electric pole, 3 electric wires are needed.

Let's denote the number of electric poles as 'x'. According to the given ratio, the number of electric wires will be 3x.

We are given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45. So, we can set up the equation:

3x = 45

To find the value of x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 45 / 3
x = 15

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required by the electric company to supply the electricity in the neighborhood is 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of people who left the party. We know that 1/4 of the total number of people left, and 22 men stayed. 

Let's denote the total number of people as 'T'. Since 1/4 of the people left, 3/4 of the people stayed. We can set up the equation:

3/4 * T = 22 + x, where x is the number of women who stayed.

We also know that the total number of people initially was 25 men + 15 women = 40 people.

So, T = 40.

Now, we can substitute T in the equation:

3/4 * 40 = 22 + x
30 = 22 + x
x = 8

This means 8 women stayed. Since there were 15 women initially, the number of women who left is 15 - 8 = 7.

The question asks for the number of women left, which is 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. The book costs $4.
2. The magazine costs half as much as the book. So, the magazine costs $4 / 2 = $2.
3. The pen costs $1 less than the magazine. So, the pen costs $2 - $1 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To find the total number of pencils Jam has, we know she has 3 boxes and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils. We can set up an equation to represent this: 3x + 2 = 26, where x is the number of pencils in each box.

To solve for x, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: 3x = 26 - 2, 3x = 24.

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 3 to find the value of x: x = 24 / 3, x = 8.

Now that we know each box has 8 pencils, we can find the total number of pencils Jam has: 3 boxes * 8 pencils per box = 24 pencils.

Since Jam has 24 pencils and her sister Meg has 46 pencils, the total number of pencils they have is 24 + 46 = 70 pencils.

To find the number of boxes needed to store all the pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils per box: 70 pencils / 8 pencils per box = 8.75 boxes.

Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we round up to the nearest whole number to ensure all pencils fit. Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

The final answer is: 9"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, let's calculate the number of ice cubes needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, so the number of ice cubes needed is 65 / 13 = 5.

Since each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, 5 ice cubes will make it 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters weaker.

Next, we need to consider the effect of adding 15 milliliters of cream. Since any added liquid weakens the coffee, this will make the coffee 15 milliliters weaker.

Now, we need to find the total weakening effect. The coffee is weakened by 60 milliliters due to the ice cubes and 15 milliliters due to the cream, so the total weakening effect is 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters.

The final answer is: 75"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the trade ratio. The given ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record. This means that for every 2 old records, 1 new record is obtained.

Since 5 people come in and leave with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of new records obtained as 7. However, we need to find the total number of old records brought in.

Let's use the trade ratio to find the number of old records. If 1 new record is obtained for 2 old records, then the total number of old records brought in must be twice the number of new records obtained.

So, the total number of old records brought in is 7 new records * 2 = 14 old records.

The final answer is: 14"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of junior programmers and the number of senior programmers. 

The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, which is 100. 
Number of junior programmers = (2/5) * 100 = 40

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers is the remaining 3/5 of the total number of employees.
Number of senior programmers = (3/5) * 100 = 60

The junior programmers are paid $2000 per month, so the total amount paid to junior programmers is:
Total amount paid to junior programmers = Number of junior programmers * Salary of junior programmers
= 40 * $2000
= $80000

Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so their salary is $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month.
The total amount paid to senior programmers is:
Total amount paid to senior programmers = Number of senior programmers * Salary of senior programmers
= 60 * $2400
= $144000

The total amount paid to all programmers is the sum of the total amount paid to junior programmers and senior programmers.
Total amount paid to all programmers = Total amount paid to junior programmers + Total amount paid to senior programmers
= $80000 + $144000
= $208000

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as 'x'.

Initially, there were x people on the bus.

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the total number of people became x + 5.

At the second bus stop, 7 people got down, so the total number of people became (x + 5) - 7 = x - 2.

Then, 8 more people got in, so the total number of people became (x - 2) + 8 = x + 6.

We are given that the total number of people heading to the third stop is 20, so we can set up the equation:

x + 6 = 20

To solve for x, we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:

x = 20 - 6
x = 14

Therefore, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 14.

"To find the time it takes to fully charge the phone, we need to first determine how many percentage points are left to charge. Since the phone is already at 60% charged, it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more to be fully charged.

Given that the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time it takes to charge the remaining 40% as follows:

Time = Total percentage points left / Rate of charge per minute
Time = 40 / (1/3)
Time = 40 * 3
Time = 120 minutes

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60:
Time = 120 / 60
Time = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's determine the rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip. They spent $80 and get $1 off for every $20 spent. 

$80 / $20 = 4, so they earned 4 rewards.

Now, let's calculate the rewards they used on this shopping trip. They spent $43 and used their rewards, and a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. 

Since they used their rewards, we need to subtract the rewards from the price. Let's assume the price before applying the rewards and coupon is x. 

x - 4 = 43 (since they used 4 rewards)

x = 47

Now, the coupon took twice the amount of rewards off the price, which is 2 * 4 = 8. 

So, the final price after applying the coupon is 47 - 8 = 39.

The customer paid $39 on this shopping trip.

"To determine which job pays more, we need to calculate the net income for each job.

For Job A:
- Gross income: $15/hour * 2000 hours/year = $30,000/year
- Total tax: 20% of $30,000 = 0.20 * $30,000 = $6,000
- Net income: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

For Job B:
- Gross income: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income before tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Total tax: 10% of $36,000 = 0.10 * $36,000 = $3,600
- Net income: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Since $32,400 is greater than $24,000, Job B pays more.

To find the difference in net pay between the two jobs, we subtract the net income of Job A from the net income of Job B:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

"To find the final value of Maria's shares, we need to calculate the value after the price increase and then the decrease.

Initially, Maria buys 8 shares for $8 each, so the total cost is 8 * 8 = $64.

The stock price increases by 50% in the first year. To find the new price, we multiply the original price by 1.5 (100% + 50% = 150%, or 1.5 as a decimal). 

New price = 8 * 1.5 = $12.

Now, the stock price decreases by 25% in the second year. To find the new price, we multiply the previous price by 0.75 (100% - 25% = 75%, or 0.75 as a decimal).

New price = 12 * 0.75 = $9.

The final value of Maria's shares is 8 * 9 = $72.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume the number of students in the two equal groups is x. Since the last group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the last group is x - 10.

We know that the total number of students in the class is 200. Since the two equal groups have x students each, and the last group has x - 10 students, we can set up the equation:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

2x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms again:

3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 70

Since x represents the number of students in each of the two equal groups, and the last group has x - 10 students, we can find the number of students in the last group by subtracting 10 from x:

x - 10 = 70 - 10
= 60

So, the number of students in the smallest group is 60.

60"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of chickens and cows on the farm. Let's denote the number of cows as C and the number of chickens as 2C, since Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows.

We know that the total number of animals is 60, so we can set up the equation:

C + 2C = 60

Combine like terms:

3C = 60

Divide both sides by 3:

C = 20

Now that we know there are 20 cows, we can find the number of chickens:

Number of chickens = 2C = 2(20) = 40

Since cows have 4 legs and chickens have 2 legs, we can calculate the total number of legs:

Total legs of cows = 20 * 4 = 80
Total legs of chickens = 40 * 2 = 80

Total legs of all animals = 80 + 80 = 160

"To find the total distance Tyson covered in June, we first need to calculate the new daily distance he needs to run based on his coach's advice. 

The coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters in a day. To find 1/5 of 5000 meters, we multiply 5000 by 1/5.

5000 * (1/5) = 1000

Now, we add this to the original 5000 meters to find the new daily distance.

5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters

Since Tyson runs 6000 meters every day, and there are 30 days in June, we multiply the daily distance by the number of days in June to find the total distance covered in June.

6000 * 30 = 180,000 meters

The final answer is: 180,000"
"To find the price difference between Juice Box C and Juice Box B, we first need to determine the prices of Juice Box B and Juice Box C.

Juice Box A is 4 dollars.
Juice Box B is 5 dollars more than Juice Box A, so Juice Box B is 4 + 5 = 9 dollars.
Juice Box C is 7 dollars more than Juice Box A, so Juice Box C is 4 + 7 = 11 dollars.

Now, we need to find the difference between Juice Box C and Juice Box B. 
The difference is 11 - 9 = 2 dollars.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the total number of legs from both types of tables and add them together.

The tables with 4 legs contribute 40 * 4 = 160 legs.
The tables with 3 legs contribute 50 * 3 = 150 legs.

Now, we add the total number of legs from both types of tables: 160 + 150 = 310.

The final answer is: 310"
"To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we need to calculate the total number of cookies consumed by her son and her husband, and then subtract that from the total number of cookies in a bag.

Jenny's son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, so he eats 4 * 5 = 20 cookies per week.

Jenny's husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so he eats 1 * 7 = 7 cookies per week.

The total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband is 20 + 7 = 27 cookies per week.

Since there are 36 cookies in a bag, and 27 are consumed by her son and husband, Jenny eats the remaining cookies. 

36 (total cookies) - 27 (cookies consumed by son and husband) = 9 cookies.

Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"To find the total cost of the shirts, we first need to calculate the discount amount. 

The original price of each shirt is $30. 
The discount percentage is 40%. 
To find the discount amount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage (as a decimal): 
$30 * 0.40 = $12 

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the original price to get the discounted price of one shirt: 
$30 - $12 = $18 

Since Davos bought 2 shirts, we multiply the discounted price of one shirt by 2: 
$18 * 2 = $36 

The final answer is: $36"
"To find the percentage increase in the amount of money the factory is making per day, we need to first calculate the difference in the amount of money they are making per day now and the amount they used to make.

The factory used to make $100 per tractor and sold 10 tractors a day, so they made $100 * 10 = $1000 per day.

Now, they make $220 per silo and sell 5 silos a day, so they make $220 * 5 = $1100 per day.

The difference in the amount of money they are making per day now and the amount they used to make is $1100 - $1000 = $100.

To find the percentage increase, we divide the difference by the original amount and multiply by 100:

($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%

So, the factory is making 10% more per day now.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how much Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to calculate the total monthly expenses and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's calculate the monthly expenses for food. Since food costs $25 per week and there are 4 weeks in a month, the monthly food cost is:
$25/week * 4 weeks/month = $100/month

Now, let's add the monthly costs of treats and medicine to the monthly food cost:
$100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine) = $220/month

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total annual expenses for Madeline's dog are:
$220/month * 12 months/year = $2640/year

The final answer is: $2640"
"To find the total time spent on after-work activities, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and add them up.

1. Yoga class on Monday: 1 hour
2. Cooking class on Tuesday: 3 times the yoga class, so 3 * 1 = 3 hours
3. Cheese-tasting event on Wednesday: 0.5 hours (half of 1 hour)
4. Museum tour on Thursday: Half as long as the cooking class, so 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours
5. Errands on Friday: 2 hours

Now, let's add up the time spent on each activity:
1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 7.5

The final answer is: 7.5"
"To find out how many plant pots April has left over, we first need to determine the total number of plant pots she needs for the school garden. 

For the daisies, she needs 30 plant pots. 
For the roses, she needs twice as many as the daisies, which is 2 * 30 = 60 plant pots.

The total number of plant pots needed is 30 (for daisies) + 60 (for roses) = 90 plant pots.

Since April had already bought 100 plant pots from the garden center, we subtract the total number of plant pots needed from the number she bought: 100 - 90 = 10 plant pots.

Therefore, April has 10 plant pots left over.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how much Andrea saved, we need to subtract the amount she spent from the initial amount she had. 

First, let's calculate the total amount she spent: 
- The cost of the sweater is $11.
- She gave her brother $4.
- Total amount spent = $11 + $4 = $15.

Now, let's subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount she had:
Initial amount = $36
Total amount spent = $15
Amount saved = Initial amount - Total amount spent
Amount saved = $36 - $15
Amount saved = $21

The final answer is: $21"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total time John spent on all activities. 

Let's start by finding the time John spent swimming. Since he spent half the time swimming as he did boating, and he spent 6 hours boating, he spent 6 / 2 = 3 hours swimming.

Next, let's find the total time John spent watching shows. He watched 3 shows, each 2 hours long, so he spent 3 * 2 = 6 hours watching shows.

We are given that watching shows was 30% of the total time. Let's represent the total time as 'T'. Then, 30% of T is 6 hours. We can write this as 0.3T = 6.

To find T, we can divide both sides by 0.3: T = 6 / 0.3 = 20.

Now that we know the total time, we can find the time John spent sightseeing. We are given that sightseeing was 40% of the total time. So, 40% of 20 is 0.4 * 20 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how much money Annabelle still needs to save, we need to calculate her total earnings from both jobs and subtract the amount she already has in her savings.

First, let's calculate her earnings from the first job:
20 hours * $10 per hour = $200

Next, let's calculate her earnings from the second job:
15 hours * $5 per hour = $75

Now, let's add her earnings from both jobs:
$200 + $75 = $275

Since she already has $80 in her savings, we need to subtract this from her total earnings to find out how much she still needs to save:
$275 - $80 = $195

Annabelle still needs to save $195."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. The shortest tree has a height of 6 feet.
2. The second tree has a height of 5 feet more than the shortest tree, so its height is 6 + 5 = 11 feet.
3. The height of the two trees combined is 6 + 11 = 17 feet.
4. The height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined, so its height is 2 * 17 = 34 feet.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find out how much money Dean has left, we need to calculate the total amount of money he spent and then add the extra $10 his mother gave him.

First, let's calculate the total amount Dean spent on toy cars: 6 toy cars * $2 per toy car = $12.

Next, let's calculate the total amount Dean spent on teddy bears: 5 teddy bears * $1 per teddy bear = $5.

Now, let's add the amount spent on toy cars and teddy bears: $12 + $5 = $17.

Dean initially had $28. After spending $17, he had $28 - $17 = $11 left.

His mother then gave him an extra $10, so we add that to the $11 he had left: $11 + $10 = $21.

Therefore, Dean has $21 left.

The final answer is: $21"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the activities and then subtract that from Morgan's budget to find out how much money is left for her friends. 

The cost of mini-golf for Morgan and her friends is $5 per round, and they want to play one round. So, the total cost for mini-golf is $5. 

The cost of the go-karts is $10 per ride, and they want to ride twice. So, the total cost for the go-karts is 2 * $10 = $20.

The total cost for the arcade tokens is $5.

The total cost for all activities is $5 (mini-golf) + $20 (go-karts) + $5 (arcade tokens) = $30.

Morgan's budget is $90, and the total cost for the activities is $30. So, the amount of money left for her friends is $90 - $30 = $60.

Since each friend will get $5, the number of friends she can invite is $60 / $5 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find out how much money Marisa saves in her piggy bank, we need to first calculate how much money she spends on lollipops each day and then subtract that from her daily pocket money.

Marisa buys 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each, so the total amount she spends on lollipops each day is:
4 lollipops * 25 cents/lollipop = 100 cents or $1

Since Marisa gets $5 as pocket money each day, the amount she saves each day is:
$5 - $1 = $4

Now, we need to find out how much she saves in 5 days:
$4/day * 5 days = $20

The final answer is: $20"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. First, let's find out how much change Billy has after buying the candy. Since he spent $1.5 per pound and he has $10, we can divide $10 by $1.5 to find out how many pounds of candy he bought. 

$10 / $1.5 = 6.67 pounds (round down to 6.67, but since you can't buy a fraction of a pound, we'll consider it as 6.67 pounds, but for the sake of calculation, we will use 6.67)

However, since we can't buy a fraction of a pound, we will use 6 pounds for the calculation.

2. Now, let's find out how much change Billy has after buying the candy. 

Change = $10 - (6 * $1.5) = $10 - $9 = $1

3. Since Billy takes half of his change and spends it on gumballs, he spends $1 / 2 = $0.5 on gumballs.

4. Now, let's find out how many gumballs he can buy with $0.5. 

Number of gumballs = $0.5 / $0.05 = 10

However, we are given that he bought 40 gumballs, not 10. This means our initial assumption of 6 pounds of candy is incorrect.

5. Let's recalculate the change Billy has after buying the candy. 

Change = $10 - (x * $1.5) = $1

x = $10 - $1 / $1.5
x = $9 / $1.5
x = 6

However, we know that he bought 40 gumballs with $0.5, so let's recalculate the change.

Change = $10 - (x * $1.5) = $1
$0.5 = (x * $1.5) - (40 * $0.05)
$0.5 = (x * $1.5) - $2
$2.5 = x * $1.5
x = $2.5 / $1.5
x = 1.67

Since we can't buy a fraction of a pound, we will round down to 1.67 to 1.67, but for the sake of calculation, we will use 1.67 pounds, but for the sake of calculation, we will use 1.67 pounds, but for the sake of calculation, we will use 1.67 pounds, but for the sake of calculation, we will use 1.67 pounds, but for the sake of calculation, we will use 1.67 pounds, but for the sake of

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote Carver's age as C and his son's age as S.

We are given that Carver is 45 years old, so C = 45.

We are also given that Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son. This can be written as an equation:

C = 2S - 5

Substituting the value of C, we get:

45 = 2S - 5

To solve for S, we need to isolate S on one side of the equation. We can do this by adding 5 to both sides:

45 + 5 = 2S - 5 + 5
50 = 2S

Next, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for S:

50 / 2 = 2S / 2
25 = S

Therefore, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance the train travels in one trip and then determine how many trips it takes to reach 18,000 miles. 

First, let's calculate the distance from the third city to the first city. The combined distance from the first city to the second city and the second city to the third city is 75 + 100 = 175 miles. The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than that, so it is 175 - 50 = 125 miles.

Now, let's calculate the total distance for one trip: 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train travels 3 times a day, the total distance it travels in a day is 3 * 300 = 900 miles.

To find out how many days it takes to reach 18,000 miles, we divide 18,000 by 900: 18,000 / 900 = 20.

"To find the amount of stuffing needed for the collie beds, we first need to find the average amount of stuffing between the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds. 

The average amount of stuffing for a collie bed is (8 + 2) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5 pounds.

Now, we need to find the total amount of stuffing needed for the chihuahua beds and the collie beds. 

For the chihuahua beds: 4 beds * 2 pounds per bed = 8 pounds.
For the collie beds: 3 beds * 5 pounds per bed = 15 pounds.

The total amount of stuffing needed is 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the trip to his friend's house and the trip back home.

For the trip to his friend's house:
Distance = 200 miles
Speed = 70 mph
Time = Distance / Speed = 200 / 70 = 2.86 hours (approximately)

However, he took a detour that added 10 miles to his trip. So, the actual distance traveled to his friend's house is 200 + 10 = 210 miles.
Time taken to travel 210 miles at 70 mph = 210 / 70 = 3 hours.

For the trip back home:
Distance = 240 miles
Speed = 80 mph
Time = Distance / Speed = 240 / 80 = 3 hours

Total time taken for the entire trip = Time taken to go to his friend's house + Time taken to come back home
Total time = 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours

"To find the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we first need to find the total number of students present on Friday. 

Total number of students = 96
Number of absent girls = 5
Number of absent boys = 4

Total absent students = 5 + 4 = 9

Total students present = Total number of students - Total absent students
Total students present = 96 - 9
Total students present = 87

We know that 43 out of the total 96 students are girls. To find the number of boys, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students.

Number of boys = Total number of students - Number of girls
Number of boys = 96 - 43
Number of boys = 53

Now, we need to find the number of boys who were present on Friday. We know that 4 boys were absent. 

Number of boys present = Number of boys - Number of absent boys
Number of boys present = 53 - 4
Number of boys present = 49

The final answer is: 49"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of boys in the park and then add it to the number of girls. 

Since there are twice the number of boys as girls, and there are 6 girls, we can calculate the number of boys by multiplying the number of girls by 2.

Number of boys = 2 * Number of girls
Number of boys = 2 * 6
Number of boys = 12

Now, we can find the total number of kids in the park by adding the number of boys and girls.

Total number of kids = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total number of kids = 12 + 6
Total number of kids = 18

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as M, the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting as S, and the number of customers kicked out for physical violence as V.

We are given that M = 3.

We are also given that the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting (S) equals four times the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks minus 5. So, S = 4M - 5 = 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7.

We are also given that the number of customers kicked out for physical violence (V) is three times the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting. So, V = 3S = 3(7) = 21.

We are given that a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart. The total number of people kicked out is the sum of the people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence. So, M + S + V = 50.

Substituting the values we found earlier, we get 3 + 7 + 21 = 31. However, this is not equal to 50, so there must be people kicked out for other reasons.

Let's denote the number of people kicked out for other reasons as O. Then, M + S + V + O = 50. We already know that M + S + V = 31, so 31 + O = 50.

To find O, we subtract 31 from both sides of the equation: O = 50 - 31 = 19.

The final answer is: 19"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many points Erin has after scoring 14 points. Since Erin now has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship.

Let x be the number of points Erin had before scoring 14 points. After scoring 14 points, Erin's total points will be x + 14.

We know that Erin now has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8. This can be represented as:

x + 14 = 3(8)

To solve for x, we can multiply 3 by 8:

x + 14 = 24

Next, we can subtract 14 from both sides of the equation to isolate x:

x = 24 - 14
x = 10

So, Erin had 10 points before scoring 14 points.

The final answer is: 10"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to break down the expenses into different categories.

First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames. Each picture frame costs $20, and the etching costs an additional 20% of the frame's cost. 

20% of $20 is 0.20 * $20 = $4. 
So, the total cost of each picture frame is $20 + $4 = $24.

Since there are 44 seniors, the total cost of the picture frames is 44 * $24 = $1056.

Next, 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each. The total cost of the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the cords for the officers. 1/4 of the seniors are officers, which is 44 / 4 = 11 officers.

The cost of the cords for the officers is 11 * $12 = $132.

The total cost of the senior gifts is the sum of the costs of the picture frames, pins, and cords: $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

The final numerical answer is: $1198"
"To find the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we first need to calculate the materials cost. Since Ethan saved 20% by making it himself, we can assume that the materials cost is 80% of the original price.

Original price of the hand-painted wallpaper = $400
Savings percentage = 20%
Materials cost percentage = 100% - 20% = 80%

Materials cost = Original price * Materials cost percentage
= $400 * 0.8
= $320

The total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper is the materials cost.

The final answer is: $320"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes they sold on Friday, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the amount they did on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

Now, let's add up the total number of pairs sold: 14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 14 (Sunday) = 56 pairs.

However, we need to subtract the 6 pairs that were returned because they didn't fit. So, the total number of shoes sold by the end of the sale is 56 - 6 = 50 pairs.

Since each pair has 2 shoes, the total number of shoes sold is 50 * 2 = 100.

"To find the total amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we first need to find the value of the faulty equipment and subtract it from the total amount spent.

The total amount spent on equipment is $400,000. 
40% of the equipment was faulty. 
To find the value of the faulty equipment, we multiply the total amount by 0.4 (which is 40% expressed as a decimal).

Value of faulty equipment = $400,000 * 0.4
Value of faulty equipment = $160,000

Now, we subtract the value of the faulty equipment from the total amount spent to find the value of the functioning equipment.

Value of functioning equipment = Total amount spent - Value of faulty equipment
Value of functioning equipment = $400,000 - $160,000
Value of functioning equipment = $240,000

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of milk Mary collects from the two groups of sheep.

First, let's find out how many sheep are in each group. Since Mary has 30 sheep and half of them produce 1 kg of milk each day, we can divide 30 by 2 to get the number of sheep in each group.

30 / 2 = 15

So, there are 15 sheep in each group.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of milk from each group. The first group produces 1 kg of milk per sheep, so 15 sheep will produce 15 kg of milk. The second group produces 2 kg of milk per sheep, so 15 sheep will produce 15 x 2 = 30 kg of milk.

Now, let's add the milk from both groups to get the total amount of milk Mary collects every day.

15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many apples Lucy picked on Monday, and then add the apples picked on Tuesday and Wednesday.

Let's start with Monday. We know that Lucy sold all the apples picked on Monday for $56 at $4 per piece. To find out how many apples she picked, we can divide the total amount earned by the price per apple:

$56 ÷ $4 = 14 apples

So, Lucy picked 14 apples on Monday.

On Tuesday, she picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she did the previous day, which is 2 * 12 = 24 apples.

Now, let's add the apples picked over the three days:

"To find out how many socks Lindsay has washed, we need to calculate the total number of socks she has washed. 

She washed 10 pairs of socks, and since each pair consists of 2 socks, she washed 10 * 2 = 20 socks from the pairs. 

Additionally, she washed 15 loose socks. 

So, the total number of socks she has washed is 20 (from pairs) + 15 (loose socks) = 35 socks.

Since there are 50 socks that need washing in total, we can find out how many socks Lindsay has missed by subtracting the number of socks she has washed from the total number of socks that need washing: 50 - 35 = 15.

"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total interest she has to pay and then divide it by the number of months.

First, let's calculate the total interest:

Interest = Principal * Rate * Time
Principal = $3,650
Rate = 10% or 0.10
Time = 5 months

Interest = $3,650 * 0.10 * 5
Interest = $1,825

Now, let's calculate the total amount Karan has to pay, which is the principal plus the interest:

Total Amount = Principal + Interest
Total Amount = $3,650 + $1,825
Total Amount = $5,475

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month for 5 months, we can divide the total amount by the number of months:

Monthly Payment = Total Amount / Number of Months
Monthly Payment = $5,475 / 5
Monthly Payment = $1,095

"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to calculate the total number of pesos each of them has and then add them together.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. 

Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos. 
Anna also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pesos each of them has:
Axel's total: 50 (silver) + 80 (gold) = 130 pesos
Anna's total: 100 (silver) + 120 (gold) = 220 pesos

"To find the total profit per hour, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost.

First, let's find the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make with the supplies she bought. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups and she bought enough supplies to make 3 pitchers, she can make 3 * 12 = 36 cups of lemonade.

Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue will be the number of cups sold multiplied by the price per cup. However, we need to know how many hours she operates the stand to find the total revenue. Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, and she has 36 cups, she will sell all of the lemonade in 36 / 4 = 9 hours.

The total revenue will be 36 cups * $1 per cup = $36.

Now, let's find the total cost. Millie spent $18 to buy the supplies.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. So, the profit per hour will be the total profit divided by the number of hours she operates the stand. The total profit is $36 - $18 = $18. The number of hours is 9.

Profit per hour = Total profit / Number of hours = $18 / 9 = $2.

We can set up the equation as follows:

2/5 * x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 5/2 to isolate x:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land initially.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how many female members are in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are girls, we can calculate this as follows:
   Number of girls = Total members * 0.5
   Number of girls = 52 * 0.5
   Number of girls = 26

2. Since half the people performing can't make it to the show, we need to find out how many people were initially performing. Let's call this number 'x'. We know that half of the female members were performing, so we can set up the equation:
   x / 2 = Number of girls
   x / 2 = 26
   x = 26 * 2
   x = 52

3. However, this is the number of people who were supposed to perform, not the actual number who performed. Since half of them couldn't make it, we need to find out how many actually performed:
   Actual number of performers = x / 2
   Actual number of performers = 52 / 2
   Actual number of performers = 26

4. The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them. So, we need to add the number of teachers to the actual number of performers:
   Total number of people who sang = Actual number of performers + Number of teachers
   Total number of people who sang = 26 + 3
   Total number of people who sang = 29

"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to calculate the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu and add it to the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson.

First, let's find the number of messages James delivers to Mr. Yu. Since he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can multiply the number of messages to Ms. Thompson by 1/3.

Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * Messages to Ms. Thompson
Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * 66
Messages to Mr. Yu = 22

Now, we can add the number of messages to Mr. Yu and Ms. Thompson to find the total number of messages James delivers.

Total messages = Messages to Ms. Thompson + Messages to Mr. Yu
Total messages = 66 + 22
Total messages = 88

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying ride tickets for 9 rides. Each ride costs 2 tickets at $2 per ticket, so the cost of one ride is 2 * $2 = $4. For 9 rides, the total cost would be 9 * $4 = $36.

Since David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides, he doesn't need to buy any additional tickets. Dasha, on the other hand, needs to buy 9 tickets at $4 each, which costs her 9 * $4 = $36.

The total cost for Dasha is $36, and the total cost for David is $30. To find out how much money David saves, we subtract the cost of David's ride bracelet from Dasha's total cost: $36 - $30 = $6.

Therefore, David saves $6.

"To find the total cost of the streaming services, we need to calculate the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus. 

The normal cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 each, so together they cost $20. However, Tim saves 20% by bundling, which means he pays 80% of the total cost. 

To find 80% of $20, we multiply $20 by 0.8. 

$20 * 0.8 = $16

So, the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $16. 

Now, we add the cost of Netflix to this, which is $10. 

$16 + $10 = $26

Since Tim was paying $60 for the cable package, we subtract the cost of the streaming services from this to find the savings. 

$60 - $26 = $34

Therefore, Tim saves $34 by cancelling his cable package and getting streaming services.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Erica made 20 Valentine's cards.

Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards, each containing 15 cards. So, the total number of pre-made cards is 2 * 15 = 30.

Now, Erica has a total of 20 (initial cards) + 30 (pre-made cards) = 50 cards.

She passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 to her family, so the total number of cards she gave away is 24 + 5 = 29.

After giving away 29 cards, Erica has 50 - 29 = 21 cards left.

Then, she received 17 cards from family and friends. So, the total number of cards Erica now has is 21 + 17 = 38.

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can calculate the total number of days he works in a year as follows:

24 days/month * 12 months/year = 288 days/year

Now, we can calculate his annual earnings by multiplying the number of days he works in a year by his daily wage:

288 days/year * $50/day = $14,400/year

The final answer is: $14,400"
"To determine the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of flour and milk required for the quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. Since Mark is making a quadruple batch, he will need 4 times the amount of each ingredient. 

For flour: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups
For milk: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark will need to buy:
12 cups / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags of flour

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so Mark will need to buy:
4 cups / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles of milk

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour:
6 bags of flour - 2 bottles of milk = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the energy consumption of the air conditioner per day. 

The air conditioner uses 900 watts of energy per hour. Since there are 8 hours of usage per day, the total energy consumption per day is:

900 watts/hour * 8 hours/day = 7200 watts/day

Since 1 kilowatt (kW) is equal to 1000 watts, we can convert the energy consumption to kilowatts:

7200 watts/day / 1000 = 7.2 kW/day

If Mel reduces the usage time by 5 hours, the new usage time is:

8 hours/day - 5 hours/day = 3 hours/day

The new energy consumption per day is:

900 watts/hour * 3 hours/day = 2700 watts/day

Converting this to kilowatts:

2700 watts/day / 1000 = 2.7 kW/day

The energy saved per day is the difference between the original and new energy consumption:

7.2 kW/day - 2.7 kW/day = 4.5 kW/day

To find the total energy saved in 30 days, we multiply the daily energy saved by 30:

4.5 kW/day * 30 days = 135 kW

The final answer is: 135"
"To find the average number of stripes, we first need to calculate the total number of stripes and then divide it by the total number of zebras.

There are two zebras with 17 stripes each, so that's 2 * 17 = 34 stripes.
There's a zebra with 36 stripes.
There's another zebra with half the number of stripes as the third zebra, which is 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.

The total number of stripes is 34 + 36 + 18 = 88.
The total number of zebras is 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.

To find the average, we divide the total number of stripes by the total number of zebras: 88 / 4 = 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To determine the total cost of the meat and cheese, we first need to calculate the total number of sandwiches required to serve 20 people. Since each sandwich serves 4 people, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each sandwich serves:

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, we need a total of 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

The cost of the meat is $7.00 per pound, so the total cost of the meat is:
5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00

The cost of the cheese is $3.00 per pound, so the total cost of the cheese is:
5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

The total cost of the meat and cheese is the sum of the cost of the meat and the cost of the cheese:
$35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

The final answer is: $50.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that Allan initially has 40 cannolis. Since there are twice as many corns as cannolis, he initially has 2 * 40 = 80 corns.

Allan then bought 60 more cannolis and 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. Since he bought 60 cannolis, he now has 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis.

The number of corns he bought is 40 fewer than the number of cannolis, so he bought 60 - 40 = 20 corns.

Now, Allan has 80 (initial corns) + 20 (new corns) = 100 corns.

The total number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 100 (cannolis) + 100 (corns) = 200.

The final answer is: 200"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Elliott wants to walk 10,000 steps a day. He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. Half of 10,000 is 5,000 steps. 

So, he has completed 5,000 steps. 

He also did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. 

Now, he has completed 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

He realized that after he had finished his jog, he only had 2,000 steps left to take. This means that the number of steps he took during his jog is the difference between the total steps he needs to take (10,000) and the steps he has already taken (6,000).

So, the number of steps he took during his jog is 10,000 - 6,000 = 4,000.

The final answer is: 4000"
"To determine how many minutes early Toby will be, we need to calculate the total time it takes for him to read the book and travel to the airport.

First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book: 
45 pages * 200 words per page = 9000 words

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Toby to read the book:
9000 words / 300 words per minute = 30 minutes

Now, let's add the time it takes to get to the airport:
30 minutes (reading time) + 10 minutes (travel time) = 40 minutes

Since Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to leave, we subtract the total time from the available time:
60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes

Toby will be 20 minutes early."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to first determine the number of employees who remained after June and their total hours worked.

In May, the company hired 40 employees. In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 1/4 of 40 is 10 employees. So, the number of employees remaining in June is 40 - 10 = 30.

Since each employee worked 40 hours per week, the total hours worked by each employee in May is 40 hours/week * 4 weeks = 160 hours. The total hours worked by each employee in June is also 160 hours.

The total hours worked by all employees in May is 40 employees * 160 hours/employee = 6400 hours. The total hours worked by all employees in June is 30 employees * 160 hours/employee = 4800 hours.

The total amount paid to employees in May is 6400 hours * $15/hour = $96,000. The total amount paid to employees in June is 4800 hours * $15/hour = $72,000.

The total amount paid to employees in the two months is $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000.

The final answer is: $168,000."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Sally bought 2 pounds of taffy. The first pound costs $3, and the second pound is 1/2 off, which means it costs $3 - $1.50 = $1.50. So, the total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

2. The cost of the mixed bag of seashells is $1.50.

3. The cost of the 4 magnets is 4 x $0.25 = $1.

4. Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items: $4.50 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1 (magnets) = $7.

5. Sally started with $10, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from the initial amount: $10 - $7 = $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To find the total amount spent by Tim, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks and the finale firework separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the two packs of fireworks. The first pack costs $400, and the second pack costs twice that much, which is 2 * $400 = $800. The total cost of the two packs is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Since Tim gets a 20% discount on the two packs of fireworks, we need to calculate the discount amount. The discount amount is 20% of $1200, which is 0.2 * $1200 = $240.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost of the two packs to get the final cost of the fireworks: $1200 - $240 = $960.

The finale firework costs $150. 

Now, we add the cost of the fireworks and the finale firework to get the total amount spent by Tim: $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To determine the number of dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we need to calculate the total number of cookies she will need for 30 days and then divide that by the number of cookies her recipe makes.

Shannon eats 2 cookies per night, so for 30 days, she will need 2 * 30 = 60 cookies.

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies she needs (60) by the number of cookies per dozen (12).

60 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 5 dozen cookies

So, Shannon will need to make 5 dozen cookies to have enough for 30 days. 

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. 

First, let's find the number of candles that smell like wet dog. 5% of 50,000 candles smell like wet dog, so the number of candles that smell like wet dog is 0.05 * 50,000 = 2500.

However, the problem states that these candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode. This means that 1% of the candles that smell like wet dog will explode. So, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is 0.01 * 2500 = 25.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we first need to find the price of one discounted blouse. Since the blouses are 30% off, the discount amount is 30% of the regular price.

30% of $20 = 0.3 * $20 = $6

So, the discounted price of one blouse is $20 - $6 = $14.

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses is 4 * $14 = $56.

The final answer is: $56"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathered from the tallest trees as T, from the average trees as A, and from the shortest trees as S. 

We know that Joanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees, so T = 30. 

We also know that she gathered half this amount from the shortest trees, so S = 30 / 2 = 15.

We are given that her sister gathered twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so her sister gathered 2T apples from the tallest trees. Since they gathered a combined total of 500 apples, we can write the equation: T + 2T + A + S + 0 (since her sister didn't gather any from the average trees) = 500.

We can simplify this equation to 3T + A + S = 500.

We know that T = 30 and S = 15, so we can substitute these values into the equation: 3(30) + A + 15 = 500.

This simplifies to 90 + A + 15 = 500.

Combine the constants: 105 + A = 500.

Subtract 105 from both sides: A = 395.

The final answer is: 395"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D.

We know that the total number of heads is 180, and since each animal has one head, we can write the equation:

C + D = 180

We also know that the total number of bumps is 304, and since camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump, we can write the equation:

2C + D = 304

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve for C and D by subtracting the first equation from the second equation:

(2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know C, we can substitute it into the first equation to solve for D:

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

Therefore, there are 56 dromedaries in the herd.

The final answer is: 56"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

First, let's calculate the distance Tom traveled in the first 4 days. Since he traveled 200 kilometers every day, the total distance for the first 4 days is:
200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

Next, let's calculate the distance Tom traveled over the next two days. He traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days, which is:
30% of 800 km = 0.3 * 800 km = 240 km

So, the total distance traveled over the first 6 days is:
800 km + 240 km = 1040 km

On the next day, he didn't travel at all, so we don't need to add any distance for that day.

During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day for 7 days. The total distance for the second week is:
300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Now, let's add the distances traveled in the first week and the second week to get the total distance:
1040 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

The final answer is: 3140"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the size of Timothy's locker in cubic inches. 

First, we know that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches and it is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. To find Zack's locker size, we multiply Peter's locker size by 4.

Zack's locker size = 5 * 4 = 20 cubic inches

Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can find Timothy's locker size by multiplying Zack's locker size by 2.

Timothy's locker size = 20 * 2 = 40 cubic inches

The final answer is: 40"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the difference in elevation between Stanley's current position and the position of the comb. Since the comb fell 4,000 feet from Stanley's initial position, and he is now at 10,000 feet, we need to subtract the height of the ledge from the initial height of Stanley.

However, the problem doesn't mention the height of the ledge, but it does mention that the comb fell 4,000 feet. This implies that the comb is at an elevation of 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet.

Now, we need to find the difference in elevation between the comb and Oliver's position. Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet, and the comb is at 6,000 feet. To find the difference, we subtract Oliver's elevation from the comb's elevation: 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000.

Therefore, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

The final answer is: 3000"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Mr. Josue received from the two banks and then add it to his initial capital.

The first bank gave him $4000. The second bank gave him twice as much, which is 2 x $4000 = $8000.

So, the total amount of money he received from the banks is $4000 + $8000 = $12000.

Now, we add this amount to his initial capital of $5000. 

$12000 + $5000 = $17000.

Therefore, Mr. Josue now has $17000 in capital.

The final answer is: $17000"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock.

Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each. So, the total number of cats taken away by the boats is 4 * 5 = 20.

Now, let's subtract the number of cats taken away from the initial number of cats: 50 - 20 = 30.

After that, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find 3/5 of 30, we multiply 30 by 3/5: (3/5) * 30 = (3 * 30) / 5 = 90 / 5 = 18.

Now, let's subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats: 30 - 18 = 12.

So, the number of cats left on the rock is 12.

"To find the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into the different periods and calculate the cost for each period.

1. The first 6 months were $8 a month, so the cost for this period is 6 * $8 = $48.
2. The next 8 months were $12 a month, so the cost for this period is 8 * $12 = $96.
3. The remaining months in 2 years (24 months) minus the first 14 months (6 + 8) is 24 - 14 = 10 months. The cost for this period is 10 * $14 = $140.

Now, we add up the costs for each period to find the total cost: $48 + $96 + $140 = $284.

The final answer is: $284"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the cost of the jogger jeans as J and the cost of the tattered jeans as T. We know that T = $28.

We are also given that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so we can write an equation: J = T - 6.

Substituting the value of T, we get J = 28 - 6, which simplifies to J = 22.

We are told that Cole saved a total of $6. Since he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, we can set up the following equation: (1/3)J + (2/3)T = 6.

Substituting the values of J and T, we get (1/3)(22) + (2/3)(28) = 6.

Simplifying the equation, we get 22/3 + 56/3 = 6.

Combining the fractions, we get 78/3 = 6.

Let's re-evaluate the problem statement again. We are told that Cole saved a total of $6. Since he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, we can set up the following equation: (1/3)J + (2/3)T = 6.

We know that J = 22 and T = 28. Substituting these values, we get (1/3)(22) + (2/3)(28) = 6.

Simplifying the equation, we get 22/3 + 56/3 = 6.

"To find the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and then add them together.

The capacity of the 4 buses is 4 x 60 = 240 employees.
The capacity of the 6 minibusses is 6 x 30 = 180 employees.
The capacity of the 10 minivans is 10 x 15 = 150 employees.

Now, we add the capacities together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

The final answer is: 570"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder and then calculate the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden.

Let's denote the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders as x. Since the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is x + 10.

Lillian has 3 store-bought feeders and 3 homemade feeders. The total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3x, and the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3(x + 10).

The total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden is the sum of the birds attracted to the store-bought and homemade feeders: 3x + 3(x + 10).

We are given that each bird feeder attracts 20 birds throughout the day. Since Lillian has 6 feeders in total, the total number of birds attracted to all feeders is 6 * 20 = 120.

We can set up an equation to represent the situation: 3x + 3(x + 10) = 120.

Simplifying the equation, we get 3x + 3x + 30 = 120, which becomes 6x + 30 = 120.

Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get 6x = 90.

Dividing both sides by 6, we get x = 15.

Now that we know x, we can find the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders: x + 10 = 15 + 10 = 25.

The total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden is 3x + 3(x + 10) = 3(15) + 3(25) = 45 + 75 = 120.

However, this is the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought and homemade feeders separately. Since the problem states that each feeder attracts 20 birds, and we know that the homemade feeders attract 25 birds, the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden is actually 6 * 20 = 120.

However, this is incorrect because it doesn't take into account the fact that the homemade feeders attract 25 birds. The correct total number of birds is 3 * 20 + 3 * 25 = 60 + 75 = 135.

The final answer is: 135"
"To find the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

The bagel costs $4. 
The soup costs 25% more than the bagel, which is 4 + (4 * 0.25) = 4 + 1 = $5.

The cake is half the price of the bagel, which is 4 / 2 = $2.

Now, let's add the costs of all the items together: 4 (bagel) + 5 (soup) + 2 (cake) = 11.

The total cost of Aleksandra's dinner is $11.

The final answer is: $11"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much money Kenny needs to make from selling his cards to reach the total of $100. Since he already has $50, he needs to make $100 - $50 = $50 from selling the cards.

Since each card sells for $1.5, we can divide the amount he needs to make ($50) by the price per card ($1.5) to find out how many cards he needs to sell:

$50 / $1.5 = 33.33

However, since Kenny can't sell a fraction of a card, we know he must sell at least 34 cards to have enough money to go to the amusement park. 

Now, we need to find out how many cards he started with. We know that he keeps 1/3 of his cards and sells the rest. Let's call the total number of cards he started with 'x'. The number of cards he sells is x - (1/3)x = (2/3)x.

We know that he sells 34 cards, so we can set up the equation:

(2/3)x = 34

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

x = 34 * (3/2)
x = 51

So, Kenny started with 51 cards. 

The final answer is: 51"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, the caterer prepared enough hot dogs for half of the guests to have two hot dogs. Since there are 36 guests, half of them would be 36 / 2 = 18 guests. 

For these 18 guests, the caterer prepared 2 hot dogs each, so the total number of hot dogs prepared for these 18 guests is 18 * 2 = 36 hot dogs.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hot dog. This means that the caterer had to provide an additional 40 - 36 = 4 hot dogs to the 22 guests who were not initially prepared for two hot dogs.

Since the caterer had already prepared 36 hot dogs for the 18 guests who were initially prepared for two hot dogs, and 4 additional hot dogs were needed for the remaining 22 guests, the total number of hot dogs prepared is 36 + 4 = 40 hot dogs.

Since there are 40 hot dogs in total and 40 guests showed up, the number of guests who did not get a second hot dog is the number of guests who were initially prepared for one hot dog, which is 36 - 18 = 18 guests.

However, this is not the answer we are looking for. We are looking for the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog. Since 40 guests showed up and there are 36 hotdogs, 4 guests did not get a second hotdog.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the number of letters in Indras' sister's name, we first need to find half of the letters in Indras' name. 

Half of the letters in Indras' name is 6 / 2 = 3. 

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name, so it has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

The total number of letters in both names is 6 (Indras) + 7 (her sister) = 13.

The final answer is: 13"
"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the total cost of the items before the discount and then apply the 20% discount.

1. Calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:
   - The set of pot and pans costs $120.00.
   - The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
   - 5 separate utensils at $5.00 each will cost 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.
   - The total cost of the items before the discount is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

2. Apply the 20% discount to the total cost:
   - To find 20% of $165.00, multiply $165.00 by 0.20: $165.00 * 0.20 = $33.00.
   - Subtract the discount from the total cost: $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

Therefore, the total cost of Charlotte's order after the 20% discount is $132.00.

The final answer is: $132.00"
"To find out how much more money Dora needs, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy and subtract the amount of money she already has.

The total cost of the items is: $6 (skipping rope) + $11 (board game) + $2 (playground ball) = $19.

Dora has $2 from her allowance and $16 from her mother, so she has a total of $2 + $16 = $18.

To find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost: $19 - $18 = $1.

Therefore, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball.

The final answer is: $1"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

"To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we first need to determine how much gas was in one container. Since 15 gallons were equally divided into 5 containers, we divide 15 gallons by 5.

15 gallons / 5 = 3 gallons per container

Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we multiply the number of gallons per container by 8 to find out how many pints are in one container.

3 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 24 pints per container

Josey needed 1/4 of a container to run her lawnmower. To find out how many pints she needed, we multiply the number of pints per container by 1/4.

24 pints/container * 1/4 = 6 pints

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money George had initially. Since he had 1% of his money left after spending $5, we can set up an equation to find the initial amount.

Let's denote the initial amount of money George had as 'x'. Since he had 1% of his money left after spending $5, we can write the equation as:

0.01x = 5

To find 'x', we can divide both sides by 0.01:

x = 5 / 0.01
x = 500

So, George initially had $500.

Now, let's find out how much he spent on chips. He bought 3 bags of chips for 40 cents each, so the total amount spent on chips is:

3 * 0.40 = 1.20

Since he spent $5 in total, the amount spent on candy bars is:

5 - 1.20 = 3.80

Now, we need to find out how many candy bars he bought. Each candy bar costs 75 cents, so we can divide the total amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar:

3.80 / 0.75 = 5.07

Since we can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can buy 5 candy bars with $3.75 and have $0.05 left, which is not enough to buy another candy bar. Therefore, George bought 5 candy bars.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many lollipops each of Ray's friends received, we need to first determine how many lollipops he shared with his friends. 

Ray had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself, so he shared 25 - 5 = 20 lollipops with his friends.

Since he shared the lollipops equally among his four friends, we need to divide the number of lollipops he shared (20) by the number of friends (4).

20 ÷ 4 = 5

So, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the remaining weight of the cake, we first need to determine the total weight of the pieces that Rory and her mom each have. 

Since there are 8 pieces in total and each piece is equal in weight, we can divide the total weight of the cake by the number of pieces to find the weight of each piece. 

Weight of each piece = Total weight of the cake / Number of pieces
Weight of each piece = 20 ounces / 8
Weight of each piece = 2.5 ounces

Since Rory and her mom each have a piece, we need to find the total weight of the two pieces they have. 

Total weight of the two pieces = Weight of each piece * 2
Total weight of the two pieces = 2.5 ounces * 2
Total weight of the two pieces = 5 ounces

Now, we can find the remaining weight of the cake by subtracting the total weight of the two pieces from the total weight of the cake.

Remaining weight of the cake = Total weight of the cake - Total weight of the two pieces
Remaining weight of the cake = 20 ounces - 5 ounces
Remaining weight of the cake = 15 ounces

"To find out how many oranges each person will get, we need to first calculate the total number of oranges Sitti and Juris have. 

Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges. 

Total oranges = 34 + 22 = 56

Since they are sharing the oranges with 6 other friends, including themselves, the total number of people sharing the oranges is 8 (Sitti, Juris, and 6 friends).

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people.

Oranges per person = Total oranges / Total people
= 56 / 8
= 7

So, everyone will get 7 oranges. 

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the cost per serving, we need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients and divide it by the number of servings.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the onions. Antoine wants to double the amount of onions, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The cost of onions is $2.00 per pound, so the total cost of onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the beef stock. Antoine needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box costs $2.00, so the total cost of beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is the sum of the cost of onions and beef stock, which is $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

Since the soup serves 6 people, the cost per serving is the total cost divided by the number of servings: $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes Bernadette to get to the theater and then calculate how much earlier she needs to leave than Wayne.

Since it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, and Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's, Bernadette's drive will take 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, and it takes her 16 minutes to get to the theater, she needs to leave 16 + 5 = 21 minutes before Wayne.

However, since Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, Bernadette needs to leave 21 minutes before Wayne's 4 minutes, which is 21 - 4 = 17 minutes.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 17 minutes earlier than Wayne to get to the theater first.

"To find the perimeter of the room, we first need to find the width of the room. Since the area of the room is given as 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. 

1 yard = 3 feet, so 3 yards = 3 * 3 = 9 feet.

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle: Area = Length * Width. 

360 = 9 * Width

To find the width, we can divide both sides of the equation by 9:

Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the width, we can find the perimeter of the room using the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)

Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98 feet

The final answer is: 98"
"To find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we need to calculate the total number of beads each sister has.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:

2 packs of clear beads = 2 x 20 = 40 beads
Total beads Elizabeth has = 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
3 packs of blue beads = 3 x 20 = 60 beads
4 packs of red beads = 4 x 20 = 80 beads
Total beads Margareth has = 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, we need to find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth:
Margareth's beads - Elizabeth's beads = 140 - 60 = 80

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. So, the total temperature increase due to baking is 3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees.

The initial temperature of the house is 40 degrees. After baking, the temperature becomes 40 + 15 = 55 degrees.

Then, Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Since the window is open for 30 minutes, it cools down for 3 intervals of 10 minutes each (30 minutes / 10 minutes per interval = 3 intervals). So, the total temperature decrease due to the window being open is 3 intervals * 2 degrees/interval = 6 degrees.

The final temperature of the house is 55 - 6 = 49 degrees.

The final answer is: 49"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it took James to complete each segment of the triathlon. 

Let's start with the swim. Since James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon, and Jon took 40 minutes, we can calculate James' swim time as follows:

James' swim time = Jon's swim time - (10% of Jon's swim time)
= 40 - (0.1 * 40)
= 40 - 4
= 36 minutes

Next, we know that James took 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. Since Jon took 1 hour and 20 minutes (or 80 minutes) for the bike ride, we can calculate James' bike time as follows:

James' bike time = Jon's bike time + 5 minutes
= 80 + 5
= 85 minutes

Now, we know that Jon won by 10 minutes. This means that the total time it took James to complete the triathlon was 10 minutes more than Jon's total time. We can calculate Jon's total time as follows:

Jon's total time = Swim time + Bike time + Run time
= 40 + 80 + 50
= 170 minutes

Since James took 10 minutes longer than Jon, his total time is:
James' total time = Jon's total time + 10 minutes
= 170 + 10
= 180 minutes

Now, we can calculate James' run time as follows:
James' run time = James' total time - (James' swim time + James' bike time)
= 180 - (36 + 85)
= 180 - 121
= 59 minutes

The final answer is: 59"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that Movie C is 1.25 hours. We need to convert this to minutes because the other movies' lengths are given in minutes. 

1 hour = 60 minutes, so 1.25 hours = 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes.

Now, we know that Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. So, Movie B's length is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes.

We also know that Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B. To find Movie A's length, we need to divide Movie B's length by 4.

Movie A's length = Movie B's length / 4 = 80 / 4 = 20 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance the horse runs, the amount of hay it eats, and then the cost of the hay. 

First, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours since the speed is given in miles per hour (MPH). 

30 minutes is equal to 0.5 hours (since 1 hour = 60 minutes).

Now, we can calculate the distance the horse runs: 
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 32 MPH * 0.5 hours
Distance = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile, it will eat:
Hay eaten = Distance * (1/2)
Hay eaten = 16 miles * (1/2)
Hay eaten = 8 bails

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost of hay will be:
Total cost = Hay eaten * Cost per bail
Total cost = 8 bails * $3
Total cost = $24

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of:
Total money = 6 * $5
Total money = $30

To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the total money:
Change = Total money - Total cost
Change = $30 - $24
Change = $6

"To find out how many trays Rozanne can put out, we first need to determine the total number of eggs she has. 

Rozanne uses 4 dozen eggs from cases. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 4 dozen eggs would be 4 * 12 = 48 eggs.

She also uses 2 loose eggs from the cupboard. 

So, the total number of eggs is 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Each glass of eggnog needs 5 eggs, so the total number of glasses she can make is 50 / 5 = 10 glasses.

Each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog, so the total number of trays she can put out is 10 / 5 = 2 trays.

"To find the salesman's profit, we first need to calculate the total revenue from the sale of sneakers. 

The salesman sold 17 sneakers for $20 each on Monday, so the revenue from these sales is 17 * $20 = $340.

The remaining sneakers are 48 - 17 = 31. These were sold for $25 each to the department store, so the revenue from these sales is 31 * $25 = $775.

The total revenue is the sum of these two amounts: $340 + $775 = $1115.

The cost of the case of sneakers is $576. To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the total revenue: $1115 - $576 = $539.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the regular price of popcorn as P. 

The total cost of buying a movie ticket and popcorn and soda at regular price is 12 + P + 3 = 15 + P.

The total cost of buying a super ticket is 20. If you buy a super ticket, you get one popcorn and a soda for $1 extra, so the total cost is 20 + 1 = 21.

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the difference between the two options is 21 - (15 + P) = 6 - P.

We are given that this difference is equal to $2, so we can set up the equation 6 - P = 2.

To solve for P, we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation, which gives us -P = -4.

Multiplying both sides by -1, we get P = 4.

The regular price of popcorn is $4.

Let's denote the original cost of filling one balloon as x. Since the total cost of filling 20 balloons was $900, we can set up the equation:

20x = 900

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 20:

x = 900 / 20
x = 45

So, the original cost of filling one balloon was $45.

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20, making the new cost of filling one balloon $65.

Now, we need to find the total cost of filling 170 balloons at the new price. We can multiply the new cost per balloon by the number of balloons:

Total cost = 65 * 170
Total cost = 11050

The final answer is: 11050"
"To find the average speed of the car during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled at 60 mph for 2 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 60 mph x 2 hours
Distance = 120 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled at 30 mph for 1 hour:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 30 mph x 1 hour
Distance = 30 miles

Now, let's find the total distance traveled:
Total Distance = 120 miles + 30 miles
Total Distance = 150 miles

The total time taken is the sum of the time taken at 60 mph and 30 mph:
Total Time = 2 hours + 1 hour
Total Time = 3 hours

Finally, we can calculate the average speed:
Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
Average Speed = 150 miles / 3 hours
Average Speed = 50 mph

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the value of the sapphires and rubies Jenna has after the trade. 

Initially, Jenna has 8 sapphires. She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. This means she has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left. 

The value of the sapphires she has left is 5 * $800 = $4000. 

The value of the rubies she got in the trade is 2 * $1200 = $2400.

The total value of her jewels is the sum of the value of the sapphires and the rubies, which is $4000 + $2400 = $6400.

The final answer is: $6400"
"To find the total number of apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of apples they eat per day and then multiply it by 30.

Marin and Nancy each eat 4 apples a day. So together, they eat 4 + 4 = 8 apples per day.

To find the total number of apples they eat in 30 days, we multiply 8 apples per day by 30 days: 8 * 30 = 240 apples.

The final answer is: 240"
"To determine the total cost of the potting soil, we need to calculate the total volume of soil required and then divide it by the volume of each bag, rounding up to the nearest whole number since we can't buy a fraction of a bag. 

First, let's calculate the volume of each raised bed: 
Volume = length * width * height = 8 * 2 * 2 = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil required is: 
Total Volume = 10 * 32 = 320 cubic feet.

Now, let's calculate the number of bags needed: 
Number of bags = Total Volume / Volume per bag = 320 / 2 = 160 bags.

Since we can't buy a fraction of a bag, we round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can buy 160 bags, which is a whole number.

Now, let's calculate the total cost: 
Total Cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag = 160 * $12 = $1920.

The final answer is: $1920"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of green cards first. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:

Number of red cards = 15
60% of 15 = 0.6 * 15 = 9
Number of green cards = 15 + 9 = 24

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards:
Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
= 15 + 24
= 39

To find the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards:
Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
= 15 + 24 + 39
= 78

The final answer is: 78"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies.

After 20 minutes, one of her friends saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the fairies that were there. This means her friend saw 50 / 2 = 25 fairies. So, the total number of fairies now is 50 (initial fairies) + 25 (new fairies) = 75.

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. So, the remaining number of fairies is 75 - 30 = 45.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the total number of puppies with spots, we need to add the number of puppies with spots from Jennifer's and Brandon's dogs. 

Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots. So, the total number of puppies with spots is 3 + 4 = 7.

Next, we need to find the total number of puppies. Jennifer has 8 puppies, and Brandon has 12 puppies. So, the total number of puppies is 8 + 12 = 20.

To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we need to divide the total number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiply by 100.

Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

The final answer is: 35"
"To find the total weight of the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and add them together.

The total weight of sugar cubes is 2 boxes * 1 pound per box = 2 pounds.

The total weight of carrots is 4 bags * 12 pounds per bag = 48 pounds.

The total weight of hay is 42 bales * 75 pounds per bale = 3150 pounds.

The total weight of oats is 20 sacks * 65 pounds per sack = 1300 pounds.

The total weight of all the feed is 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3400 pounds.

Since the farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, we need to divide the total weight of the feed by the truck's capacity to find the number of trips needed.

3400 pounds / 2250 pounds per trip = 1.51 trips.

Since we can't make a fraction of a trip, the farmer will need to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To find out how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate her earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles separately and then add them together.

Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans of soda per week. Since an aluminum can is worth 2 cents, her weekly earnings from aluminum cans are 3 * 2 = 6 cents.

Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles of water per week. Since a plastic bottle is worth 3 cents, her weekly earnings from plastic bottles are 5 * 3 = 15 cents.

In a four-week month, Grayson's total earnings from aluminum cans are 6 * 4 = 24 cents.

In a four-week month, Grayson's total earnings from plastic bottles are 15 * 4 = 60 cents.

To find Grayson's total earnings from recycling in a four-week month, we add her earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles: 24 + 60 = 84 cents.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many plants Toni has first, and then determine how many plants Shondra has.

Since Frederick has 10 plants, and Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, we can calculate Toni's plants as follows:

Toni's plants = Frederick's plants + (60% of Frederick's plants)
Toni's plants = 10 + (0.6 * 10)
Toni's plants = 10 + 6
Toni's plants = 16

Now that we know Toni has 16 plants, and Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni, we can calculate Shondra's plants as follows:

Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
Shondra's plants = 16 - 7
Shondra's plants = 9

"To find out how many students Miss Maria has, we first need to determine the total number of cards she has. 

She has 6 decks of basketball cards with 25 cards in each deck, so the total number of basketball cards is 6 * 25 = 150.

She has 5 boxes of baseball cards with 40 cards in each box, so the total number of baseball cards is 5 * 40 = 200.

The total number of cards is the sum of basketball and baseball cards, which is 150 + 200 = 350.

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so the remaining cards are 350 - 50 = 300.

If her students got 10 cards each, the total number of students can be found by dividing the remaining cards by 10. 

300 / 10 = 30.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of each type of laundry item in 80 rooms and then add them up.

Each room has 2 sheets. So, in 80 rooms, there are 80 * 2 = 160 sheets.

Each room has 1 comforter. So, in 80 rooms, there are 80 comforters.

Each room has twice as many pillow cases as sheets, which means each room has 2 * 2 = 4 pillow cases. So, in 80 rooms, there are 80 * 4 = 320 pillow cases.

Each room has twice as many towels as pillow cases, which means each room has 2 * 4 = 8 towels. So, in 80 rooms, there are 80 * 8 = 640 towels.

Now, let's add up the total number of laundry items: 160 (sheets) + 80 (comforters) + 320 (pillow cases) + 640 (towels) = 1200.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, there are 30 students, each with 10 pencils. So, the total number of pencils at the beginning of the year is 30 * 10 = 300.

After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used. This means 1/5 of 300 pencils were used. To find 1/5 of 300, we multiply 300 by 1/5, which is the same as dividing 300 by 5. So, 300 / 5 = 60 pencils were used.

Now, we subtract the used pencils from the initial total to find the remaining pencils after two months: 300 - 60 = 240 pencils.

At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. This means 1/3 of 240 pencils were left. To find 1/3 of 240, we multiply 240 by 1/3, which is the same as dividing 240 by 3. So, 240 / 3 = 80 pencils were left.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. 

Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt has to eat as 'x'. According to the given condition, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, which is x/2. Additionally, he gets two extra cookies for cleaning his room. 

The total number of cookies Matt wants to eat is five. So, we can set up the equation: x/2 + 2 = 5.

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate the variable. First, subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: x/2 = 5 - 2, which simplifies to x/2 = 3.

Next, multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction: x = 3 * 2.

x = 6

"To find the combined length of the remoras, we need to convert their length to feet and then add them together. 

Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 12 inches in a foot. So, we can convert 6 inches to feet by dividing by 12: 6 / 12 = 0.5 feet. 

Since there are two remoras, we multiply 0.5 feet by 2: 0.5 * 2 = 1 foot. 

Now, we add the length of the remoras to the length of the shark: 10 feet (shark) + 1 foot (remoras) = 11 feet.

To find the percentage, we divide the combined length of the remoras by the length of the shark and multiply by 100: (1 / 10) * 100 = 10%.

Let's denote the total number of students as 'x'. Since three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer, one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer. We are given that this number is 20.

We can set up the equation: (1/4)x = 20

To solve for 'x', we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4 to isolate 'x':

x = 20 * 4
x = 80

Therefore, there are 80 students at that grade level.

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total number of minutes Jason has available to walk in three weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so in three weeks, there are 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Since Jason can walk 4 days a week, the total number of days he can walk in three weeks is 21 * 4 = 84 days.

Now, we need to calculate the total number of minutes Jason needs to walk to break in the shoes. This is given as 240 minutes.

To find out how long Jason has to spend walking each day, we need to divide the total number of minutes by the total number of days he can walk. 

Total minutes = 240
Total days = 84

Daily walking time = Total minutes / Total days

"To find out how many books each child got, we need to first determine the total number of books Sarah bought. Since each book costs $15 and she spent $300, we can divide the total amount spent by the cost of each book.

Total amount spent = $300
Cost of each book = $15

Total number of books = Total amount spent / Cost of each book
Total number of books = $300 / $15
Total number of books = 20

Since Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, we can divide the total number of books by 4 to find out how many books each child got.

Number of books per child = Total number of books / 4
Number of books per child = 20 / 4
Number of books per child = 5

"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we need to first find the total number of kids who are allergic to at least one thing. 

We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find this. The formula is Total = A + B - Both, where A is the number of kids allergic to dairy, B is the number of kids allergic to peanuts, and Both is the number of kids allergic to both.

A = 9 (kids allergic to dairy)
B = 6 (kids allergic to peanuts)
Both = 3 (kids allergic to both)

Total allergic = A + B - Both = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12

Now, to find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we subtract the total number of kids allergic from the total number of kids in the class.

Total kids = 32
Kids not allergic = Total kids - Total allergic = 32 - 12 = 20

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of oats consumed by the horses per day and then multiply it by the number of days.

First, let's calculate the total amount of oats consumed by the horses per day:

Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and there are 2 meals per day, so each horse consumes 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of oats per day.

Since Uncle Ben has 4 horses, the total amount of oats consumed by all horses per day is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

Now, we need to multiply this amount by the number of days to find the total amount of oats needed for 5 days:

40 pounds/day * 5 days = 200 pounds

Since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, we need to divide the total amount of oats needed by the weight of one bag to find the number of bags needed:

200 pounds / 50 pounds/bag = 4 bags

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for 5 days.

First, let's calculate the cost of 2 packs of razors at the sale price. Since it's buy one get one free, Heather will only pay for 1 pack. The cost of 1 pack is $4.00. 

Now, let's apply the $2.00 coupon to the cost of 1 pack. The new cost is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since Heather buys 2 packs, but only pays for 1 pack, the total cost is $2.00.

Now, let's find the total number of razors. 2 packs contain 4 razors each, so 2 packs contain 2 * 4 = 8 razors.

To find the cost per individual razor, we divide the total cost by the total number of razors. The total cost is $2.00, which is equivalent to 200 cents. The total number of razors is 8.

Cost per individual razor = Total cost / Total number of razors
= 200 cents / 8
= 25 cents

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the total height of the human pyramid, we need to calculate the height of each level and add them up.

The 4 girls on the bottom are 64"" tall each, so their total height is 4 * 64 = 256"".

The 3 girls on top of the 4 are also 64"" tall each, so their total height is 3 * 64 = 192"".

The 2 girls on top of the 3 are also 64"" tall each, so their total height is 2 * 64 = 128"".

The shortest girl at the top is 60"" tall.

Now, we add up the heights of all the levels: 256"" + 192"" + 128"" + 60"" = 536"".

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches): 536"" / 12 = 44.67 feet.

The final answer is: 44.67"
"To find the total number of minutes Charisma walked, we need to calculate the total number of 5-minute walks she took in 5 days.

Charisma works 8 hours a day, and she takes a 5-minute walk every hour. So, in a day, she takes 8 walks. 

In 5 days, she will take 8 walks/day * 5 days = 40 walks.

Since each walk is 5 minutes, the total number of minutes she walked is 40 walks * 5 minutes/walk = 200 minutes.

The final answer is: 200"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine Brett's age in four years. Since Brett is currently 14 years old, in four years, he will be 14 + 4 = 18 years old.

According to the problem, in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. Since Brett is 14 years old now, three times his current age is 3 * 14 = 42 years old.

Since Angela will be 42 years old in four years, we need to subtract 4 from 42 to find out how old Angela is now. Angela's current age is 42 - 4 = 38 years old.

The final answer is: 38"
"To find the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car, we need to calculate the cost of the morning rides and the cost of the afternoon rides separately, and then add them together.

The cost of the morning rides is the cost per ride multiplied by the number of rides: $6/ride * 14 rides = $84.

The cost of the afternoon rides is the cost per ride multiplied by the number of rides: $2/ride * 14 rides = $28.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the morning rides and the cost of the afternoon rides: $84 + $28 = $112.

The final answer is: $112"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of oranges both Ashley and Brianne brought and then divide that number by the number of oranges needed for one pie.

Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so she brought 5 * 10 = 50 oranges.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so she brought 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

In total, they have 50 + 70 = 120 oranges.

Since one Greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, the number of pies they can make is 120 / 3 = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation for each venue and then equate them to find the break-even point.

Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'.

For the first venue, the total cost is the flat fee of $200 plus the cost of food for each guest, which is $5x. So, the total cost for the first venue is:

Cost1 = 200 + 5x

For the second venue, the total cost is the cost per guest, which is $25, multiplied by the number of guests, x. So, the total cost for the second venue is:

Cost2 = 25x

Since we want to find the break-even point, we set the two costs equal to each other:

200 + 5x = 25x

Now, we can solve for x:

200 = 25x - 5x
200 = 20x
x = 200 / 20
x = 10

Therefore, Mark needs 10 guests for the two venues to be equal in cost.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of insects David found as D, the number of insects Bodhi found as B, and the number of insects Lily found as L.

We know that Lily found 7 more than David, so we can write an equation: L = D + 7.

We also know that David found half of what Bodhi found, so we can write another equation: D = B/2.

We are also given that together they collected 43 insects, so the sum of the insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43: L + D + B = 43.

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the third equation: (D + 7) + D + B = 43.

Combine like terms: 2D + B + 7 = 43.

Subtract 7 from both sides: 2D + B = 36.

Now, substitute the second equation into this one: 2(D) + B = 36, and since D = B/2, we can substitute D with B/2: 2(B/2) + B = 36.

Simplify the equation: B + B = 36.

Combine like terms: 2B = 36.

Divide both sides by 2: B = 18.

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects David found: D = B/2 = 18/2 = 9.

Finally, we can find the number of insects Lily found: L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total amount of yarn used, we need to calculate the amount used by Mariah and her grandma separately and then add them together.

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, and there are 364 yards in a skein. To find 1/4 of 364, we multiply 364 by 1/4 (which is the same as dividing by 4).

364 yards / 4 = 91 yards

So, Mariah used 91 yards of yarn.

Mariah's grandma used 1/2 of a skein, which is the same as 364 yards / 2.

364 yards / 2 = 182 yards

So, Mariah's grandma used 182 yards of yarn.

To find the total amount of yarn used, we add the amount used by Mariah and her grandma together.

91 yards (Mariah) + 182 yards (grandma) = 273 yards

"To find the total number of gifts Cherrie bought, we need to calculate the total number of gifts her friends want and then add the 10 additional random gifts.

First, let's calculate the total number of gifts her friends want:

2 friends want 5 gifts each, so 2 x 5 = 10 gifts
3 friends want 2 gifts each, so 3 x 2 = 6 gifts
Total gifts wanted by friends = 10 + 6 = 16 gifts

Now, let's add the 10 additional random gifts:
Total gifts = 16 (gifts wanted by friends) + 10 (additional random gifts) = 26 gifts

"To find the length of the couch, we first need to determine the width of the rug. Since the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, and the chair is 3 feet wide, the rug's width is 3 + 5 = 8 feet.

Next, we need to find the length of the couch. The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Twice the width of the rug is 2 * 8 = 16 feet. Adding 2 feet to this gives us the length of the couch: 16 + 2 = 18 feet.

The final answer is: 18"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as 'x'. Since Suzie bought two packs of strawberry gum, the total cost for these two packs would be 2x.

She paid $2 for a pack of grape gum. 

She also paid half as much for a small pack of green apple gum, which means the cost of the green apple gum is $2 / 2 = $1.

The total cost of all four packs of gum is $7. So, we can set up the equation: 2x + 2 + 1 = 7.

Now, let's simplify the equation: 2x + 3 = 7.

Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 4.

Divide both sides of the equation by 2: x = 2.

The cost of each pack of strawberry gum is $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine which type of wood Frederick should buy to maximize the number of popsicle sticks he can make while staying within his budget of $24.

Let's calculate the cost per stick for each type of wood:

For a 2 x 4 piece of wood, Frederick can get 200 sticks for $4. The cost per stick is $4 / 200 = $0.02 per stick.

For a 2 x 8 piece of wood, Frederick can get 400 sticks for $6. The cost per stick is $6 / 400 = $0.015 per stick.

Since the 2 x 8 piece of wood costs less per stick, Frederick should buy the 2 x 8 piece of wood.

Now, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces of wood Frederick can buy with his budget of $24:

$24 / $6 = 4

Since Frederick can get 400 sticks from each 2 x 8 piece of wood, he can get a total of:

4 x 400 = 1600 sticks

The final answer is: 1600"
"To find the total cost of snowshoes for Mario's dogs, we need to first determine the total number of snowshoes required. Since each dog has 4 legs and Mario has 6 dogs, the total number of legs is 6 * 4 = 24.

Since each dog needs a pair of snowshoes, and each pair has 2 snowshoes, the total number of snowshoes required is 24 / 2 = 12.

Now, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of snowshoes by the cost per pair: 12 * $12.00 = $144.00.

The final answer is: $144.00"
"To find out how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips for a week and then subtract the cost of the weekly pass.

Janet takes two bus trips per day, five days a week. So, the total number of bus trips per week is 2 * 5 = 10.

Each bus trip costs $2.20, so the total cost of her bus trips for a week is 10 * $2.20 = $22.

The weekly bus pass costs $20. To find out how much Janet would save, we subtract the cost of the pass from the total cost of her bus trips: $22 - $20 = $2.

Therefore, Janet would save $2 by buying a weekly bus pass.

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of cows and sheep at the farm and the zoo.

The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does. Since the farm has 30 cows, the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does. Since the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, we need to find the total number of animals at the farm and the zoo. The farm has 30 cows and 10 sheep, so the total number of animals at the farm is 30 + 10 = 40. The zoo has 60 cows and 20 sheep, so the total number of animals at the zoo is 60 + 20 = 80.

The total number of animals at the farm and the zoo combined is 40 + 80 = 120.

The final answer is: 120"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can let x be the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought. 

We know that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, so the total number of items Rose bought is 12 + 4 = 16. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of items Sophia bought, we can set up the equation 4x = 16.

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 4: x = 16 / 4 = 4.

This means Sophia bought 4 onions and 4 potatoes. To find the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we add the number of onions and potatoes: 4 + 4 = 8.

"To determine the total number of days Andy has to reach his goal, we need to calculate the difference between his birthday and today's date. 

December has 31 days, and his birthday is on the 19th of July, which is in the month of July. July has 31 days. So, the total number of days Andy has to reach his goal is 31 (December) + 30 (January) + 31 (February) + 31 (March) + 30 (April) + 31 (May) + 31 (June) + 19 (July) = 184 days.

Since Andy wants to lose 30 pounds, and he needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound, the total number of calories he needs to burn is 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories.

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories needed by the number of days: 105,000 / 184 ≈ 571 calories.

"To find out how much Gerald has left, we need to calculate his total earnings for the week and then subtract the amount he spent.

Since Gerald works for a week, which has 7 days, and he earns $30 per day, his total earnings for the week would be:

$30/day * 7 days = $210

Now, we subtract the amount he spent from his total earnings:

$210 (total earnings) - $100 (amount spent) = $110

Gerald has $110 left."
"To find out how many milliliters of water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total distance she will run. Since each lap is 0.25 km and she needs to run 8 laps, we multiply the number of laps by the distance per lap.

Total distance = 8 laps * 0.25 km/lap = 2 km

Since Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs, we multiply the total distance by the amount of water needed per kilometer.

Total water needed = 2 km * 60 ml/km = 120 ml

"To find out how much money Julie had left, we need to calculate the amount she spent on clothes and CDs, and then subtract that from the initial amount.

First, Julie spent 20% of $500 on clothes. 
20% of $500 = 0.20 * $500 = $100

Now, we subtract the amount spent on clothes from the initial amount:
$500 - $100 = $400

Next, Julie spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs.
25% of $400 = 0.25 * $400 = $100

Now, we subtract the amount spent on CDs from the remaining amount:
$400 - $100 = $300

So, Julie had $300 left.

The final answer is: $300"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations. Let's denote the cost of the lot as 'x'. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house can be represented as 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot together is $120,000. Therefore, we can write the equation: x + 3x = 120,000.

Combining like terms, we get 4x = 120,000.

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 4: x = 120,000 / 4 = 30,000.

Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x = 3 * 30,000 = 90,000.

The final answer is: $90,000."
"To find the profit, we first need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

The total cost is the cost of the canvas bags, which is 8 packs * 5 bags per pack * $4 per bag = 8 * 5 * 4 = $160.

The total revenue is the selling price of the bags, which is 8 bags * $8 per bag = 8 * 8 = $64.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $64 - $160 = -$96.

However, since profit cannot be negative, it seems there is an error in the problem. The selling price of $8 per bag is less than the cost price of $4 per bag, which is not possible in a real-world scenario. 

Assuming the selling price is higher than the cost price, let's recalculate the profit. 

The total cost is still $160. 

The total revenue is 8 bags * $8 per bag = 8 * 8 = $64. However, this is not possible as the total revenue should be higher than the total cost. 

Let's assume the selling price is $12 per bag. The total revenue is 8 bags * $12 per bag = 8 * 12 = $96.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $96 - $160 = -$64. 

However, this is still not possible as the profit cannot be negative. 

Let's assume the selling price is $16 per bag. The total revenue is 8 bags * $16 per bag = 8 * 16 = $128.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $128 - $160 = -$32. 

However, this is still not possible as the profit cannot be negative. 

Let's assume the selling price is $20 per bag. The total revenue is 8 bags * $20 per bag = 8 * 20 = $160.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $160 - $160 = $0.

However, this is not the maximum possible profit. 

Let's assume the selling price is $24 per bag. The total revenue is 8 bags * $24 per bag = 8 * 24 = $192.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $192 - $160 = $32.

This is still not the maximum possible profit. 

Let's assume the selling price is $28 per bag. The total revenue is 8 bags * $28 per bag = 8 * 28 = $224.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $224 - $160 = $64.

This is the maximum possible profit.

"To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we first need to determine how many cups of raisins she has available for the oatmeal cookies. 

Since she divides the raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, each of these will get 27 / 3 = 9 cups of raisins.

However, the question states that a batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins. To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies she can make, we need to divide the total raisins available for oatmeal cookies by the amount needed per batch.

First, let's find out how many cups of raisins are available for oatmeal cookies: 9 cups (total) - 9 cups (for granola) - 9 cups (for snack mix) = 0 cups. However, this is incorrect because we are dividing the raisins equally among the three items. The correct way to find the amount of raisins available for oatmeal cookies is to divide the total raisins by 3 and then multiply by 2 (since oatmeal cookies get 2/3 of the raisins). 

So, raisins available for oatmeal cookies = (27 / 3) * 2 = 18 cups.

Now, we can find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies she can make: 18 cups / (3/4 cup per batch) = 18 / (3/4) = 18 * (4/3) = 24.

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we first need to calculate her daily and weekly electric consumption before and after adding the new device.

Before adding the new device, Ada's daily electric consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. Since there are 24 hours in a day, her daily consumption is 12 * 24 = 288 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per day.

After adding the new device, her daily electric consumption will be 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour. So, her daily consumption will be 14 * 24 = 336 kWh per day.

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7. 

Before adding the new device, Ada's weekly consumption is 288 * 7 = 2016 kWh.
After adding the new device, her weekly consumption is 336 * 7 = 2352 kWh.

The cost of electricity is $1.50 per kWh. So, the weekly cost before adding the new device is 2016 * $1.50 = $3024.
The weekly cost after adding the new device is 2352 * $1.50 = $3528.

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is $3528 - $3024 = $504.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the rate at which one person can paint a house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then they can paint a whole house in 10 days (since it would take twice as long to paint the entire house).

Now, let's convert the time from days to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 10 days is equal to 10 x 24 = 240 hours.

Since one person can paint a whole house in 240 hours, we need to find out how long it would take for 5 people to paint the same house. To do this, we can divide the total time it takes for one person to paint the house by the number of people working together. 

So, 240 hours / 5 people = 48 hours.

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of chairs Ophelia and Jenna have. 

Since Ophelia has 20 sofas and she has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, we can set up an equation to find the number of chairs Ophelia has. Let's denote the number of chairs Ophelia has as 'x'. Then, the number of sofas she has is x - 2. We know that the number of sofas Ophelia has is 20, so we can set up the equation x - 2 = 20.

Solving for x, we get x = 22. This means Ophelia has 22 chairs.

Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.

Now, we know that Ophelia has 20 sofas and Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. So, Jenna has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

To find the total number of sofas and chairs, we add the number of sofas and chairs Ophelia and Jenna have: 20 + 22 + 64 + 66 = 152.

Cost of headphone set = $48 - $4
Cost of headphone set = $44

Now that we know the cost of the headphone set, we can find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with that money.

Cost of one CD = $4
Number of CDs Tom could have bought with the money spent on the headphone set = Cost of headphone set / Cost of one CD
Number of CDs Tom could have bought with the money spent on the headphone set = $44 / $4
Number of CDs Tom could have bought with the money spent on the headphone set = 11

Since Tom bought one CD, we need to add 1 to the number of CDs he could have bought with the money spent on the headphone set to find out how many more CDs he could have bought.

Number of additional CDs Tom could have bought = Number of CDs Tom could have bought with the money spent on the headphone set + 1
Number of additional CDs Tom could have bought = 11 + 1
Number of additional CDs Tom could have bought = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we need to consider the different scenarios where he spent more or less time than the usual 4 hours per week.

In 6 weeks, Josh spent 4 hours per week. So, the total hours spent in these 6 weeks is 6 * 4 = 24 hours.

In 1 week, Josh spent 6 hours. 

In 1 week, Josh spent 5 hours for two consecutive weeks. So, the total hours spent in these 2 weeks is 2 * 5 = 10 hours.

Now, let's add up the total hours spent: 24 + 6 + 10 = 40 hours.

The final answer is: 40"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off. So, the number of people left on the bus is 48 - 8 = 40.

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (which is 8) get into the bus. So, 5 * 8 = 40 people get in. Now, the total number of people on the bus is 40 (who were already there) + 40 (who got in) = 80.

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off. So, the number of people left on the bus is 80 - 21 = 59.

Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on. Since 21 got off, 3 times fewer would be 21 / 3 = 7. So, 7 people get in. Now, the total number of people on the bus is 59 (who were already there) + 7 (who got in) = 66.

The final number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop is 66."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, so his current age is 27 - 5 = 22 years.
2. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. 
   Let's denote Jame's age in 8 years as J8 and his cousin's age in 8 years as C8. 
   We know that C8 = 2 * J8 - 5.
3. Since Jame's age in 8 years will be 22 + 8 = 30, we can substitute J8 = 30 into the equation from step 2.
   C8 = 2 * 30 - 5 = 55.
4. Now, we need to find Jame's cousin's current age. Since his cousin will be 55 in 8 years, his current age is 55 - 8 = 47.
5. The age difference between Jame and his cousin is 47 - 22 = 25 years.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the cost of one monitor, we first need to determine the cost of the printer. Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, and the computer cost $1,100, the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700.

The total cost of the computer and the printer is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800. 

Since Errol bought 2 monitors, the cost of the two monitors is $2,400 - $1,800 = $600. 

To find the cost of one monitor, we divide the total cost of the two monitors by 2: $600 / 2 = $300.

The final answer is: $300"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. There are 20 kids in total, divided into two equal groups of girls and boys. This means there are 10 girls and 10 boys.
2. The boys brought back 60 shells each, so the total number of shells brought by the boys is 10 * 60 = 600 shells.
3. The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 600 (number of shells brought by the boys) + 4 * 60 (four times the number of shells brought by the boys) seashells.
4. To find the total number of seashells brought by the girls, we calculate 600 + 4 * 60 = 600 + 240 = 840 seashells.
5. Since there are 10 girls, we need to find out how many seashells each girl brought. To do this, we divide the total number of seashells brought by the girls (840) by the number of girls (10).
6. 840 / 10 = 84

The final answer is: 84"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Initially, Nick had twice as many candies as George. Let's denote the number of candies George had initially as 'x'. Therefore, Nick had 2x candies.

2. George ate 5 candies, so the number of candies George has left is x - 5.

3. We are given that George has 3 candies left, so we can set up the equation: x - 5 = 3.

4. To find the value of x, we need to solve the equation: x - 5 = 3. Adding 5 to both sides of the equation gives us x = 8.

5. Since Nick had twice as many candies as George initially, Nick had 2x candies. Now that we know x = 8, we can find the number of candies Nick has: 2x = 2 * 8 = 16.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find Anne's age, we first need to determine Alyana's age. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, we can calculate Alyana's age by subtracting 4 from Chenny's age.

Alyana's age = Chenny's age - 4
Alyana's age = 10 - 4
Alyana's age = 6

Now that we know Alyana's age, we can find Anne's age by adding 2 to Alyana's age.

Anne's age = Alyana's age + 2
Anne's age = 6 + 2
Anne's age = 8

"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book and then add them together.

The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 * 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add the thickness of all four books together:
31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188

The final answer is: 188"
"To find out how many vlogs Emma needs to make to complete 72 vlogs per month, we first need to calculate how many vlogs she has already made in the first three weeks.

In the first week, Emma made 18 vlogs.
In the second week, Emma made 21 vlogs.
In the third week, Emma made 15 vlogs.

Total vlogs made in the first three weeks = 18 + 21 + 15 = 54 vlogs

Since Emma aims to make 72 vlogs per month, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from the target number of vlogs.

Vlogs needed to complete the target = 72 - 54 = 18 vlogs

Therefore, Emma should make 18 vlogs to complete the 72 vlogs per month.

"To find the total amount you paid, first, calculate the 20% tip on the $50 dinner bill. 

20% of $50 is calculated as 0.20 * $50 = $10.

Now, add the tip to the original bill: $50 + $10 = $60.

Since your wife wants to evenly split the check, you will pay half of the total amount: $60 / 2 = $30.

The final answer is: $30"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, $18 is shared among 3 boys. This means each boy gets $18 / 3 = $6.

The eldest boy added $5 to his share, so he now has $6 + $5 = $11.

The following day, he added another $10, so he now has $11 + $10 = $21.

Then, he spent $8, so he has $21 - $8 = $13 left.

After saving some more, he tripled the amount he had left after spending the $8. This means he now has 3 * $13 = $39.

The final answer is: $39"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much Elvis needs to save in the first half of the month. 

Let's assume the number of days in the first half of the month is x. Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half, the number of days in the second half is also x.

The total number of days in the month is 30 (assuming April has 30 days). So, we can set up the equation: x + x = 30, which simplifies to 2x = 30. Solving for x, we get x = 15.

This means the first half of the month has 15 days and the second half also has 15 days.

Now, let's calculate the total savings needed for the first half of the month. Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half, let's call the daily savings in the first half 'y'. Then, the daily savings in the second half will be 2y.

The total savings for the first half is 15y, and the total savings for the second half is 15(2y) = 30y.

The total savings for the month is the sum of the savings in the first and second half, which is 15y + 30y = 45y.

We know that the total savings target is $1125. So, we can set up the equation: 45y = 1125.

Solving for y, we get y = 1125 / 45 = 25.

This means Elvis needs to save $25 per day in the first half of the month.

Since he wants to save twice as much in the second half, the daily savings in the second half will be 2y = 2(25) = 50.

The final answer is: $50"
"To find the total cost of the fruits, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and add them together.

The cost of 5 oranges at $0.80 each is 5 x $0.80 = $4.
The cost of 6 peaches at $0.75 each is 6 x $0.75 = $4.50.

Now, let's add the costs together: $4.50 + $4 + $4.50 = $13.

Jairus gets $0.8 for each task, so for 20 tasks, he will get 20 * $0.8 = $16.

Jenny gets $0.5 for each task, so for 20 tasks, she will get 20 * $0.5 = $10.

To find out how much more Jairus will get than Jenny, we subtract Jenny's total from Jairus's total: $16 - $10 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let's represent the amount of money Brad gets as 'x'. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff's amount can be represented as 4x.

We know that the total amount of money they are dividing is $100. So, the sum of the money Jeff and Brad get should equal $100. We can write this as an equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms:

5x = 100

Now, divide both sides by 5 to solve for x:

x = 100 / 5
x = 20

Since x represents the amount Brad gets, and Jeff gets 4 times as much, we can find Jeff's amount by multiplying x by 4:

Jeff's amount = 4x
= 4 * 20
= 80

The final answer is: $80"
"To find the total miles Jeff walks in a week, we need to calculate the total miles he walks in a day and then multiply it by the number of days he works in a week.

Since Jeff walks to work and back each day, the total miles he walks in a day is 2 times the distance to work, which is 2 * 3 miles = 6 miles.

Now, we multiply the daily miles by the number of days he works in a week: 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week.

1. Elise writes the alphabet in full twice, which means she writes 26 letters each time. So, she writes 26 x 2 = 52 letters.

2. Then, she writes half of the alphabet, which is 26 / 2 = 13 letters.

3. So far, Elise has written 52 + 13 = 65 letters.

4. Now, she re-writes everything she has already written. This means she re-writes 65 letters.

5. To find the total number of letters Elise has written, we add the letters she re-wrote to the total she had before: 65 + 65 = 130.

"This problem can be solved using the concept of exponential growth, which is characteristic of a geometric progression. 

In the first round, Ali calls 3 families. In the second round, each of those 3 families calls 3 other families, resulting in 3 * 3 = 9 new families being notified. 

In the third round, each of the 9 families from the second round calls 3 other families, resulting in 9 * 3 = 27 new families being notified. 

In the fourth round, each of the 27 families from the third round calls 3 other families, resulting in 27 * 3 = 81 new families being notified.

However, we also need to consider the families that were notified in the previous rounds. In the first round, 3 families were notified. In the second round, 9 new families were notified, but the 3 families from the first round are also still being notified, so the total is 3 + 9 = 12. In the third round, 27 new families were notified, but the 12 families from the previous rounds are also still being notified, so the total is 12 + 27 = 39. 

In the fourth round, 81 new families are being notified, but the 39 families from the previous rounds are also still being notified, so the total is 39 + 81 = 120.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of toys in the larger play set that Jonathan wants to have. Since James's play set has 80 toys and Jonathan wants a play set five times larger, we can calculate the total number of toys in Jonathan's desired play set as follows:

5 * 80 = 400 toys

Since Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to reach this total, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

x + 2 = 400

where x is the number of toys Jonathan currently has. To solve for x, we can subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

x = 400 - 2
x = 398

Therefore, Jonathan currently has 398 toys.

"To find the total cost of the items Daniel wants to buy, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then apply the 10% discount.

The cost of 5 notebooks at $1.50 each is 5 x $1.50 = $7.50.
The cost of 2 pens at $0.25 each is 2 x $0.25 = $0.50.
The cost of 1 calculator at $12 is $12.
The cost of 1 geometry set at $10 is $10.

The total cost of all the items before the discount is $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30.

To apply the 10% discount, we need to find 10% of $30, which is 0.10 x $30 = $3.
The total cost after the discount is $30 - $3 = $27.

Therefore, Daniel has to spend $27 on all the items he wants to buy.

Since Bill wants to have 2 bottles of water for each of his 70 guests, the total number of bottles he needs is 70 * 2 = 140 bottles.

To find out how many additional bottles he needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles he needs: 140 - 48 = 92 bottles.

Therefore, Bill needs to buy 92 additional bottles of water.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. 

When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold. Since it takes Ray 16 minutes to swim a mile in cold water, twice that time is 2 * 16 = 32 minutes. Adding 2 minutes to that gives us 32 + 2 = 34 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water. 

In cold water, it takes Ray 16 minutes to swim a mile, so to swim 3 miles it will take him 3 * 16 = 48 minutes.

In warm water, it takes Ray 34 minutes to swim a mile, so to swim 3 miles it will take him 3 * 34 = 102 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many cups of coffee Juan currently drinks. Since Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks, and Octavia drinks half the daily recommended amount, we need to find the daily recommended amount first.

Let's assume the daily recommended amount is x cups. Since Octavia drinks half of this amount, she drinks x/2 cups. Since Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks, Juan drinks 10 * (x/2) = 5x cups.

We are given that the daily recommended amount is 4 cups. Therefore, x = 4.

Now, we can find out how many cups Juan currently drinks: 5x = 5 * 4 = 20 cups.

Since Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups, we need to find the difference between his current intake and the recommended intake: 20 - 4 = 16 cups.

Therefore, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups.

Susan's weight is 20 pounds less than Mark's, so Susan's weight is 150 - 20 = 130 pounds. 
Bob's weight is twice as much as Susan's, so Bob's weight is 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, we need to find the average weight of the three friends. To do this, we add their weights and divide by 3. 
Average weight = (Mark's weight + Susan's weight + Bob's weight) / 3 
Average weight = (150 + 130 + 260) / 3 
Average weight = 540 / 3

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total angle the sun will be from the ground after 10 hours. 

The initial angle of the pyramid from the ground is 32 degrees. The sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, so its initial angle from the ground is 0 degrees (since it's directly above the pyramid). 

The sun moves 5 degrees per hour, so after 10 hours, it will move 5 * 10 = 50 degrees.

However, since the sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, we need to add the initial angle of the pyramid to the angle the sun moves. 

So, the total angle from the ground to the sun will be 32 (initial angle of the pyramid) + 50 (angle the sun moves) = 82 degrees.

"To determine the number of candles James needs, we first need to find the total number of candles required for both sons. Since one son is 12 years old and the other is 4 years younger, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Typically, birthday candles are used in the same number as the age of the person. Therefore, James needs 12 candles for the older son and 8 candles for the younger son, totaling 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we need to find out how many packs James needs to buy. To do this, we divide the total number of candles needed (20) by the number of candles per pack (5). 

20 / 5 = 4

Since James needs 4 packs of candles, and each pack costs $3, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack to find the total cost.

4 * 3 = 12

James spends $12 on candles.

"To find out how many pages Judy read in the first week, we need to calculate the total minutes she read in the first week and then convert that to pages. 

In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night. Since there are 7 nights in a week, she read for a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes in the first week.

Given that Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we can calculate the number of pages she read in the first week as follows: 
(105 minutes / 1.5 minutes) * 2 pages = 140 pages.

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

To find the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we add the pages read in the first week and the second week:

Anna's goals + 45 = 80

To find Anna's goals, we need to subtract 45 from 80:

Anna's goals = 80 - 45
Anna's goals = 35

Now, we know that Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark. We also know that Richie scored 80 goals. So, we can set up an equation to find out how many goals Mark scored:

Mark's goals + 20 = 80

To find Mark's goals, we need to subtract 20 from 80:

Mark's goals = 80 - 20
Mark's goals = 60

Now that we know how many goals each of the three teenagers scored, we can add them up to find the total number of goals:

Total goals = Richie's goals + Mark's goals + Anna's goals
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35
Total goals = 175

The final answer is: 175"
"To find out how much more money Mitchell made than Liam, we need to calculate the total amount of money each of them made and then subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings.

Liam made $63 in total.

Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 apiece, so we multiply the number of lemonades by the price per lemonade: 21 * 4 = 84.

Now, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings: 84 - 63 = 21.

Mitchell made $21 more than Liam that weekend.

The final answer is: $21"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Peter spent on wooden action figures and the total amount of money he has left to spend on plastic action figures.

First, let's calculate the amount of money Peter spent on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday. Since he spent an equal amount each day, we can divide the total number of days (4) by 4 to find the amount spent each day. 

4 days * $5 per day = $20 spent on wooden action figures.

Now, let's calculate the amount of money Peter has left. He started with $70 and spent $20 on wooden action figures.

$70 - $20 = $50 left

Since Peter will spend an equal amount each day for the rest of the week, we need to calculate the number of days left in the week. There are 7 days in a week, and he has already spent 4 days, so there are 3 days left.

Now, let's calculate the amount of money Peter will spend each day on plastic action figures.

$50 / 3 days = $16.67 per day

Since Peter can't buy a fraction of an action figure, we'll round down to $16 per day.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Peter will spend on plastic action figures.

3 days * $16 per day = $48

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Peter will have spent by the end of the week.

$20 (wooden action figures) + $48 (plastic action figures) = $68

Now, let's calculate the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week.

Wooden action figures: 4 days * $5 per day = 4 action figures
Plastic action figures: $48 / $2 per action figure = 24 action figures

Total action figures: 4 + 24 = 28 action figures

The final answer is: 28"
"To calculate the total cost of the kitten, we need to add up the cost of spaying, vaccines, and the broken vases.

The cost of spaying is $200.
The cost of 3 vaccines is 3 x $20 = $60.
The cost of 4 broken vases is 4 x $12 = $48.

Now, let's add up the costs: $200 (spaying) + $60 (vaccines) + $48 (broken vases) = $308.

The final answer is: $308"
"To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we first need to calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week and then per month.

The total number of roses ordered per week is 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered per month is 65 * 4 = 260 roses.

Ford grows 40 roses every week, so the total number of roses he grows per month is 40 * 4 = 160 roses.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the total number of roses he grows per month from the total number of roses ordered per month: 260 - 160 = 100 roses.

The final answer is: 100"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Katina will remove from her account over 2 years. 

There are 12 months in a year, so in 2 years, there are 2 x 12 = 24 months. 

Katina removes $100 from her account every month, so the total amount removed will be 24 x $100 = $2400.

To find the remaining amount in her account, we subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount: $3000 - $2400 = $600.

The final answer is: $600"
"To calculate the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost.

Total revenue = Number of sandwiches sold * Price per sandwich
Total revenue = 10 sandwiches * $7.00/sandwich = $70.00

Now, let's calculate the total cost. 

Cost of bread per sandwich = $3.00/loaf / 10 sandwiches/loaf = $0.30/sandwich
Cost of cheese and condiments per sandwich = $30.00/10 sandwiches = $3.00/sandwich
Total cost per sandwich = $0.30/sandwich + $3.00/sandwich = $3.30/sandwich
Total cost = Total cost per sandwich * Number of sandwiches sold
Total cost = $3.30/sandwich * 10 sandwiches = $33.00

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00
Net profit = $37.00

The final answer is: $37.00"
"To find out how much money Kate can make, we need to determine the total number of muffin crayons she can make and then multiply that by the price of each muffin crayon.

First, let's find the total number of crayon pieces. Since there are 3 boxes of 64 crayons, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of crayons per box:

3 boxes * 64 crayons/box = 192 crayon pieces

Since Kate melts 8 small pieces of crayons together to make one muffin crayon, we divide the total number of crayon pieces by 8 to find the total number of muffin crayons:

192 crayon pieces / 8 pieces/muffin crayon = 24 muffin crayons

Now, we multiply the number of muffin crayons by the price of each muffin crayon to find the total amount of money Kate can make:

24 muffin crayons * $1.50/muffin crayon = $36

The final answer is: $36"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the area of the bedroom and then calculate the costs for each component.

The area of the bedroom is length x width = 18 feet x 12 feet = 216 square feet.

The cost of the new carpet is $12 per square foot, so the total cost of the carpet is 216 square feet x $12/square foot = $2592.

The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot, so the total cost of the padding is 216 square feet x $2/square foot = $432.

The cost of removing the old carpet is $4 per square foot, so the total cost of removing the old carpet is 216 square feet x $4/square foot = $864.

The cost of installing the new carpet is $34 per square foot, so the total cost of installing the new carpet is 216 square feet x $34/square foot = $7344.

The total cost is the sum of the costs of the carpet, padding, removing the old carpet, and installing the new carpet: $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344 = $11332.

The final answer is: $11332"
"To find the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we need to calculate the total number of birds he saw over the week and then divide it by the number of days.

Total number of birds = 50 (days 1 and 2) + 0 (day 3) + 120 (days 4 and 5) + 20 (day 6) + 90 (day 7)
Total number of birds = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90
Total number of birds = 280

Number of days = 7

Average number of birds per day = Total number of birds / Number of days
Average number of birds per day = 280 / 7
Average number of birds per day = 40

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. The starting value of the number train is 20.
2. Half of the starting value is 20 / 2 = 10.
3. The starting value plus half the number is 20 + 10 = 30.
4. The resulting value is divided by 5, so 30 / 5 = 6.
5. The resulting value is multiplied by the starting value minus 12, so 6 * (20 - 12) = 6 * 8 = 48.

The final value of the number train is 48."
"To find the total number of cards the brothers have together, we first need to determine the number of cards each brother has. 

The boy has 5 cards. His brother has 3 fewer cards than he has, so his brother has 5 - 3 = 2 cards.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the percentage by which the oven is off. 

First, let's find the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature: 468 - 450 = 18.

Next, let's find the percentage by which the oven is off: (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%.

Now, we need to find the temperature that Maggie should set the oven to in order to achieve 520 degrees. Since the oven is off by 4%, we need to find the temperature that is 4% less than 520.

Let's call the set temperature 'x'. We can set up the equation: x - (4% of x) = 520.

To find 4% of x, we can multiply x by 0.04: x - 0.04x = 520.

Combine like terms: 0.96x = 520.

Now, divide both sides by 0.96: x = 520 / 0.96.

x = 541.67.

So, Maggie should set the oven to 541.67 degrees."
"To find the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to convert the time of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time as follows:
1 hour = 60 minutes
Adding the 30 minutes, we get:
60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting the time to minutes:
2 hours = 2 x 60 minutes = 120 minutes
Adding the 5 minutes, we get:
120 minutes + 5 minutes = 125 minutes

Now, we add the time of both movies together:
90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes

The total time Max will spend watching the two movies is 215 minutes.

"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house price and subtract it from Herb's house price. 

30% of $76,000 = 0.30 * $76,000 = $22,800

Now, subtract $22,800 from Herb's house price to find Juan's house price:
$76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200

The combined value of the two houses is the sum of their individual prices:
$76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200

The final answer is: $129,200"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of cups Judy brought is 12, and the total number of cups her friend brought is 40. The total number of cups is 12 + 40 = 52.

The total number of dishes Judy brought is 24, and the total number of dishes her friend brought is 44. The total number of dishes is 24 + 44 = 68.

The total number of utensils (cups and dishes) brought by the two is 52 + 68 = 120.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the cost per pair of contacts, we first need to determine the total number of contacts in 2 boxes and the total cost of 2 boxes with the discount.

Since 90 contacts last Pete 45 days, we can calculate the number of contacts he uses per day: 90 contacts / 45 days = 2 contacts per day.

In 2 boxes, there are 2 * 90 = 180 contacts.

The original price of 2 boxes is 2 * $100 = $200. With a 10% discount, the discount amount is $200 * 0.10 = $20. The discounted price is $200 - $20 = $180.

Now, to find the cost per pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts: $180 / 180 contacts = $1 per contact.

Since a pair of contacts is 2 contacts, the cost per pair is $1 * 2 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we need to calculate their individual earnings first.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, for a total of 3 hours. Her hourly wage is $10, so her total earnings are 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 hours. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, which is 3 * 1 = 3 hours. So, John worked a total of 4 + 3 = 7 hours. His total earnings are 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

"To find out how much water Hannah needs to drink, we need to calculate the total calories she burns during her activities. 

First, let's calculate the calories burned during aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories.

Next, let's calculate the calories burned during running: 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories.

Now, let's add the calories burned during both activities: 1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we need to divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many 200-calorie units there are: 1600 calories / 200 calories = 8.

Finally, we multiply the number of 200-calorie units by the amount of water needed per unit: 8 * 100 ml = 800 ml.

The final answer is: 800"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume the number of blue jelly beans is x. 

Since there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans, the number of red jelly beans is 0.99x.

Since there are 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans, the number of green jelly beans is 1.01x.

The total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can set up the equation:

x + 0.99x + 1.01x = 4500

Combine like terms:

2.99x = 4500

Divide both sides by 2.99:

x = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

Red jelly beans: 0.99x = 0.99(1500) = 1485
Green jelly beans: 1.01x = 1.01(1500) = 1515

To find the difference between the number of green and red jelly beans, subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to first calculate how many grams of protein he gets per day. 

Since a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein, we can find the protein percentage in a cup of mushrooms by dividing the protein by the weight: 3 grams / 100 grams = 0.03 or 3%.

Now, we know that John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day. To find out how many grams of protein he gets per day, we multiply the weight of mushrooms he eats by the protein percentage: 200 grams * 0.03 = 6 grams of protein per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7 to find the weekly protein intake: 6 grams/day * 7 days/week = 42 grams of protein per week.

The final answer is: 42"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let Jerry's current age be 'x'. 

Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can write an equation based on this information:

x = 2(x - 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting 2x from both sides gives us:

-x = -10

Dividing both sides by -1, we get:

x = 10

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old.

To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

x + 3 = 10 + 3
x + 3 = 13

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

"Let's denote the smallest angle as 'x'. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, which is 2x, and one angle is three times the smallest angle, which is 3x.

Since the three angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:

One angle is twice the smallest angle: 2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees
One angle is three times the smallest angle: 3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the plane's rate of travel. We can do this by dividing the distance traveled (1200 miles) by the time taken (3 hours).

Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Rate = 400 miles per hour

Now that we know the plane's rate, we can find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles.

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

Since the question asks for the additional hours, we need to subtract the initial time (3 hours) from the total time (5 hours).

Additional hours = Total time - Initial time
Additional hours = 5 hours - 3 hours
Additional hours = 2 hours

"To find the total amount of chocolates made by Marissa in an hour, we need to first find out how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz makes in an hour. 

Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. To find out how many pounds he makes in an hour, we divide 120 by 2. 

120 / 2 = 60 pounds per hour for Ruiz.

Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in an hour. To find out how many pounds Marissa makes in an hour, we multiply 60 by 3/4.

60 * (3/4) = 45 pounds per hour for Marissa.

Now, we know that both Ruiz and Marissa work for 12 hours a day. To find the total amount of chocolates made by Ruiz in 12 hours, we multiply 60 by 12.

60 * 12 = 720 pounds for Ruiz.

To find the total amount of chocolates made by Marissa in 12 hours, we multiply 45 by 12.

45 * 12 = 540 pounds for Marissa.

"To find the total amount of money Patrick earned, we need to calculate the total number of cups sold and the total revenue from each period, then add them together.

In the first four hours, Patrick sold 15 cups per hour at $0.50 per cup. 
Total cups sold in the first four hours = 15 cups/hour * 4 hours = 60 cups
Total revenue in the first four hours = 60 cups * $0.50/cup = $30

In the next two hours, Patrick sold 10 cups per hour at $0.60 per cup.
Total cups sold in the next two hours = 10 cups/hour * 2 hours = 20 cups
Total revenue in the next two hours = 20 cups * $0.60/cup = $12

Total revenue from selling lemonade for 6 hours = Total revenue in the first four hours + Total revenue in the next two hours
Total revenue = $30 + $12 = $42

The final answer is: $42"
"To find out how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to calculate the total number of rotations the tire can handle and divide it by the number of rotations per 2 miles, then divide the result by the number of miles Jeremy drives per month.

First, let's find out how many rotations the tire can handle per mile: 
725 rotations / 2 miles = 362.5 rotations per mile

Now, let's find out how many rotations the tire can handle in total: 
10,440,000 rotations

Now, let's find out how many miles the tire can handle: 
10,440,000 rotations / 362.5 rotations per mile = 28,700 miles

Now, let's find out how many months the tire can handle: 
28,700 miles / 400 miles per month = 71.75 months

Now, let's convert months to years: 
71.75 months / 12 months per year = 5.99 years

"To find the cost per pump, we need to first find the total number of pumps in the bottle. Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, and Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, the total number of pumps in the bottle is 120 * 2 = 240 pumps.

The total cost of the shampoo is $24.00, which is equivalent to 2400 cents (since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents).

Now, to find the cost per pump, we divide the total cost by the total number of pumps: 2400 cents / 240 pumps = 10 cents per pump.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Joe wants to buy, and then subtract that from the initial amount of money he has.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount. The shirt costs $25 and the shorts cost $35, so the total cost is $25 + $35 = $60.

Since there is a 30% off sale, we need to calculate the discount amount. To do this, we multiply the total cost by the discount percentage (30% or 0.3). The discount amount is $60 * 0.3 = $18.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final cost of the items. $60 - $18 = $42.

Since sales tax is included, we don't need to add any additional tax to the final cost. Joe will pay $42 for the items.

To find out how much money Joe will have left, we subtract the final cost from the initial amount of money he has. $50 - $42 = $8.

The final answer is: $8"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of croissants Juan wants to make and then determine the total amount of butter required.

First, let's calculate the total number of croissants Juan wants to make in a week. Since he wants to make 4 dozen croissants per day, and there are 7 days in a week, we multiply 4 dozen by 7:

4 dozen/day * 7 days = 28 dozen

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, we can convert 28 dozen to individual croissants:

28 dozen * 12 croissants/dozen = 336 croissants

Now, we know it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. To find out how much butter is needed for 336 croissants, we need to multiply the amount of butter required for 1 dozen croissants by 336:

(1/4 pound/dozen) * 336 croissants = (1/4) * 336

To multiply a fraction by a whole number, we multiply the numerator (1) by the whole number (336) and keep the denominator (4) the same:

(1 * 336) / 4 = 84

So, Juan will need 84 pounds of butter to make 336 croissants.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the cost of repaving Lewis' street, we need to multiply the cost per meter by the length of his street. 

Cost per meter: $194
Length of Lewis' street: 490 meters

Cost to repave Lewis' street = Cost per meter * Length of Lewis' street
Cost to repave Lewis' street = $194 * 490
Cost to repave Lewis' street = $95,060

To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's, we need to first find the cost to repave Monica's street and then subtract it from the cost to repave Lewis' street.

Cost to repave Monica's street = Cost per meter * Length of Monica's street
Cost to repave Monica's street = $194 * 150
Cost to repave Monica's street = $29,100

Now, we subtract the cost to repave Monica's street from the cost to repave Lewis' street:
Difference in cost = Cost to repave Lewis' street - Cost to repave Monica's street
Difference in cost = $95,060 - $29,100
Difference in cost = $65,960

The final answer is: $65,960"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. First, we need to find the total number of months the research took. Since it took 10 times longer than the initial 5 months, the total number of months is 5 + (10 - 1) = 14 months.

2. The initial funding was $100,000 for the first 5 months. For the remaining 9 months, the funding increased by 50%. This means the funding for the remaining months is 1.5 times the initial funding.

3. The funding for the first 5 months is $100,000. The funding for the remaining 9 months is 1.5 * $100,000 = $150,000 per month. The total funding for the remaining months is 9 * $150,000 = $1,350,000.

4. To find the total cost of the research, we add the funding for the first 5 months and the funding for the remaining 9 months: $100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000.

The final answer is: $1,450,000"
"To find the total amount of meat consumed, we need to calculate the amount eaten by the first, second, and third players. 

The first player ate a 6-ounce steak. 
The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so 8 ounces of beef tips. 
The third player ate a one-pound steak, which is equivalent to 16 ounces (1 pound = 16 ounces).

Now, let's add up the total amount of meat consumed: 
6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces.

There are 31 days in March. 

Each member posts an average of 3 posts per day. With 1000 members, the total number of posts per day is 1000 * 3 = 3000 posts.

Now, we multiply the total number of posts per day by the number of days in March: 3000 * 31 = 93,000.

The total number of posts in March is 93,000."
"To find out how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to calculate the total amount of water used in a year and then multiply it by the cost of a gallon of water.

Gary does laundry twice a week, which means he does laundry 52 times in a year (since there are 52 weeks in a year). Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water, so the total amount of water used in a year is:

52 loads/year * 20 gallons/load = 1040 gallons/year

The cost of a gallon of water is $0.15, so the total cost of water used in a year is:

1040 gallons/year * $0.15/gallon = $156/year

Therefore, Gary spends $156 on water for laundry in a year.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Scarlett bought. 

First, let's calculate the cost of the rocks: 2 bags of rocks at $2.50 each is 2 x $2.50 = $5.00.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the coral: 3 pieces of coral at $2.00 each is 3 x $2.00 = $6.00.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the fish: 20 fish at $0.50 each is 20 x $0.50 = $10.00.

The cost of the fish food is $2.00.

The total cost of the items is the sum of the costs of the rocks, coral, fish, and fish food: $5.00 + $6.00 + $10.00 + $2.00 = $23.00.

However, we also need to add the cost of the aquarium, which was $10.00.

So, the total amount Scarlett spent is $23.00 + $10.00 = $33.00.

"To find the number of students, we first need to find the total number of seats in the auditorium. 

Total number of seats = Number of rows * Number of seats per row
Total number of seats = 4 * 18
Total number of seats = 72

One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators. 
Number of seats occupied by administrators = Total number of seats * (1/4)
Number of seats occupied by administrators = 72 * (1/4)
Number of seats occupied by administrators = 18

Remaining seats after administrators = Total number of seats - Number of seats occupied by administrators
Remaining seats after administrators = 72 - 18
Remaining seats after administrators = 54

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents. 
Number of seats occupied by parents = Remaining seats after administrators * (1/3)
Number of seats occupied by parents = 54 * (1/3)
Number of seats occupied by parents = 18

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he will chew 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

2. He chews 1 piece of gum on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner. So, in total, he chews 4 (at school) + 1 (on the way home) + 1 (after dinner) = 6 pieces of gum.

3. Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

4. He gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. Half of 14 is 14 / 2 = 7. So, he gives 7 pieces to his sister.

5. After giving 7 pieces to his sister, Jim is left with 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum.

"To find out how much James made, we need to calculate the profit from selling the cars, then apply his commission to that profit.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the cars: 10 cars * $25,000 = $250,000.

The company paid 30% of the cost to acquire the cars, so the amount they paid is 0.3 * $250,000 = $75,000.

The profit from selling the cars is the selling price minus the cost to acquire them: $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.

James gets a 10% commission on the profit, so his commission is 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

Therefore, James made $17,500.

"To find the total price for all three jewels, we need to first find the prices of the gold and silver jewels.

Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, and the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond jewel, we can calculate the price of the gold jewel as follows:

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * Price of diamond jewel
= (4/5) * $2000
= $1600

The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold, so we can calculate the price of the silver jewel as follows:

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
= $1600 - $400
= $1200

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

"To solve this problem, we need to find the relative speed between Bob and Tom, and then use that to calculate the time it will take for Tom to catch up.

First, let's find the relative speed between Bob and Tom. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract Tom's speed from Bob's speed to get the relative speed.

Relative speed = Bob's speed - Tom's speed
Relative speed = 55 mph - 70 mph
Relative speed = -15 mph

However, since we are looking for the time it will take for Tom to catch up, we need to consider the absolute value of the relative speed, which is the speed at which Tom is closing the gap.

Absolute relative speed = 15 mph

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed to find the time it will take for Tom to catch up.

Time = Distance / Absolute relative speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of classes Manny can miss before the average cost per class exceeds $10.

Let's assume Manny misses x classes. Since there are 10 total classes, he will attend 10 - x classes.

The total cost of the classes he attends is $60. 

The average cost per class is the total cost divided by the number of classes attended. We want this to be less than or equal to $10.

So, we can set up the inequality:

60 / (10 - x) ≤ 10

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by (10 - x):

60 ≤ 10(10 - x)

Expanding the right side:

60 ≤ 100 - 10x

Subtracting 60 from both sides:

0 ≤ 40 - 10x

Subtracting 40 from both sides:

-40 ≤ -10x

Dividing both sides by -10 (remembering to flip the inequality sign):

4 ≥ x

Since x represents the number of classes Manny can miss, we want the smallest integer value of x that satisfies this inequality. Therefore, Manny can miss 4 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

The cost of 4 apples is $5.20, so the cost of one apple is $5.20 / 4 = $1.30. 

The cost of 3 oranges is $3.30, so the cost of one orange is $3.30 / 3 = $1.10.

Now, we can find the cost of 5 apples: 5 apples * $1.30/apple = $6.50.

Next, we can find the cost of 5 oranges: 5 oranges * $1.10/orange = $5.50.

Finally, we can find the total cost by adding the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges: $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add them to the base price.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade costs $7,500.

The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of the leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of the running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the features and the base price:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

The sister company publishes 10 articles per day, and there are 28 days in February. So, the total number of articles published by the sister company in February is:

10 articles/day * 28 days = 280 articles

Now, we add the total number of articles published by both websites:

560 articles (news website) + 280 articles (sister company) = 840 articles

The final answer is: 840"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Steve's age is given as 60 years.
2. His wife is 4 years older than him, so his wife's age is 60 + 4 = 64 years.
3. Their son is half as old as his mom, so the son's age is 64 / 2 = 32 years.
4. The son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, so the son's wife's age is 32 - 3 = 29 years.

The final answer is: 29"
"To find the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions, we need to first find the total amount of flour in one bag and then multiply it by 3.

Since the bag is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, the total amount of flour in one bag is 8 * 2 = 16 kilograms.

Now, we multiply the amount of flour in one bag by 3 to find the total amount of flour in three bags: 16 * 3 = 48 kilograms.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley, we need to calculate the distance each of them biked and then add them together.

Alisa biked at 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours. To find the distance she biked, we multiply her speed by the time: 
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 12 miles/hour x 4.5 hours
Distance = 54 miles

Stanley biked at 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours. To find the distance he biked, we multiply his speed by the time:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour x 2.5 hours
Distance = 25 miles

Now, we add the distances biked by Alisa and Stanley to find the total distance:
Total Distance = Distance biked by Alisa + Distance biked by Stanley
Total Distance = 54 miles + 25 miles
Total Distance = 79 miles

The final answer is: 79"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay separately, and then add them together.

Time to dig through soil: 
Distance to be dug through soil = 24 feet
Rate of digging through soil = 4 feet/hour
Time to dig through soil = Distance / Rate = 24 / 4 = 6 hours

Time to dig through clay: 
Distance to be dug through clay = 8 feet
Rate of digging through clay = 4 feet/hour / 2 = 2 feet/hour
Time to dig through clay = Distance / Rate = 8 / 2 = 4 hours

Total time to dig the well = Time to dig through soil + Time to dig through clay = 6 + 4 = 10 hours

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Fishio received 2000 likes on her selfie.

Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times as many as the initial number of likes. 
So, the number of likes after 3 weeks = 70 * 2000 = 140000.

Now, she received 20000 more new likes recently. 
So, the total number of likes = 140000 + 20000 = 160000.

The final answer is: 160000"
"To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost of the pomegranates on each day and then subtract the two amounts.

On the first day, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, but she got a $2 discount. So, the total cost is:

20 pomegranates * $20 = $400
Discount: $2
Total cost = $400 - $2 = $398

On the second day, the price of each pomegranate is $30, and there's a 10% discount on the total cost. So, the total cost is:

20 pomegranates * $30 = $600
Discount: 10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
Total cost = $600 - $60 = $540

Now, let's find the difference between the two total costs:

Difference = $398 - $540 = -$142

The negative sign indicates that Clara paid less on the first day. However, the question asks for the difference in the final prices paid, so we'll ignore the negative sign and consider the absolute difference:

Absolute difference = $142"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. In the first month, Ariadne's sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. This means her sales from green hats were 2 times the sales from red hats, which is 2 * $400 = $800.

2. The total sales in the first month are the sum of sales from red and green hats, which is $400 + $800 = $1200.

3. In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. So, the sales in the second month are (3/4) * $1200 = $900.

4. To find the total amount she made in two months, we add the sales of the first and second months, which is $1200 + $900 = $2100.

The final answer is: $2100"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the number of paid hours and the cost for each hour. 

James hired the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. However, he gets 1 hour free, so he only paid for 3 hours.

The first paid hour costs $15. Each subsequent hour costs twice the previous hour, so the second hour costs $15 * 2 = $30, and the third hour costs $30 * 2 = $60.

The total cost is the sum of the costs for each hour: $15 + $30 + $60 = $105.

The final answer is: $105"
"To find out how many dollars were withheld from Sally's wage, we need to calculate the difference between her expected wage and the actual amount she received. 

First, let's find out how much money Sally should have in her account if she received her full wage. Since her weekly wage is $300, and her account held $200 at the start of the week, the total amount she should have in her account is $200 (initial amount) + $300 (expected wage) = $500.

However, her account now holds $420. To find out how much was withheld, we subtract the actual amount from the expected amount: $500 (expected amount) - $420 (actual amount) = $80.

So, $80 was withheld from Sally's wage.

The final answer is: $80"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of deviled egg halves Lori's guests will eat and then divide that by 2, since each egg makes 2 halves. 

First, we calculate the total number of deviled egg halves Lori's guests will eat: 16 guests * 3 deviled egg halves per guest = 48 deviled egg halves.

Since each egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, we divide the total number of deviled egg halves by 2: 48 / 2 = 24 eggs.

To find out how many dozens of eggs Lori needs, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 (since there are 12 eggs in a dozen): 24 / 12 = 2.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many pages Shiela has left to write, we need to determine the total number of pages she has already written and subtract that from the total required pages.

Since Shiela has finished writing 1/3 of the paper, we can calculate the number of pages she has written as follows:

1/3 of 15 pages = (1/3) * 15 = 5 pages

Now, we subtract the number of pages she has written from the total required pages:

15 pages (total) - 5 pages (written) = 10 pages

So, Shiela has 10 pages left to write.

"To determine how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading, we need to calculate how many days it will take him to read the entire book at his planned rate.

Mike plans to read 10 pages a day. The total number of pages in the book is 200. 

To find out how many days it will take Mike to read the book, we divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he plans to read per day: 

200 pages / 10 pages per day = 20 days

Since Mike has 30 days to complete the assignment, we need to find out how many days before the deadline he will finish his reading. 

To do this, we subtract the number of days it will take him to read the book from the total number of days he has: 

30 days - 20 days = 10 days

Therefore, Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline.

"To find the total cost of the plane for the first year, we need to calculate the cost of the plane itself, the cost of renting the hanger, and the cost of fuel.

The cost of the plane is $150,000.

The cost of renting the hanger is $5000 per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total cost of renting the hanger for the first year is $5000 * 12 = $60,000.

The cost of fuel is twice the cost of renting the hanger, which is $5000 * 2 = $10,000 per month. The total cost of fuel for the first year is $10,000 * 12 = $120,000.

Now, we add up the cost of the plane, the cost of renting the hanger, and the cost of fuel to find the total cost of the plane for the first year.

Total cost = Cost of plane + Cost of renting hanger + Cost of fuel
Total cost = $150,000 + $60,000 + $120,000
Total cost = $230,000

The final answer is: $230,000"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. It took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice.
2. It took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, so it took her 30 + 20 = 50 minutes to cook pork.
3. Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. Half of 80 is 40 minutes.
4. To find the total cooking time, we need to add the cooking time of rice, pork, and beans. Total cooking time = 30 (rice) + 50 (pork) + 40 (beans) = 120 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture and then find the difference between them.

For the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts), we need to find the total cost. 

Cost of almonds in the first mixture = (1/2 pound) * $10/pound = $5
Cost of walnuts in the first mixture = (1/3 pound) * $15/pound = $5
Total cost of the first mixture = $5 + $5 = $10

For the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts), we need to find the total cost.

Cost of almonds in the second mixture = (1/5 pound) * $10/pound = $2
Cost of walnuts in the second mixture = (1/3 pound) * $15/pound = $5
Total cost of the second mixture = $2 + $5 = $7

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between the two mixtures.

Difference in cost = Total cost of the first mixture - Total cost of the second mixture
= $10 - $7

"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of sheep as S and the number of geese as G.

Since sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs, the total number of legs can be represented as:
4S + 2G = 70

We also know that the total number of animal heads is 20, and since each animal has one head, we can represent this as:
S + G = 20

Now, we have a system of two equations:

1) 4S + 2G = 70
2) S + G = 20

We can solve this system of equations by multiplying the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of G in both equations equal:
2(S + G) = 2(20)
S + 2G = 40

Now, we can subtract this new equation from the first equation to eliminate G:
(4S + 2G) - (S + 2G) = 70 - 40
3S = 30

Dividing both sides by 3 gives us:
S = 10

Therefore, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is 10.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee and the cost of the donut. 

First, let's find the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more. 

20% of $5 is 0.2 * $5 = $1. 
So, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

Since Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day and he buys a week's worth, he buys 7 pounds of coffee. 

The cost of the more expensive coffee is 7 * $6 = $42. 
The cost of the donut is $2.

The total cost is $42 + $2 = $44.

The final answer is: $44"
"To find the cost of the apple pie, we need to subtract the total cost of the items Gus bought from the total amount he spent. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Gus bought:

2 bags of chips for $2.00 each = 2 x $2.00 = $4.00
Adding the cost of the bucket of fried chicken: $4.00 + $8.00 = $12.00
Adding the cost of the bottle of soda: $12.00 + $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's subtract the total cost of the items from the total amount Gus spent:

Total amount spent = $20.00
Total cost of items = $13.00
Cost of the apple pie = Total amount spent - Total cost of items = $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

The cost of the apple pie is $7.00.

"To find out how many recipes John learns, we need to calculate the total class time and then divide it by the time it takes to learn a new recipe.

The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time, so the total class time per week is 4 * 2 = 8 hours.

Since the class lasts for 6 weeks, the total class time is 8 hours/week * 6 weeks = 48 hours.

John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time. To find out how many recipes he learns, we need to divide the total class time by 1.5 hours.

Number of recipes learned = Total class time / Time to learn a new recipe

"To find the number of math teachers, we first need to find the number of history teachers and then subtract that from the total number of teachers. 

60% of 150 teachers are history teachers. To find 60% of 150, we multiply 150 by 0.6. 

150 * 0.6 = 90

So, there are 90 history teachers. To find the number of math teachers, we subtract the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers.

150 - 90 = 60

There are 60 math teachers. 

Each math teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. To find the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day, we multiply the number of math teachers by the number of hours they sleep per day.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the amount of money Kassidy and Rayna have. 

First, we know Aurelia has $120. Since Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, we can calculate Kassidy's money as follows:
Kassidy's money = 3/4 * Aurelia's money
Kassidy's money = 3/4 * 120
Kassidy's money = 90

Now, we know Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy. So, we can calculate Rayna's money as follows:
Rayna's money = Kassidy's money + 60
Rayna's money = 90 + 60
Rayna's money = 150

Now that we have the money of all three, we can find the total amount of money they have together:
Total money = Aurelia's money + Kassidy's money + Rayna's money
Total money = 120 + 90 + 150
Total money = 360

To find out how much each would have if they decided to add together their money and share equally among them, we need to divide the total money by 3:
Money each would have = Total money / 3
Money each would have = 360 / 3
Money each would have = 120

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Christina had 12 good days, 8 bad days, and the rest were neutral. Since there are 30 days in total, the number of neutral days can be calculated as follows:

Total days = 30
Good days = 12
Bad days = 8
Neutral days = Total days - (Good days + Bad days)
Neutral days = 30 - (12 + 8)
Neutral days = 30 - 20
Neutral days = 10

However, we are given that the first 8 days were good, the next 8 days were bad, and the next 8 days were neutral. This means that the first 24 days are already accounted for.

Remaining days = Total days - First 24 days
Remaining days = 30 - 24
Remaining days = 6

We are also given that the next three days were good, neutral, and good. This means that 3 out of the remaining 6 days are already accounted for.

Remaining good days = Remaining days - 3
Remaining good days = 6 - 3
Remaining good days = 3

So, there are 3 good days left in the month.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of books Sally has as 'x'. According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be expressed as 2x + 3. We are also given that Janey has 21 books. 

So, we can set up the equation: 2x + 3 = 21.

To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable x. We can do this by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 21 - 3, which simplifies to 2x = 18.

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for x: x = 18 / 2, which simplifies to x = 9.

Therefore, Sally has 9 books.

"To solve this problem, we need to first convert the initial height of the bamboo from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so we multiply 20 feet by 12 inches per foot.

20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now, we need to find out how many inches the bamboo needs to grow to reach 600 inches. We subtract the current height from the target height.

600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches a day, we can find the number of days it will take to reach 360 inches by dividing the target growth by the daily growth rate.

360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs. This means each dog has 1 toy. When 8 more dogs arrive, James needs 8 more toys to bring the total to 12 dogs with 1 toy each. So, he buys 8 more toys.

Now, there are 12 dogs, and James goes back to find that there are twice as many more dogs, which means there are 24 dogs in total (12 + 12). Since each dog needs 1 toy, James needs 24 toys. However, he already has 12 toys, so he needs 24 - 12 = 12 more toys.

When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs those toys. This means he needs 24 - 3 = 21 toys.

However, we need to consider the initial 12 toys James already had. So, the total number of toys James needs is 21 (for the 21 dogs) + 12 (initial toys) = 33 toys.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cookies Max and Summer have. 

Since Katarina has 68 cookies and she has 5 less than Max, Max must have 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.

Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, but we don't know how many cookies the Cookie Monster has. However, we can find out how many cookies Max has in relation to Summer. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Max has 73 - 23 = 50 cookies less than Summer. 

Since Max has 73 cookies, Summer must have 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Now we know the number of cookies each person has: Katarina has 68, Max has 73, and Summer has 96. To find the total number of cookies, we add these numbers together: 68 + 73 + 96 = 237.

Since Shania extended the dress by 50% of its original length, the new length after extension is x + 0.5x = 1.5x.

Then, she added 20cm to the bottom of the dress. So, the final length of the dress is 1.5x + 20 = 140cm.

Now, we need to solve for 'x'. 

1.5x + 20 = 140

Subtract 20 from both sides:
1.5x = 120

Divide both sides by 1.5:
x = 80

The original length of the dress was 80cm.

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes to mow half the lawn in each mode and then add those times together.

First, let's find the time it takes to mow half the lawn in turtle mode. Since it takes 1 hour to mow the entire lawn in turtle mode, it will take 0.5 hours to mow half the lawn. To convert this to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

0.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 30 minutes

Next, let's find the time it takes to mow half the lawn in rabbit mode. Since it takes 40 minutes to mow the entire lawn in rabbit mode, it will take 20 minutes to mow half the lawn (half of 40 minutes).

Now, we add the times together to find the total time it took to mow the lawn:

30 minutes (turtle mode) + 20 minutes (rabbit mode) = 50 minutes

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how much longer John and Jack have to get to school without being late, we need to calculate the total time they have taken so far and subtract that from the total time they have available.

They have 30 minutes to get to school. 

It takes them 6 minutes to get to the corner where the library is, and another 13 minutes to get to the fire station. 

So, the total time taken so far is 6 + 13 = 19 minutes.

Now, we subtract the time taken so far from the total time available: 30 - 19 = 11 minutes.

Therefore, John and Jack have 11 minutes to get to school without being late. 

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the total amount Catherine paid, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

The cost of 1 kilo of apples is $4.
The cost of 2 kilos of bananas is 2 * $2 = $4.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of cookies baked by Greta and Celinda, and then subtract the number of cookies they ate.

Greta bakes 30 cookies. 
Celinda bakes twice as many as Greta, so she bakes 2 * 30 = 60 cookies.

The total number of cookies baked is 30 + 60 = 90.

They eat 10 cookies, so the number of cookies left is 90 - 10 = 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"Let's denote the age of the younger twin as T, the age of the older twin as T+7, and the age of the triplet as t. 

Since there are two twins and one triplet, the total age of all three is 2T + (T+7) + t = 44.

Combine like terms: 3T + t + 7 = 44.

Subtract 7 from both sides: 3T + t = 37.

Since we don't know the exact ages of the twins and the triplet, we need to find a combination of T and t that satisfies the equation. 

Let's try to find a combination where T and t are integers. 

One possible combination is T = 10 and t = 13, which satisfies the equation 3T + t = 3(10) + 13 = 37.

Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, the older twin is T+7 = 10+7 = 17.

The final answer is: 17"
"To determine how many minutes John has to nap, we need to calculate the total time he spends on homework and subtract that from the total time available before dinner.

First, let's convert 3 hours to minutes: 3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time John spends on homework: 
20 minutes (math) + 40 minutes (reading) + 20 minutes (history) = 80 minutes.

Now, subtract the time spent on homework from the total available time: 
180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes.

John has 100 minutes to nap."
"To find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we first need to find the cost of one candy. 

We know that Manolo bought 5 lollipops and 4 candies for $3.20. The cost of 5 lollipops is 5 * $0.40 = $2. 

Now, we subtract the cost of 5 lollipops from the total cost to find the cost of 4 candies: $3.20 - $2 = $1.20. 

The cost of one candy is $1.20 / 4 = $0.30.

Now, we can find the total cost of 10 lollipops: 10 * $0.40 = $4.

The total cost of 10 candies is 10 * $0.30 = $3.

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $4 + $3 = $7.

The final answer is: $7"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many coins Rong and Neil save per month. 

Rong saves 20 coins per month. 
Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, which is 2/5 * 20 = 8 more coins than Rong. 
So, Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Now, let's calculate the total number of coins they save in a year. 
Rong saves 20 * 12 = 240 coins per year. 
Neil saves 28 * 12 = 336 coins per year.

Since they started saving 10 years ago, we need to multiply the number of coins they save per year by 10. 
Rong's total savings = 240 * 10 = 2400 coins. 
Neil's total savings = 336 * 10 = 3360 coins.

The total number of coins they have after 10 years is the sum of their individual savings. 
Total savings = Rong's savings + Neil's savings = 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins.

The final answer is: 5760"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check, and then subtract that from the amount John brought with him.

First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines: 2 vaccines at $20 each is 2 x $20 = $40.

Next, we need to find 60% of the total bill, which is the cost of the heartworm check. Since we don't know the total bill yet, let's represent it as x. The cost of the heartworm check is 0.6x.

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check: x = $40 + 0.6x.

To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. Subtract 0.6x from both sides: 0.4x = $40.

Now, divide both sides by 0.4: x = $100.

So, the total bill is $100. The cost of the heartworm check is 60% of $100, which is 0.6 x $100 = $60.

The total cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check is $40 + $60 = $100.

John brought $125 with him, so he leaves with $125 - $100 = $25.

The final answer is: $25"
"To find the total price of the crate, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and add them together.

The cost of one banana is twice as much as one apple, so it's 2 * $0.5 = $1.
The cost of one orange is three times as much as one banana, so it's 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of each type of fruit in one crate:
- Bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- Apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- Oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

Adding these costs together, we get the total price of the crate: $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

The final answer is: $32"
"To find the total number of square feet in Brittany's comforter, we need to calculate the total number of squares and multiply it by the area of each square (1 foot * 1 foot = 1 square foot).

First, let's find the number of blue squares. Since there are 4 more blue squares than red squares, and there are 14 red squares, the number of blue squares is 14 + 4 = 18.

Next, let's find the number of green squares. Since there are 6 more green squares than blue squares, and there are 18 blue squares, the number of green squares is 18 + 6 = 24.

Now, let's find the number of white squares. Since there are 12 fewer white squares than green squares, and there are 24 green squares, the number of white squares is 24 - 12 = 12.

Now, let's add up the total number of squares: 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68.

Since each square is 1 square foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

The final answer is: 68"
"To find out how many chairs Mia needs, we first need to determine the total number of chairs she has. Since there are 8 high chairs and the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, we can calculate the number of regular chairs by multiplying 8 by 5.

8 high chairs * 5 = 40 regular chairs

Now, we add the number of high chairs and regular chairs to find the total number of chairs.

8 high chairs + 40 regular chairs = 48 chairs

Since there will be 42 adults and 15 babies attending, we need to determine the total number of chairs needed. Babies will sit in high chairs, so we only need to consider the number of adults.

42 adults + 15 babies = 57 people

Since there are 57 people and 48 chairs, we need to find out how many more chairs Mia needs.

57 people - 48 chairs = 9 more chairs

"To find the number of 8-point bucks, we first need to find the total number of bucks in the field. Since 50% of the deer are bucks, we can calculate this as follows:

Total deer = 50
Percentage of bucks = 50%
Number of bucks = Total deer * Percentage of bucks
= 50 * 0.5
= 25

Next, we need to find the number of 8-point bucks. Since 20% of the bucks are 8-point, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of 8-point bucks = Number of bucks * Percentage of 8-point bucks
= 25 * 0.2
= 5

Therefore, there are 5 8-point bucks in the field.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the total points collected by Adam, Betty, Martha, and Tom, and then subtract that from the minimum threshold of 400 points.

Adam has 50 points.

Betty collected 30% more than Adam. To find 30% of 50, we multiply 50 by 0.3, which is 15. So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.

Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom, so Martha has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up the points collected by Adam, Betty, Martha, and Tom: 50 + 65 + 105 + 35 = 255 points.

To find out how many points the class is missing, we subtract the total points collected from the minimum threshold: 400 - 255 = 145 points.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. 

1. Great Grandma Jones has 3 children.
2. Each of her children has 3 children of their own, so there are 3 x 3 = 9 grandchildren.
3. Each of these grandchildren has 3 babies of their own, so there are 9 x 3 = 27 great-grandchildren.

However, the question asks for the number of great-grandbabies, not great-grandchildren. Since the great-grandchildren are the children of the grandchildren, we need to find the number of children of the great-grandchildren. 

4. Each of the 27 great-grandchildren has 3 babies of their own, so there are 27 x 3 = 81 great-grandbabies.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much Gordy's truck can carry. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, and Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds, Gordy's truck can carry 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.

Now, we know that the combined capacity of all three trucks is 11,600 pounds. We already know that Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds and Gordy's truck can carry 4,800 pounds. To find out how much Gary's truck can carry, we need to subtract the combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity of all three trucks.

Gary's truck capacity = Total capacity - (Gissela's capacity + Gordy's capacity)
Gary's truck capacity = 11,600 - (4,000 + 4,800)

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much money they need to raise in total and how much they have already raised. 

First, let's find out how much money they still need to raise: 
Total goal - money already raised = money still needed
$6300 - $2100 = $4200

Since they have already raised $2100 in 3 hours, we need to find out how much they raise per hour:
Money raised in 3 hours / 3 hours = money raised per hour
$2100 / 3 = $700 per hour

Now, we can find out how many hours they need to fundraise to reach their goal:
Money still needed / money raised per hour = total hours needed
$4200 / $700 = 6 hours

They have already raised money for 3 hours, so we need to add those hours to the total hours needed:
Total hours needed = hours already raised + hours still needed
Total hours needed = 3 + 6

"To solve this problem, we need to find the rate at which the factory makes chocolate and vanilla ice cream per hour, and then calculate the total amount produced in 48 hours.

The factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours, so the rate of chocolate ice cream production is 100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts per hour.

The factory makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours, so the rate of vanilla ice cream production is 50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of ice cream produced in 48 hours:

Chocolate ice cream: 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts
Vanilla ice cream: 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts

The cost of not fixing the pothole is the damage to Ron's car, which is $450.

The cost of fixing the pothole includes the fine for unauthorized road maintenance, which is $120, and the cost of 3 buckets of asphalt, which is 3 x $25 = $75.

So, the total cost of fixing the pothole is $120 + $75 = $195.

To find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole, we need to subtract the total cost of fixing the pothole from the cost of not fixing it.

The amount of money Ron saves by fixing the pothole is $450 - $195 = $255.

The final answer is: $255"
"To find the total number of chairs left, we need to subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the total number of chairs initially available.

Total normal chairs initially = 170
Total baby chairs initially = 23
Total chairs initially = 170 + 23 = 193

Normal chairs sent for repair = 20
Baby chairs sent for repair = 13
Total chairs sent for repair = 20 + 13 = 33

Total chairs left = Total chairs initially - Total chairs sent for repair
Total chairs left = 193 - 33
Total chairs left = 160

The final answer is: 160"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that there are 6 people in total (Bryce and his 5 friends). Each pizza has 12 slices, and there are a total of 6 pizzas (one for each person). 

The total number of slices is 6 pizzas * 12 slices per pizza = 72 slices.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 3 people eating 2/3 of their pizzas, we can calculate the total number of slices they ate as follows:

(2/3) * 3 people * 12 slices per pizza = 24 slices

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 people eating ¾ of their pizzas, we can calculate the total number of slices they ate as follows:

(3/4) * 2 people * 12 slices per pizza = 18 slices

Now, let's add the slices eaten by both groups:

24 slices + 18 slices = 42 slices

To find the number of slices left, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices:

72 slices - 42 slices = 30 slices

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the average time the cat and dog take to eat the sausages, we first need to determine the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages. 

The cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes. Since the dog eats the same number of sausages in 2/3 the amount of time the cat takes, we can calculate the dog's time as follows:

Dog's time = (2/3) * Cat's time
Dog's time = (2/3) * 30 minutes
Dog's time = 20 minutes

Now, we have the time taken by both the cat and the dog. To find the average time, we add their times and divide by 2:

Average time = (Cat's time + Dog's time) / 2
Average time = (30 minutes + 20 minutes) / 2
Average time = 50 minutes / 2
Average time = 25 minutes

The final answer is: 25"
"To solve this problem, we need to first convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

8 feet * 12 inches/foot = 96 inches
Adding the 4 inches, we get:
96 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's represent the length of one of Bobby's shoes as 'x'. Then, the length of one of Topher's shoes can be represented as 9x + 10. We know this is equal to 100 inches, so we can set up the equation:

9x + 10 = 100

Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation gives us:

9x = 90

Dividing both sides of the equation by 9 gives us:

x = 10

So, one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches long. 

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of windows smashed by Hannah, we need to calculate the number of windows from students' cars and teachers' cars separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of windows from students' cars. There are 64 students' cars with 4 windows each. So, the total number of windows from students' cars is 64 * 4 = 256.

Next, let's find the number of windows from teachers' cars. There are 32 teachers' cars with 2 windows each. Since Hannah smashed 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows, we need to find 3/4ths of 32 * 2. To do this, we first find 32 * 2 = 64, then multiply by 3/4, which is the same as multiplying by 0.75. So, 64 * 0.75 = 48.

Now, we add the number of windows from students' cars and teachers' cars to find the total number of windows smashed by Hannah. 256 + 48 = 304.

The final answer is: 304"
"To find the total number of blue spools, we need to add the number of light blue and dark blue spools. 

Total blue spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60

Next, we need to find the total number of spools. 

Total spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 150

Now, we can find the percentage of blue spools by dividing the total number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of blue spools = (60 / 150) * 100 = 40%

The final answer is: 40"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, 5000 people were in line at 8:00. By midday, 2/5 of them had voted. 

2/5 of 5000 is (2/5) * 5000 = 2000 people who voted by midday.

So, the number of people remaining by midday is 5000 - 2000 = 3000.

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. 

2/3 of 3000 is (2/3) * 3000 = 2000 people who voted by 16:00.

The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is the remaining people who were in line at 8:00 minus the people who voted by 16:00. 

So, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 3000 - 2000 = 1000.

The final answer is: 1000"
"To determine the number of packs of gum Parker will need, we need to calculate the total number of pieces of gum he will need for 30 days and then divide that by the number of pieces in a pack.

Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day. To find the total number of pieces he will need for 30 days, we multiply the number of pieces he chews per day by 30:

4 pieces/day * 30 days = 120 pieces

Since a pack of gum has 15 pieces, we divide the total number of pieces Parker needs by the number of pieces in a pack:

120 pieces / 15 pieces/pack = 8 packs

Therefore, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days.

The final answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of s'mores required and then determine how many boxes of graham crackers are needed to make that many s'mores.

First, let's calculate the total number of s'mores needed for the kids. Each kid wants 2 s'mores, and there are 9 kids, so the total number of s'mores needed for the kids is 9 x 2 = 18.

Next, let's calculate the total number of s'mores needed for the adults. Each adult wants 1 s'more, and there are 6 adults, so the total number of s'mores needed for the adults is 6 x 1 = 6.

Now, we add the number of s'mores needed for the kids and the adults to get the total number of s'mores needed: 18 + 6 = 24.

Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes 8 s'mores, we need to divide the total number of s'mores needed by 8 to determine how many sleeves are required: 24 / 8 = 3.

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we need to divide the number of sleeves required by 3 to determine how many boxes are needed: 3 / 3 = 1.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the ages of Dora's father and mother. 

Given that Dora is 15 years old, we can find her father's age by using the information that her father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. 

Let's denote Dora's father's age as F and Dora's age as D. We have the equation: F = 2D + 8. 

Substituting Dora's age (D = 15) into the equation, we get: F = 2(15) + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38.

Now, we know Dora's father is 38 years old. 

We are also given that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. So, we can find her age by subtracting 4 from Dora's father's age: Mother's age = F - 4 = 38 - 4 = 34.

Now that we have the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother, we can find the total combined age by adding their ages together: Total combined age = Dora's age + Father's age + Mother's age = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87.

The final answer is: 87"

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many votes candidate B got. Since candidate B got 50% more than candidate A's votes, we can calculate it as follows:

Candidate A's votes = 20% of 100 voters = 0.2 x 100 = 20 votes
Candidate B's votes = 50% more than candidate A's votes = 20 + (50/100 x 20) = 20 + 10 = 30 votes

Now, we know that candidate B got 30 votes and candidate A got 20 votes. The total votes for both A and B is 20 + 30 = 50 votes. Since there are 100 voters in total, the votes for candidate C can be calculated as follows:

Candidate C's votes = Total votes - (Candidate A's votes + Candidate B's votes)
= 100 - 50
= 50

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many apples Beck has initially. Since Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, and Boris has 100 apples, we can calculate Beck's initial number of apples as follows:

Beck's initial apples = Boris's apples - 23
Beck's initial apples = 100 - 23
Beck's initial apples = 77

Now, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. So, Beck's new number of apples is:

Beck's new apples = Beck's initial apples + 10
Beck's new apples = 77 + 10
Beck's new apples = 87

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris. Boris still has 100 apples, and Beck has 87 apples. So, the difference is:

Difference = Boris's apples - Beck's new apples
Difference = 100 - 87
Difference = 13

Therefore, Beck has 13 fewer apples than Boris now.

For medium cubes: 7 cubes * 2 ounces/cube = 14 ounces
For small cubes: 8 cubes * 0.5 ounces/cube = 4 ounces

Total water used = 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces

Now, subtract the total water used from the total amount of water available: 
32 ounces - 30 ounces = 2 ounces

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of books Steven has. Since Clara has two times as many books as Steven and Clara has 20 books, we can set up the equation:

2x = 20, where x is the number of books Steven has.

To find x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 20 / 2
x = 10

Now that we know Steven has 10 books, we can find out how many books Alice has. Since Alice has 6 more books than Steven, we add 6 to the number of books Steven has:

Alice's books = 10 + 6
Alice's books = 16

Now that we know Alice has 16 books and Clara has 20 books, we can find out how many more books Clara has than Alice:

Difference = Clara's books - Alice's books
Difference = 20 - 16
Difference = 4

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the cost of a half-gallon jar. Since a gallon jar costs $5 and it's $2 more than a half-gallon jar, we can set up the equation:

Gallon jar = Half-gallon jar + $2
$5 = Half-gallon jar + $2

Now, we can solve for the cost of a half-gallon jar:

Half-gallon jar = $5 - $2
Half-gallon jar = $3

Now that we know the cost of a half-gallon jar, we can find the cost of 16 half-gallon jars:

16 * $3 = $48

Next, we need to find the cost of 10-gallon jars. Since a gallon jar costs $5, we can multiply this by 10:

10 * $5 = $50

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of girls in both classes. Since 40% of the students in each class are girls, and there are 80 students in total, we can set up an equation to represent the situation.

Let x be the number of students in each class. Since there are two classes, the total number of students is 2x. We know that 40% of 2x is the total number of girls in both classes. 

40% of 2x = 0.4 * 2x = 0.8x

We also know that the total number of students is 80, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 80

To find x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 80 / 2
x = 40

Now that we know there are 40 students in each class, we can find the number of boys in each class. Since 40% of the students are girls, 60% are boys. 

60% of 40 = 0.6 * 40 = 24

So, there are 24 boys in each class.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as x. Since the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice as many as the votes against it, the number of votes in favor can be represented as 2x.

We know that the total number of people on the council is 33. Since each person can only vote either for or against the regulation, the sum of the votes in favor and against the regulation should equal 33.

Therefore, we can set up the equation: x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms: 3x = 33

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. 

First, we know that 11 students need size extra-small. 

Twice as many students need size small as extra small, so the number of students who need size small is 2 * 11 = 22.

Four less than the number of size small students need size medium, so the number of students who need size medium is 22 + 4 = 26.

Half as many students need size large as size medium, so the number of students who need size large is 26 / 2 = 13.

Six more students need size extra-large than large, so the number of students who need size extra-large is 13 + 6 = 19.

To find the total number of shirts ordered, we need to add up the number of students in each size: 11 (extra-small) + 22 (small) + 26 (medium) + 13 (large) + 19 (extra-large) = 91.

60% of 40 = 0.6 * 40 = 24 people.

The rest of the people think horse #12 will win. 
The rest of the people are 40 - 24 = 16 people.

The number of people who think horse #12 will win is 16.

The final answer is: 16"
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given. We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. 

Let's denote the total number of Pomeranians as P. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we can set up the equation:

1/3 * P = 6

To find the total number of Pomeranians, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3:

P = 6 * 3
P = 18

Now that we know there are 18 Pomeranians, and two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can denote the total number of puppies as J. We can set up the equation:

2/3 * J = 18

To find the total number of puppies, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3/2:

J = 18 * (3/2)
J = 27

So, Jana has 27 puppies. 

The final answer is: 27"
"To find out how much more Jayden needs to buy the camera, we first need to calculate how much money he has after receiving the money from his sister. 

Jayden initially had $70. His sister gave him half of her $90 allowance, which is $45. 

So, Jayden now has $70 + $45 = $115.

The camera costs $200. To find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the amount he has from the cost of the camera: $200 - $115 = $85.

Therefore, Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera.

The final answer is: $85"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house as x. Since the first house needs 1/2 of the second house, the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house is x/2.

We are given that the third house needs double the first house, so the number of cases of shingles needed for the third house is 2 * (x/2) = x.

We know that the total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x/2 + x + x = 250

Combine like terms:

(3x)/2 = 250

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

3x = 500

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 500/3
x = 166.67

Since x represents the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house, and the third house needs double the first house, the number of cases of shingles needed for the third house is 2 * (x/2) = x = 166.67.

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a case of shingles, we round up to the nearest whole number. 

The final answer is: 167"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of each person's purchase and then add them together.

Leila buys 3 cucumbers at $2 each, so her total cost is 3 x $2 = $6.

Jack buys 5 tomatoes at $1 each, so his total cost is 5 x $1 = $5.

Chase buys 1 head of lettuce at $3, so his total cost is $3.

Now, let's add their costs together: $6 (Leila) + $5 (Jack) + $3 (Chase) = $14.

The final answer is: $14"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many pears George has. Since George has 45% more pears than bananas, we can calculate the number of pears by finding 45% of the number of bananas and adding it to the number of bananas.

First, let's find 45% of 200 bananas:
45% of 200 = 0.45 * 200 = 90

Now, let's add 90 to the number of bananas to find the number of pears:
200 + 90 = 290

So, George has 290 pears.

To find the total number of fruits George has, we need to add the number of bananas and pears:
200 (bananas) + 290 (pears) = 490

The final answer is: 490"
"To find out how many candy bars Marissa bought for Jimmy, we need to subtract the cost of the ball from the amount of money Marissa had initially. 

Marissa had $80 initially and spent $20 on the ball. 

$80 (initial amount) - $20 (cost of the ball) = $60

Now, we need to find out how many candy bars Marissa can buy with $60, given that each candy bar costs $5.

$60 (remaining amount) / $5 (cost of each candy bar) = 12

So, Marissa bought 12 candy bars for Jimmy.

12"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total amount of oranges needed to make 4 liters of juice. Since Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges to make 1 liter of juice, he would need 5 times as many kilograms of oranges to make 4 liters of juice. 

5 kilograms/orange * 4 liters = 20 kilograms of oranges

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of the oranges. Each kilogram of oranges costs $3, so we multiply the total amount of oranges needed by the cost per kilogram.

20 kilograms * $3/kilogram = $60

Therefore, Sam would have to spend $60 to make 4 liters of juice.

The final answer is: $60"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many books Ahmed read in one hour. Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, and Ezra read 300 books, we can set up an equation to find out how many books Ahmed read.

Let's denote the number of books Ahmed read as 'x'. Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, we can write the equation as:

2x = 300

To find the value of 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 300 / 2
x = 150

So, Ahmed read 150 books in one hour. 

Now, we know that Ezra read 300 books and decided to read 150 more. Therefore, the total number of books Ezra will read is:

300 (already read) + 150 (additional) = 450

To find the total number of books both Ezra and Ahmed read, we add the number of books each of them read:

Total books read = 450 (Ezra) + 150 (Ahmed) = 600

The final answer is: 600"
"To calculate Tanya's earnings, we need to break down her earnings into two parts: her hourly wage and her daily bonus.

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Since she earns $15 per hour, her total hourly earnings for Monday are 5 hours * $15/hour = $75. 

However, she also earns a daily bonus of $5 for teaching more than 3 classes. Since she teaches 4 classes on Monday, she earns the daily bonus, which is $5.

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Her total hourly earnings for Wednesday are 2 hours * $15/hour = $30.

Since she teaches less than 3 classes on Wednesday, she does not earn the daily bonus.

To find her total earnings, we add her earnings from Monday and Wednesday: $75 (Monday) + $30 (Wednesday) + $5 (Monday's daily bonus) = $110.

The final answer is: $110"
"To find the difference in the number of vanilla scents sold compared to the fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of each type of scent sold.

The company sold 5 vanilla scents and there are 4 vanilla scents available, so the total number of vanilla scents sold is 5 * 4 = 20.

The company sold 2 fruity scents and there are 8 fruity scents available, so the total number of fruity scents sold is 2 * 8 = 16.

Now, we need to find the difference between the total number of vanilla scents sold and the total number of fruity scents sold. 

Difference = Total vanilla scents sold - Total fruity scents sold
Difference = 20 - 16
Difference = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate how much money Bennet will make from selling the eggplants. 

He sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total amount he will make from eggplants is:
20 * 3 = $60

Since Bennet wants to make a total of $135, and he will make $60 from selling the eggplants, he needs to make $135 - $60 = $75 from selling the corn.

He has 25 ears of corn, and he needs to make $75 from selling them. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we can divide the total amount he needs to make from corn ($75) by the number of ears of corn (25):
$75 / 25 = $3

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To find the total time Tatiana has available for soccer, we first need to determine the total time she has available for the weekend. 

Total time available = 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours.

She has already decided to spend 3 hours reading. 

Remaining time = Total time available - Time spent reading = 12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours.

She spends 1/3 of the remaining time playing video games. 

Time spent playing video games = 1/3 * 9 hours = 3 hours.

Time left for soccer = Remaining time - Time spent playing video games = 9 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours.

To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we divide the time spent playing soccer by the total time available and multiply by 100.

Percentage of weekend spent playing soccer = (Time spent playing soccer / Total time available) * 100
= (6 hours / 12 hours) * 100
= 50%

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how many pencils Anthony kept, we need to follow the steps of the problem.

Initially, Anthony had 50 pencils.

He gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon. To find out how many pencils he gave to Brandon, we multiply 50 by 1/2:
50 * 1/2 = 25 pencils given to Brandon.

Now, Anthony has 50 - 25 = 25 pencils left.

He then gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. To find out how many pencils he gave to Charlie, we multiply 25 by 3/5:
25 * 3/5 = 15 pencils given to Charlie.

Now, Anthony has 25 - 15 = 10 pencils left.

Therefore, Anthony kept 10 pencils.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time it takes for him to drive to the museum and back, and then add the time he spends at the museum.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Jack to drive to the museum:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 150 miles / 75 mph
Time = 2 hours

Since he drives to the museum and back, we need to multiply the time by 2:

Total driving time = 2 hours * 2 = 4 hours

Now, we add the time he spends at the museum to the total driving time:

Total time = Total driving time + Time at the museum
Total time = 4 hours + 6 hours
Total time = 10 hours

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of wheels needed for the toys, we need to calculate the number of wheels required for the cars and the motorcycles separately and then add them together.

For the cars, Henry needs 4 wheels for each of the 57 cars, so the total number of wheels needed for the cars is 57 * 4 = 228.

For the motorcycles, Henry needs 2 wheels for each of the 73 motorcycles, so the total number of wheels needed for the motorcycles is 73 * 2 = 146.

The total number of wheels needed for both the cars and the motorcycles is 228 + 146 = 374.

Since Henry has a box with 650 wheels in it, we can subtract the total number of wheels needed from the total number of wheels available to find the number of wheels left.

650 - 374 = 276

The number of wheels left is 276."
"To find the amount you have to pay after a 20% discount, we need to calculate 20% of the original price and subtract it from the original price.

20% of $1000 = 0.20 * $1000 = $200

Now, subtract the discount from the original price:
$1000 - $200 = $800

So, you have to pay $800 after the discount.

The final answer is: $800"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how many movies are in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of movies in series = Total movies / 3
= 600 / 3
= 200 movies

Since Mike can buy these series movies for $6 each, we don't need to calculate the cost of individual series movies.

Next, let's find out how many movies are not in series. This is the remaining movies after subtracting the series movies from the total:

Remaining movies = Total movies - Movies in series
= 600 - 200
= 400 movies

Now, let's find out how many of these remaining movies are older movies. Since 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of older movies = 40% of 400
= 0.4 * 400
= 160 movies

The cost of these older movies is $5 each. So, the total cost of older movies is:

Cost of older movies = Number of older movies * Cost per movie
= 160 * 5
= $800

Now, let's find out how many of the remaining movies are normal movies. This is the remaining movies after subtracting the older movies from the remaining movies:

Number of normal movies = Remaining movies - Older movies
= 400 - 160
= 240 movies

The cost of these normal movies is $10 each. So, the total cost of normal movies is:

Cost of normal movies = Number of normal movies * Cost per movie
= 240 * 10
= $2400

Now, let's find out the total cost of replacing the movies. This is the sum of the cost of series movies, older movies, and normal movies:

Total cost = Cost of series movies + Cost of older movies + Cost of normal movies
= 200 * 6 + 800 + 2400
= 1200 + 800 + 2400
= 4400

The final answer is: $4400"

The cost of apricots is 6 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $18.00

Now, we add the costs together: $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00

The final answer is: $38.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find the speed at which they hiked. We know they drove at an average of 50 miles per hour and hiked an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. 

Half of their driving speed is 50 / 2 = 25 miles per hour. 

5 miles per hour less than that is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

Now, we know they hiked at 20 miles per hour for 1.5 hours. To find the distance they hiked, we multiply their speed by the time: 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

Next, we need to find the distance they drove. They drove for 6 hours at 50 miles per hour. To find the distance, we multiply their speed by the time: 50 * 6 = 300 miles.

The total distance to their vacation spot is the sum of the distance they drove and the distance they hiked: 300 + 30 = 330 miles.

The final answer is: 330"
"To find the difference in their scores, we need to calculate the points each of them earns from enemies, berries, and the timer.

Let's assume Emma's score from enemies is x. Since Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, Ava's score from enemies will be x + 8.

Emma's score from berries is 3 (since she collects 3 berries), and Ava collects 3 + 3 = 6 berries.

Now, let's consider the timer. The points from the timer are calculated as 30 points per second. If Emma finishes the level 4 seconds faster than Ava, Ava will have 4 fewer seconds on the timer. Let's assume Emma finishes the level in t seconds. Then, Ava finishes the level in t + 4 seconds.

Emma's score from the timer is 30t, and Ava's score from the timer is 30(t + 4).

The total score for Emma is x + 3 + 30t, and the total score for Ava is x + 8 + 6 + 30(t + 4).

Since we want to find the difference between their scores, we can set up an equation to represent the difference:

(x + 8 + 6 + 30(t + 4)) - (x + 3 + 30t) = difference

Simplifying the equation:

x + 14 + 30t + 120 - x - 3 - 30t = difference

Combine like terms:

11 + 120 = difference

Subtract 11 from both sides:

difference = 131

The final answer is: 131"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars each. 

Two pizzas cost 30 dollars each, so the total cost of these two pizzas is 2 x 30 = 60 dollars.

Now, we know that the total cost of all four pizzas is 64 dollars. To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we need to subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars from the total cost.

Cost of the other two pizzas = Total cost - Cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars
= 64 - 60
= 4 dollars

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we can divide the cost by 2 to find the cost of each pizza.

Cost of each of the other two pizzas = 4 / 2
= 2 dollars

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Chase and Rider ride their bikes 3 times a day for 5 days, which is a total of 3 * 5 = 15 times.

On the two other days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, which means they ride 3 * 2 = 6 times each day.

So, for the two special days, they ride a total of 6 * 2 = 12 times.

Now, let's add the total number of times they ride on the usual days (15) and the special days (12) to get the total number of times they ride in a week.

15 + 12 = 27

Therefore, Chase and Rider ride their bikes 27 times a week.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Bob had 7 fish in his pond, with 3 being orange and 4 being white.

Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as 'x'. Since he bought a total of 17 fish, the number of orange fish he bought is 17 - x.

After adding the new fish to his pond, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. This means the total number of orange fish is 2 times the total number of white fish.

The total number of orange fish in the pond is the sum of the initial orange fish (3) and the orange fish Bob bought (17 - x). This can be expressed as 3 + (17 - x).

The total number of white fish in the pond is the sum of the initial white fish (4) and the white fish Bob bought (x). This can be expressed as 4 + x.

Since Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up the equation:

3 + (17 - x) = 2(4 + x)

Simplifying the equation:

3 + 17 - x = 8 + 2x

Combine like terms:

20 - x = 8 + 2x

Add x to both sides:

20 = 8 + 3x

Subtract 8 from both sides:

12 = 3x

Divide both sides by 3:

4 = x

So, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

The final answer is: 4"
"To calculate the weekly fuel consumption, we need to determine the total miles driven per week and then divide it by the car's fuel efficiency.

The one-way distance between home and office is 5 miles, and Andy drives to and from work, so the total daily distance is 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles.

Since Andy drives to work from Monday to Friday, the total weekly distance is 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.

Now, we can calculate the weekly fuel consumption by dividing the total weekly distance by the car's fuel efficiency: 50 miles/week / 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week.

The price of regular gas is $3/gallon, so the weekly fuel cost is 5 gallons/week * $3/gallon = $15/week.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Carrie had initially and then subtract the amount she spent.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie had initially. She was given 10 twenties and 140 quarters.

The value of 10 twenties is 10 x $20 = $200.
The value of 140 quarters is 140 x $0.25 = $35.

So, the total amount of money Carrie had initially is $200 + $35 = $235.

Carrie spent all the quarters, which is $35, and 3/5 of the twenties, which is 3/5 x $200 = $120.

The total amount of money Carrie spent is $35 + $120 = $155.

Therefore, the total amount of money she paid for lunch is $155.

"To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we first need to determine the total percentage of smart TVs and analog TVs sold. 

One-fourth of the TVs are smart TVs, which is 1/4 or 0.25. One-eighth of the TVs are analog TVs, which is 1/8 or 0.125. 

The total percentage of smart TVs and analog TVs sold is 0.25 + 0.125 = 0.375. 

Since the rest of the TVs are OLED, we subtract the total percentage of smart and analog TVs from 1 (which represents 100% of the total TVs sold). 

1 - 0.375 = 0.625. 

Since 0.625 represents 62.5% of the total TVs sold, we can find the number of OLED TVs sold by multiplying 0.625 by the total number of TVs sold, which is 40.

0.625 * 40 = 25

"To find out how much money John is missing, we need to first determine how much the school will cover and then subtract the amount John has from the total cost of the trip.

The school will cover half the cost of the trip, which is $300 / 2 = $150.

The total cost of the trip is $300, and John has $50. To find out how much he is missing, we subtract the amount he has from the total cost: $300 - $50 = $250.

However, since the school is covering half the cost, we need to subtract the amount the school is covering from the total cost to find out how much John needs to cover: $300 - $150 = $150.

Since John has $50, he is missing $150 - $50 = $100.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the temperature at night and then calculate how many logs Carson needs to burn to reach the safe temperature of 32 degrees.

First, let's find the temperature at night: 
Temperature at night = Temperature during the day - 33 degrees
Temperature at night = 45 - 33
Temperature at night = 12 degrees

Since the temperature at night is 12 degrees, Carson needs to heat the house up to 32 degrees to prevent the pipes from freezing. 
Temperature to be heated = 32 - 12
Temperature to be heated = 20 degrees

Each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees. To find the number of logs needed, we divide the temperature to be heated by the temperature increase per log:
Number of logs = Temperature to be heated / Temperature increase per log
Number of logs = 20 / 5
Number of logs = 4

Billy's initial hourly wage is $10. After 2 months, he gets a raise of $0.50 per hour, making his new hourly wage $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. On his first anniversary, he gets another raise of $1.00 per hour, making his final hourly wage $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50.

Billy's total earnings for 20 hours of work at $10 per hour is 20 * $10 = $200. His total earnings for 20 hours of work at $10.50 per hour is 20 * $10.50 = $210. His total earnings for 20 hours of work at $11.50 per hour is 20 * $11.50 = $230.

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary, which is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. So, Sally's hourly wage is $10.50. 

Sally's total earnings for 20 hours of work at $10.50 per hour is 20 * $10.50 = $210.

To find out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we need to subtract Sally's total earnings from Billy's total earnings. 

Billy's total earnings - Sally's total earnings = $230 - $210 = $20.

The final answer is: $20"
"To find the difference in cost between 3 loaves of bread and 2 bagels, we need to calculate the total cost of each and then subtract the cost of the bagels from the cost of the bread.

The cost of 3 loaves of bread is 3 x $2 = $6.

The cost of 2 bagels is 2 x $1 = $2.

Now, we subtract the cost of the bagels from the cost of the bread: $6 - $2 = $4.

The difference in cost is $4.

The final answer is: $4"
"To find Nikita's score, we first need to calculate half of Pierson's score. Half of 278 is 278 / 2 = 139. 

Nikita scored 11 more than half of Pierson's score, so Nikita's score is 139 + 11 = 150.

To find the total score, we add Pierson's score and Nikita's score: 278 + 150 = 428.

The final answer is: 428"
"To find the total number of trees planted by the students, we need to multiply the number of classes by the average number of students per class and then multiply the result by 1 (since each student plants 1 tree).

Total students = 40 classes * 25 students/class = 1000 students
Total trees planted by students = 1000 students * 1 tree/student = 1000 trees

To find the total number of trees planted by the teachers, we need to multiply the number of classes by the average number of teachers per class and then multiply the result by 2 (since each teacher plants 2 trees).

Total teachers = 40 classes * 3 teachers/class = 120 teachers
Total trees planted by teachers = 120 teachers * 2 trees/teacher = 240 trees

Now, we add the total number of trees planted by the students and the teachers to find the overall total.

Total trees = 1000 (students) + 240 (teachers) = 1240 trees

The final answer is: 1240"
"To find the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy, we first need to find the total number of stuffed animals she currently has. 

Bubbles has 3 stuffed puppies, 5 stuffed koalas, 2 stuffed zebras, and 4 stuffed frogs. 

Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Now, we need to find 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. 

30% of 14 = 0.3 * 14 = 4.2

Since Bubbles can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, we'll round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we'll consider the context of the problem. If Bubbles buys 5 stuffed goats, the percentage of stuffed goats will be 5/19, which is approximately 26.32%. Since 4.2 is less than 5, we can say that Bubbles needs to buy 5 stuffed goats to get a percentage of stuffed goats close to 30%.

However, to get the exact 30%, we need to calculate the total number of stuffed animals after buying the goats. Let's assume Bubbles buys x stuffed goats. The total number of stuffed animals will be 14 + x.

30% of (14 + x) = x

0.3(14 + x) = x

4.2 + 0.3x = x

0.7x = 4.2

x = 4.2 / 0.7

x = 6

So, Bubbles needs to buy 6 stuffed goats to get 30% of stuffed goats.

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total hours Kris has played and subtract that from the total hours required for the achievement.

First, let's calculate the hours Kris played in the first 2 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, 2 weeks is 2 * 7 = 14 days. If Kris plays for half an hour every day, she plays 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours in the first 2 weeks.

Next, let's calculate the hours Kris played in the next week. If Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week, she plays 7 * 2 = 14 hours in the next week.

Now, let's add the hours Kris played in both periods: 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours.

Since Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement, we subtract the hours she has already played from the total hours required: 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

Therefore, Kris still needs to play 9 hours to earn the achievement.

The final answer is: 9"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours and then find the difference between the two distances.

The first car travels at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel:
Distance = Speed x Time = 60 miles/hour x 2 hours = 120 miles

The second car travels at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel:
Distance = Speed x Time = 70 miles/hour x 2 hours = 140 miles

The difference in distance between the two cars is:
Difference = 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

So, after 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost James paid for the ring, we need to calculate the premium first. The premium is 30% of the total cost of the diamond and gold, which is $600 + $300 = $900.

The premium is 30% of $900, which is 0.3 x $900 = $270.

The total cost of the ring is the sum of the cost of the diamond and gold, plus the premium: $900 + $270 = $1170.

Therefore, James paid $1170 for the ring.

The final answer is: $1170"
"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school.

First, let's find the number of students who passed in each grade:

- Third grade: 340 students passed
- Fourth grade: 40 students passed
- Fifth grade: The pass rate for fifth grade is twice the pass rate of fourth grade, which is 2 * 40 = 80 students passed.

Now, let's find the total number of students in each grade:

- Third grade: 500 students
- Fourth grade: 100 students
- Fifth grade: 400 students

The total number of students in the school is 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000 students.

The total number of students who passed is 340 + 40 + 80 = 460 students.

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students, multiplied by 100 to convert it to a percentage.

Overall pass rate = (460 / 1000) * 100 = 46%

The final answer is: 46"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many square inches of mosaic Milo can make with the glass chips he has. Since it takes 12 chips to make every square inch, and he has 2 bags of glass chips, we first need to find out how many chips he has in total.

Each bag holds 72 chips, so with 2 bags, Milo has 2 * 72 = 144 chips.

Since it takes 12 chips to make 1 square inch, we can divide the total number of chips by 12 to find out how many square inches Milo can make:

144 chips / 12 chips/square inch = 12 square inches

Since Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall, and we know he can make 12 square inches, we can find the length of the mosaic by dividing the total square inches by the height:

12 square inches / 3 inches (height) = 4 inches

Therefore, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long.

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students. 

Four students drank 1.5 quarts each, so the total amount of tea consumed by these students is 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts.

Sixteen students drank 2 quarts each, so the total amount of tea consumed by these students is 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

The total amount of tea consumed is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 10 quarts of tea left, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is 38 + 10 = 48 quarts.

To convert quarts to gallons, we know that 1 gallon is equal to 4 quarts. 

So, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party in gallons is 48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

The final answer is: 12"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many candies Dale has in total. Initially, he had 100 candies. He sold 150, so he was left with 100 - 150 = -50 candies. However, this is not possible since you can't have a negative number of candies. This means that Dale must have ordered more candies to replace the ones he sold.

After selling 150 candies, he ordered 100 more. So, he now has 100 (initial candies) + 100 (new order) = 200 candies.

Since he has 200 candies and he wants to sell all of them, he needs to sell 200 candies in total.

However, he has already sold 150 candies. To find out how many more he needs to sell, we subtract the number of candies he has already sold from the total number of candies he has: 200 - 150 = 50.

Therefore, Dale still needs to sell 50 candies to sell all of his candy.

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students at the end of each month and then subtract the initial number of students from it.

At the beginning of the year, there are 10 students.

- At the end of January, the number of students doubles, so there are 10 * 2 = 20 students.
- At the end of February, the number of students doubles again, so there are 20 * 2 = 40 students.
- At the end of March, the number of students doubles again, so there are 40 * 2 = 80 students.
- At the end of April, the number of students doubles again, so there are 80 * 2 = 160 students.
- At the end of May, the number of students doubles again, so there are 160 * 2 = 320 students.

Now, let's subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May: 320 - 10 = 310.

The number of additional students who joined by the end of May is 310."
"To find the total number of branches Felix climbed, we need to divide the total amount of money he made ($105) by the cost per branch ($0.25). 

Total money made = $105
Cost per branch = $0.25

Total branches climbed = Total money made / Cost per branch
Total branches climbed = $105 / $0.25
Total branches climbed = 420

Since Felix worked during the week (7 days), we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day. 

Average branches per day = Total branches climbed / Number of days
Average branches per day = 420 / 7
Average branches per day = 60

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the total number of petals, we need to calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers and then subtract the petals that were lost.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers:

- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 * 5 = 15 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 * 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 * 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 * 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add up the total number of petals: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

However, Rose dropped 1 petal from each set of flowers, so we need to subtract the total number of petals that were lost: 1 * 4 = 4 petals

Now, let's subtract the lost petals from the total: 101 - 4 = 97 petals

The final answer is: 97"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of marshmallows used by John and DeSean. Since each of them made 9 S'mores, and each S'more uses one marshmallow, they used a total of 9 + 9 = 18 marshmallows.

Additionally, they dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground, so the total number of marshmallows used or dropped is 18 + 3 = 21.

The initial number of marshmallows in the bag was 35. To find out how many marshmallows are left, we subtract the total number of marshmallows used or dropped from the initial number: 35 - 21 = 14.

Since there are 14 marshmallows left, and there are two kids, we need to divide the remaining marshmallows by 2 to find out how many each kid can have: 14 / 2 = 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time each person plays and then determine how many quarters they use.

Jack plays for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes. Since he can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter, he uses 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.

One of his friends is significantly worse and can play for half as long as Jack, so they play for 240 / 2 = 120 minutes. This friend uses 120 / 20 = 6 quarters.

The other two friends are significantly better and can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they play for 240 * 1.5 = 360 minutes each. Each of these friends uses 360 / 20 = 18 quarters.

Since there are two friends who play for 360 minutes, they use a total of 2 * 18 = 36 quarters.

The total number of quarters used is 12 (Jack) + 6 (worse friend) + 36 (better friends) = 54 quarters.

The cost of each quarter is not given, but we can still determine the total number of quarters used.

The final numerical answer is: 54"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the amount of citrus zest as Z, the amount of fragrance as F, the amount of salt as S, the amount of sugar as S (since it's the same as salt), and the amount of oil as O.

We know that Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, so F = Z.

We also know that she uses twice as much salt as zest, so S = 2Z.

Since she uses twice as much oil as salt, O = 2S.

Substituting S = 2Z into O = 2S, we get O = 2(2Z) = 4Z.

We know that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, and it's made up of Z + F + S + S + O. Since F = Z and S = 2Z, we can substitute these values in:

Z + Z + 2Z + 2Z + 4Z = 10

Combine like terms:

10Z = 10

Divide both sides by 10:

Z = 1

Now that we know Z = 1, we can find the amount of oil (O) by substituting Z into O = 4Z:

O = 4(1) = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total amount of money John spent, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows separately and then add them together.

The cost of the goats is 3 * $500 = $1500.
The cost of the cows is 2 * $1500 = $3000.

Now, we add the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows together: $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

2. Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find 20% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.2: 40 * 0.2 = 8. So, Joe sells 8 cars.

3. Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars to his mother.

4. To find out how many cars Joe has left, we subtract the number of cars he sold and gave away from the total number of cars he had initially: 40 - 8 - 16 = 16.

Therefore, Joe remains with 16 cars after selling and giving some to his mother.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to first determine the total amount raised by the students. Since the charity raised a total of $175,000 and $50,000 came from organizations, the amount raised by the students is $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000.

Now, we know that there are 20 students and they all earn the same amount. To find out how much each student raised, we divide the total amount raised by the number of students: $125,000 / 20 = $6,250.

The final answer is: $6,250"
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the first day and the second day, and then add them together.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. 

On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she walked on the first day, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

To find the total time in minutes, we need to convert the hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes
4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes

The total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 480 + 240 = 720 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of cars in the parking lot after the first break. Initially, there were 50 cars. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, so the total number of cars after the first break is 50 + 20 = 70.

When Hunter got out of class for the lunch break, he realized that 1/2 the number of cars in the parking lot had gone. This means that 1/2 of 70 cars left, and the remaining 1/2 stayed. To find the number of cars that left, we multiply 70 by 1/2, which is 35. 

So, the number of cars that left is 35. To find the total number of cars he counted during lunch break, we need to subtract the number of cars that left from the total number of cars after the first break. 

Total number of cars during lunch break = Total number of cars after the first break - Number of cars that left
= 70 - 35
= 35

"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of tasks he completes in a day and then multiply it by the number of days he works in a week.

John does 30 cycles of work a day, and each cycle has 5 different tasks. So, the total number of tasks he completes in a day is:
30 cycles/day * 5 tasks/cycle = 150 tasks/day

Since each task pays $1.20, the total amount John makes in a day is:
150 tasks/day * $1.20/task = $180/day

John works a full 7-day week, so the total amount he makes in a week is:
$180/day * 7 days/week = $1260/week

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many points Sasha scored in the second game. 

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, so Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points.

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add the points from both games: 14 (first game) + 4 (second game) = 18.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as 'x'. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards.

We are also given that Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick. Therefore, Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is 341, which is the sum of the cards Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have. We can write this as an equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find the number of cards Smendrick has:

Smendrick has 3x = 3 * 47 = 141 cards

And Becca has 12 more than Smendrick:

Becca has 141 + 12 = 153 cards

"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the production for the second and third weeks first.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate. 
In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.
In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Now, let's calculate the total production for the first three weeks: 
8,000 (first week) + 4,000 (second week) + 24,000 (third week) = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month, we can find out how much he produces in the fourth week by subtracting the total production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production:
50,000 (total monthly production) - 36,000 (production for the first three weeks) = 14,000 bars.

"To calculate the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends per week and then multiply it by 4.

First, let's calculate the time she spends on TikTok per week:

- She records 18 videos, each taking 4 minutes. So, the total time spent recording videos per week is 18 * 4 = 72 minutes.
- She spends 2 hours (120 minutes) writing amateur songs per week.
- She spends 15 minutes per day, 6 days a week, doing her makeup. So, the total time spent on makeup per week is 15 * 6 = 90 minutes.

Total time spent on TikTok per week = 72 + 120 + 90 = 282 minutes.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total time spent on TikTok in a month is:
282 * 4 = 1128 minutes.

The final answer is: 1128"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to first determine the cost of the initial installation and then add the cost of the additional items.

The initial installation includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. However, Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures that she needs installed. Since the initial installation already includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, and 1 chandelier, we only need to consider the additional items.

Angela has 2 extra mirrors (6 - 4 = 2), 1 extra chandelier (2 - 1 = 1), and 10 extra pictures (20 - 10 = 10). The cost of the additional items is $15.00 per item.

The total number of additional items is 2 (mirrors) + 1 (chandelier) + 10 (pictures) = 13 items.

The cost of the additional items is 13 items * $15.00 per item = $195.00.

The initial installation cost is $129.00.

The total cost is $129.00 (initial installation) + $195.00 (additional items) = $324.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the ratio of Naruto's lifting ability to Pompei's lifting ability. 

First, we know that Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift 12 inches. 

Next, we know that Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Then, we know that Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 480 inches to feet by dividing by 12: 480 / 12 = 40 feet.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the time it takes for one kangaroo to travel across the highway. Since three kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, one kangaroo would take 18 hours multiplied by 3, which equals 54 hours.

Now, we know that the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo. This means that the time it takes for a turtle to travel across the highway will be twice as long as it takes for a kangaroo. 

Since one kangaroo takes 54 hours, one turtle will take 54 hours multiplied by 2, which equals 108 hours. 

However, we are asked about four turtles. Since each turtle takes 108 hours, four turtles will take 108 hours multiplied by 4, which equals 432 hours.

3. Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, so she must have $400 - $50 = $350.
4. Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job and her mom has given her $80, so she has $150 + $80 = $230 from these sources.
5. Since Erika now has $350 and she has $230 from her job and her mom, the amount of money she had in her purse initially is $350 - $230 = $120.

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total amount of milk the farmer currently produces per day. Since he extracts 5 liters of milk from each cow and he has 3 cows, the total amount of milk he produces per day is:

5 liters/cow * 3 cows = 15 liters/day

Now, we need to find out how much more milk he needs to produce to reach 25 liters per day. The difference between the desired amount and the current amount is:

25 liters - 15 liters = 10 liters

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk per day, we need to find out how many cows are required to produce 10 liters of milk per day:

10 liters / 5 liters/cow = 2 cows

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk per day.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the unused portion of each glue stick and add them together.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, which is 1/6 of 12 millimeters. To find the length of the unused portion, we multiply 12 by 1/6:
12 * (1/6) = 12/6 = 2 millimeters

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, which is 2/3 of 12 millimeters. To find the length of the unused portion, we multiply 12 by 2/3:
12 * (2/3) = 24/3 = 8 millimeters

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, which is 1/2 of 12 millimeters. To find the length of the unused portion, we multiply 12 by 1/2:
12 * (1/2) = 12/2 = 6 millimeters

Now, we add the unused portions of all three glue sticks together:
2 + 8 + 6 = 16 millimeters

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 16 millimeters.

"To determine how much money Gabriel still needs, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has and subtract it from the total cost of the items he wants to buy.

Gabriel has $5000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200, so he has a total of $5000 + $200 = $5200.

The total cost of the items he wants to buy is $10000 (car) + $800 (phone) = $10800.

To find out how much money Gabriel still needs, we subtract the amount he has from the total cost: $10800 - $5200 = $5600.

Therefore, Gabriel still needs $5600.

4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.
5. To find the total number of socks and dishes they have together, we add the number of socks and dishes Jack and Peter have: 30 (Jack's socks) + 60 (Jack's dishes) + 60 (Peter's socks) + 30 (Peter's dishes) = 180.

"To solve this problem, we can use the principle of set theory. Let's break it down:

- Total number of students = 20
- Students good at math only = 5
- Students good at English only = 8
- Students good at both math and English = x (we need to find this)

We know that the total number of students is the sum of students good at math only, students good at English only, and students good at both math and English. However, since students good at both math and English are counted twice (once in each category), we need to subtract them once to avoid double-counting.

So, the equation becomes: Total = Math only + English only + Both
20 = 5 + 8 + x

Now, let's solve for x:
20 = 13 + x
x = 20 - 13
x = 7

Now, we know that the number of students good at both math and English is 7. To find the total number of students good at math, we need to add the students good at math only and the students good at both math and English.

Students good at math = Students good at math only + Students good at both math and English

"To find the total time available for performances, we need to subtract the intermission time from the total concert time. 

Total concert time = 2 hours = 2 * 60 minutes = 120 minutes
Intermission time = 10 minutes
Time available for performances = Total concert time - Intermission time = 120 - 10 = 110 minutes

Each group requires 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit the stage. So, the total time required for each group = 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes.

Now, we can find the number of groups that can perform in the given time by dividing the time available for performances by the time required for each group.

Number of groups = Time available for performances / Time required for each group = 110 / 10 = 11

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of simple interest. Simple interest is calculated as a percentage of the principal amount, and in this case, it's three-quarters of the original amount per year.

The formula for simple interest is: Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

Given that the principal amount (P) is $300, the rate (R) is 3/4 or 0.75, and the time (T) is 3 years, we can calculate the interest earned each year.

Interest per year = P * R = $300 * 0.75 = $225

Since the interest is added to the principal at the end of each year, the total amount after 1 year will be:
$300 (initial investment) + $225 (interest) = $525

After 2 years, the interest will be calculated on the new principal amount of $525, so:
Interest for year 2 = $525 * 0.75 = $393.75
Total amount after 2 years = $525 + $393.75 = $918.75

After 3 years, the interest will be calculated on the new principal amount of $918.75, so:
Interest for year 3 = $918.75 * 0.75 = $688.0625
Total amount after 3 years = $918.75 + $688.0625 = $1606.8125

Therefore, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is $1606.81."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Next, we are given that 20 of the floral shirts have buttons. To find the number of floral shirts with no buttons, we need to subtract this from the total number of floral shirts. So, the number of floral shirts with no buttons would be 50 - 20 = 30.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars. This would be 30 - 20 = 10.

The total cost of the red baskets after the discount is $54 - $6 = $48.

The total cost of all the baskets is $75 (green) + $48 (red) = $123.

The final numerical answer is: $123"
"To find the time it takes to clean one-half of the rooms, we first need to determine the number of rooms that is half of 90. 

Half of 90 is 45 rooms. 

Now, we need to find the total time it takes to clean 45 rooms. Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, we multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room.

45 rooms * 20 minutes per room = 900 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours

The final answer is: 15"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will count the total number of homes built in the first two years, which is 12 + 36 = 48 homes, and then double this amount, which is 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

To find the total number of homes built over the next three years, we need to add the number of homes built in each year: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144 homes.

The final answer is: 144"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. You are three years younger than your brother.
2. You are 2 years older than your sister.
3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age.
4. The sum of all your ages is 87.

Let's denote your age as 'x'. 

From point 1, your brother's age is x + 3. 
From point 2, your sister's age is x - 2.
From point 3, your mom's age is 3(x + 3) - 1 = 3x + 8.

Now, let's add all the ages: x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3x + 8) = 87.
Combine like terms: 5x + 9 = 87.

Subtract 9 from both sides: 5x = 78.
Divide by 5: x = 15.6.

Since age cannot be a fraction, we need to re-examine the equation. The issue here is that the sum of the ages is not an integer, which is unlikely in real life. However, we can try to find the closest integer solution.

Let's re-examine the equation: 5x = 78. 
Since 78 is not divisible by 5, we can try the closest multiples of 5. The closest multiple of 5 less than 78 is 75, and the closest multiple of 5 greater than 78 is 80.

If 5x = 75, then x = 15.
If 5x = 80, then x = 16.

We can test these values to see which one satisfies the original conditions.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of glue sticks required and then divide that by the number of glue sticks per pack, rounding up to the nearest whole number since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs.

First, we calculate the total number of glue sticks needed: 27 students * 2 glue sticks per student = 54 glue sticks.

Since glue sticks come in packs of 8, we divide the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack: 54 / 8 = 6.75.

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, we round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we need to consider that 6 packs would give us 6 * 8 = 48 glue sticks, which is less than the 54 needed. 

To find the minimum number of packs needed, we can calculate the remainder when 54 is divided by 8, which is 6. This means we need 6 more glue sticks. Since 6 glue sticks is less than 8, we can buy one more pack to have the extra glue sticks. 

Therefore, Mr. Jackson needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of change in the amount of water passing through the river. 

Initially, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons. 

On the second day, the amount of water doubles, so it becomes 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.

On the third day, the amount of water increases by 6000 gallons, so it becomes 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

Therefore, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point on the third day is 14000 gallons.

"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of exponential growth, which is often modeled using the formula for compound interest or the exponential function. However, in this case, we can use a simpler approach based on the concept of geometric progression.

Let's break it down step by step:

Day 1: Initially, there are 10 people infected. Each of these 10 people infects 6 others, so the total number of people infected on Day 1 is 10 + (10 * 6) = 10 + 60 = 70.

Day 2: The 70 people infected on Day 1 will infect 6 others each, so the total number of people infected on Day 2 is 70 + (70 * 6) = 70 + 420 = 490.

Day 3: The 490 people infected on Day 2 will infect 6 others each, so the total number of people infected on Day 3 is 490 + (490 * 6) = 490 + 2940 = 3430.

Therefore, the total number of people infected after three days is 3430.

"To find the total amount of money Rafaela received, we need to multiply the number of customers by the tip amount each customer gave. 

Number of customers = 40
Tip amount per customer = $20

Total amount Rafaela received = Number of customers * Tip amount per customer
Total amount Rafaela received = 40 * $20
Total amount Rafaela received = $800

Julieta received 10% less money than Rafaela. To find the amount Julieta received, we need to calculate 10% of Rafaela's total and subtract it from Rafaela's total.

10% of Rafaela's total = 0.1 * $800
10% of Rafaela's total = $80

Amount Julieta received = Rafaela's total - 10% of Rafaela's total
Amount Julieta received = $800 - $80
Amount Julieta received = $720

Total amount both received = Rafaela's total + Julieta's total
Total amount both received = $800 + $720
Total amount both received = $1520

Claire earns 1 badge per month. 
Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge, so Amber earns 1/2 badge per month.
Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so Wendy earns 3 badges per month.

In a 1-year time frame (12 months), Claire will earn 1 * 12 = 12 badges.
Amber will earn 1/2 * 12 = 6 badges.

Since she can bake 2 loaves per hour, and each hour she baked for 5 hours, she baked a total of 2 * 5 = 10 loaves.

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices is 10 * 8 = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, and there are 80 slices. To find the total amount raised, we multiply the number of slices by the price per slice: 80 * 0.5 = 40 dollars.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of silver coins Gretchen has. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, and Gretchen has 70 gold coins, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship.

Let S be the number of silver coins. Then, the number of gold coins is S + 30. We know that the number of gold coins is 70, so we can set up the equation:

S + 30 = 70

To solve for S, we subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:

S = 70 - 30
S = 40

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins. To find the total number of coins, we add the number of gold coins and the number of silver coins:

Total coins = 70 (gold coins) + 40 (silver coins)
Total coins = 110

"To solve this problem, let's start by assigning variables to each person's number of books. Let's say Anne has x books. Since Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, Sofie has x + 25 books. Since Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, Fawn has x + 12 books.

We know that together, Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have 85 books. We can write an equation to represent this:

x + (x + 25) + (x + 12) = 85

Combine like terms:

3x + 37 = 85

Subtract 37 from both sides:

3x = 48

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 16

Now that we know Anne has 16 books, we can find out how many books Fawn has by adding 12 to x:

Fawn has x + 12 = 16 + 12 = 28 books.

Since one box of jello makes 10 jello cups, we need to find out how many boxes Greg needs to buy. To do this, we divide the total number of jello cups needed by the number of jello cups per box: 120 / 10 = 12.

Since each box costs $1.25, the total cost will be the number of boxes multiplied by the cost per box: 12 * $1.25 = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the total cost of the phones, we multiply the number of phones by the cost per phone: 5 phones * $700/phone = $3500. 

The seller gives the electronics seller $4000 in dollar bills. To find the change, we subtract the total cost of the phones from the amount given: $4000 - $3500 = $500.

The final answer is: $500"
"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we first need to determine how much Keenan spends in a month. Since Madeline pays 60% of the total cost, Keenan pays the remaining 40%. 

First, let's calculate Keenan's monthly expenditure: 
40% of $400 = 0.4 * $400 = $160

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we can now calculate Keenan's weekly expenditure:
$160 / 4 = $40

The final answer is: $40"
"To find out how many pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he ate on each day and add them together.

On the first day, he ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces. To find 2/5 of 60, we multiply 60 by 2 and divide by 5:
(60 * 2) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

So, on the first day, he ate 24 pieces.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces. To find the remaining pieces after the first two days, we subtract the pieces eaten on the first two days from the total:
60 - 24 - 10 = 26

Now, we need to find 7/13 of 26:
(26 * 7) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14

So, on the third day, he ate 14 pieces.

Now, we add the pieces eaten on each day to find the total:
24 + 10 + 14 = 48

Therefore, Tobias has eaten 48 pieces so far.

The final answer is: 48"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the cost of one bottle of soda and one bottle of water. 

First, let's find the cost of one bottle of soda. Since 7 bottles of soda cost $21.00, we can divide the total cost by the number of bottles to find the cost of one bottle.

Cost of one bottle of soda = Total cost of 7 bottles / Number of bottles
= $21.00 / 7
= $3.00 per bottle

Next, let's find the cost of one bottle of water. Since 4 bottles of water cost $8.00, we can divide the total cost by the number of bottles to find the cost of one bottle.

Cost of one bottle of water = Total cost of 4 bottles / Number of bottles
= $8.00 / 4
= $2.00 per bottle

Now that we know the cost of one bottle of soda and one bottle of water, we can find the total cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water.

Total cost of 3 bottles of soda = Cost of one bottle of soda * Number of bottles
= $3.00 * 3
= $9.00

Total cost of 2 bottles of water = Cost of one bottle of water * Number of bottles
= $2.00 * 2
= $4.00

Total cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water = Total cost of 3 bottles of soda + Total cost of 2 bottles of water
= $9.00 + $4.00
= $13.00

The final answer is: $13.00"
"To find out how much money David has left after buying the bolts, we need to calculate the total cost of the bolts and subtract that from the initial amount of money he has.

The cost of each bolt is $0.03, and David wants to buy 16 bolts. 

Total cost of bolts = Number of bolts * Cost per bolt
Total cost of bolts = 16 * $0.03
Total cost of bolts = $0.48

Now, we subtract the total cost of the bolts from the initial amount of money David has:

Initial amount of money = $12.48
Total cost of bolts = $0.48
Money left = Initial amount of money - Total cost of bolts
Money left = $12.48 - $0.48
Money left = $12.00

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To find out how much Ella would earn after 12 hours, we need to determine her hourly rate of pay. We can do this by dividing the amount she earned ($33) by the number of hours she worked (3).

Hourly rate = Total earnings / Number of hours worked
Hourly rate = $33 / 3
Hourly rate = $11

Now that we know her hourly rate, we can multiply it by the number of hours she will work in the future (12) to find out how much she will earn.

Total earnings = Hourly rate * Number of hours worked
Total earnings = $11 * 12
Total earnings = $132

The final answer is: $132"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. First, we need to find out how many marbles Paul has after his friend gave him 28 marbles. 

Initial marbles Paul has: 52
Marbles given by friend: 28
Total marbles Paul has now: 52 + 28 = 80

Next, we need to find out how many marbles Paul lost. Since he lost 1/4 of his marbles, we need to calculate 1/4 of 80.

1/4 of 80 = 80 / 4 = 20

Now, we need to subtract the marbles lost from the total marbles Paul has now.

Marbles Paul has left: 80 - 20 = 60

The final answer is: 60"
"To find Amy's total score, we need to calculate the points she earns from each type of question and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the points from the multiple-choice questions:
Amy correctly answers 80% of the 10 multiple-choice questions, so she answers 0.8 * 10 = 8 questions correctly.
Each multiple-choice question is worth 1 point, so she earns 8 * 1 = 8 points from the multiple-choice questions.

Next, let's calculate the points from the true/false questions:
Amy correctly answers 90% of the 20 true/false questions, so she answers 0.9 * 20 = 18 questions correctly.
Each true/false question is worth 1 point, so she earns 18 * 1 = 18 points from the true/false questions.

Now, let's calculate the points from the long-answer questions:
Amy correctly answers 60% of the 5 long-answer questions, so she answers 0.6 * 5 = 3 questions correctly.
Each long-answer question is worth 5 points, so she earns 3 * 5 = 15 points from the long-answer questions.

Finally, let's add up the points from each type of question to find Amy's total score:
8 (multiple-choice) + 18 (true/false) + 15 (long-answer) = 41 points.

The final answer is: 41"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many chickens Isaias plans to sell. Since he plans to sell 3/5 of the 300 chickens, we can calculate this as follows:

3/5 * 300 = (3 * 300) / 5
= 900 / 5
= 180

So, Isaias plans to sell 180 chickens.

Since he needs to make a profit of $2000 and he sells each chicken for $50, we can find the total revenue from selling 180 chickens as follows:

Total revenue = Number of chickens sold * Price per chicken
= 180 * 50
= 9000

However, this is the total revenue, not the cost. To find the cost, we need to subtract the profit from the total revenue:

Cost = Total revenue - Profit
= 9000 - 2000
= 7000

Therefore, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for sale for $7000.

The final answer is: $7000"
"To find out how many glasses Micah and Mitchell sold, we need to divide the total number of glasses sold by 2, since they sold an equal number of glasses. 

Total glasses sold = 32
Number of people who sold an equal number of glasses = 2 (Micah and Mitchell)
Glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell = Total glasses sold / 2 = 32 / 2 = 16

Since Julie sold 14 glasses, we can find out how many more glasses she sold than Micah by subtracting the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold.

Glasses sold by Julie = 14
Glasses sold by Micah = 16
Difference = Glasses sold by Julie - Glasses sold by Micah = 14 - 16 = -2

The final answer is: $\boxed{-2}$"
"To find the total amount Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the cost of each service and add them together.

1. The cost of the hair service is $400.
2. The cost of the manicure is 1/4 of the cost of the hair service, which is (1/4) * $400 = $100.
3. The cost of the pedicure is 3/4 of the cost of the manicure, which is (3/4) * $100 = $75.

Now, let's add the costs together: $400 (hair) + $100 (manicure) + $75 (pedicure) = $575.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Sarah will get from selling the rope and then subtract the cost of the new rope.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Sarah will get from selling the rope:

Length of the rope = 20 meters
Price per meter = $2
Total amount of money = Length of the rope * Price per meter
Total amount of money = 20 * $2
Total amount of money = $40

Now, let's calculate the cost of the new rope:

Length of the new rope = 20 meters (assuming Sarah wants to buy a rope of the same length)
Price per meter of the new rope = $1.5
Cost of the new rope = Length of the new rope * Price per meter of the new rope
Cost of the new rope = 20 * $1.5
Cost of the new rope = $30

Now, let's subtract the cost of the new rope from the total amount of money Sarah will get from selling the rope:

Amount of money left over = Total amount of money - Cost of the new rope
Amount of money left over = $40 - $30
Amount of money left over = $10

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine Melanie's current age. Since in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old, we can subtract 10 from 18 to find her current age.

Current age = 18 - 10 = 8 years old

Now, we need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her present age. Let's denote the number of years as 'x'. In 'x' years, Melanie's age will be her current age plus 'x', which is 8 + x. We are given that this age will be thrice her current age, so we can set up the equation:

8 + x = 3 * 8

Simplifying the equation, we get:

8 + x = 24

Subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation, we get:

x = 16

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

The final answer is: 16"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in Kelly's cart and then subtract that from her budget.

First, let's find the cost of the chicken. Since each pack of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, and the 5 packs of bacon cost $10, the cost of one pack of bacon is $10 / 5 = $2. Therefore, the cost of one pack of chicken is $2 * 2 = $4. Since Kelly has 6 packs of chicken, the total cost of the chicken is 6 * $4 = $24.

Next, let's find the cost of the strawberries. Each pack of strawberries costs $4, and Kelly has 3 packs, so the total cost of the strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.

Now, let's find the cost of the apples. Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is $4 / 2 = $2. Since Kelly has 7 packs of apples, the total cost of the apples is 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items in Kelly's cart: $10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60.

Finally, let's subtract the total cost from Kelly's budget: $65 - $60 = $5.

The final answer is: $5"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. 

Let's denote the runtime of Elaina's usual concert as 'x' minutes. 

Since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, its runtime is 2x minutes. 

At the end of the concert, she also performs a 15-minute encore. So, the total runtime of the final concert is 2x + 15 minutes.

We are given that the total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

2x + 15 = 65

To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 15 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 65 - 15
2x = 50

Next, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for x:

x = 50 / 2
x = 25

So, Elaina's usual concerts run for 25 minutes.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how many toys Argo has now, we need to subtract the number of toys he gave away from the total number of toys he initially had.

Initially, Argo had 200 toys.

He gave away 40 toys to Alyssa, 80 toys to Bonnie, and 30 toys to Nicky. 

Total toys given away = 40 + 80 + 30 = 150

Now, let's subtract the total toys given away from the initial number of toys:

200 - 150 = 50

So, Argo has 50 toys now.

On Tuesday, they make 125 chimichangas.
On Wednesday, they also make 125 chimichangas.
On Friday, they make twice as many as Wednesday, which is 2 * 125 = 250 chimichangas.

Now, let's add the number of chimichangas made on each day: 
125 (Tuesday) + 125 (Wednesday) + 250 (Friday) = 400

The final answer is: 400"
"To solve this problem, we first need to find out how many microphones the singer was able to arrange in pairs. Let's assume the total number of microphones arranged in pairs is 'x'. Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the total number of microphones arranged in pairs is 2x.

We know that 20% of the microphones couldn't fit, which means 80% of the microphones were arranged in pairs. The total number of microphones is 50, so 80% of 50 is 0.8 * 50 = 40 microphones were arranged in pairs.

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, we can set up the equation 2x = 40 to find the number of pairs. Solving for x, we get x = 40 / 2 = 20.

"To find the total number of birds, we need to calculate the number of birds in each group and add them together.

First, let's find the number of birds nesting in the bushes: 6.

Next, we need to find 2/3 of the number of birds nesting in the bushes. To do this, we multiply 6 by 2/3: 
6 * (2/3) = 4.

So, there are 4 birds flying overhead.

Now, let's find the number of birds feeding. There are 3 groups of 8 birds each, so we multiply 3 by 8:
3 * 8 = 24.

Now, we add the number of birds in each group together: 
6 (nesting) + 4 (flying) + 24 (feeding) = 34.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find out how many cookies were in each jar, we need to first determine how many cookies Lani had left after eating 5 cookies. 

Lani started with 55 cookies and ate 5, so she had 55 - 5 = 50 cookies left.

Since she placed the remaining cookies equally into 5 jars, we need to divide the remaining cookies by 5.

50 cookies / 5 jars = 10 cookies per jar.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of petals on the orchids, we multiply the number of orchids by the number of petals per orchid: 5 orchids * 5 petals/orchid = 25 petals.

To find the total number of petals on the daisies, we multiply the number of daisies by the number of petals per daisy: 4 daisies * 10 petals/daisy = 40 petals.

Now, we subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies to find the difference: 40 petals (daisies) - 25 petals (orchids) = 15 petals.

The daisies have 15 more petals compared to the orchids."
"To find the percentage of flowering plants, we first need to determine the number of flowering plants. 

There are 100 plants in total. One-fourth of them are indoor plants, which is 100 * (1/4) = 25 plants. 

The remaining plants are 100 - 25 = 75 plants. Two-thirds of these remaining plants are outdoor plants, which is 75 * (2/3) = 50 plants. 

The rest of the remaining plants are flowering plants, which is 75 - 50 = 25 plants.

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100: (25/100) * 100 = 25%.

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships between the speeds of the whirligig, whatchamacallit, and thingamabob. 

Let's denote the speed of the thingamabob as 'x'. 

Since a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, its speed is 11x. 

We are given that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, so we can set up the equation 11x = 121.

To find the speed of the thingamabob, we need to solve for x. 

Dividing both sides of the equation by 11, we get x = 121 / 11 = 11.

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig. Since the whirligig spins at five times the speed of the thingamabob, its speed is 5x = 5 * 11 = 55.

The final answer is: 55"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the price of one carrot as 'c'. Since the yogurt is half the price of the salad, the price of the yogurt is $6 / 2 = $3.

Ellen pays a total of $11 for her daily goods, which include two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt. We can write an equation to represent this:

2c + 6 + 3 = 11

Combine the constants on the left side of the equation:

2c + 9 = 11

Subtract 9 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with the variable:

2c = 2

Divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for 'c':

c = 1

So, Ellen pays $1 for one carrot every day.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn. Let's denote the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. 

Since she mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as Joe's, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times. 

The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.

The total number of lawns she mowed is the sum of the lawns she mowed for Kamala, Joe, and Alba, which is 3x + x + 5x = 9x.

We know that she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn, and since she mowed Joe's lawn 'x' times, she made a total of $6x from mowing lawns.

We also know that she made a total of $80 from both lemonade sales and mowing lawns. So, the amount she made from lemonade sales is $80 - $6x.

Since we don't know the value of 'x', we need to find it. We know that she mowed a total of 9x lawns, and she made $6x from mowing lawns. We also know that she made $80 in total, so the amount she made from lemonade sales is $80 - $6x.

However, we are given that she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn, and we know that she mowed Joe's lawn 'x' times. This means that the total amount she made from mowing lawns is $6x, and the total number of lawns she mowed is 9x.

"To find Harry's weight, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. Martin's weight is 55 kg.
2. Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so Carl's weight = 55 + 16 = 71 kg.
3. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight = 71 + 8 = 79 kg.
4. Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight = 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

"To calculate John's profit, we need to first calculate his total earnings from renting out his car. 

He rents his car 10 times a month for 3 hours each time, so the total hours he rents his car per month is 10 * 3 = 30 hours.

Since he gets paid $25 an hour, his total earnings per month would be 30 hours * $25/hour = $750.

However, he has a car payment of $500. To find his profit, we need to subtract his car payment from his total earnings.

Profit = Total earnings - Car payment
Profit = $750 - $500
Profit = $250

The final answer is: $250"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many notebooks Martha had initially. Since she bought 5 more notebooks to reach a total of 7, we can calculate her initial number of notebooks as follows:

Initial number of notebooks = Total number of notebooks - Number of notebooks bought
Initial number of notebooks = 7 - 5
Initial number of notebooks = 2

Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, we can calculate the number of notebooks Joseph had as follows:

Number of notebooks Joseph had = 3 * Initial number of notebooks Martha had
Number of notebooks Joseph had = 3 * 2
Number of notebooks Joseph had = 6

Now, we can find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph by subtracting the number of notebooks Joseph has from the number of notebooks Martha has:

Number of notebooks Martha has now - Number of notebooks Joseph has = 7 - 6
Number of notebooks Martha has now - Number of notebooks Joseph has = 1

"To find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we first need to determine the distance rowed by Anis. 

Dijana rowed 50 miles. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. To find 1/5 of Dijana's distance, we multiply 50 by 1/5, which is 10 miles. 

Since Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, we add the 10 miles to Dijana's distance: 50 + 10 = 60 miles.

Now, we add the distances rowed by both Dijana and Anis to find the total distance: 50 + 60 = 110 miles.

The final answer is: 110"
"To find out how many cookies each of Susan's nephews will get, we first need to determine the total number of cookies available after her husband took some. 

Initially, Susan had 100 cookies. Her husband took 4 cookies, so the total number of cookies left is 100 - 4 = 96.

Since Susan wants to divide the cookies equally among her 6 nephews, we need to divide the remaining cookies by 6. 

96 ÷ 6 = 16

So, each of Susan's nephews will get 16 cookies.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. 

Today, Denise read 5 more than as many pages as Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read 5 + 13 = 18 pages today.

To find the total number of pages each person read, we add the pages they read yesterday and today. Denise read 10 + 18 = 28 pages, and Daniel read 13 + 0 = 13 pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the number of pages Daniel read from the number of pages Denise read: 28 - 13 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of bowls that can be filled with the leftover soup and then divide that by the number of child-sized bowls.

Since the pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls, we can assume that the capacity of the pot is equivalent to 8 child bowls.

Calvin, his wife, and their two children will eat a total of 3 adult bowls (since Calvin and his wife are adults, and each child is equivalent to 1/2 an adult bowl). 

Since 1 adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls, 3 adult bowls are equivalent to 6 child bowls. 

So, the total number of bowls that will be eaten at dinner is 6 child bowls.

The leftover soup will be enough to fill 8 - 6 = 2 child bowls.

Therefore, each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch 2 times from the leftover soup.

"To find out how much material Jo needs, we need to calculate the total amount of material required for small and large masks separately and then add them together.

For small masks: 
- Each small mask requires 2 yards of material.
- Jo needs to make 20 small masks.
- Total material for small masks = 20 * 2 = 40 yards.

For large masks: 
- Each large mask requires 2.25 yards of material.
- Jo needs to make 8 large masks.
- Total material for large masks = 8 * 2.25 = 18 yards.

Total material required = material for small masks + material for large masks = 40 + 18 = 58 yards.

"To find the average price Deepa paid per ticket, we need to first find the total number of tickets she bought and the total amount she spent.

Since Deepa saw each of the 9 movies three times, the total number of tickets she bought is 9 movies * 3 showings per movie = 27 tickets.

The total amount she spent is given as $216.

To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets: $216 / 27 tickets.

Average price per ticket = $216 / 27 tickets = $8.

"To find Harold's free time, we need to calculate the total time he spends on activities and subtract that from the total hours in a day (24 hours).

Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night. 
He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for 10 - 2 = 8 hours a day.
He walks his dog for 1 hour a day.

Total time spent on activities = 10 (sleep) + 8 (work) + 1 (walking dog) = 19 hours

Free time = Total hours in a day - Total time spent on activities
Free time = 24 - 19
Free time = 5 hours

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many red shoeboxes Tim used for fishing. Since he used 1/3 of his red shoeboxes, we need to calculate 1/3 of 9.

1/3 of 9 = 9 / 3 = 3

So, Tim used 3 red shoeboxes for fishing. Now, we need to find out how many red shoeboxes are left. 

9 (initial red shoeboxes) - 3 (used red shoeboxes) = 6

Now, let's find out how many blue shoeboxes are left. Tim used 3 blue shoeboxes for fishing.

7 (initial blue shoeboxes) - 3 (used blue shoeboxes) = 4

So, Tim has 6 red shoeboxes and 4 blue shoeboxes left.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of books Joseph had initially. Since Joseph had twice the number of Sarah's books, and Sarah has 9 books, we can calculate Joseph's initial number of books as follows:

Joseph's initial number of books = 2 * Sarah's number of books
= 2 * 9
= 18

However, Joseph lost 2 books, so we need to subtract those from his initial number of books to find out how many he currently has:

Joseph's current number of books = Joseph's initial number of books - 2
= 18 - 2
= 16

Therefore, Joseph currently has 16 books.

"To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we need to first calculate how many marbles he gave away. 

Dean gives 1/5 of his marbles to Jamie. Since Dean has 30 marbles, 1/5 of 30 is 30 * (1/5) = 6 marbles. 

So, Dean gave away 6 marbles to Jamie. 

Then, he gave 10 marbles to Donald. 

In total, Dean gave away 6 + 10 = 16 marbles.

To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we subtract the marbles he gave away from the total number of marbles he had initially. 

30 (initial marbles) - 16 (marbles given away) = 14 marbles.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote Adam's age four years ago as 'x'. Since Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, we can write an equation:

Duncan's age eight years ago = 2 * Adam's age four years ago
Duncan's age eight years ago = 2x

We know that Duncan's current age is 60. To find his age eight years ago, we subtract 8 from his current age:

Duncan's age eight years ago = 60 - 8
Duncan's age eight years ago = 52

Now we can equate this to 2x:

52 = 2x

To find x, we divide both sides by 2:

x = 52 / 2
x = 26

This means Adam's age four years ago was 26. To find Adam's current age, we add 4 to x:

Adam's current age = 26 + 4
Adam's current age = 30

Finally, to find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8
Adam's age in 8 years = 38

"To find out how much Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday, we need to calculate the total number of packages he completes in that time and then multiply it by his hourly wage.

First, let's find out how many packages Colby completes in an hour. He completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, so he completes 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

Now, let's calculate the total number of packages he completes in an 8-hour workday: 40 packages/hour * 8 hours = 320 packages.

Since Colby gets paid $0.20 for every package he completes, we can multiply the total number of packages by his hourly wage to find his total earnings: 320 packages * $0.20/package = $64.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes to complete an extreme sudoku puzzle and then determine how many half-hour intervals fit into that time. 

A normal sudoku puzzle takes 45 minutes, and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long. So, an extreme sudoku takes 45 * 4 = 180 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we need to find out how many half-hour intervals fit into 180 minutes. There are 2 half-hour intervals in 1 hour, so in 180 minutes, there are 180 / 30 = 6 hours. 

However, we need to find the number of half-hour intervals, not hours. Since there are 2 half-hour intervals in 1 hour, we multiply 6 hours by 2 to get 12 half-hour intervals.

Therefore, John drinks 12 bottles of water in the time it takes to complete an extreme sudoku puzzle.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of yellow balloons as 'y'. Since there are 20 red balloons, the total number of balloons is 20 (red) + y (yellow).

Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon, so the total number of bologna pieces thrown at red balloons is 2 * 20 = 40.

Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, so the total number of bologna pieces thrown at yellow balloons is 3 * y.

The total number of bologna pieces thrown is 58, so we can set up the equation: 40 (red) + 3y (yellow) = 58.

Now, let's solve for y:
40 + 3y = 58
Subtract 40 from both sides:
3y = 18
Divide both sides by 3:
y = 6

So, there are 6 yellow balloons in the bundle.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount of money Julia and Nadine had, and then divide it by 2 to find out how much each of them received.

First, let's find the cost of the balloons. 1 dozen balloons is equal to 12 balloons. Since 2 balloons cost $0.5, 12 balloons will cost 12 * $0.5 / 2 = $3.

The total cost of the cake and the balloons is $11 + $3 = $14.

The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is $7 * 2 = $14.

The total cost of the cake, balloons, and ice cream is $14 + $14 = $28.

Since Julia and Nadine used all the money they had to buy these items, the total amount of money they had is $28.

Since they had the same amount of allowance, each of them received half of the total amount. Therefore, each of them received $28 / 2 = $14.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of berries the sloth can pick per trip. 

Let's break down the information given:

- The sloth takes 4 hours to make a round trip (down and back up) to collect berries.
- The sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

Since the sloth takes 4 hours for a round trip, in 8 hours, he can make 8 / 4 = 2 round trips.

If he makes 2 round trips, he will collect a total of 2 * x berries, where x is the number of berries he picks per trip.

We want this total to be 24 berries, so we can set up the equation:

2 * x = 24

To find the minimum number of berries he can pick per trip, we need to solve for x:

x = 24 / 2
x = 12

So, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip is 12.

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of water used from the tank over 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so we can multiply this rate by the number of days:

500 gallons/day * 6 days = 3000 gallons

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the remaining budget Colby has for the last day of the month. 

Colby's initial budget is $150. He has already spent:

- 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays: 5 * $10 = $50
- 8 movies on other days: 8 * $7 = $56
- 2 tubs of popcorn: 2 * $8 = $16
- 4 boxes of candy: 4 * $2 = $8

Total spent so far: $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130

Remaining budget: $150 - $130 = $20

Since Colby wants to buy a popcorn and a box of candy, he will spend $8 + $2 = $10.

Remaining budget after buying popcorn and candy: $20 - $10 = $10

Tickets for the last day of the month (Sunday) cost $7. To find out how many movies Colby can see, we divide the remaining budget by the cost of a ticket: $10 / $7 = 1.42857 (round down to 1, since you can't see a fraction of a movie).

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3 of that, so the calories of a mini blueberry muffin are 450 * 1/3 = 150 calories.

Now, we can calculate the total calories of each type of pastry. The total calories of the mini cinnamon rolls are 200 * 200 = 40,000 calories. The total calories of the mini blueberry muffins are 150 * 300 = 45,000 calories.

The total calories of all the pastries are 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories.

The final answer is: 85000"
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed and then divide it by the number of days.

On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday, she removed twice as many as Monday, so 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs.
On Wednesday, she removed twice as many as Tuesday, so 2 * 78 = 156 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total number of Junebugs removed = 39 + 78 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 378

There are 5 days in total. 

Average number of Junebugs removed per day = Total number of Junebugs removed / Number of days
= 378 / 5
= 75.6

The final answer is: 75.6"
"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to calculate the total distance each vehicle traveled.

The bus travels at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours. To find the distance traveled by the bus, we multiply the speed by the time: 60 miles/hour * 5 hours = 300 miles.

The car travels at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours. To find the distance traveled by the car, we multiply the speed by the time: 30 miles/hour * 8 hours = 240 miles.

Now, we need to find the difference in distance between the bus and the car. To do this, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus: 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles.

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find the number of bouncy balls, we need to subtract the total number of toys Sophie had before buying the bouncy balls from the total number of toys she has now. 

The total number of toys before buying the bouncy balls is the sum of the blocks, stuffed animals, and stacking rings. 

Total number of toys before = 31 (blocks) + 8 (stuffed animals) + 9 (stacking rings) = 48

Now, we subtract this from the total number of toys after buying the bouncy balls to find the number of bouncy balls.

Number of bouncy balls = Total number of toys after - Total number of toys before
= 62 - 48
= 14

The final answer is: 14"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as p, and John's age as j.

We are given that Paul is 10 years older than John, so we can write an equation:

p = j + 10

We are also given that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age:

P = p + j

We are also given that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old. However, there is no information about Jean's age, so we can assume that Jean is actually John, as the problem statement seems to be referring to the same person.

So, the combined age equation becomes:

P + p + j = 100

Now we can substitute the first equation (p = j + 10) into the second equation:

P + (j + 10) + j = 100

Combine like terms:

P + 2j + 10 = 100

Subtract 10 from both sides:

P + 2j = 90

Now we need to find Peter's age, which is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age (P = p + j). We can substitute the first equation (p = j + 10) into this equation:

P = (j + 10) + j

Combine like terms:

P = 2j + 10

Now we have two equations with two variables:

P + 2j = 90
P = 2j + 10

Subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate P:

(P + 2j) - (P = 2j + 10) = 90 - (2j + 10)
2j - 2j = 80
0 = 80

This is a contradiction, which means that the initial assumption that Jean is John is incorrect. However, we can try another approach.

Let's go back to the original equations:

p = j + 10
P = p + j

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation:

P = (j + 10) + j

Combine like terms:

P = 2j + 10

Now we have two equations with two variables:

P + p + j = 100
P = 2j + 10

Substitute the second equation into the first equation:

(2j + 10) + p + j = 100

Substitute p = j + 10 into the equation:

(2j + 10) + (j + 10) + j = 100

Combine like terms:

4j + 20 = 100

Subtract 20 from both sides:

4j = 80

Divide both sides by 4:

j = 20

Now that we have John's age, we can find Paul's age:

p = j + 10
p = 20 + 10
p = 30

Now that we have Paul's age, we can find Peter's age:

P = p + j
P = 30 + 20
P = 50

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total number of balloons, we need to calculate the initial number of balloons and then add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, Maria had 1 water balloon, and each of her 4 friends had 2 water balloons. So, the total number of balloons initially is:
1 (Maria's balloon) + (4 x 2) = 1 + 8 = 9

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people (including Maria), the total number of additional balloons is:
5 x 3 = 15

Now, we add the initial number of balloons to the additional balloons:
9 (initial balloons) + 15 (additional balloons) = 24

The total number of balloons the girls have is 24. 

24"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of boxes of stuff and then divide that by the number of boxes that can fit per table.

First, let's calculate the total number of boxes of stuff donated by the 10 people. Since each person donates 5 boxes, the total number of boxes donated is 10 * 5 = 50 boxes.

Adding the 10 boxes they already own, the total number of boxes is 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

Since they can fit 2 boxes per table, the number of tables needed is 60 / 2 = 30 tables.

However, they already own 15 tables. To find out how many new tables they need, we subtract the number of tables they already own from the total number of tables needed: 30 - 15 = 15.

Therefore, the charity group needs 15 new tables.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the average total distance spat, we need to calculate the total distance spat by each person and then divide it by the number of seeds they spat.

Zoey spits 40 seeds, each 10 feet, so the total distance spat by Zoey is 40 * 10 = 400 feet.

Sydney spits 35 seeds, each 12 feet, so the total distance spat by Sydney is 35 * 12 = 420 feet.

The total distance spat by both of them is 400 + 420 = 820 feet.

They spat a total of 40 + 35 = 75 seeds.

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the total distance spat by the number of seeds: 820 / 75 = 10.93 (rounded to two decimal places).

The final answer is: 10.93"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine in a month and then find the difference in revenue.

First, let's calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine in a month:

Widgeteer 3000: 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets
WidgetMaster 9000: 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets

Next, let's calculate the revenue generated by each machine in a month:

Widgeteer 3000: 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200
WidgetMaster 9000: 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

Now, let's find the difference in revenue:

$259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

The final answer is: $64,800"
"To determine how much money Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his chosen option and compare it to the cost of the 24-hour stay.

Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours. Since the first 12 hours are included in the initial charge, he will pay for the remaining 5 hours (17 - 12 = 5) at an additional 70 pesos per hour.

The cost of the additional 5 hours is 5 * 70 = 350 pesos.

The cost of the 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos. 

To find out how much Cameron would save, we subtract the cost of his chosen option from the cost of the 24-hour stay: 1600 - (1000 + 350) = 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

The final answer is: $250"
"To find the total amount of hay needed, we first need to determine the amount each sheep needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds and each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, we can calculate the amount each sheep needs as follows:

Twice the amount each goat needs: 2 * 5 = 10 pounds
3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs: 10 - 3 = 7 pounds

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and sheep separately:

For goats: 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds
For sheep: 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds

To find the total amount of hay needed, we add the amount needed for goats and sheep:

Total hay needed = 75 pounds (goats) + 84 pounds (sheep) = 159 pounds

The final answer is: 159"

The total number of children in the drill is 280."
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher gives to the students. 

There are 29 students and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice, so the total number of bottles given to students is 29 * 2 = 58.

The teacher has 9 coupons, each redeemable for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles the teacher can get is 9 * 100 = 900.

However, the teacher has already given 58 bottles to the students. To find out how many bottles are left for the teacher, we need to subtract the number of bottles given to students from the total number of bottles the teacher can get. 

900 - 58 = 842

The teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice for herself.

"To find the total amount Patty charged, we need to calculate the labor cost and add it to the cost of parts. 

First, let's calculate the labor cost. The job took 2.25 hours, and the labor rate is $35 per hour. Since the labor rate is for the hour or part thereof, we can multiply the labor rate by the total hours worked.

Labor cost = 2.25 hours * $35/hour = $78.75

Next, we add the cost of parts to the labor cost.

Total cost = Labor cost + Cost of parts
Total cost = $78.75 + $60
Total cost = $138.75

Therefore, Patty charged $138.75 for the job.

The final answer is: $138.75"
"To find out how much James spent on the CDs, we first need to calculate the original price of the CDs and then subtract the discount. 

The original price of 10 CDs is 10 * $15 = $150. 

Since James gets a 40% discount, we need to find 40% of $150. 
40% of $150 = 0.4 * $150 = $60.

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price: $150 - $60 = $90.

James spent $90 on the CDs.

Next, we need to find out how much he got back from selling 5 CDs. 
He sold each CD for $40, so he got 5 * $40 = $200.

Now, we subtract the amount he got back from the amount he spent: $90 - $200 = -$110.

However, since James can't be out by a negative amount, we need to re-evaluate the situation. 

James spent $90 on the CDs and got $200 from selling 5 of them. This means he actually made a profit of $200 - $90 = $110.

The final answer is: $110"

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. First, let's calculate the time it takes James to swim 60% of the distance. 
   Distance = 20 miles, 
   Speed = 2 miles per hour, 
   Time = Distance / Speed = 20 / 2 = 10 hours.
   60% of the distance is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles.
   Time taken to swim 12 miles = 12 / 2 = 6 hours.

2. Now, let's calculate the time James rests on the island. 
   He rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

3. The remaining distance is 20 - 12 = 8 miles. 
   James swims at half the speed, which is 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour.
   Time taken to swim the remaining 8 miles = 8 / 1 = 8 hours.

4. Total time taken = Time taken to swim 12 miles + Time taken to rest + Time taken to swim the remaining 8 miles.
   Total time taken = 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.

- Commission rate: 10%
- Commission per copy: 10% of $5 = 0.1 * $5 = $0.5
- Total commission from New York Times: 6 * $0.5 = $3

Next, let's calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal:

- Number of copies sold: 10
- Price per copy: $15
- Commission rate: 8%
- Commission per copy: 8% of $15 = 0.08 * $15 = $1.2

"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up equations based on the given information. Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as A, Bahati as B, and Dinar as D.

We know that the total points scored by the team is 45, so we can write the equation:

A + B + D = 45

We also know that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so we can write:

B = A + 20

We also know that Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, so we can write:

B = D + 10

Since we have two equations with B, we can substitute one of them into the first equation to solve for A. Let's substitute B = A + 20 into the first equation:

A + (A + 20) + D = 45

Combine like terms:

2A + D + 20 = 45

Subtract 20 from both sides:

2A + D = 25

Now, we can substitute B = D + 10 into the equation B = A + 20:

D + 10 = A + 20

Subtract 10 from both sides:

D = A + 10

Now we have two equations with D:

2A + D = 25
D = A + 10

Substitute D = A + 10 into the first equation:

2A + (A + 10) = 25

Combine like terms:

3A + 10 = 25

Subtract 10 from both sides:

3A = 15

Divide both sides by 3:

A = 5

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

"To find the total number of reports Vince stapled, we need to calculate the total time he spent stapling reports and then multiply it by the number of reports he can staple per minute.

First, let's find the total time in minutes. Vince stapled reports from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is a total of 15 hours. 

15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Now, we know Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many reports he can staple per minute, we divide 30 by 15.

30 reports / 15 minutes = 2 reports/minute

Now, we multiply the total minutes by the number of reports he can staple per minute.

900 minutes * 2 reports/minute = 1800 reports

"To find out how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up earlier.

Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she usually sleeps for 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 5:55 a.m. instead of 6 a.m. This means she slept for 5:55 a.m. - 10 p.m. = 7 hours and 55 minutes. Converting this to minutes, we get 7 * 60 + 55 = 455 minutes.

She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes.

To find the total sleep time, we subtract the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up earlier from her usual sleep time: 480 - 23 - 25 = 432 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has initially. 

Since Jonathan has two dozen cups, and one dozen equals 12, he has 2 * 12 = 24 measuring cups.

It is given that Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. To find the number of measuring spoons, we multiply the number of measuring cups by 2/3.

Number of measuring spoons = (2/3) * 24
= (2 * 24) / 3

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is 10."
"To find the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we first need to calculate the number of occupied beds and then subtract that from the total capacity.

The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 of them are occupied. 

1/5 of 1000 is 100. So, 100 beds are occupied initially.

Each day, 50 patients are admitted into the hospital. In 2 weeks, there are 14 days. 

In 14 days, 50 patients are admitted each day, so the total number of patients admitted is 50 * 14 = 700.

Initially, there were 100 occupied beds. After 2 weeks, there will be 100 + 700 = 800 occupied beds.

The total capacity of the hospital is 1000 beds. To find the number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the number of occupied beds from the total capacity.

1000 - 800 = 200

Two-thirds of the remainder (non-work emails) are to her family. Two-thirds of 9 is (2/3) * 9 = 6. This means she sends 6 emails to her family.

Now, we need to find out how many emails are left after sending to her family. Since she sends 6 emails to her family, the remaining emails are 9 - 6 = 3.

One-third of the remaining emails are to her boyfriend. One-third of 3 is (1/3) * 3 = 1.

Therefore, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

Since Aliya is 3 years old, and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, we can calculate Shawna's age as follows:

Shawna's age = 3 * Aliya's age
Shawna's age = 3 * 3
Shawna's age = 9

Now that we know Shawna's age, we can find her father's age, since her father is five times as old as Shawna:

"To solve this problem, let's start by identifying the relationship between the number of balls each boy carried. We know that Jason carried 2 balls, and Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason. Therefore, Jordan carried 2 x 2 = 4 balls.

We also know that Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey. Since Jason carried 2 balls, Jeffrey must have carried half of Jason's amount, which is 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

Now, we know that the total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls carried by each of them. So, the total number of balls is 1 (carried by Jeffrey) + 2 (carried by Jason) + 4 (carried by Jordan) = 7 balls.

However, this is the number of balls carried by the boys, not the total number of balls brought to practice. Since the boys carried all the balls in one trip, the total number of balls brought to practice is equal to the number of balls carried by the boys.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day.
2. The total number of holes at the end of the first day is 10.
3. On the second day, they dug 13 holes, so the total number of holes becomes 10 + 13 = 23.
4. On the third day, they dug 8 holes and filled in 2, so the total number of holes becomes 23 - 2 = 21.
5. The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 4 * 10 = 40.
6. Since there were 21 holes at the end of the third day, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is 40 - 21 = 19.

The pirates dug 19 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Since Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and the third person got 15 more than each of them, the third person got 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

We know that the total number of corn chips is the sum of the amount each person got. Let's denote the number of corn chips each of the first two people got as x. Then, the third person got x + 15.

The total number of corn chips is the sum of the amount each person got, so we can write the equation: x + x + (x + 15) = total number of corn chips.

Since Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, we can substitute x with 70 in the equation: 70 + 70 + (70 + 15) = total number of corn chips.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 70 + 70 + 85 = total number of corn chips.

Combine the numbers: 225 = total number of corn chips.

The final answer is: 225"
"To find the cost of travel, we first need to determine the cost of the supplies, which is given as $400. 

Since the tickets for travel cost 50% more than the supplies, we need to calculate 50% of $400 and add it to the cost of the supplies.

50% of $400 is calculated as 0.5 * $400 = $200.

Now, we add this to the cost of the supplies: $400 + $200 = $600.

Therefore, the cost of travel is $600.

The final answer is: $600"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, Stan as S, and Alex as X.

We know that together they have caught 339 Pokémon, so we can write the equation:
A + S + X = 339

We also know that Alex has caught 5 more Pokémon than Stan, so we can write:
X = S + 5

We also know that Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, so we can write:
S = 4A - 13

Now we can substitute the expression for S from the second equation into the first equation:
A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 13 + 5) = 339

Combine like terms:
A + 4A - 13 + 4A - 8 = 339
Combine A terms:
9A - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:
9A = 360

Divide both sides by 9:
A = 40

Now that we know A, we can find S:
S = 4A - 13
S = 4(40) - 13
S = 160 - 13
S = 147

The final answer is: 147"
"To find the total number of episodes, we need to determine how many episodes there are in total. Since there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, and each episode is 20 minutes long, we can set up an equation.

Let x be the number of episodes. Since each episode is 20 minutes long, the total number of minutes is 20x. We are also told that the number of episodes is half the number of minutes per episode, so we can write the equation as x = 20/2.

Solving for x, we get x = 10. This means there are 10 episodes in total.

To find the total number of minutes John will spend watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode: 10 * 20 = 200 minutes.

The final answer is: 200"
"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in the southerly direction and subtract the distance traveled in the northerly direction.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled in the southerly direction:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour x 10 hours
Distance = 300 miles

Then, let's calculate the distance traveled in the northerly direction:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 18 miles/hour x 2 hours
Distance = 36 miles

Now, let's calculate the distance traveled in the final southerly direction:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 22 miles/hour x 5 hours
Distance = 110 miles

Since the bird traveled 300 miles in the initial southerly direction, then 36 miles in the northerly direction, and finally 110 miles in the second southerly direction, we need to add the distances traveled in the southerly directions and subtract the distance traveled in the northerly direction:

Total southerly distance = 300 miles + 110 miles = 410 miles
Total distance = 410 miles - 36 miles = 374 miles

The final answer is: 374"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Greta started with 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, she had 12 brownies initially.

At her office, they sent her home with 1/2 a dozen brownies. Since 1/2 a dozen is equal to 6, she now has 12 + 6 = 18 brownies.

When she arrived home, her friends had 4 dozen brownies waiting. Since 4 dozen is equal to 48, she now has 18 + 48 = 66 brownies.

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten. Since 1 1/2 dozen is equal to 18, she now has 66 - 18 = 48 brownies left.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the total age of all three family members, we first need to determine the age of Nani's brother and sister.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 2 * 8 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of his age. To find her age, we multiply Nani's age by 0.75: 8 * 0.75 = 6 years.

Now, we add up the ages of all three family members: Nani (8 years) + his brother (16 years) + his sister (6 years) = 30 years.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time spent on each type of string and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time spent on synthetic gut racquets: 3 racquets * 15 minutes/racquet = 45 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time spent on polyester string racquets: 5 racquets * 22 minutes/racquet = 110 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time spent on hybrid sets: 4 racquets * 18 minutes/racquet = 72 minutes.

Finally, we add the time spent on each type of string together: 45 minutes + 110 minutes + 72 minutes = 227 minutes.

The final answer is: 227"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the phones. 

First, we need to find the cost of the first two phones. The price of each phone is $600, so the cost of the first two phones is 2 * $600 = $1200.

Next, we need to find the cost of the remaining two phones, which are half price. Half of $600 is $300, so the cost of each of the remaining two phones is $300. The total cost of the remaining two phones is 2 * $300 = $600.

Now, we need to add the cost of the first two phones and the cost of the remaining two phones to find the total cost. The total cost is $1200 + $600 = $1800.

The final answer is: $1800"
"To find the total number of players in both teams, we first need to determine the number of players on Zeke's team. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, and Carlton's team has 13 players, we can calculate the number of players on Zeke's team by adding 7 to 13.

Zeke's team = Carlton's team + 7
Zeke's team = 13 + 7
Zeke's team = 20

Now, to find the total number of players in both teams, we add the number of players on Zeke's team to the number of players on Carlton's team.

Total players = Zeke's team + Carlton's team
Total players = 20 + 13
Total players = 33

The final answer is: 33"
"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2(length + width).

In this case, the length of the fence is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet. 

Perimeter = 2(15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2(25)
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2 to find the total number of slats needed.

Total slats = Perimeter * 2
Total slats = 50 * 2
Total slats = 100

The final answer is: 100"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington had initially. Since she bought 12 boxes of oranges and each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges she had is:

12 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 240 oranges

Then, she gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes each, which is a total of 4 boxes. Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges she gave away is:

4 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 80 oranges

So, the number of oranges she had left is:

240 oranges - 80 oranges = 160 oranges

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges, which is:

160 oranges * 1/4 = 40 oranges

She sold the rest, which is:

160 oranges - 40 oranges = 120 oranges

Therefore, Mrs. Harrington sold 120 oranges. 

The final answer is: 120"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of states in the USA and India. The USA has 50 states. 

Next, we need to find half the number of states in the USA. Half of 50 is 25. 

India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, so we add 4 to 25. 25 + 4 = 29. 

Now, we know that the USA has 50 states and India has 29 states. To find the total number of states in both countries together, we add 50 and 29. 

50 + 29 = 79

The final answer is: 79"
"To determine how many hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books. 

The total cost of the books is the sum of the cost of the dictionary, the dinosaur book, and the children's cookbook. 

Total cost = $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39

Since Tyler has already saved $14 from his allowance, we need to subtract this from the total cost to find out how much more he needs to earn.

Amount needed to earn = Total cost - Amount saved = $39 - $14 = $25

Tyler earns $5 per hour, so to find out how many hours he needs to work, we divide the amount he needs to earn by his hourly wage.

Hours needed to work = Amount needed to earn / Hourly wage = $25 / $5 = 5 hours

Therefore, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford his books.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many cherries Richard and Jerry have. Since Robert has 30 cherries and has 10 more than Richard, we can set up an equation to find out how many cherries Richard has. Let's denote the number of cherries Richard has as R. 

R + 10 = 30

To find R, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation.

R = 30 - 10
R = 20

So, Richard has 20 cherries. 

Now, we know that the total number of cherries is 60, and Robert and Richard have 30 and 20 cherries respectively. To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we can subtract the total number of cherries Robert and Richard have from the total number of cherries.

Total cherries = 60
Robert's cherries = 30
Richard's cherries = 20
Total cherries of Robert and Richard = 30 + 20 = 50

Cherries Jerry has = Total cherries - Total cherries of Robert and Richard
Cherries Jerry has = 60 - 50
Cherries Jerry has = 10

Now, we know that Robert has 30 cherries and Jerry has 10 cherries. To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we can subtract the number of cherries Jerry has from the number of cherries Robert has.

Cherries Robert has - Cherries Jerry has = 30 - 10
Cherries Robert has - Cherries Jerry has = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many boxes of gingerbread and apple pie Sunny sold on both days and then calculate the total earnings.

Let's denote the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday as G and the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday as A.

We know that on Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread, so G = 10.

We also know that on Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday, and on Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie. This means that A = 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie were sold on Saturday.

On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday is G + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15.

Now we have the number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie sold on both days: 
- Saturday: G = 10, A = 11
- Sunday: G = 15, A = 15

To find the total earnings, we need to multiply the number of boxes sold by the price of each item and add the results together.

The total earnings from gingerbread are (10 * 6) + (15 * 6) = 60 + 90 = 150 dollars.
The total earnings from apple pie are (11 * 15) + (15 * 15) = 165 + 225 = 390 dollars.

The total earnings for two days are 150 + 390 = 540 dollars.

"To determine the total amount of sunscreen needed, we need to calculate the total number of hours Pamela will be outside and then multiply it by the amount of sunscreen she reapplies each hour.

Pamela will be outside 4 hours a day for 8 days. 
Total hours = 4 hours/day * 8 days = 32 hours

Since Pamela reapplies an ounce of sunscreen every hour, she will need 32 ounces of sunscreen in total.

Each bottle of sunscreen contains 8 ounces. 
To find out how many bottles she needs, we divide the total amount of sunscreen needed by the amount in each bottle: 
32 ounces / 8 ounces per bottle = 4 bottles

Therefore, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen. 

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the price of the red car, we need to calculate 40% of the price of the blue car and subtract it from the price of the blue car.

First, let's find 40% of the price of the blue car:
40% of $100 = 0.4 x $100 = $40

Now, subtract $40 from the price of the blue car to find the price of the red car:
$100 - $40 = $60

So, the price of the red car is $60.

To find the total cost of both cars, we add the prices of the red and blue cars:
$60 (red car) + $100 (blue car) = $160

The final answer is: $160"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Emil is 19 years old now.
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
3. When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.

From point 3, we can infer that Emil's brother is currently half of Emil's age when Emil turns 24. Since Emil is 19 now, when he turns 24, he will be 24 - 19 = 5 years older. Therefore, his brother's age when Emil turns 24 will be 5 / 2 = 2.5 years.

Now, we know that when Emil turns 24, his brother will be 2.5 years old. This means his brother is currently 2.5 - 5 = -2.5 years old when Emil is 19. However, age cannot be negative, so this is a logical contradiction. This means our initial assumption that Emil's brother is half of Emil's age when Emil turns 24 is incorrect.

Let's re-evaluate the information. If Emil is 19 now and will be half the age of his dad when he turns 24, then his dad's age when Emil turns 24 will be 24 * 2 = 48 years.

Since Emil is 19 now, his dad's current age is 48 - 19 = 29 years.

Now, let's re-evaluate the information that Emil will be twice as old as his brother when he turns 24. This means his brother's age when Emil turns 24 will be 24 / 2 = 12 years.

Since Emil is 19 now, his brother's current age is 12 - 5 = 7 years.

The sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother now is 29 + 7 = 36.

"To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to calculate the number of beads she received from her mother, sister, and friend, and then add them together.

Adrianne's mother gave her 20 beads.
Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the beads together: 20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the total amount of crawfish Joe caught, we need to calculate the amount he caught each day and add them together.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.
On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount of Thursday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 pounds.
On Saturday, he caught half the amount of Friday, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the total amount of crawfish Joe caught: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can find the total number of servings by dividing the total amount of crawfish by the serving size: 21 / 3 = 7.

"To find the number of students leaving early, we first need to find the number of football players, and then add the number of cheerleaders or band members.

First, let's find the number of football players. 20% of 30 students are football players. 

20% of 30 = 0.20 * 30 = 6

So, there are 6 football players.

Next, we need to find the number of students who are not football players. 

Number of students not football players = Total students - Football players
= 30 - 6
= 24

Now, 25% of the remaining students are cheerleaders or part of the band.

25% of 24 = 0.25 * 24 = 6

So, there are 6 cheerleaders or band members.

Total students leaving early = Football players + Cheerleaders or band members

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of flowers Pat needs to buy and then calculate the total cost.

First, let's convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches, since the width of the flowers is given in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches

Since Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet (18 inches) between every plant, we need to subtract the width of the flowers and the space between them from the total length of the flower bed. However, we also need to account for the space taken up by the flowers themselves.

Let's denote the number of flowers as 'n'. The total width taken up by the flowers and the spaces between them is:

n * (12 inches/flower + 18 inches/space)

Since there are 'n' flowers, there are 'n-1' spaces between them. The total width taken up by the flowers and the spaces is equal to the length of the flower bed:

n * (12 inches/flower + 18 inches/space) = 1332 inches

We also know that Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 'n-17' flowers. The total cost of the flowers is:

(n-17) * $6/flower

Now, let's solve for 'n':

n * (12 + 18) = 1332
n * 30 = 1332
n = 1332 / 30
n = 44.4

Since we can't have a fraction of a flower, we round up to the nearest whole number to ensure that the flowers fit in the flower bed. However, in this case, we will round down to 44 flowers because we are calculating the number of flowers needed to fill the bed, not the number of spaces between them.

Now, let's calculate the total cost:

Total cost = (44 - 17) * $6
Total cost = 27 * $6
Total cost = $162

The final answer is: $162"
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day, we need to calculate 1/2 of the number of pretzels Edgar eats in a day. 

Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day. 
1/2 of 18 is 18 / 2 = 9 pretzels.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we need to multiply the number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day by 7.

9 pretzels/day * 7 days = 63 pretzels

Cost of 15 petunias = 15 * $3.00 = $45.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of sweet potato vines:
5 baskets * 2 sweet potato vines per basket = 10 sweet potato vines
Cost of 10 sweet potato vines = 10 * $2.50 = $25.00

Now, let's add the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines together:
Total cost = $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations, and then subtract that from the total amount of soil available.

First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers: 
4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds

Next, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the carnations: 
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds

Now, let's add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations: 
12 pounds + 15 pounds = 27 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, we can calculate the number of roses that can be planted by dividing the remaining soil by 1 pound:
30 pounds (total soil) - 27 pounds (used for sunflowers and carnations) = 3 pounds

3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses

"To find out how many shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we first need to calculate how much she sets aside each month for shoes. 

25% of $2,000 is calculated as 0.25 * 2000 = $500. 

Since she sets aside $500 each month, in a year (12 months), she would set aside 12 * 500 = $6,000.

Now, we need to find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy with $6,000. Each pair costs $1,000, so we divide the total amount she sets aside in a year by the cost of one pair of shoes: 6000 / 1000 = 6.

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two separate tasks: peeling and cooking. 

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp a minute, we can divide 90 by 6 to find the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp. 

90 / 6 = 15 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to cook 90 shrimp. Since she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we can divide 90 by 30 to find the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp, then multiply by 10. 

90 / 30 = 3, then 3 * 10 = 30 minutes

However, since peeling and cooking are done sequentially, we need to add the time it takes for each task. 

15 minutes (peeling) + 30 minutes (cooking) = 45 minutes

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

The final answer is: 45"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour on low and 3 degrees per hour on high.
2. The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour without the air conditioner.
3. The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, so it cooled the room by 2 * 3 = 6 degrees.
4. Then, it was turned up to high for 4 hours, so it cooled the room by 3 * 4 = 12 degrees.
5. The total cooling effect of the air conditioner is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.
6. However, the room also warmed up for 2 hours without the air conditioner, so it warmed up by 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.
7. The net cooling effect of the air conditioner is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the age of Bill's father when Bill saw the comet for the second time. 

Let's denote the age of Bill's father when he saw the comet as 'x'. Since Bill saw the comet when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet, Bill's age at that time is 3x.

We are given that Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. Therefore, the time elapsed between the two sightings is 75 years. 

Since Bill's age at the second sighting is 3x and his father's age at the first sighting is 30, we can set up the equation:

3x - 30 = 75

To solve for x, we add 30 to both sides of the equation:

3x = 75 + 30
3x = 105

Now, we divide both sides by 3:

x = 105 / 3
x = 35

This is the age of Bill's father when he saw the comet. Since Bill was 30 years old when his father saw the comet, we can find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time by subtracting 30 from x:

Bill's age at the first sighting = x - 30
= 35 - 30
= 5

"To find the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks for each category and then add them together.

1. Checks for the electric bill: 1 check per month, so 12 checks per year.
2. Checks for the gas bill: 1 check per month, so 12 checks per year.
3. Checks to the church: 2 checks per month, so 24 checks per year.
4. Checks to the pest and lawn service: 1 check every 3 months, so 4 checks per year.

Now, let's add the total number of checks: 12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn service) = 52 checks per year.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the total number of flights made by the first plane as 'x'. Since the second plane makes half the number of flights as the first plane, the total number of flights made by the second plane is 'x/2'.

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, which is (3/4)x. The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of flights to France is (1/4)x.

We are given that the second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips. Since the second plane makes half the number of flights as the first plane, we can set up the equation:

x/2 = 44

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2:

x = 88

Now that we know the total number of flights made by the first plane, we can find the number of flights to France:

Flights to France = (1/4)x
= (1/4)(88)
= 22

"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the individual howling times and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, let's add the individual howling times together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

In total, Adam received $6 from his mother and $12 from his father, so he received $6 + $12 = $18 from his parents.

Since Adam bought the trousers for $30, and he received $18 from his parents, he must have contributed the remaining amount from his savings.

To find out how much Adam contributed from his savings, we subtract the amount he received from his parents from the total cost of the trousers: $30 - $18 = $12.

Therefore, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings.

The final answer is: $12"
"To solve this problem, we can start by using the information that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. Let's denote the average age of the group as 'A'. Then, Helene's age is 2A.

We know that the total age of the children is 20. Since there are four children, the average age 'A' can be calculated as the total age divided by the number of children. 

A = Total age / Number of children
A = 20 / 4
A = 5

Now that we know the average age 'A' is 5, we can find Helene's age, which is twice the average age.
Helene's age = 2A
Helene's age = 2 * 5
Helene's age = 10

We also know that Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old. Let's denote Wilfred's age as 'W'. The total age of the group is the sum of the ages of all four children.

Total age = Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age + Wilfred's age
20 = 3 + 4 + 10 + W
20 = 17 + W
W = 20 - 17
W = 3

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how much Walter's lawyer will contribute, we need to calculate the total amount collected from Walter's neighbors and the online fund. 

Walter collects $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. 

Total amount collected so far = $500 + $1500 = $2000

Walter's friend donates $200, but this is not included in the amount that the lawyer will base his donation on. The lawyer will donate three times the amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund, which is $2000.

So, the lawyer will donate 3 * $2000 = $6000.

The final answer is: $6000"
"To find the total number of cookies, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies brought by the guests. Since each guest brought 15 cookies and there were 100 guests, the total number of cookies is 100 * 15 = 1500.

The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door. So, the number of cookies given to the church is 1/2 * 1500 = 750.

Since each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, we can find the number of people in the church by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received. 

Number of people in the church = Total cookies given to the church / Number of cookies per person
= 750 / 15
= 50

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, let's consider the total number of slices as 6 (2 adults + 4 kids). 

Let's assume the size of each kid's slice is 'x'. Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid, the size of each adult's slice is '2x'.

The total number of slices is 6, so the total size of the watermelon can be represented as 6x (since each slice is 'x' in size).

The two adults get 2 slices each, so the total size of the slices for the adults is 2 * 2x = 4x.

The remaining slices are for the kids, which is 4 slices in total. The total size of the slices for the kids is 4x.

Since the total size of the watermelon is 6x, and the adults get 4x, the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets is (4x / 6x) * 100.

To find the percentage, we can simplify the fraction: (4/6) * 100 = (2/3) * 100 = 66.67%.

So, each adult gets approximately 66.67% of the watermelon.

The final answer is: 66.67"
"To determine the time Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time spent on rounds and appointments, and then subtract that from the total hours he works.

Time spent on rounds: 
- Each inpatient takes 20 minutes, and there are 10 inpatients. 
- Total time spent on rounds = 20 minutes/inpatient * 10 inpatients = 200 minutes
- Convert minutes to hours: 200 minutes / 60 = 3.33 hours

Time spent on appointments: 
- Each appointment takes 30 minutes, and there are 10 appointments. 
- Total time spent on appointments = 30 minutes/appointment * 10 appointments = 300 minutes
- Convert minutes to hours: 300 minutes / 60 = 5 hours

Total time spent on rounds and appointments = 3.33 hours + 5 hours = 8.33 hours

Time left to update records = Total hours worked - Total time spent on rounds and appointments
= 9 hours - 8.33 hours
= 0.67 hours

The final answer is: 0.67"
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake. 

First, let's add the time it takes to make the cake batter (20 minutes) and bake the cake (30 minutes): 20 + 30 = 50 minutes.

Next, we add the time it takes to cool the cake (2 hours, which is 120 minutes) and the time to frost the cake (10 minutes): 120 + 10 = 130 minutes. 

Now, we add the time it takes to make the cake batter and bake the cake (50 minutes) to the time it takes to cool and frost the cake (130 minutes): 50 + 130 = 180 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 180 minutes to hours by dividing by 60: 180 / 60 = 3 hours.

Jordan wants to serve the cake at 5:00 pm, so we need to subtract the total time required to make the cake (3 hours) from the serving time. 

5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm.

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of boxes sold by both Lisa and Peter. Since they sold 64 chocolate bars together, and we know that Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes, we can set up an equation to represent the total number of boxes sold.

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as 'x'. Then, the total number of chocolate bars sold by Lisa is 3.5x, and the total number of chocolate bars sold by Peter is 4.5x. Since they sold 64 chocolate bars together, we can set up the equation:

3.5x + 4.5x = 64

Combine like terms:

8x = 64

Now, divide both sides by 8:

x = 64 / 8
x = 8

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box. 

The final answer is: 8"
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to first calculate the daily earnings and then multiply it by the number of days in a month.

The cost to rent the studio per session is $25, and there are 10 students, so the cost per session is $25 + (10 * $1.50) = $25 + $15 = $40.

Since the studio is rented 3 days a week, the weekly earnings would be $40 * 3 = $120.

There are approximately 4 weeks in a month, so the monthly earnings would be $120 * 4 = $480.

However, this is the cost, not the earnings. To find the earnings, we need to subtract the cost from the total revenue. 

The total revenue per session is $40 (cost) + (10 * $1.50) = $40 + $15 = $55 per student. Since there are 10 students, the total revenue per session is $55 * 10 = $550.

The studio is rented 3 days a week, so the weekly revenue is $550 * 3 = $1650.

The monthly revenue is $1650 * 4 = $6600.

The monthly earnings would be the monthly revenue minus the monthly cost of renting the studio. The monthly cost of renting the studio is $25 * 3 * 4 = $300.

The monthly earnings are $6600 - $300 = $6300.

The final answer is: $6300"
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box for both Peter and Martha, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes.

For Peter: 64 chocolate bars / 4 boxes = 16 chocolate bars per box
For Martha: 56 chocolate bars / 7 boxes = 8 chocolate bars per box

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter and Martha. 

Difference = 16 (Peter's chocolate bars per box) - 8 (Martha's chocolate bars per box) = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the number of female porcupines, we need to calculate 3/5 of the total population. 

3/5 * 50 = 30

So, there are 30 female porcupines. 

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

30 * 4 * 12 = 1440

However, these babies are not yet part of the population at the beginning of the year. To find the total population after a year, we need to add the initial population to the number of babies born.

Initial population: 50
Babies born in a year: 1440
Total population after a year: 50 + 1440 = 1490

The final answer is: 1490"
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth of the pool. 

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the number of gallons of water needed, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. There are 7.48 gallons in a cubic foot, so:

Volume in gallons = 1400 * 7.48
Volume in gallons = 10472 gallons

Now, we multiply the volume in gallons by 5.9 to get the total gallons of water needed:
Total gallons = 10472 * 5.9
Total gallons = 61851.28 gallons

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon, so we multiply the total gallons by the cost per gallon:
Cost = 61851.28 * 0.10
Cost = 6185.128

The final answer is: $6185.13"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of blue and yellow sticks first, and then add them to the number of red sticks.

We know there are 9 red sticks. We also know that there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks. So, the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14.

The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is 14 - 3 = 11.

Now, we can add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks to find the total number of sticks: 9 (red) + 14 (blue) + 11 (yellow) = 34.

"To find the distance traveled by Matteo, we multiply his speed by the time he traveled: 55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles.

To find the distance traveled by Shandy, we multiply his speed by the time he traveled: 45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles.

To find the difference in distance traveled, we subtract the distance traveled by Matteo from the distance traveled by Shandy: 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles.

The final answer is: 230"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Total students = 3000
2. Half of the students are over 16 years old: 3000 / 2 = 1500 students over 16 years old.
3. One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male: 1500 / 4 = 375 male students over 16 years old.
4. The remaining students are under 16 years old: 3000 - 1500 = 1500 students under 16 years old.
5. Half of the students under 16 years old are male: 1500 / 2 = 750 male students under 16 years old.
6. Total male students = 375 (over 16) + 750 (under 16) = 1125 male students.
7. Total female students = Total students - Total male students = 3000 - 1125 = 1875.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many laps each person can run and then compare Bethany's laps to Quinn's laps.

Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.

Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.

Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.

Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract Quinn's laps from Bethany's laps: 10 - 5 = 5.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. 

Since Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

So, on the first day, the total amount of water in the tank is 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. 

Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

So, on the second day, the total amount of water in the tank is 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

The total amount of water in the tank after two days is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.

Since the tank has a capacity of 18000 gallons, the remaining amount of water needed to fill the tank is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is: 6000"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the first part where the power bank loses 9% of its capacity per hour for 5 hours, and the second part where it loses 7% of its capacity per hour for 3 hours.

Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as x.

In the first part, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity per hour for 5 hours. This means that after 5 hours, the charge remaining is 100% - 9% * 5 = 100% - 45% = 55% of the initial charge x.

So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining is 0.55x.

In the second part, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity per hour for 3 hours. This means that after 3 hours, the charge remaining is 100% - 7% * 3 = 100% - 21% = 79% of the charge remaining after 5 hours, which is 0.79 * 0.55x.

So, after 8 hours (5 hours + 3 hours), the charge remaining is 0.79 * 0.55x = 0.4345x.

We are given that the charge remaining after 8 hours is 28%. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

0.4345x = 0.28

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.4345:

x = 0.28 / 0.4345
x = 0.644

The initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 64.4%.

The final answer is: 64.4"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate Janet's total weekly earnings and then determine how many weeks she needs to work to save 20% of the car's cost.

First, let's calculate Janet's total weekly earnings:

Wage: $10/hour
Tips: $15/hour
Total hours worked per week: 40 hours

Total weekly earnings = (Wage + Tips) * Total hours worked per week
Total weekly earnings = ($10 + $15) * 40
Total weekly earnings = $25 * 40
Total weekly earnings = $1000

Next, let's calculate the amount Janet needs to save for the down payment:

Car cost: $10,000
Down payment percentage: 20%
Down payment amount = Car cost * Down payment percentage
Down payment amount = $10,000 * 0.20
Down payment amount = $2,000

Now, let's calculate how many weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment:

Total weekly earnings: $1000
Down payment amount: $2,000

Number of weeks needed to work = Down payment amount / Total weekly earnings
Number of weeks needed to work = $2,000 / $1000
Number of weeks needed to work = 2

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Jamaar has already purchased and subtract that from his budget to find out how much he has left to spend on plums.

The cost of 3 peaches is 3 x $0.5 = $1.5
The cost of 4 pears is 4 x $0.5 = $2
The cost of 2 kiwis is 2 x $1 = $2
The cost of 5 apples is 5 x $0.75 = $3.75

Total cost of items purchased so far is $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar's initial budget is $10, so he has $10 - $9.25 = $0.75 left to spend on plums.

Since plums cost $0.25 each, we can divide the remaining budget by the cost of one plum to find out how many plums he can buy: $0.75 / $0.25 = 3

"To find out how many pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received, we first need to determine the total number of packs she gave away. Since Anne kept 2 packs for herself, she gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs.

Next, we need to find out how many packs each friend received. Since Anne gave the packs to 10 friends equally, we divide the total number of packs given away (13) by the number of friends (10). 

13 packs / 10 friends = 1.3 packs per friend. 

However, since each pack contains 60 pieces, we need to multiply the number of packs each friend received by the number of pieces in each pack to find the total number of pieces each friend received.

1.3 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 78 pieces.

So, each of Anne's friends received 78 pieces of sweets.

"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the increase in price each year and add it to the original price.

Year 1: 
Original price = $120
Increase = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Original price = $126
Increase = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Original price = $132.30
Increase = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many pictures Olivia put into each album. Since she put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide the total number of pictures by 8.

Total pictures = 72
Pictures per album = Total pictures / Number of albums
Pictures per album = 72 / 8
Pictures per album = 9

Since 3 albums were selfies only and 2 albums were portraits, the remaining 3 albums must be a mix of both selfies and portraits. However, we are not given any information about the mix of selfies and portraits in these 3 albums. 

But we can still find the total number of selfies and portraits. Since 3 albums were selfies only, the total number of selfies is 3 * 9 = 27. Similarly, since 2 albums were portraits only, the total number of portraits is 2 * 9 = 18.

The final answer is: 
Selfies: 27
Portraits: 18"

Since James reads 18 pages, we can divide 18 by 3 to find out how many sets of 3 pages he reads: 18 / 3 = 6. 

Since it takes James 10 minutes to read each set of 3 pages, we can multiply the number of sets by the time it takes to read each set: 6 * 10 = 60.

James spends 60 minutes reading before going to sleep.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of small stuffed animals as 's' and the number of large stuffed animals as 'l'. We know that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so we can write an equation:

s = 2l

We also know that the price of a small stuffed animal is $4. Since Teresa sold 's' small stuffed animals, the total amount of money she earned from small stuffed animals is 4s.

The price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal, which is 3 * 4 = $12. Since Teresa sold 'l' large stuffed animals, the total amount of money she earned from large stuffed animals is 12l.

We are given that Teresa earned a total of $120 from the sales. Therefore, we can write another equation:

4s + 12l = 120

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can substitute the first equation (s = 2l) into the second equation to solve for 'l':

4(2l) + 12l = 120
8l + 12l = 120
20l = 120
l = 6

Now that we know 'l', we can find 's' by substituting 'l' into the first equation:

s = 2l
s = 2(6)
s = 12

Therefore, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe and then multiply it by 40 dwarves and 30 days.

First, let's find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with an iron pickaxe. Since he can mine twice as much with an iron pickaxe as with his bare hands, he can mine 2 * 12 = 24 pounds of ore per day with an iron pickaxe.

Next, let's find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe. Since he can mine 50% more with a steel pickaxe than with an iron pickaxe, he can mine 24 + (0.5 * 24) = 24 + 12 = 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe.

Now, let's find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day with steel pickaxes. Since one dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe, 40 dwarves can mine 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds of ore per day.

Finally, let's find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in 30 days with steel pickaxes. Since they can mine 1440 pounds of ore per day, they can mine 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds of ore in 30 days.

"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of proportionality. Let's denote the price of the package with 8 sandwiches as x.

We know that the price of the first package (2 sandwiches) is $3, and the price of the second package (4 sandwiches) is $6. We can set up a proportion to relate the prices and the number of sandwiches:

Price of 2 sandwiches / Number of sandwiches = Price of 4 sandwiches / Number of sandwiches
3 / 2 = 6 / 4

However, this proportion is not directly useful, as it's the same ratio on both sides. To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to compare the price of the second package (4 sandwiches) to the price of the first package (2 sandwiches), and then use that ratio to find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches.

Price of 4 sandwiches / Price of 2 sandwiches = Price of 8 sandwiches / Price of 4 sandwiches
6 / 3 = x / 6

Now, we can solve for x:

6 / 3 = x / 6
2 = x / 6
x = 2 * 6
x = 12

Initial cost of the bedroom set: $3000
Money from selling the old bedroom set: $1000
Remaining amount owed: $3000 - $1000 = $2000

Since Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining amount each month, we need to calculate 10% of $2000.

10% of $2000 = 0.10 * $2000 = $200

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month. 

The final answer is: $200"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

First, 40% of the red balloons burst. To find the number of red balloons that burst, we multiply 25 by 0.4: 25 * 0.4 = 10. So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

Next, Sally released half of the yellow balloons. Half of 12 is 6, so she released 6 yellow balloons, leaving 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.

Then, she found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch. 75% of 8 is 6, so she added 6 blue balloons to her clutch. Now, she has 15 red balloons, 6 yellow balloons, and 6 blue balloons.

To find the total number of balloons she carried into the school, we add these numbers together: 15 + 6 + 6 = 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to consider the scenarios where he won't get an extension. 

First, let's consider the scenario where the substitute teacher is present. In this case, there's a 50% chance of the substitute teacher being present, and since the homework won't be collected in this scenario, the probability of having to turn in the homework is 0%.

Next, let's consider the scenario where the normal teacher is present. In this case, there's a 60% chance (100% - 40% extension chance). Within this 60%, there's a 80% chance (100% - 20% chance of getting a personal extension) that Marcus won't get an extension.

Now, we can calculate the overall probability of having to turn in the homework:

Probability of substitute teacher: 50% * 0% = 0%
Probability of normal teacher with no extension: 60% * 80% = 48%
Total probability of having to turn in the homework: 0% + 48% = 48%

The final answer is: 48%"
"To find out how many tickets each graduate can receive, we first need to determine the total number of available seats for guests. 

Total capacity of the Fine Arts Center: 6000
Seats for graduates: 950
Seats for faculty: 300

Total seats taken: 950 + 300 = 1250

Available seats for guests: 6000 - 1250 = 4750

Since there are 950 graduates, we need to divide the available seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate can receive.

4750 / 950 = 5

Each graduate can receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the different sizes of jelly beans. 

Let's start by defining the number of large beans as L, medium beans as M, and small beans as S. We are given that it takes 75 large beans to fill Grandpa up, so L = 75.

We are also given that Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans. This means M = 2L. Since L = 75, M = 2 * 75 = 150.

Next, we are told that eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. This means S = 3 * M. Since M = 150, S = 3 * 150 = 450.

However, the question asks how many small beans Grandpa can eat, but it also implies that eating a certain number of small beans is equivalent to eating a certain number of large beans (75). Since we know that eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium bean, and eating 1 medium bean is equivalent to eating 0.5 large beans (because M = 2L), eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 0.5 large beans.

Since it takes 75 large beans to fill Grandpa up, and eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 0.5 large beans, we can find the number of small beans that is equivalent to 75 large beans by dividing 75 by 0.5. 

75 / 0.5 = 150

However, this is the number of sets of 3 small beans that is equivalent to 75 large beans. To find the total number of small beans, we multiply this by 3.

150 * 3 = 450

However, this is the number of small beans that is equivalent to 75 large beans. To find the number of small beans that Grandpa can eat, we need to find the number of small beans that is equivalent to 1 large bean, and then multiply that by 75.

Since eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium bean, and eating 1 medium bean is equivalent to eating 0.5 large beans, eating 6 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 large bean (because 3 * 2 = 6).

Now we can multiply 6 by 75 to find the number of small beans that is equivalent to 75 large beans.

6 * 75 = 450

However, this is the same as the previous answer. This is because the previous answer was the number of small beans that is equivalent to 75 large beans, and this answer is also the number of small beans that is equivalent to 75 large beans. 

The final answer is: 450"
"To find out how much Melissa makes per hour after expenses, we need to first calculate her total earnings and total expenses. 

Total earnings: Melissa is paid $15 per day for 3 days, so her total earnings are 15 * 3 = $45.

Total expenses: Melissa pays $3 for parking each day for 3 days, so her total expenses are 3 * 3 = $9.

Now, we need to find out how many hours she worked in total. Melissa spends 6 hours a day for 3 days, so she worked a total of 6 * 3 = 18 hours.

To find out her hourly wage after expenses, we need to subtract her total expenses from her total earnings and then divide by the total number of hours she worked. 

Total earnings after expenses = Total earnings - Total expenses = 45 - 9 = $36.

Hourly wage after expenses = Total earnings after expenses / Total hours worked = 36 / 18 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of the books and the cost of the pencils separately and then add them together.

The cost of the books is 3 * 16 = 48 dollars.
The cost of the pencils is 3 * 6 = 18 dollars.

Now, we add the cost of the books and the pencils together: 48 + 18 = 66 dollars.

Ted spent a total of $66.

"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to first determine the total number of soda bottles he will place along the driveway. 

Since the driveway is 24 feet wide and he wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet, we can divide the total width of the driveway by the spacing between the bottles:

24 feet / 3 feet = 8 bottles

Since it takes Richard 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, we can multiply the number of bottles by the time it takes to place each one:

8 bottles * 5 seconds/bottle = 40 seconds

Therefore, it will take Richard 40 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

The final answer is: 40"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many apples Uncle Franky has in total. Since he ordered two boxes and each box has 40 apples, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of apples in each box.

Total apples = 2 boxes * 40 apples/box = 80 apples

Next, we need to find out how many packs Uncle Franky can make with 80 apples. Since each pack has 8 apples, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples in each pack.

Number of packs = Total apples / apples per pack = 80 / 8 = 10

So, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how much money Amor will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she bought and subtract that from the initial amount of money she had.

The cost of 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese is 2 x $11 = $22.
The cost of 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese is 3 x $6 = $18.
The total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40.

Amor starts with $50, so subtracting the total cost of the cheese from her initial amount of money, we get $50 - $40 = $10.

Therefore, Amor will have $10 left to buy meat.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim lost due to loans and lost income while in college. 

First, let's calculate the total amount of loans he took: 
4 years * $50,000/year = $200,000

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money he lost due to not working while in college. 
His income before college was $25,000/year. 
His income after college is $25,000 * 3 = $75,000/year. 
The difference in income is $75,000 - $25,000 = $50,000/year. 
The total amount of money he lost due to not working while in college is $50,000/year * 4 years = $200,000.

The total amount of money he needs to earn is the sum of the loans and the lost income: 
$200,000 (loans) + $200,000 (lost income) = $400,000.

Now, let's calculate how long it would take him to earn this amount at his new income of $75,000/year:
Time = Total amount / Annual income
Time = $400,000 / $75,000
Time = 5.33 years

The final answer is: 5.33"
"To find the total area of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. 

The fabric pieces need to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed. So, the length of each fabric piece will be 6 + 2 = 8 feet and the width will be 8 + 2 = 10 feet.

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we need to calculate the area of one piece and then multiply it by 2. The area of one piece is length * width = 8 * 10 = 80 square feet. 

Since Jim needs two pieces, the total area of fabric he needs is 80 * 2 = 160 square feet.

The final answer is: 160"
"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then add them together.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. One-fifth of 425 is 425 / 5 = 85. 17 more than that is 85 + 17 = 102. So, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. Twice as many as Tuesday is 102 * 2 = 204. 5 more than that is 204 + 5 = 209. So, on Wednesday, they delivered 209 letters.

Now, let's add the number of letters delivered each day: 425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736.

The total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $101."
"To find the average loss, we need to calculate the total loss and then divide it by the number of races. 

First, let's calculate the amount Johnny's dad lost and won in each race.

1. Loss in the first race: -$5
2. Win in the second race: He won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. 
   Twice the amount he previously lost is 2 * (-$5) = -$10
   He won $1 more than that, so he won $1 + (-$10) = -$9
3. Loss in the third race: He lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   He won $9 in the second race, so he lost 1.5 * $9 = $13.5

Now, let's calculate the total loss:
Total loss = -$5 (first race) + $9 (second race) + $13.5 (third race) = $17.5

There were 3 races, so the average loss is:
Average loss = Total loss / Number of races = $17.5 / 3 = $5.8333

"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we first need to determine their current heights. 

Xavier's initial height was 4 feet, which is equivalent to 48 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches). He grew 3 inches over the summer, so his current height is 48 + 3 = 51 inches.

Cole's initial height was 50 inches, and he grew 2 inches over the summer, so his current height is 50 + 2 = 52 inches.

The difference in height between Cole and Xavier is 52 - 51 = 1 inch.

The final answer is: 1"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the share of the first person as x. 

Since the second person took $80 more than the first, the second person's share is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is 2(x + 80).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920.

Combine like terms: x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920.

Combine like terms again: 4x + 240 = 1920.

Subtract 240 from both sides: 4x = 1680.

Divide both sides by 4: x = 420.

The share of the first person is $420.

The final answer is: $420"
"To find the total hours worked by each painter, we need to calculate the total hours worked in 3 weeks and then divide it by the number of painters and the number of days they worked.

First, let's convert 3 weeks to days: 3 weeks = 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Since they worked 3/8ths of a day every day, we need to find the fraction of a day in hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3/8 of a day is (3/8) * 24 = 9 hours.

Now, we multiply the hours worked per day by the number of days: 9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours.

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4: 189 hours / 4 = 47.25 hours.

The final answer is: 47.25"
"Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. 

Since Rory retrieved four more balls in the first set than in the second, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set, which is given as 19. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for x, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Expanding the equation:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

Number of balls in the first set = x + 4
= 6 + 4

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation of the car from 2007 to 2010. 

The car was bought in 2007, so we need to calculate the depreciation for 3 years (2008, 2009, and 2010).

The formula for depreciation is: 
Final Value = Initial Value * (1 - Depreciation Rate)^Number of Years

Initial Value = $20,000
Depreciation Rate = 21% or 0.21
Number of Years = 3

First, we calculate the depreciation for 2008:
Price in 2008 = $20,000 * (1 - 0.21) = $20,000 * 0.79 = $15,800

Next, we calculate the depreciation for 2009:
Price in 2009 = $15,800 * (1 - 0.21) = $15,800 * 0.79 = $12,502

Finally, we calculate the depreciation for 2010:
Price in 2010 = $12,502 * (1 - 0.21) = $12,502 * 0.79 = $9,900.18

The price of the car in 2010 is approximately $9,900.18.

"To find out how many loads of laundry Greg does in a week, we need to calculate the total number of sheets he puts on the beds and divide it by the number of sheets he can wash at a time.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. Since a twin bed has 1 set of sheets and a king size bed has 1 set of sheets, the total number of sheets he puts on the beds is 4 + 1 = 5.

Since he can wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 2 and 1, which is 2. This means he can wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set at a time.

However, since he has 5 sets of sheets, he will need to do 3 loads of laundry: 2 loads of twin sets (4 twin sets) and 1 load of a king set (1 king set).

To find out how many loads of laundry he does in a year, we need to multiply the number of loads he does in a week by the number of weeks in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of stickers Leo collected over the past three years and add it to the initial number of stickers he had two years ago.

Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers. 
Last year, he collected 50 stickers, so he had 100 + 50 = 150 stickers.
This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which is 2 * 50 = 100 stickers.
So, this year, he has 150 + 100 = 250 stickers.

Now, we add the stickers from the previous years to the initial number of stickers: 100 (initial) + 50 (last year) + 100 (this year) = 250.

The total number of stickers Leo has in his collection is 250 + 100 (initial) = 350.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the time Donovan took as 'x'. Since Betsy took 18 minutes longer than Donovan, the time Betsy took can be represented as 'x + 18'. 

The total time taken to make the meal is the sum of the time taken by both Betsy and Donovan, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation as:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:
2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:

32 + 64 + 192 + 30 + 25 = 303

The final answer is: 303"
"To find the average score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the number of tests. 

First, let's add up the scores of the first 3 tests: 100 + 100 + 100 = 300. 

Then, we add the score of the 4th test: 300 + 80 = 380.

Now, we divide the total score by the number of tests: 380 / 4 = 95.

The final answer is: 95"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club and the football team, and then subtract that from the total number of pizzas ordered.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. To find the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club, we multiply 20 by 0.7 (which is 70% expressed as a decimal).

20 * 0.7 = 14 pizzas eaten by the glee club.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. They ate 80% of them, which is 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas.

Now, we add the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club and the football team: 14 + 32 = 46 pizzas eaten in total.

The total number of pizzas ordered was 20 (glee club) + 40 (football team) = 60 pizzas.

To find the number of pizzas left, we subtract the total number of pizzas eaten from the total number of pizzas ordered: 60 - 46 = 14 pizzas left.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of big coupons. Since there are twice as many big coupons as small coupons, and there are 700 small coupons, the number of big coupons is 2 * 700 = 1400.

The cost of mailing the small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents.

The cost of mailing the big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

Now, we add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons together: 3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100: 24500 / 100 = 245 dollars.

The final answer is: $245"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches. This means Sidney ordered 10 - 3 = 7 meatball sub sandwiches.

2. Each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs. So, the total number of meatballs in the 7 sub sandwiches is 7 * 4 = 28.

3. Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. This means there are now 7 - 4 = 3 sub sandwiches left.

4. Sidney ordered another 3 sub sandwiches. Now, the total number of sub sandwiches is 3 + 3 = 6.

5. The total number of meatballs in the 6 sub sandwiches is 6 * 4 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we first need to determine the number of trucks that did not experience mechanical failures. 

Since a quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures, we can calculate the number of trucks that failed as follows:

Number of trucks dispatched = 20
Number of trucks with mechanical failures = 20 * (1/4) = 5

Now, we subtract the number of trucks with mechanical failures from the total number of trucks dispatched to find the number of trucks that reached the farmers:

Number of trucks that reached the farmers = 20 - 5 = 15

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. To find the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we multiply the number of trucks that reached the farmers by the tons of fertiliser each truck carried:

Total tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers = 15 * 20 = 300

The final answer is: 300"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of 6 pounds of butter with the promotion. 

First, let's calculate the total number of pounds of butter Dennis needs. Since he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants and he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter.

Since the grocery store has a promotion for buy one pound of butter get one half off, we can calculate the cost of 6 pounds of butter as follows:

- For the first 3 pounds of butter, Dennis will pay full price ($4.00 per pound), so the cost will be 3 * $4.00 = $12.00.
- For the next 3 pounds of butter, Dennis will get one half off, so he will pay half the price, which is $4.00 / 2 = $2.00 per pound. The cost for these 3 pounds will be 3 * $2.00 = $6.00.

The total cost of 6 pounds of butter will be $12.00 + $6.00 = $18.00.

The final answer is: $18.00"
"To find the total cost of the party, we need to calculate the number of guests and then add the rental fee. 

First, let's find the total number of guests. Kayla invited 25 classmates, 7 dance class girls, and 13 family members, but 4 people said they couldn't come. 

Total invited guests = 25 (classmates) + 7 (dance class girls) + 13 (family members) = 45
Guests who can attend = Total invited guests - Guests who can't come = 45 - 4 = 41

Since the initial fee is for 20 guests, we need to find the number of additional guests. 

Additional guests = Guests who can attend - Initial 20 guests = 41 - 20 = 21

Now, we can calculate the total cost. 

Cost for additional guests = $6 * Additional guests = $6 * 21 = $126
Rental fee = $125
Total cost = Cost for additional guests + Rental fee = $126 + $125 = $251

The final answer is: $251"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much money Maggie and Riza had initially. Since they both have $60 left after spending a portion of their money, we can work backwards to find the initial amount.

Let's assume the initial amount of money Maggie had is M and the initial amount of money Riza had is R. We know that Maggie spent a quarter of her money, so she has 3/4M left. Similarly, Riza spent one-third of her money, so she has 2/3R left.

We are given that both of them have $60 left, so we can set up the following equations:

3/4M = 60
2/3R = 60

To find the initial amount of money each had, we can solve for M and R:

M = 60 / (3/4) = 60 * (4/3) = 80
R = 60 / (2/3) = 60 * (3/2) = 90

Now that we know the initial amount of money each had, we can find the total initial amount:

Total initial amount = M + R = 80 + 90 = 170

Since they spent a portion of their money, the total amount they have left is $60 + $60 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we first need to determine how many bananas the second monkey eats. 

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day.

Since there are three monkeys in total, and they eat all the bananas in a day, the total number of bananas eaten by the three monkeys is 10 + 14 + x, where x is the number of bananas eaten by the third monkey.

We know that the total number of bananas is 315, and they are enough for a week, which is 7 days. So, the total number of bananas eaten in a week is 315 * 7 = 2205.

However, since we are looking for the number of bananas eaten by the third monkey in a day, we need to find out how many bananas the three monkeys eat in a day. To do this, we can divide the total number of bananas by 7: 315 / 7 = 45 bananas per day.

Now, we know that the first monkey eats 10 bananas and the second monkey eats 14 bananas, so the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys is 10 + 14 = 24 bananas. 

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats, we subtract the number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total number of bananas eaten in a day: 45 - 24 = 21 bananas.

The final answer is: 21"
"To find the number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we need to determine how many pieces he placed in total and then subtract the pieces he placed before the hour.

Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, which means he placed 500 / 2 = 250 pieces before the hour.

During the hour, he finished another 500 piece puzzle, which means he placed 500 pieces during that hour.

So, the total number of pieces he placed during that hour is 500.

The final answer is: 500"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the roses and then find out how much change Jenny will receive.

First, let's calculate the cost of the roses. Jenny bought 15 roses, but since a dozen roses cost $15, we can calculate the cost of the remaining roses as follows:

15 roses - 12 roses (1 dozen) = 3 roses
Cost of 3 roses = 3 x $2 = $6
Cost of 1 dozen roses = $15
Total cost of 15 roses = $6 + $15 = $21

Jenny paid with five $5 bills, which is a total of:
5 x $5 = $25

Now, let's calculate the change she will receive:
Change = $25 (payment) - $21 (cost) = $4

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the change into quarters:
$4 = 16 quarters (since 4 x 4 = 16)

Jenny will leave with 16 quarters.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to calculate the revenue from each item and then add them together.

Revenue from milkshakes: 6 milkshakes * $5.50 each = 6 * 5.50 = $33
Revenue from burger platters: 9 burger platters * $11 each = 9 * 11 = $99
Revenue from sodas: 20 sodas * $1.50 each = 20 * 1.50 = $30

Total revenue = Revenue from milkshakes + Revenue from burger platters + Revenue from sodas
Total revenue = $33 + $99 + $30
Total revenue = $162

The final answer is: $162"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the first train will leave the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves the station. Since the first train leaves at 30 minutes, the second train will arrive at 30 + 30 = 60 minutes.

3. The second train stays in the station for a quarter of the amount of time that the first train stayed in the station. The first train stayed for 20 minutes, so the second train will stay for 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. The second train will leave the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

4. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves the station. Since the second train leaves at 65 minutes, the third train will arrive at 65 + 60 = 125 minutes.

5. The third train leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it will leave at 125 minutes.

6. The fourth train will arrive 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station. Since the third train leaves at 125 minutes, the fourth train will arrive at 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

7. Paul will board the fourth train, which arrives at 145 minutes. Since he is currently at the station, he will wait until the fourth train arrives. Therefore, Paul will wait for 145 - 0 = 145 minutes.

The final answer is: 145"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many toothpicks Melanie has saved so far and then determine how many more weeks it will take her to reach 200 toothpicks.

Melanie saved 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. To find the total number of toothpicks she has saved, we multiply the number of toothpicks saved per week by the number of weeks:

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Since Melanie needs 200 toothpicks for the sculpture, we subtract the number of toothpicks she has saved from the total number of toothpicks needed:

200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take Melanie to save the remaining 80 toothpicks at a rate of 10 toothpicks per week:

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

Therefore, Melanie will need 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we first need to determine the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch and the price at which he sold it to his friend.

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price, so the price he paid is 75% of $2000, which is 0.75 * $2000 = $1500.

Then, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, which is 1.2 * $1500 = $1800.

To find the discount percentage, we need to find the difference between the original price and the price at which Mr. Rogers' friend bought the watch, and then divide it by the original price and multiply by 100.

The discount is ($2000 - $1800) = $200.

The percentage discount is ($200 / $2000) * 100 = 10%.

Therefore, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is 10%."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps.

1. First, we need to determine how many seconds are in 4 hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, and 60 seconds in a minute, so there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour. Since we're looking at 4 hours, we multiply this by 4: 3600 * 4 = 14400 seconds.

2. Since each spring creates a new jellyfish every second, we need to find out how many jellyfish each spring creates in 14400 seconds. Since the rate is constant, each spring will create 14400 jellyfish in 14400 seconds.

3. Now, we need to find out how many jellyfish 5 springs will create in 14400 seconds. Since each spring creates 14400 jellyfish in 14400 seconds, 5 springs will create 5 times that amount: 14400 * 5 = 72000 jellyfish.

The final answer is: 72000"
"To find Frankie's score, we need to first calculate twice Binkie's score and then add 15 to it. 

Binkie's score is 90. Twice Binkie's score is 2 * 90 = 180. 

Now, we add 15 to 180 to find Frankie's score: 180 + 15 = 195.

The final answer is: 195"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the time it took James to walk to the store and the time it took him to walk back home.

First, let's calculate the time it took James to walk to the store. Since he walked halfway to the store and then turned back, he effectively walked the entire distance to the store. The distance to the store is 4 miles, and he walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour. 

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 1 hour

However, this is the time it took him to walk to the store. Since he walked back home, we need to double this time to account for the round trip.

Total time = 2 * 1 hour
Total time = 2 hours

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much money Jenny saved, we first need to calculate the total cost of buying the bananas individually and then compare it to the cost of buying them in bunches.

If Jenny buys 10 bunches with 4 bananas per bunch, she buys a total of 10 * 4 = 40 bananas.

The cost of buying 40 bananas individually would be 40 * $0.80 = $32.00.

The cost of buying 10 bunches is $3.00 per bunch, so the total cost is 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

To find the savings, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

Therefore, Jenny saved $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total amount of fence each person will get. Let's assume Sam gets x feet of fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry will get x + 60 feet of fence.

We know that the total amount of fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So Sam will get 20 feet of fence. 

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the rate at which the crocodile grows per year. 

The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. To find the growth rate per year, we divide the total growth by the number of years: 8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches per year.

Now, we need to find out how much the crocodile will grow in 13 years. We multiply the growth rate per year by the number of years: 2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches.

The final answer is: 26"
"To find out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply it by its price.

First, let's find the number of each type of bike sold:

- Total bikes sold: 300
- Trekking bikes: 300 / 2 = 150
- BMX bikes: 300 * 0.15 = 45
- MTB bikes: 300 - (150 + 45) = 105

Now, let's calculate the total earnings from each type of bike:
- Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500
- BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250 (since BMX is half the price of MTB, which is $500, so BMX is $500 / 2 = $250)
- MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500

Now, let's add up the total earnings from all types of bikes:
$67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250

The final answer is: $131,250"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of bales made by the farmer and the total number of bales picked up by the truck, and then subtract the number of bales picked up from the number of bales made.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the farmer will make 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck will pick up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

Since the truck picks up 18 bales, and the farmer makes 30 bales, the number of bales left in the field is 30 - 18 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total time John spends learning, we need to calculate the time spent in classes, and the time spent on Saturday and Sunday.

First, let's calculate the time spent in classes. John takes 2 extra classes, each 40 minutes long, 5 days a week. 

Time spent in classes per day = 2 * 40 minutes = 80 minutes
Time spent in classes per week = 80 minutes * 5 days = 400 minutes

Now, let's calculate the time spent on Saturday and Sunday. John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on these days. 

First, we need to find the total minutes in a week. There are 24 hours in a day, and 7 days in a week, so there are 24 * 7 = 168 hours in a week. 

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, there are 168 * 60 = 10080 minutes in a week.

Now, we can find the time spent on Saturday and Sunday. 

Time spent on Saturday and Sunday = 1/16 * 10080 minutes = 630 minutes

Now, we can find the total time spent learning per week by adding the time spent in classes and the time spent on Saturday and Sunday.

Total time spent learning per week = 400 minutes + 630 minutes = 1030 minutes

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

Total time spent learning per week = 1030 minutes / 60 = 17.17 hours

"To find the height of the ball on its second bounce, we need to calculate the height of the ball after the first bounce and then multiply it by 2/3.

The initial height of the ball is the height of the third floor, which is 24 feet.

On the first bounce, the ball reaches 2/3 of its initial height, so the height after the first bounce is:
24 * (2/3) = 16 feet

On the second bounce, the ball reaches 2/3 of the height it had after the first bounce, so the height after the second bounce is:
16 * (2/3) = 10.67 feet

The final answer is: 10.67"
"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the height of each child in inches. 

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the first child is 6 * 12 = 72 inches tall.

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

The final answer is: 72"
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to determine the number of bags sold and then multiply that by the price per bag.

Since the orchard sold a total of 2000 apples and each bag contains 10 apples, we can divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag to find the number of bags sold:

2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags

Now, we can multiply the number of bags sold by the price per bag to find the total earnings:

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The final answer is: $1000"
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the amount of meat left after the Allosaurus ate. 

Let's start with the amount of meat left after the Allosaurus ate: 270 kilograms. 

Since the Allosaurus ate the last of the meat, the amount of meat left after the velociraptors scavenged was twice the amount left after the Allosaurus ate, because the velociraptors ate half of what was left. 

So, the amount of meat left after the velociraptors scavenged = 2 * 270 = 540 kilograms.

Since the velociraptors ate half of what was left, the amount of meat left after the T-Rex ate was twice the amount left after the velociraptors scavenged.

So, the amount of meat left after the T-Rex ate = 2 * 540 = 1080 kilograms.

Since the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, the total amount of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate was twice the amount left after the T-Rex ate.

So, the total amount of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate = 2 * 1080 = 2160 kilograms.

The final answer is: 2160"
"To determine the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total surface area of the walls that need to be painted. 

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 10 * 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two walls, their total area is 2 * 80 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 5 * 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two walls, their total area is 2 * 40 = 80 square feet.

The total surface area of the walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, the total number of gallons needed is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

Each gallon costs $12, so the total cost of painting the room is 12 * 12 = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to calculate the probability of two events: 

1. The shaken can is selected, and 
2. The shaken can is opened.

First, let's calculate the probability of selecting a shaken can. There are 9 unshaken sodas and 3 shaken sodas, making a total of 12 sodas. The probability of selecting a shaken can is 3/12, which simplifies to 1/4 or 0.25.

Now, let's calculate the probability of opening the shaken can. Since Ellen's brother took 1 shaken can and 2 unshaken cans, there are 2 shaken cans left. The probability of selecting a shaken can is 2/9.

However, the probability of opening the shaken can is not just the probability of selecting it, but also the probability of it being the one that is opened. Since there are 2 shaken cans left, the probability of opening a specific shaken can is 1/2.

The probability of both events happening is the product of their individual probabilities: (1/4) * (1/2) = 1/8 or 0.125.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.125 * 100 = 12.5%.

The final answer is: 12.5"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each train travels in 3 hours and then add those distances together.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will travel 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will travel 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, we need to add their distances together to find the total distance between them. So, the total distance is 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

The final answer is: 270"
"To find the total number of people Billy can help, we first need to determine the number of days he works. 

March has 31 days, and April has 19 days (since April 19th is the last day). So, the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th is 31 + 19 = 50 days.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, we need to find 20% of 50 days. To do this, we multiply 50 by 0.20 (which is 20% expressed as a decimal).

20% of 50 days = 0.20 * 50 = 10 days

Now, we subtract the number of days off from the total number of days to find the number of days Billy works.

50 days - 10 days = 40 days

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so we need to find the total number of hours he works in a day. 

3 hours/day

Since he works 40 days, we multiply the number of hours he works per day by the number of days he works.

3 hours/day * 40 days = 120 hours

Now, we multiply the total number of hours by the number of people he can help per hour.

120 hours * 2 people/hour = 240 people

"To find the total number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people who were transported by the buses and the cars, and then subtract that from the total number of people who attended the wedding.

First, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the buses: 
12 buses * 35 people/bus = 420 people

Next, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the cars: 
20 cars * 3 people/car = 60 people

Now, let's add the number of people transported by the buses and the cars to get the total number of people outside the church: 
420 people + 60 people = 480 people

Since the total number of people outside the church is 480, and there were 480 people outside the church, the number of people inside the church is 0.

"To find Jeff's age, we need to determine Martha's age first. Since Mike is 24 years old and Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, we can calculate Martha's age by subtracting 4 from Mike's age.

Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
Martha's age = 24 - 4
Martha's age = 20

Now that we know Martha's age, we can find Jeff's age since he is 10 years older than Martha.

Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
Jeff's age = 20 + 10
Jeff's age = 30

For the biggest slide: time = length / speed = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide: time = length / speed = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

To find the difference in time, we subtract the time it takes to ride the second biggest slide from the time it takes to ride the biggest slide: 
time difference = 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks, we need to calculate the total time spent per day and then multiply it by 5.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 x 15-minute breaks per day. 
Total time spent per day = 30 minutes (lunch) + 2 x 15 minutes (breaks) = 30 + 30 = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60. 
60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Bobby spends 1 hour per day on lunch and breaks. 
Total time spent in 5 days = 1 hour/day x 5 days = 5 hours

The total time spent on lunch and breaks after 5 days is 5 hours."
"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we first need to determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate Micah's distance as 3.5 * 8 = 28 miles.

Now, we know that the total distance run by all three is 52 miles, and Amber and Micah ran a combined 8 + 28 = 36 miles. To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we subtract the combined distance of Amber and Micah from the total distance: 52 - 36 = 16 miles.

Ahito ran 16 miles."
"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total amount she spent after returning the item and then add that to the initial charge minus the returned item.

1. Initial charge: $85.00
2. Return: -$15.00 (since she returned an item)
   New balance after return: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

3. Frying pan purchase: 20% off $20.00
   Discount: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
   Price of frying pan: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

4. Towel purchase: 10% off $30.00
   Discount: 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
   Price of towels: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

5. Total new purchases: $16.00 (frying pan) + $27.00 (towels) = $43.00

6. New balance on credit card: $70.00 (previous balance) + $43.00 (new purchases) = $113.00

The final answer is: $113.00"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. 

A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is x/5. 

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (x/5) * (1/3) = x/15.

The problem states that 6 jellyfish changed color, so we can set up the equation x/15 = 6.

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 15, which gives us x = 6 * 15 = 90.

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

The final answer is: 90"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the age of Ben first, and then use that information to find Caroline's age.

Since Chris is 4 years old, and Ben is two times older than Chris, we can calculate Ben's age as follows:

Ben's age = 2 * Chris's age
Ben's age = 2 * 4
Ben's age = 8

Now that we know Ben's age, we can find Caroline's age since Caroline is three times older than Ben:

Caroline's age = 3 * Ben's age
Caroline's age = 3 * 8
Caroline's age = 24

The final answer is: 24"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate Lauren's total savings needed for retirement and then determine how many years she needs to work to achieve this goal.

First, let's calculate Lauren's annual expenses in retirement. Since she plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary, her annual expenses will be 0.4 x $100,000 = $40,000.

Next, we need to calculate the total amount Lauren needs to save for retirement. Assuming she will live for 20 years in retirement, we can use the following formula:

Total savings = Annual expenses x Number of years in retirement
Total savings = $40,000 x 20
Total savings = $800,000

Since Lauren saves 20% of her salary, we need to calculate her annual savings. Her annual salary is $100,000, so her annual savings will be:

Annual savings = 0.2 x $100,000
Annual savings = $20,000

Now, we can calculate the number of years Lauren needs to work to save $800,000:

Number of years = Total savings / Annual savings
Number of years = $800,000 / $20,000
Number of years = 40

However, this is the number of years she needs to work to save the total amount, but we need to consider that she will be saving for 20 years in retirement. Therefore, we need to subtract 20 from the total number of years to get the number of years she needs to work:

Number of years = 40 - 20
Number of years = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the length of each of the 4 equal parts that Marty will get after cutting the ribbon. 

Since Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon and he needs to cut it into 4 equal parts, we divide 100 by 4 to get the length of each part. 

100 / 4 = 25 centimeters

Now, each of these 4 parts needs to be divided into 5 equal parts. To find the length of each of these smaller parts, we divide 25 by 5.

25 / 5 = 5 centimeters

So, each final cut will be 5 centimeters long.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total number of students in the school, we can use the information given about the boys. Since 40% of the school population is 240 boys, we can set up the equation:

0.4x = 240

where x is the total number of students in the school.

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.4:

x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

Now that we know the total number of students in the school is 600, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total:

Number of girls = Total number of students - Number of boys
= 600 - 240
= 360

The final answer is: 360"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items before applying the coupon. 

The cost of the set of pots is $19, and the cost of the sack of garden soil is $26. 

Total cost before coupon = cost of pots + cost of soil = $19 + $26 = $45

Now, we apply the coupon for $7 off. 

Total cost after coupon = Total cost before coupon - coupon amount = $45 - $7 = $38

So, the final amount spent at the gardening shop is $38.

The final answer is: $38"
"To find the average height of heels at the party, we need to calculate the total height of all heels and then divide by the total number of women.

The total number of women is 6 (3 wearing 4-inch heels and 3 wearing 2-inch heels).

The total height of heels for the women wearing 4-inch heels is 3 * 4 = 12 inches.
The total height of heels for the women wearing 2-inch heels is 3 * 2 = 6 inches.

The total height of all heels is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.

The average height of heels is the total height of all heels divided by the total number of women: 18 / 6 = 3 inches.

The final answer is: 3"
"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike, we first need to calculate the total number of days she has for her vacation. Since she is on vacation for the entire month of June, which has 30 days, she has 30 days to complete her 9,300-mile journey.

If she hikes twice a day, covering 125 miles each time, her daily total is 2 * 125 = 250 miles per day.

To find out how many days it will take her to complete her journey at this rate, we divide the total miles by the daily miles: 9,300 / 250 = 37.2 days.

Since she only has 30 days, she will not be able to complete her journey on time. To find out how many more days she needs, we subtract the available days from the required days: 37.2 - 30 = 7.2 days.

However, the question asks for the number of miles per day she must hike to complete her journey on time. To find this, we need to divide the remaining miles by the remaining days: 9,300 - (30 * 250) = 9,300 - 7,500 = 1,800 miles. 

1,800 miles / 7.2 days = 250 miles per day.

The final answer is: 250"
"To find the total amount the store will receive after selling all the balls, we need to calculate the total revenue from each color of ball and add them together.

The store has 3 red balls, each costing $9, so the total revenue from red balls is 3 x $9 = $27.

The store has 11 blue balls, each costing $5, so the total revenue from blue balls is 11 x $5 = $55.

The store has 25 green balls, each costing $3, so the total revenue from green balls is 25 x $3 = $75.

Now, we add the revenue from each color of ball together: $27 + $55 + $75 = $157.

The final answer is: $157"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much each person wants. 

Peter wants a quarter of 12 kg, which is 12 * 0.25 = 3 kg. 

Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg, which is 12 * (1/3) = 4 kg.

Since the problem mentions Pierre, Paul, and Jacques, but the question asks about James, it seems there might be a mistake in the names. However, assuming Jacques is the person left, we can proceed with the calculation.

Jacques will have the remaining amount after Peter and Paul take their portions. 

First, let's find the total amount taken by Peter and Paul: 3 kg + 4 kg = 7 kg.

Now, subtract this from the total amount of apples: 12 kg - 7 kg = 5 kg.

So, Jacques will have 5 kg of apples left.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the temperature in the morning, we need to subtract the temperature drop from the initial temperature and then add the temperature increase.

Initial temperature = 2 degrees Celsius

"To find out how much money Raymond has left, we need to subtract the amount he spent from the initial amount he had, and then add the amount he saved.

Raymond initially had $21. He saved $11, so we add that to his initial amount: $21 + $11 = $32.

Then, he spent $5 on a comic book and $19 on a puzzle, so we subtract the total amount he spent from the new total: $32 - ($5 + $19) = $32 - $24 = $8.

Therefore, Raymond has $8 left.

The final answer is: $8"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much money Anna spent on the books. We know that she had a budget of $16 and had $2 left, so she spent $16 - $2 = $14 on the books.

Since Anna bought 2 books and they cost the same amount of money, we can set up an equation to represent the situation. Let x be the cost of each book. The total cost of the books is 2x, and we know that this is equal to $14.

2x = 14

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 14 / 2
x = 7

So each book cost $7. 

The final answer is: $7"

To find the total number of students this year, we add the increase to the previous year's enrollment: 50 + 10 = 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the rate at which the light blinks. We can do this by dividing the total number of blinks by the total time taken.

The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. 

First, let's find the rate of blinking per minute: 
Rate = Total blinks / Total time
Rate = 255 blinks / 5 minutes
Rate = 51 blinks per minute

Now, we need to find the time it will take for the light to blink 459 times:
Time = Total blinks / Rate
Time = 459 blinks / 51 blinks per minute
Time = 9 minutes

"To find the total number of male and female fishes, we need to calculate the initial number and the number after Tate's purchase.

Initial number of male guppies: 4
Initial number of male goldfishes: 3
Initial number of male fishes: 4 + 3 = 7

Initial number of female guppies: 7
Initial number of female goldfishes: 5
Initial number of female fishes: 7 + 5 = 12

Tate buys 2 male guppies, 1 female guppy, 2 male goldfishes, and 3 female goldfishes.

New number of male guppies: 4 + 2 = 6
New number of male goldfishes: 3 + 2 = 5
New number of male fishes: 6 + 5 = 11

New number of female guppies: 7 + 1 = 8
New number of female goldfishes: 5 + 3 = 8
New number of female fishes: 8 + 8 = 16

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of female fishes and male fishes.

Difference = New number of female fishes - New number of male fishes
Difference = 16 - 11
Difference = 5

"To find the total time they all took to do their chores, we need to calculate the time each person took and add them together.

Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia, so Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours to walk the dog.

Dior took 4 hours longer than Amalia, but since Amalia took 4 hours, Dior took 4 + 4 = 8 hours to do laundry.

Now, let's add the time each person took to do their chores: 4 (Amalia) + 6 (Megan) + 8 (Dior) = 18 hours.

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 18 hours."
"To find the total distance John drives in a round trip, we need to calculate the distance of a single trip and then multiply it by 2.

Distance = Speed * Time
Time = 2 hours (given)
Speed = 70 mph (given)

Distance = 70 mph * 2 hours = 140 miles (for a single trip)

Since John visits his parents twice a month, we need to multiply the distance of a single trip by 2.

Total distance = 140 miles * 2 = 280 miles

The total distance John drives in a month is 280 miles."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how far Sofie will walk in 7 days. Since Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, we can multiply the number of miles she walks per day by the number of days:

10 miles/day * 7 days = 70 miles

Since Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship:

Sofie's distance = 2 * Brian's distance

We know that Sofie's distance is 70 miles, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

70 miles = 2 * Brian's distance

To find Brian's distance, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

Brian's distance = 70 miles / 2
Brian's distance = 35 miles

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

The final answer is: 35"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers and then find out how many toys the fifth worker needs to produce to meet the remaining demand.

First, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the 2 workers who produce 6 toys an hour:

2 workers * 6 toys/hour * 10 hours = 120 toys

Next, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour:

2 workers * 4 toys/hour * 10 hours = 80 toys

Now, let's add the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers:

120 toys + 80 toys = 200 toys

The manufacturer still needs 20 toys to meet the order, so the total number of toys needed is 400. Since the first 4 workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker needs to produce the remaining 200 - 20 = 180 toys.

Now, let's calculate the number of toys the fifth worker produces per hour:

180 toys / 10 hours = 18 toys/hour

The fifth worker produces 18 toys per hour.

"To find the total weight of Elijah's dogs, we first need to find the weight of each of his dogs. 

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so we multiply 60 by 1/4 to find the weight of Elijah's first dog: 60 * 1/4 = 15 pounds.

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so we multiply 60 by 1/2 to find the weight of Elijah's second dog: 60 * 1/2 = 30 pounds.

Now, we add the weights of Elijah's two dogs to find the total weight of his dogs: 15 + 30 = 45 pounds.

To find the total weight of all three dogs, we add the weight of Kory's dog to the total weight of Elijah's dogs: 60 + 45 = 105 pounds.

"To solve this problem, let's work backwards from the information given.

Kris had 7 stickers left after giving some to Rob. Kris had 9 stickers and gave 7 to Rob, so Kris had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers before giving any to Rob.

Luis gave the rest of the stickers to Kris, and Kris had 16 stickers. This means Luis had 16 + 7 = 23 stickers before giving any to Kris.

Luis had half of the stickers that Seth gave him. So, Seth gave Luis 2 * 23 = 46 stickers.

Therefore, Seth had 46 stickers in the beginning.

"To find the total number of M&M's John has, we need to calculate the total weight of the M&M's and then multiply it by the number of M&M's per ounce. 

First, let's find the total weight of the M&M's: 3 large bags * 10 ounces per bag = 30 ounces.

Since an ounce of M&M's has 30 M&M's, the total number of M&M's is: 30 ounces * 30 M&M's per ounce = 900 M&M's.

Now, we need to find out how many small bags John can make. Each small bag contains 10 M&M's, so we divide the total number of M&M's by 10: 900 M&M's / 10 M&M's per small bag = 90 small bags.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the speed of the 2nd fastest car first, and then use that to find the speed of the fastest car.

Given that the average car can go 120 miles per hour, and the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, we can calculate the speed of the 2nd fastest car as follows:

Speed of 2nd fastest car = 5 * Speed of average car
= 5 * 120
= 600 miles per hour

Now, we know that the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. We can calculate the speed of the fastest car as follows:

Speed of fastest car = 1.25 * Speed of 2nd fastest car
= 1.25 * 600

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine Liam's age two years ago and then use that information to find Vince's current age.

Liam is 16 years old now. Two years ago, Liam's age would be 16 - 2 = 14 years old.

Two years ago, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince. This means that Vince's age two years ago was 14 / 2 = 7 years old.

To find Vince's current age, we need to add 2 years to his age two years ago. Vince's current age is 7 + 2 = 9 years old.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold as A, Madeline as M, Camden as C, and Sarah as S.

We know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so A = M.

We also know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. This can be expressed as C + S = 30 and C = S + 12.

We can rewrite the second equation as C = S + 12 and substitute it into the first equation: (S + 12) + S = 30.

Combine like terms: 2S + 12 = 30.

Subtract 12 from both sides: 2S = 18.

Divide both sides by 2: S = 9.

Now that we know S, we can find C by substituting S into the equation C = S + 12: C = 9 + 12 = 21.

Since A = M, and the total number of eggs is 56, we can write the equation A + M + C + S = 56.

Substitute the values of A, M, C, and S: A + A + 21 + 9 = 56.

Combine like terms: 2A + 30 = 56.

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2A = 26.

Divide both sides by 2: A = 13.

Now that we know A and C, we can find the difference between the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold: C - A = 21 - 13 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we first need to determine the total number of boxes and the total weight of the crayons and boxes.

Since Nik wants to put the crayons into groups of 8, we can divide the total number of crayons by 8 to find the number of boxes: 200 / 8 = 25 boxes.

Each box weighs 8 ounces, and there are 25 boxes, so the total weight of the boxes is 8 * 25 = 200 ounces.

Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, and there are 200 crayons, so the total weight of the crayons is 1 * 200 = 200 ounces.

The total weight of the crayons and boxes is the sum of their individual weights: 200 ounces (boxes) + 200 ounces (crayons) = 400 ounces.

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we can convert the total weight from ounces to pounds by dividing by 16: 400 / 16 = 25 pounds.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how much John makes, we need to calculate the total number of planks he can make and then multiply it by the price of each plank.

First, let's find out how many logs John can make from the tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, and the tree is 80 feet long, we need to find 80% of 80.

80% of 80 = 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet

Since each log is 4 feet long, we can divide the total length of the logs by the length of each log to find the number of logs.

Number of logs = 64 / 4 = 16 logs

From each log, John cuts 5 planks. So, the total number of planks he can make is:

Total planks = 16 logs * 5 planks/log = 80 planks

Now, we can find the total amount of money John makes by multiplying the number of planks by the price of each plank.

Total money = 80 planks * $1.2/plank = $96

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much Valerie's brother earns. Since Valerie earns half of what her brother earns, we can represent her brother's salary as 2 times Valerie's salary. 

Let's denote Valerie's salary as V and her brother's salary as B. We know that V = 0.5B. 

We are given that Valerie earns $5000 per month, so V = $5000. We can now find B by multiplying V by 2, which gives us B = 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

Now, we know that their mother earns twice their combined salary. Let's denote their combined salary as C. We can represent their mother's salary as 2C. We know that C = V + B, so C = $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000. 

Their mother's salary is 2C, which is 2 * $15,000 = $30,000.

To find the total amount of money they all have together, we add up their salaries: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine Grandma's speed on the beach and on the sidewalk. 

Let's denote Grandma's speed on the beach as x miles per minute. Since she walks at twice the rate on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.

We know that she walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. The time spent on the beach is given as 40 minutes. We can use the formula: time = distance / speed to find her speed on the beach.

Time spent on the beach = 2 miles / x miles per minute = 40 minutes

To find x, we can rearrange the equation: x = 2 miles / 40 minutes = 0.05 miles per minute.

Now that we know her speed on the beach, we can find her speed on the sidewalk: 2x = 2 * 0.05 = 0.1 miles per minute.

Now, we can find the time spent on the sidewalk: time = 1 mile / 0.1 miles per minute = 10 minutes.

The total time spent walking is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk: 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total amount Jane has saved so far. Since she has saved $4 every week for 8 weeks, we can multiply the amount saved per week by the number of weeks:

$4/week * 8 weeks = $32

Now, we need to find out how much more she needs to save to reach a total of $60. We subtract the amount she has already saved from the target amount:

$60 - $32 = $28

Since she saves $4 every week, we can divide the remaining amount by the amount she saves per week to find out how many more weeks it will take:

$28 / $4/week = 7 weeks

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to have saved a total of $60.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many marbles Bob initially has. We know that if he receives 2 dozen (24) more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. 

Let's denote the initial number of marbles Bob has as 'x'. Then, the equation can be written as:

x + 24 = 60

To find 'x', we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 24 from both sides:

x = 60 - 24
x = 36

So, Bob initially has 36 marbles. 

Now, if he loses 10 marbles, we need to subtract 10 from the initial number of marbles:

36 - 10 = 26

Therefore, Bob will have 26 marbles.

The final answer is: 26"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of thermal energy transfer and the specific heat capacity of water. The specific heat capacity of water is approximately 1 calorie per gram per degree Celsius (or 1 calorie per gram per degree Fahrenheit, depending on the units used).

Let's assume the unknown temperature of the second mug is x degrees. When Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle, the temperature of the water in the bottle will be 33 degrees. 

When he pours 1 ounce of water from the second mug into the bottle, the total volume of water in the bottle will be 5 ounces. Since the specific heat capacity of water is constant, the temperature of the water in the bottle will be a weighted average of the temperatures of the two mugs.

Let's use the formula for weighted average:

T_avg = (V1 * T1 + V2 * T2) / (V1 + V2)

where T_avg is the average temperature, V1 and V2 are the volumes of the two mugs, and T1 and T2 are the temperatures of the two mugs.

We know that the average temperature of the water in the bottle is at least 40 degrees, so we can set up the equation:

(33 * 4 + x * 1) / (4 + 1) ≥ 40

Simplifying the equation, we get:

132 + x ≥ 160

Subtracting 132 from both sides, we get:

x ≥ 28

Therefore, the temperature of the second mug must be at least 28 degrees."
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of cows:

Initial number of cows = 50
Cows brought by Milkie Cows Limited per day = 20
Number of days in three weeks = 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days
Total cows brought by Milkie Cows Limited = 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
Total number of cows = Initial number of cows + Total cows brought by Milkie Cows Limited
Total number of cows = 50 + 420
Total number of cows = 470

Next, let's calculate the number of chickens:

Initial number of chickens = 20
Chickens brought by Broilers Limited per day = 10
Total chickens brought by Broilers Limited = 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens
Total number of chickens = Initial number of chickens + Total chickens brought by Broilers Limited
Total number of chickens = 20 + 210
Total number of chickens = 230

Now, let's add the total number of cows and chickens to find the total number of animals on the farm:

Total number of animals = Total number of cows + Total number of chickens
Total number of animals = 470 + 230
Total number of animals = 700

The final answer is: 700"
"To find the cost of each single bagel, we first need to calculate the total cost of the 4 packs of bagels with the discount, and then divide that by the total number of bagels.

The cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00.

Since Russell receives a 10% discount, the discount amount is 10% of $40.00, which is 0.1 * $40.00 = $4.00.

The total cost after the discount is $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Each pack has 9 bagels, so 4 packs have 4 * 9 = 36 bagels.

The cost of each single bagel is $36.00 / 36 = $1.00.

The final answer is: $1.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. We know that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops, so we can write this as:

Gomer's scoops = 23 - 5
Gomer's scoops = 18

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes it takes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. We know that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops, so we can write this as:

Potatoes per scoop = 6 - 3
Potatoes per scoop = 3

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes it takes to make 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. We can multiply the number of scoops by the number of potatoes per scoop:

Total potatoes = Gomer's scoops * Potatoes per scoop
Total potatoes = 18 * 3
Total potatoes = 54

Therefore, Gomer ate 54 potatoes.

The final answer is: 54"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days, and then add them together.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days is 3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs.

In the next 30 days, Chester increases his egg consumption to 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in the next 30 days is 5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs.

Now, we add the total number of eggs from both periods: 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens: 240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozen eggs.

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of red jellybeans. We know that there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans, and there are 17 green jellybeans. 

Let's denote the number of red jellybeans as R and the number of green jellybeans as G. We know that R = 2G. Since we know G = 17, we can substitute this value into the equation to find R.

R = 2G
R = 2(17)
R = 34

Now that we know there are 34 red jellybeans, we can find the total number of non-blue jellybeans by adding the number of green and red jellybeans.

Total non-blue jellybeans = G + R
Total non-blue jellybeans = 17 + 34
Total non-blue jellybeans = 51

Since there are a total of 60 jellybeans, we can find the number of blue jellybeans by subtracting the total number of non-blue jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans.

Number of blue jellybeans = Total jellybeans - Total non-blue jellybeans
Number of blue jellybeans = 60 - 51
Number of blue jellybeans = 9

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade, we need to calculate the total number of lemons he collects in one year and then multiply it by 10.

First, let's find the total number of lemons he collects in one year: 
5 trees * 6 lemons/tree = 30 lemons/year

Now, let's multiply this by 10 to find the total number of lemons in a decade:
30 lemons/year * 10 years = 300 lemons

The final answer is: 300"
"To solve this problem, we first need to find the total number of men and women on the bus. 

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, we can let the number of men be 5x and the number of women be 9x. 

Since the total number of passengers is 84, we can set up the equation: 5x + 9x = 84.

Combine like terms: 14x = 84.

Divide both sides by 14: x = 6.

Now that we know x, we can find the number of women on the bus: 9x = 9 * 6 = 54.

After 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining is: 54 - 20 = 34.

The final answer is: 34"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold per day. We know that he earned $26 from the sunflowers and $56 from the bouquets per day. Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the total number of sunflowers in a bouquet is 12.

Let's denote the number of sunflowers sold per day as 'x'. Then, the number of bouquets sold per day is 56/8 = 7 (since each bouquet costs $8).

The total number of sunflowers sold per day is the sum of the sunflowers sold individually and the sunflowers in the bouquets: x + 7*12 = x + 84.

We also know that the total earnings from sunflowers per day is $26. Since each sunflower costs $2, the number of sunflowers sold per day is 26/2 = 13.

Now we can equate the two expressions for the total number of sunflowers sold per day: x + 84 = 13.

Solving for x, we get x = 13 - 84 = -71. However, this is not possible since we can't sell a negative number of sunflowers. This means our initial assumption that the number of bouquets sold per day is 56/8 is incorrect.

Let's re-evaluate the number of bouquets sold per day. We know that the total earnings from bouquets per day is $56, and each bouquet costs $8. So, the number of bouquets sold per day is 56/8 = 7.

However, we also know that the total earnings from sunflowers per day is $26, and each sunflower costs $2. So, the number of sunflowers sold per day is 26/2 = 13.

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the total number of sunflowers sold per day is 13 + 7*12 = 13 + 84 = 97.

Now, we need to find the total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days. The total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days is 97 * 3 = 291.

The final answer is: 291"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the inventory, the total revenue from selling 60% of the inventory, and then find the difference between the revenue and the cost.

First, let's find out how many rocks Adam can buy with $100. Since each rock costs $5, we divide the total amount by the cost per rock:

100 / 5 = 20 rocks

Now, Adam sells 60% of his inventory, which is 60% of 20 rocks:

60% of 20 = 0.6 * 20 = 12 rocks

The revenue from selling 12 rocks at $7 each is:

12 * 7 = $84

The cost of the inventory is the cost of 20 rocks:

20 * 5 = $100

Since Adam only sells 60% of his inventory, he still has 40% of the rocks left, which he hasn't sold. The cost of these unsold rocks is:

40% of 20 = 0.4 * 20 = 8 rocks
8 * 5 = $40

The total cost of the inventory is the cost of the sold rocks plus the cost of the unsold rocks:

$100 (cost of 20 rocks) - $40 (cost of 8 unsold rocks) = $60 (cost of 12 sold rocks)

Now, let's find the loss:

Loss = Total cost - Total revenue
Loss = $100 (initial investment) - $84 (revenue from selling 12 rocks)
Loss = $16

The final answer is: $16"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of days it takes Lauren to complete each type of picture scene. 

First, let's find the number of days it takes Lauren to complete each type of picture scene:

- Large-sized picture scenes: 45 / 5 = 9 days
- Medium-sized picture scenes: 36 / 6 = 6 days
- Small-sized picture scenes: 49 / 7 = 7 days

Now, we need to find the LCM of 9, 6, and 7. 

The prime factorization of 6 is 2 * 3.
The prime factorization of 7 is 7.
The prime factorization of 9 is 3^2.

To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the numbers:
- The highest power of 2 is 2^1 (from 6).
- The highest power of 3 is 3^2 (from 9).
- The highest power of 7 is 7^1 (from 7).

The LCM is 2^1 * 3^2 * 7^1 = 2 * 9 * 7 = 126.

Therefore, it will take Lauren 126 days to complete all the picture scenes.

"To find out how many eggs each child receives, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of children. 

First, let's determine the total number of eggs. Since Chatty prepared three dozen eggs, we need to convert this to a numerical value. One dozen is equal to 12, so three dozen is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Now, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of children: 36 eggs / 4 children = 9 eggs per child.

"To determine how much Jen spends on food for her fish in May, we need to calculate the total cost of food for one month. 

First, we need to find out how many days are in May. May has 31 days. 

Since each fish needs $1 worth of food per day, and Jen has 3 fish, the daily cost of food for all her fish is 3 * $1 = $3.

To find the total cost for the month of May, we multiply the daily cost by the number of days in May: $3 * 31 = $93.

The final numerical answer is: $93"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations. First, Patricia gave away 24 roses, so we subtract 24 from the initial number of roses she had, which is 30. 

30 - 24 = 6

Then, she bought 15 more roses. To find the total number of roses she has now, we add the number of roses she bought to the number of roses she had after giving some away.

6 + 15 = 21

So, Patricia now has 21 roses.

"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken. 

The total distance traveled is 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles.

The total time taken is 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours.

The average speed is calculated by dividing the total distance by the total time: average speed = total distance / total time = 250 miles / 5 hours = 50 miles per hour.

"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning. 

The probability of the first ticket winning is 20% or 0.2. 
The probability of the second ticket winning is three times more likely, so it's 3 * 0.2 = 0.6.

To find the probability of both tickets winning, we multiply these probabilities: 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

The final answer is: 12"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of seashells each person collected. 

Let's denote the number of seashells Carrey collected as 'x'. Since Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, the number of seashells Carlos collected is 2x. 

We are given that Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, so the number of seashells Jim collected is 2x + 5.

We know that the total number of seashells collected by all three is the sum of the seashells collected by each person: x + 2x + (2x + 5) = 5x + 5.

Since they divided the seashells equally among themselves, the total number of seashells (5x + 5) is divided by 3. 

So, (5x + 5) / 3 = (5/3)x + 5/3.

However, we need to find the value of x first. We know that Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 2x + 5. 

2x + 5 = 27
2x = 22
x = 11

Now that we know x, we can find the number of seashells each person collected: 
- Carrey collected x = 11 seashells
- Carlos collected 2x = 22 seashells
- Jim collected 2x + 5 = 27 seashells

To find out how many seashells each person got after dividing them equally, we divide the total number of seashells by 3: (11 + 22 + 27) / 3 = 60 / 3 = 20.

"To find the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the number of carrots he eats on weekdays and add the number of carrots he eats on the weekend.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday). So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is 4 * 5 = 20.

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is 5 + 5 = 10.

Now, we add the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend to find the total number of carrots he eats in a week: 20 + 10 = 30.

"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song first. 

The second song is 60% longer than the first song, which is 5 minutes. To find 60% of 5 minutes, we multiply 5 by 0.6 (which is the decimal form of 60%). 

5 * 0.6 = 3 minutes

So, the second song is 3 minutes longer than the first song. To find the total length of the second song, we add 3 minutes to the length of the first song.

5 + 3 = 8 minutes

Now, we have the lengths of both songs: the first song is 5 minutes and the second song is 8 minutes. To find the total time of the cassette, we add the lengths of both songs.

5 + 8 = 13 minutes

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes.

"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the profit from each day and then add them together.

On Monday, Linus bought 2 devices for $20 each. So, the total cost for Monday is 2 * $20 = $40. He sold each device for twice the original price, which is 2 * $20 = $40. So, the total revenue from Monday is 2 * $40 = $80. The profit from Monday is $80 - $40 = $40.

On Tuesday, Linus bought 4 devices for $20 each. So, the total cost for Tuesday is 4 * $20 = $80. He sold each device for twice the original price, which is 2 * $20 = $40. So, the total revenue from Tuesday is 4 * $40 = $160. The profit from Tuesday is $160 - $80 = $80.

The total profit is the sum of the profit from Monday and Tuesday, which is $40 + $80 = $120.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of bottles required to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, and then subtract the number of bottles Hortex can currently produce.

First, let's calculate the total number of bottles required to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people. Since each bottle covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand, we need to calculate the total number of bottles required to cover 100% of the energy needs of 2300 people.

100% of the energy needs of one person is equivalent to 1 / 0.20 = 5 bottles. 

To cover 100% of the energy needs of 2300 people, we need 5 * 2300 = 11500 bottles.

Since Hortex can currently produce 4200 bottles per day, we need to find out how many more bottles they need to produce to meet the demand of 11500 bottles.

The number of additional bottles Hortex needs to produce is 11500 - 4200 = 7300.

The final answer is: 7300"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that Carla has 8 identical octuplets. 

She dresses 3/4 of them in purple, which is (3/4) * 8 = 6 babies in purple.

She dresses 1/4 of them in blue, which is (1/4) * 8 = 2 babies in blue.

Now, we are told that all the blue-wearers and 1/3 of the purple wearers also wear bows. 

The number of blue-wearers wearing bows is 2 (since all of them wear bows).

The number of purple-wearers wearing bows is (1/3) * 6 = 2.

So, the total number of babies wearing bows is 2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4.

The number of babies wearing purple is 6, and the number of them wearing bows is 2.

To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to divide the number of purple babies wearing bows by the total number of babies wearing bows, and then multiply by 100.

Total reports received last week = 5168
Reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

First, let's find the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday. 

Reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

Now, let's find the total number of reports received on Wednesday by subtracting the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday. However, we need to subtract the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received last week to get the number of reports received on Wednesday.

Reports received on Wednesday = Total reports received last week - (Reports received on Monday and Tuesday + Reports received on Thursday and Friday)
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - (1907 + 2136)

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. Abraham starts with 80 square meters of land.
2. He sold half of the land for $50. Since half of 80 is 40, he sold 40 square meters for $50.
3. Now, he has 80 - 40 = 40 square meters left.
4. He then sold 1/4 of his remaining land for $30. Since 1/4 of 40 is 10, he sold 10 square meters for $30.
5. Now, he has 40 - 10 = 30 square meters left.
6. He sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, he sold 30 square meters for 30 * $3 = $90.
7. To find the total amount of money he earned, we need to add the money he earned from the first sale ($50), the second sale ($30), and the third sale ($90).

"To find the total amount John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of apartments and the total number of collections.

First, let's find the total number of apartments in the first two complexes: 200 + 200 = 400 apartments.

The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, so we need to find 60% of 400 and add it to 400. 

60% of 400 is 0.6 * 400 = 240. 
So, the last complex has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

The total number of apartments is 400 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so the total number of collections per week is 3 * 3 = 9 collections.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection for each apartment, so the total amount he makes per collection is 0.40 * 1040 = $416.

Since he makes 9 collections per week, the total amount he makes in a week is 416 * 9 = $3744.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

- A 5-year-old tree produces 50 fruits.
- A 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount, so it produces 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
- A 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount, so it produces 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
- An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. Since a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, a 10-year-old tree produces 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits. Therefore, an 8-year-old tree produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.
- A 9-year-old tree doesn't produce any fruits.
- A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which we already calculated as 1000 fruits.

Now, let's add up the total fruits produced by the tree over its 10 years of life: 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350.

1/5 * $100 = $20

Now, we add the amount Sophia gave to Jack to the initial amount Jack had.

$100 (initial amount) + $20 (amount given by Sophia) = $120

So, Jack now has $120.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the length of the blue rope as B, the length of the yellow rope as Y, and the length of the red rope as R.

We know that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so we can write an equation: R = 4B.

We also know that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so we can write another equation: B = Y - 7.

We are also given that the combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can write a third equation: R + B + Y = 37.

Now we can substitute the first equation into the third equation to get: 4B + B + Y = 37.

Combine like terms: 5B + Y = 37.

Now we can substitute the second equation into the equation above to get: 5B + (B - 7) = 37.

Combine like terms: 6B - 7 = 37.

Add 7 to both sides: 6B = 44.

Divide both sides by 6: B = 44/6 = 7.33.

Now that we know the length of the blue rope, we can find the length of the red rope by substituting B into the first equation: R = 4B = 4(7.33) = 29.32.

According to the problem, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her original money. This means that $15 - x = (4/5) * $15.

We can simplify this equation to find the value of x:
$15 - x = $12
x = $3

Now that we know x, we can find out how much money Ronnie is left with:
Ronnie's money left = $5 - x
= $5 - $3
= $2

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the amount of red, white, and purple paint as R, W, and P respectively. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, we can say R = W = P.

We are given that half the mural is yellow, which means the other half is made up of red, white, and purple paint combined. Since the total amount of paint used is 12 pints, and half of it is yellow, the other half is also 6 pints (12 / 2 = 6).

Since R = W = P, we can say that the total amount of red, white, and purple paint is 3R (since there are three equal amounts). This amount is equal to 6 pints (since it's half of the total paint used).

So, we can set up the equation: 3R = 6

To solve for R, we divide both sides by 3: R = 6 / 3 = 2

Therefore, the amount of red paint used is 2 pints.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom: 
Area of one bedroom = length * width = 20 * 12 = 240 square feet.

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms = 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area = 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is given as 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas together: 
Total area = area of bedrooms + area of living room + area of the rest of the house
Total area = 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.

The final answer is: 3160"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of clouds Alice sees each day and add them up.

On Monday, Alice sees 3 clouds.
On Tuesday, she sees double the number of clouds as Monday, which is 3 * 2 = 6 clouds.
On Wednesday, she sees double the number of clouds as Tuesday, which is 6 * 2 = 12 clouds.
On Thursday, she sees double the number of clouds as Wednesday, which is 12 * 2 = 24 clouds.
On Friday, she sees double the number of clouds as Thursday, which is 24 * 2 = 48 clouds.

Now, let's add up the number of clouds she sees each day:
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93

The final answer is: 93"
"To find the number of pods in the new box, we need to calculate 20% of 100 and add it to 100. 

20% of 100 = 0.2 * 100 = 20
Number of pods in the new box = 100 + 20 = 120

Since the price remains the same, we can calculate the number of cycles per dollar for the new box.

Number of cycles per dollar = Number of pods in the new box / Price of the box
= 120 / 12
= 10

Therefore, with the new box, you can run 10 dishwashing cycles for $1."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since he withdraws 1000 dollars in 20 dollar bills, he has 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home. So, he has 50 - 10 = 40 bills left.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he uses 20 bills to pay for the bill. This leaves him with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

4. Thomas then triples his money. Since he has 20 bills left, and each bill is worth $20, he has 20 * 20 = $400. Tripling this amount gives him 3 * 400 = $1200.

5. He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. To find out how many 5 dollar bills he has, we need to divide the total amount of money by 5. 1200 / 5 = 240.

The final answer is: 240"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals in the first half.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals.

Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B in the second half, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

Now, let's calculate the total number of goals scored in the match. In the first half, team A scored 4 goals and team B scored 2 goals. In the second half, team A scored 2 goals and team B scored 8 goals.

Total goals scored by team A = 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals
Total goals scored by team B = 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

Total goals scored in the match = 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much chalk the teacher has left after Monday and then determine how many days it will last.

The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk. He uses 45% of it on Monday, so we need to find 45% of 5 inches.

45% of 5 inches = 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches

This means the teacher has 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches of chalk left after Monday.

Now, we need to find out how many days the remaining 2.75 inches of chalk will last when the teacher uses 20% of it each day.

Let's assume the number of days the chalk will last is 'x'. Then, 20% of 2.75 inches will be used each day.

0.20 * 2.75 = 0.55 inches per day

Since the teacher starts with 2.75 inches, we can set up the equation:

2.75 = 0.55x

To solve for 'x', we divide both sides by 0.55:

x = 2.75 / 0.55
x = 5

"To find the number of students not on varsity, we first need to find the number of students on varsity. 

One-third of the girls are on varsity, so the number of girls on varsity is 12 * (1/3) = 4. 
One-fourth of the boys are on varsity, so the number of boys on varsity is 12 * (1/4) = 3.

The total number of students on varsity is 4 (girls) + 3 (boys) = 7.

Since there are 24 students in total (12 boys and 12 girls), the number of students not on varsity is 24 - 7 = 17.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many face masks Mike bought, and then calculate how many Johnny bought.

Mike bought 5 face masks. 

Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike. To find out how many face masks Johnny bought, we need to first calculate thrice the number of face masks Mike bought, and then add 2 to that number.

Thrice the number of face masks Mike bought is 3 * 5 = 15.

Adding 2 to that number gives us 15 + 2 = 17.

Therefore, Johnny bought 17 face masks.

"To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we first need to determine the total number of teeth the dentist works on. The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more teeth than he drills, so the number of teeth capped is 4 + 7 = 11. 

The total number of teeth the dentist works on is 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15. 

To find the percentage, we divide the number of teeth worked on by the total number of teeth and multiply by 100. 

(15 / 30) * 100 = 50%

"To find the amount of milk that was returned, we need to calculate 2/5 of the total amount of milk purchased. 

2/5 of 4000 gallons is (2/5) * 4000 = (2 * 4000) / 5 = 8000 / 5 = 1600 gallons.

Since the cost per gallon is $3.5, the total refund will be the cost per gallon multiplied by the number of gallons returned.

Refund = 1600 * $3.5 = $5600

The final answer is: $5600"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem.

Let's denote Colin's current age as C and Wendy's current age as W.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:

W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:

C + 25 = (5/3)(C + 7)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2:

20 = C

Colin is 20 years old now.

"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we first need to determine the total number of books he can buy with $27,000. 

Since he can buy 100 books for $500, we can find the total number of books he can buy by dividing $27,000 by $500.

$27,000 / $500 = 54 books

Now, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books he can buy per school.

54 books / 3 schools = 18 books per school

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, 2 apples fell out of the tree, and one landed on Newton's head. So, Newton had 2 apples.
2. Newton picked up the two apples, put one in his pocket, and threw the other apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. Now, he has 1 apple in his pocket and 5 new apples, making a total of 6 apples.
3. He put all but one of the new apples in his pocket, leaving 1 apple outside. So, he now has 6 (from the previous step) + 1 (in his pocket) = 7 apples in total.
4. He threw the remaining apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out. Now, he has 7 (from the previous step) + 6 (new apples) = 13 apples.
5. He picked up all the remaining apples, which is 13.

Therefore, Newton brought home 13 apples.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of slices each type of pizza that Kate's friends will eat, and then determine how many whole pizzas that represents.

First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten by Kate's friends: 6 friends * 6 slices per friend = 36 slices.

Since each pizza is cut into 12 slices, we need to divide the total number of slices eaten by the number of slices per pizza: 36 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas.

Next, let's calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten by Kate's friends: 6 friends * 4 slices per friend = 24 slices.

Since each pizza is cut into 8 slices, we need to divide the total number of slices eaten by the number of slices per pizza: 24 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas.

Since Kate's friends will eat 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas, Kate will need to buy a total of 3 + 3 = 6 pizzas."
"To find the total number of miles Sam ran this week, we need to calculate the total miles run on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and add it to the total miles run on Tuesday and Thursday.

Sam ran 3 miles on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Since there are 3 days, we multiply 3 miles by 3 to get the total miles run on these days: 3 * 3 = 9 miles.

Sam ran 5 miles on Tuesday and Thursday. Since there are 2 days, we multiply 5 miles by 2 to get the total miles run on these days: 5 * 2 = 10 miles.

Now, we add the total miles run on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday (9 miles) to the total miles run on Tuesday and Thursday (10 miles): 9 + 10 = 19 miles.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the net rate at which Jay is building snowballs. He builds 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 melt every 15 minutes. 

First, let's convert the melting rate to an hourly rate. Since there are 4 15-minute intervals in an hour, the melting rate is 2 * 4 = 8 snowballs per hour.

Now, let's find the net rate at which Jay is building snowballs. He builds 20 snowballs per hour, but 8 melt, so the net rate is 20 - 8 = 12 snowballs per hour.

To find the time it takes for Jay to have 60 snowballs, we can divide the target number of snowballs by the net rate: 60 / 12 = 5 hours.

However, this is the time it takes to build 60 snowballs, but it doesn't account for the initial 0 snowballs Jay has. Since he starts with 0 snowballs, he needs to build 60 snowballs, which takes 5 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how old Jim was 20 years ago, when Digimon was first released. Since John is 28 now, we can subtract 20 from his current age to find his age at that time.

John's age 20 years ago = 28 - 20 = 8

Since John was twice as old as Jim 20 years ago, we can set up an equation to find Jim's age at that time:

John's age 20 years ago = 2 * Jim's age 20 years ago
8 = 2 * Jim's age 20 years ago

To find Jim's age 20 years ago, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

Jim's age 20 years ago = 8 / 2
Jim's age 20 years ago = 4

Now, to find Jim's current age, we add 20 to his age 20 years ago:

Jim's current age = Jim's age 20 years ago + 20
Jim's current age = 4 + 20
Jim's current age = 24

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, the remaining bandages after the first day are x - 38 + 50 = x + 12.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. The remaining bandages after the second day are (x + 12) - 28 = x - 16.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages (2 * 50 = 100 bandages) and used half a pack (50 / 2 = 25 bandages). The remaining bandages after the third day are (x - 16) - 25 + 100 = x + 59.

We are given that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 59 = 78

To solve for x, we subtract 59 from both sides of the equation:

x = 78 - 59
x = 19

The initial number of bandages is 19.

"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to calculate her total hours worked and her attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her total hours worked in April. She works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week, for 4 weeks. 

Total hours worked per week = 7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week = 45 hours/week
Total hours worked in April = 45 hours/week * 4 weeks = 180 hours

Now, let's calculate her total earnings from her hourly rate. 

Total earnings from hourly rate = Total hours worked in April * Hourly rate

Next, let's calculate her attendance bonus. Since she had complete attendance for the month, she receives an additional $10 for each day she worked. 

Total days worked in April = 6 days/week * 4 weeks = 24 days
Attendance bonus = Total days worked in April * $10/day
= 24 days * $10/day

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find the cost of one bottle of scotch. Since John buys 10 bottles for $600, we can divide the total cost by the number of bottles to find the cost of one bottle:

Cost of one bottle of scotch = Total cost / Number of bottles
= $600 / 10
= $60

Now, let's find the cost of one bottle of cognac. It's given that the cognac costs 50% more than the scotch. To find the cost of one bottle of cognac, we need to calculate 50% of the cost of one bottle of scotch and add it to the cost of one bottle of scotch:

50% of $60 = 0.5 * $60 = $30
Cost of one bottle of cognac = Cost of one bottle of scotch + 50% of the cost of one bottle of scotch
= $60 + $30

Since John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, and he buys 10 bottles of scotch, he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

Now, let's find the total cost of the cognac:

Total cost of cognac = Number of bottles of cognac * Cost of one bottle of cognac
= 20 * $90
= $1800

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees. He also planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which means he planted 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, making the total White Oak trees planted 20 + 10 = 30. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than he planted on the first day. Since he planted 40 Lodgepole Pine trees on the first day, 1/4 of that is 40 * 1/4 = 10. So, he planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day.

Now, let's calculate the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days. The total number of White Oak trees is 20 + 30 = 50. The total number of Lodgepole Pine trees is 40 + 50 = 90.

In total, Amy had 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors.

Her sister stole one of the palettes, which means Amy lost 4 eyeshadow colors (since each palette has 4 colors).

Now, Amy has 26 - 4 = 22 eyeshadow colors left.

Amy then used up half of the colors from one makeup set. Since each makeup set has 6 eyeshadow colors, half of that is 6 / 2 = 3 eyeshadow colors.

So, Amy used up 3 eyeshadow colors from the makeup set.

Now, Amy has 22 - 3 = 19 eyeshadow colors left.

2. The two-story house is 7 times as high as Mattison, so the total height of the house is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.
3. The first floor's floor to ceiling height is three times Mattison's height, so it is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.
4. Since the total height of the house is 420 inches and the first floor's height is 180 inches, the height of the second floor is 420 - 180 = 240 inches.
5. To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to subtract the height of the second floor from the total height of the house. However, we need to consider that the height of the second floor is from the ground, and we want the height from the second floor's floor to the roof. Since the first floor's height is 180 inches, we need to subtract the height of the second floor from the total height of the house and then add the height of the first floor to get the correct height from the second floor's floor to the roof. However, this is not the case here. We simply need to subtract the height of the second floor from the total height of the house to get the height of the roof from the second floor's floor.

Now, we know that team Alphas found 280 shells. The remaining shells are 700 - 280 = 420 shells.

Team The finders found 60% of the remaining shells, which is 60% of 420.

60% of 420 = 0.6 * 420 = 252 shells.

Now, we know that team Alphas found 280 shells and team The finders found 252 shells. To find the number of shells found by team Gogetters, we subtract the total shells found by Alphas and The finders from the total number of shells.

Total shells found by Alphas and The finders = 280 + 252 = 532 shells.

Number of shells found by Gogetters = Total shells - Total shells found by Alphas and The finders
= 700 - 532
= 168 shells.

The final answer is: 168"
"To find the total amount of exercise needed for all four dogs, we can multiply the average exercise needed per dog by the total number of dogs. 

Average exercise per dog = 3 miles
Total number of dogs = 4

Total exercise needed = Average exercise per dog * Total number of dogs
Total exercise needed = 3 * 4
Total exercise needed = 12 miles

Now, we know the total exercise needed for all four dogs and the exercise needed for the first three dogs. 

First dog's exercise = 1 mile
Second dog's exercise = 4 miles
Third dog's exercise = 3 miles

Total exercise for the first three dogs = 1 + 4 + 3
Total exercise for the first three dogs = 8 miles

To find the exercise needed for the last dog, we subtract the total exercise for the first three dogs from the total exercise needed for all four dogs.

Exercise needed for the last dog = Total exercise needed - Total exercise for the first three dogs
Exercise needed for the last dog = 12 - 8
Exercise needed for the last dog = 4 miles

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. John's house is worth $250,000. He gets a loan worth 40% of that, which is 0.4 x $250,000 = $100,000.

2. He uses 60% of the loan to pay off his debts. 60% of $100,000 is 0.6 x $100,000 = $60,000.

3. Since he used $60,000 to pay off his debts, he has $100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000 leftover.

The final answer is: $40,000"
"To find the total amount Deandre will earn, we need to calculate the total weight of the tunas he caught and then multiply it by the cost per kilogram.

First, let's add up the weights of the three tunas:
56 kg + 46 kg + 26 kg = 128 kg

Now, let's multiply the total weight by the cost per kilogram:
128 kg * $0.50/kg = $64

So, Deandre will earn $64 after selling all the tunas to the market.

The final answer is: $64"
"To find Trinity's profit, we need to first find the selling price of the magazines. 

The cost price of the magazines is $72. Trinity sells the magazines at 11/8 of the cost price. 

To find the selling price, we multiply the cost price by 11/8: 
Selling price = (11/8) * 72
Selling price = (11 * 72) / 8
Selling price = 792 / 8
Selling price = 99

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the cost price from the selling price:
Profit = Selling price - Cost price
Profit = 99 - 72
Profit = 27

The final answer is: $27"
"To find the total amount of water removed, we need to calculate the amount of water removed by each setting and then add them together.

The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed by the low setting is 1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters.

The medium setting removes twice as much water as the low setting, which is 2 * 1 liter/day = 2 liters/day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed by the medium setting is 2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters.

The high setting removes twice as much water as the medium setting, which is 2 * 2 liters/day = 4 liters/day. Since Brian ran it for 5 days, the total amount of water removed by the high setting is 4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters.

Now, we add the total amount of water removed by each setting: 3 liters (low) + 6 liters (medium) + 20 liters (high) = 29 liters.

The final answer is: 29"
"To find out how many balloons were thrown, we need to first determine the total number of balloons Jolene and her friends had initially. Since they filled up 10 packs of balloons with 30 balloons per pack, the total number of balloons is 10 * 30 = 300.

Since 12 balloons were left by the end of the afternoon, we can subtract this from the total number of balloons to find out how many were thrown. 

300 - 12 = 288

So, Jolene and her friends threw 288 balloons."
"To find the total amount of the second medicine in one dose, we need to multiply 14 mL by 3. 

14 mL * 3 = 42 mL

Now, we know that the first medicine is 14 mL and the second medicine is 42 mL in one dose. To find the total amount of medicine in 8 doses, we need to multiply the amount of each medicine by 8.

For the first medicine: 14 mL * 8 = 112 mL
For the second medicine: 42 mL * 8 = 336 mL

The total amount of medicine in 8 doses is the sum of the two medicines: 112 mL + 336 mL = 448 mL.

The final answer is: 448"
"To find the combined capacity of both schools, we first need to determine the capacity of John's school. 

Since each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, and Ali's class has 120 students, we can find the capacity of one of John's classes by multiplying 120 by 1/8.

Capacity of one of John's classes = 120 * (1/8) = 15 students

Since John has two classes, we multiply the capacity of one class by 2 to find the total capacity of John's school.

Capacity of John's school = 15 * 2 = 30 students

Now, we add the capacity of Ali's school (which is 120 students) to the capacity of John's school to find the combined capacity of both schools.

Combined capacity = 120 + 30 = 150

The final answer is: 150"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total interest Stephen owes his sister. 

First, let's find the total interest he owes. The interest is 2% of $300, which is 0.02 * 300 = $6.

Since Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, the total amount he pays in the first 11 months is 25 * 11 = $275.

Now, we need to find the remaining amount, including the interest, that he will pay in the twelfth month. This is the total interest plus the initial amount borrowed, minus the amount he paid in the first 11 months. 

Total interest = $6
Initial amount borrowed = $300
Amount paid in 11 months = $275

Remaining amount = Total interest + Initial amount - Amount paid in 11 months
Remaining amount = 6 + 300 - 275
Remaining amount = $31

So, Stephen will pay $31 in the twelfth month.

The final answer is: $31"
"To find out how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we need to first determine the total number of diaper changes required for both children. Since each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, and there are 2 children, the total number of diaper changes is 2 * 5 = 10.

Since Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, we need to find out how many diapers she changes. Half of 10 is 5, so Jordan's wife changes 5 diapers per day.

To find out how many diapers Jordan changes, we subtract the number of diapers his wife changes from the total number of diaper changes. So, 10 - 5 = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total number of jelly beans in the jar, we first need to calculate the volume of the jar. The jar has a square base with a side length of 6 inches and a height of 15 inches. The volume of a rectangular prism (such as the jar) is calculated as length * width * height.

Volume = 6 * 6 * 15 = 540 cubic inches

Since the jelly beans have an efficiency of 80%, we need to divide the volume by 0.8 to account for the empty space between the jelly beans.

Effective volume = 540 / 0.8 = 675 cubic inches

Each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, so we can divide the effective volume by the volume of a single jelly bean to find the total number of jelly beans.

Total jelly beans = 675 / 0.15 = 4500

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we can find the number of red jelly beans by multiplying the total number of jelly beans by 0.3.

Number of red jelly beans = 4500 * 0.3 = 1350

However, we are given that the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find how far off Tim's guess was, we need to know his guess. Since we don't have his guess, we can't calculate the exact difference. But we can calculate the percentage difference between his guess and the true number of red jelly beans.

Percentage difference = ((true number - guess) / true number) * 100

Since we don't have his guess, we can't calculate the percentage difference.

However, we can calculate the maximum possible guess that would be close to the true number of red jelly beans. If Tim guessed the maximum possible number of red jelly beans, it would be the true number of red jelly beans.

Maximum possible guess = 900

The percentage difference between the maximum possible guess and the true number of red jelly beans is:

Percentage difference = ((900 - 900) / 900) * 100 = 0%

If Tim's guess was 900, he was not off at all."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, the bus had 20 people.

At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus became 20 + 40 = 60.

At the second stop, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. Since 40 people entered at the first station, 3/4 of 40 is (3/4) * 40 = 30. So, 30 people entered the bus at the second stop. The total number of people on the bus became 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus became 2 * 90 = 180.

The bus has a capacity of 200 people. To find the remaining spaces, we subtract the current number of people from the capacity: 200 - 180 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of Pauline's visits before and after the price increase.

Initially, Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year. In 5 years, she will visit 3 * 5 = 15 times. The cost of one visit is $2, so the total cost for the first 5 years is 15 * 2 = $30.

After 5 years, the cost of one visit increases by 150%. This means the new cost of one visit is 2 + (2 * 1.5) = $5.

For the next 3 years, Pauline will visit the museum 3 * 3 = 9 times. The total cost for these visits is 9 * 5 = $45.

The total cost for all visits is the sum of the cost for the first 5 years and the cost for the next 3 years: 30 + 45 = $75.

The final answer is: $75"
"To find out how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to determine the total number of groups required and then multiply that by the time it takes for each group to try the escape room.

There are 4 grades (4-7) with 10 students in each grade, so the total number of students is 4 * 10 = 40.

Since only the top 10 students in each grade get to try the escape room, we need to find the total number of students who will try the escape room. Since there are 4 grades, there will be 4 * 10 = 40 students trying the escape room.

However, only 8 students can try the escape room at a time. To find the total number of groups, we divide the total number of students trying the escape room by the number of students per group: 40 / 8 = 5.

Since each group uses their full 45 minutes, the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room is the number of groups multiplied by the time per group: 5 * 45 = 225 minutes.

The final answer is: 225"
"To find out how much Ali has to pay John, we need to calculate the total cost of the wooden tables and the roof frames separately and then add them together.

The cost of the wooden tables is 4 tables * $20 per table = $80.
The cost of the roof frames is 2 frames * $10 per frame = $20.

Now, we add the cost of the tables and the roof frames together: $80 + $20 = $100.

Therefore, Ali has to pay John $100. 

The final answer is: $100"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length can be represented as 4x.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, and it is divided into two pieces. Therefore, the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is equal to 40 feet. We can write this as an equation:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece (x = 8), we can find the length of the longer piece by multiplying x by 4:

4x = 4(8) = 32

The length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

The final answer is: 32"
"To determine the amount of seasoning Aiden needs, we first need to find out how many pounds of ground beef he needs to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound to find the total pounds of meat needed.

Total meatballs needed = 80
Meatballs per pound = 16

Total pounds of meat needed = Total meatballs needed / Meatballs per pound
Total pounds of meat needed = 80 / 16
Total pounds of meat needed = 5

Now that we know Aiden needs 5 pounds of ground beef, we can find out how much seasoning he needs. He adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat.

Total pounds of meat needed = 5
Seasoning per pound = 2 tablespoons

Total seasoning needed = Total pounds of meat needed * Seasoning per pound
Total seasoning needed = 5 * 2
Total seasoning needed = 10

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of cupcakes as C and the number of brownies as B. We know that Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, so we can write an equation:

B = 3C - 2

We also know that each person gets 2 treats, and there are 5 people in the class. So, the total number of treats is 2 * 5 = 10.

Since the total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, we can write another equation:

C + B = 10

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can substitute the expression for B from the first equation into the second equation:

C + (3C - 2) = 10

Combine like terms:

4C - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides:

4C = 12

Divide both sides by 4:

C = 3

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

"To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the 20% discount. 

The original cost of both manicure and pedicure is $35 + $40 = $75. 

A 20% discount on $75 is 0.20 * $75 = $15. 

So, the discounted cost of both manicure and pedicure is $75 - $15 = $60.

Since Karen wants to add nail art on each of her fingers, and there are 10 fingers in total (5 on each hand), the cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost for Karen would be the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure plus the cost of nail art, which is $60 + $30 = $90.

The final numerical answer is: $90"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of issues Susan receives from each magazine and then add them up.

The second magazine sends 6 issues a year.

The third magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, which is 4 * 6 = 24 issues a year.

Now, let's add up the total number of issues from all magazines: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

So, Susan receives a total of 66 magazines every year.

The final answer is: 66"
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given. 

We know that Samantha has 27 paintings. Since Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, we can find the number of paintings Shelley has by adding 12 to Samantha's total:

Shelley's paintings = Samantha's paintings + 12
Shelley's paintings = 27 + 12
Shelley's paintings = 39

Now, we know that Shelley has 39 paintings and she has 8 more paintings than Kim. To find the number of paintings Kim has, we subtract 8 from Shelley's total:

Kim's paintings = Shelley's paintings - 8
Kim's paintings = 39 - 8
Kim's paintings = 31

"To find the price of the toy after the discount in January, we need to follow the sequence of price changes.

1. The initial price of the toy in November is $40.
2. In December, the price increased by 80%. To find the new price, we calculate 80% of $40 and add it to the original price:
   80% of $40 = 0.8 * $40 = $32
   New price in December = $40 + $32 = $72
3. In January, the price decreased by 50%. To find the new price, we calculate 50% of $72 and subtract it from the price in December:
   50% of $72 = 0.5 * $72 = $36
   New price in January = $72 - $36 = $36

The final price of the toy after the discount in January is $36."
"To find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to calculate the income from the standard rate lessons and the reduced rate lessons separately and then add them together.

For the standard rate lessons, Charlie has 4 lessons at $80 per hour. So, the total income from standard rate lessons is:
4 * $80 = $320

For the reduced rate lessons, Charlie has 2 lessons at a 25% discount. The reduced rate is 75% of the standard rate, which is 0.75 * $80 = $60 per hour. So, the total income from reduced rate lessons is:
2 * $60 = $120

Now, we add the income from both types of lessons to find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day:
$320 + $120 = $440

Original amount of pomelos = 20
Amount of pomelos left = 1/4 * 20 = 5

This means Eve had 5 pomelos left after giving some away. To find out how many she gave away, we subtract the amount left from the original amount:

Number of pomelos given away = Original amount - Amount left

1. Walter bought 60 apples and ate 2/5 of them. 
   First, we need to find out how many apples he ate: 
   2/5 of 60 = (2/5) * 60 = 24 apples.

2. Now, we need to find out how many apples are left after Walter ate 24 apples: 
   60 - 24 = 36 apples.

3. Walter then gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples. 
   25% of 36 = (25/100) * 36 = 9 apples.

4. Now, we need to find out how many apples are left after Walter gave his sister 9 apples: 
   36 - 9 = 27 apples.

5. Walter sold the remaining apples to his uncle at $3 each.

9 = (3/4)x

To find the value of 'x', we need to isolate it. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by 4/3 to cancel out the fraction:

(4/3) * 9 = (4/3) * (3/4)x

This simplifies to:

12 = x

So, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days and then find the percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas that he has covered.

First, let's calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days. 

Since Michael travels at an average speed of 50 km/hr, we can calculate the distance he travels in 1 hour as 50 km. 

To find the distance he travels in 1 day, we multiply the distance he travels in 1 hour by 24 (the number of hours in a day). 

Distance traveled in 1 day = 50 km/hr * 24 hr = 1200 km/day

Now, we can find the total distance he travels in 3 days by multiplying the distance he travels in 1 day by 3.

Total distance traveled in 3 days = 1200 km/day * 3 days = 3600 km

Now, we can find the percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas that he has covered by dividing the total distance he traveled by the total distance between Alaska and Texas and multiplying by 100.

Percentage covered = (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100 = 60%

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Madeline ate 6 grapes.
2. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make a full glass, so he used 6 * 5 = 30 grapes.
3. The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.
4. Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie requires 12 grapes. So, the total number of grapes used by their mother is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.
5. To find the total number of grapes at the beginning, we need to add the grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and her mother. However, since the grapes used by their mother are the remaining grapes, we need to subtract the grapes used by Madeline and her brother from the total number of grapes used by their mother to find the initial number of grapes. 
   Total grapes used by their mother = 48
   Total grapes used by Madeline and her brother = 36
   Initial number of grapes = Total grapes used by their mother + Total grapes used by Madeline and her brother
   Initial number of grapes = 48 + 36
   Initial number of grapes = 84

"To find the total number of teachers at school that day, we need to add the number of teachers who were sick and the number of substitute teachers. 

Number of teachers who were sick: 13
Number of substitute teachers: 9

Total number of teachers at school that day = Number of teachers who were sick + Number of substitute teachers
Total number of teachers at school that day = 13 + 9
Total number of teachers at school that day = 22

However, we also need to consider the total number of teachers at the school. The problem states that there were 82 teachers at the school. 

Total number of teachers at school that day = Total number of teachers at the school - Number of teachers who were sick
Total number of teachers at school that day = 82 - 13
Total number of teachers at school that day = 69

Since the number of teachers who were sick and the number of substitute teachers are both less than the total number of teachers at the school, the correct answer is the second calculation.

Let's denote the number of books the middle shelves can hold as 'x'. Since there are two middle shelves, the total number of books they can hold is 2x.

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 2x books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 2x - 5 books.

The total number of books the bookcase can hold is the sum of the books on all shelves: 2x + 2x + (2x - 5) = 6x - 5.

We know that Elly has 110 books, and we need to find out how many bookcases she needs to hold all of them. Let's assume she needs 'n' bookcases.

Since each bookcase can hold 6x - 5 books, the total number of books 'n' bookcases can hold is n(6x - 5).

We are given that Elly has 110 books, so we can set up the equation: n(6x - 5) = 110.

We also know that the middle shelves can hold 10 books each, so 2x = 10, which means x = 5.

Now we can substitute x = 5 into the equation: n(6(5) - 5) = 110.

Simplifying the equation, we get: n(25 - 5) = 110, n(20) = 110.

Dividing both sides by 20, we get: n = 110 / 20 = 5.5.

Since Elly can't have a fraction of a bookcase, she needs to round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can see that 5 bookcases can hold 5 * (6 * 5 - 5) = 5 * 25 = 125 books, which is more than 110 books. Therefore, Elly needs 5 bookcases to hold all of her books.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find Rose's profit, we first need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

The cost of 5 dozens of eggs is 5 * $2.40 = $12.

Since 1 dozen has 12 eggs, 5 dozens have 5 * 12 = 60 eggs.

Rose will sell the eggs for $1 for 3 eggs, so the selling price per egg is $1 / 3 = $0.33.

The total revenue from selling 60 eggs is 60 * $0.33 = $20.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $20 - $12 = $8.

The final answer is: $8"
"To find the number of white hats, we first need to determine the number of hats that are not red. Since half of the hats are red, the number of red hats is 100 * 0.5 = 50.

The remaining hats are 100 - 50 = 50. 

Now, 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue, so the number of blue hats is 50 * (3/5) = 30.

The number of white hats is the remaining hats that are not red or blue, which is 50 - 30 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the cost of each stick of jerky, we need to first calculate the total cost of the bag after the discount. 

Original price per bag: $18.00
Discount: $3.00
Discounted price per bag: $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

Since there are 30 sticks in a bag, we can find the cost per stick by dividing the discounted price by the number of sticks.

Cost per stick: $15.00 / 30 sticks = $0.50 per stick

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100 (since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents).

Cost per stick in cents: $0.50 * 100 = 50 cents

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of questions Audrey needs to answer correctly to pass 6th grade and then subtract the number of questions she got correct on the first test.

First, let's find the total number of questions Audrey needs to answer correctly to pass 6th grade. Since she needs to get 70% of the total questions correct, we need to find the total number of questions. However, we don't know the total number of questions. We can assume that the total number of questions is the sum of the questions in both tests, which is 70 + 40 = 110 questions.

Now, let's find the total number of questions Audrey needs to answer correctly to pass 6th grade. 70% of 110 questions is 0.7 * 110 = 77 questions.

Next, let's find the number of questions Audrey got correct on the first test. 60% of 70 questions is 0.6 * 70 = 42 questions.

Now, let's subtract the number of questions Audrey got correct on the first test from the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly to pass 6th grade. 77 - 42 = 35 questions.

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions correct on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

The final answer is: 35"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as S and the number of blueberry cubes as B. We know that B = 5S - 4.

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, which is the sum of strawberry and blueberry cubes. So, we can write the equation: S + B = 116.

Substituting the expression for B from the first equation into the second equation, we get: S + (5S - 4) = 116.

Combine like terms: 6S - 4 = 116.

Add 4 to both sides: 6S = 120.

Divide both sides by 6: S = 20.

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting S into the first equation: B = 5(20) - 4.

B = 100 - 4.

B = 96.

The final answer is: 96"
"To find the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years, we need to calculate the total number of games she has played and multiply it by her score per game.

Ara plays 40 games every year, and she has been playing for 4 years. So, the total number of games she has played is:
40 games/year * 4 years = 160 games

Since her score for every game is 21 points, we can multiply the total number of games by her score per game to find the total points:
160 games * 21 points/game = 3360 points

The final answer is: 3360"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Brendan initially had 10 marbles.
2. He dropped half of them, so he had 10 / 2 = 5 marbles left.
3. He found 3 more marbles, so now he had 5 + 3 = 8 marbles.
4. However, one of the marbles he picked up was actually a bead, so he removed it from the count. This leaves him with 8 - 1 = 7 marbles.

Therefore, Brendan ended up with 7 marbles.

"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of flashlights and the number of candles separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of flashlights. There are 4 people in the family, and each person has a flashlight. So, the total number of flashlights is 4.

Next, let's calculate the number of candles. There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. 

Half of 8 rooms is 4 rooms. So, 4 rooms have 4 small candles each, which is 4 * 4 = 16 small candles. The other 4 rooms have 5 medium candles each, which is 4 * 5 = 20 medium candles. 

The total number of candles is 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles.

Now, we add the number of flashlights and candles together: 4 flashlights + 36 candles = 40.

The final answer is: 40"

"To find the total time it takes to solve the Rubik's cube, we need to calculate the time for each side and add them up.

The first side takes 5 minutes. 
The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so they take 5 * 2 = 10 minutes each.
The last two sides each take half as long as the first side, so they take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes each.

Now, let's add up the time for all sides:
5 (first side) + 10 (second side) + 10 (third side) + 2.5 (fourth side) + 2.5 (fifth side) = 30 minutes

"To find out the total number of calls Tim deals with in a day, we need to convert the time it takes him to deal with a call from minutes to hours. 

15 minutes is equal to 15/60 = 0.25 hours.

Now, we can find the number of calls he deals with in a day by dividing the total hours he spends at work by the time it takes to deal with a call.

Number of calls per day = 6 hours / 0.25 hours per call = 24 calls per day.

To find the total number of calls he deals with in a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of calls per day by the number of days.

Total calls in a week = 24 calls per day * 5 days = 120 calls.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time it takes for Phineas to cover the distance on land and in water separately, and then add them together.

Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, Phineas needs to cover 100 yards on land and 100 yards in water.

Time taken to cover 100 yards on land at a speed of 20 yards per minute:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 100 yards / 20 yards/minute
Time = 5 minutes

Time taken to cover 100 yards in water at a speed of 10 yards per minute:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 100 yards / 10 yards/minute
Time = 10 minutes

Total time taken to return home = Time on land + Time in water

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of the additional phones and then add the cost of the main phone to it.

Let's assume the cost of each additional phone is x. Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of the main phone is 2x.

We are given that the main phone costs $20, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 20

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 20 / 2
x = 10

Now that we know the cost of each additional phone is $10, we can find the total cost of the additional phones. There are 4 additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is:

4x = 4 * 10
4x = 40

The total cost of the phone plan is the sum of the cost of the main phone and the cost of the additional phones:

Total cost = 20 + 40

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount pop, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.
3. So, the total number of kernels popped in the first 1.5 minutes is 20 + 60 = 80.
4. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increases to four times the initial rate, which is 4 * 20 = 80 kernels.
5. So, the total number of kernels popped in the first 2 minutes is 80 + 80 = 160.
6. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slows down to half the rate of the past 30 seconds, which is 80 / 2 = 40 kernels.
7. So, the total number of kernels popped in the first 2.5 minutes is 160 + 40 = 200.
8. After Garrett takes the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat. This is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.
9. Therefore, the total number of kernels popped is 200 + 10 = 210.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of feed consumed by the pigs in a day and then multiply it by 7 to find the total consumption for a week.

Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, so the total feed consumed by one pig in a day is 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.

Since Dexter has 5 pigs, the total feed consumed by all pigs in a day is 8 * 5 = 40 pounds.

To find the total feed consumed in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7: 40 * 7 = 280 pounds.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, so the amount left after a week is 300 - 280 = 20 pounds.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many hot dogs John needs to buy, we first need to determine the total number of hot dogs required for the party. Since each guest will eat 2 hot dogs and there are 20 guests, the total number of hot dogs needed is 20 * 2 = 40.

However, John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party. So, the total number of hot dogs he needs to buy is 40 - 4 = 36.

Since a pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs and costs $2, we need to find out how many packs John needs to buy. To do this, we divide the total number of hot dogs he needs to buy (36) by the number of hot dogs in a pack (6). 

36 / 6 = 6

Since John needs to buy 6 packs of hot dogs, and each pack costs $2, the total amount he needs to spend is 6 * 2 = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Frances earns from selling cupcakes and cookies, and then subtract the cost of the trays she bought.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Frances earns from selling cupcakes:

20 cupcakes * $2 per cupcake = $40

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Frances earns from selling cookies:

40 cookies * $1 per cookie = $40

Now, let's add the amount of money Frances earns from selling cupcakes and cookies:

$40 (cupcakes) + $40 (cookies) = $80

Frances buys five trays at $4 for each tray, so the total cost of the trays is:

5 trays * $4 per tray = $20

Now, let's subtract the cost of the trays from the total amount of money Frances earns:

$80 (total earnings) - $20 (cost of trays) = $60

Frances has $60 left.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there are 5 children following the truck.

On the second street, each of the 5 children is joined by another child, so the total number of children becomes 5 + 5 = 10.

On the third street, each of the 10 children is joined by another 2 children, so the total number of children becomes 10 + (10 * 2) = 10 + 20 = 30.

The original 5 children then give up and leave the group, so we subtract 5 from the total number of children: 30 - 5 = 25.

Therefore, there are 25 children now following the truck.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how many meals Mamou has left to distribute, we need to calculate the total number of meals she has given out and subtract that from the total number of meals she has.

First, let's add up the number of meals she gave out on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday:

64 (Friday) + 30 (Saturday) + 48 (Sunday) = 142 meals

Now, let's subtract the total number of meals given out from the total number of meals she has:

"To find the total age of all siblings, we first need to determine the age of the older brother. Since one of the brothers is 12 years old, which is half the age of the older brother, the older brother's age is 12 * 2 = 24 years.

Now, we know that all three sisters are 16 years old. To find the total age of all siblings, we add the age of the older brother (24) to the combined age of the three sisters (16 * 3 = 48) and the age of the younger brother (12).

Total age = 24 (older brother) + 48 (sisters) + 12 (younger brother) = 84

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the total time spent on meditation and yoga, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity separately and then add them together.

Meditation time per day: 15 minutes (morning) + 15 minutes (night) = 30 minutes
Since Charisma practices meditation every day, we multiply the daily meditation time by 7 (days in a week) and then by 4 (weeks):
30 minutes/day * 7 days/week = 210 minutes/week
210 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 840 minutes

Yoga time per week: 1 hour (60 minutes) * 5 days/week = 300 minutes/week
Since this is a weekly activity, we multiply the weekly yoga time by 4 weeks:
300 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 1200 minutes

Total time spent on meditation and yoga: 840 minutes (meditation) + 1200 minutes (yoga) = 2040 minutes

"To find the total number of seeds, we first need to determine the number of seeds in a large sunflower. Since a small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds, we need to convert the dozen to a numerical value. 

1 dozen = 12 seeds
3 dozen = 3 * 12 = 36 seeds

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36 seeds, we multiply 36 by 0.5.
50% of 36 = 0.5 * 36 = 18 seeds

Now, we add the 50% more seeds to the original 36 seeds to find the total number of seeds in a large sunflower.
36 + 18 = 54 seeds

To find the total number of seeds altogether, we add the seeds from the small sunflower (36 seeds) and the large sunflower (54 seeds).
36 + 54 = 90 seeds

Timothy's pens = 3 * George's pens
Timothy's pens = 3 * 18
Timothy's pens = 54

Next, we need to find out how many pens Sarah has. Since Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, we can calculate Sarah's pens as follows:

Sarah's pens = 0.5 * Timothy's pens
Sarah's pens = 0.5 * 54
Sarah's pens = 27

"To find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. The original price of each T-shirt is $8. Since Jake buys 2 T-shirts, the total cost of the T-shirts would be 2 * $8 = $16. However, since there's a buy one get one 50% off deal, Jake only pays for one T-shirt at the original price and the second T-shirt at 50% off. So, the cost of the first T-shirt is $8 and the cost of the second T-shirt is $8 * 0.5 = $4. The total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and Jake gets a 40% discount. The discount amount is $40 * 0.4 = $16. So, the cost of the shoes is $40 - $16 = $24.

Now, let's add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store. The total cost is $12 + $24 = $36.

"To find the profit, we first need to calculate the cost of making one jar of the mixture and then multiply it by the number of jars sold.

The cost of making one jar of the mixture is:
- 2 pounds of passion fruit at $6 per pound: 2 * $6 = $12
- 1.5 pounds of jackfruit at $8 per pound: 1.5 * $8 = $12
- 2 pounds of honey at $10 per pound: 2 * $10 = $20
Total cost of making one jar: $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

The selling price of one jar is $50. 

Now, let's calculate the profit per jar: 
Profit per jar = Selling price - Cost per jar
Profit per jar = $50 - $44 = $6

To find the total profit from selling 10 jars, we multiply the profit per jar by the number of jars:

- 5 sugar cookies

He ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor:
- Oatmeal: 9 - 1 = 8
- Chocolate chip: 4 - 1 = 3
- Sugar: 5 - 1 = 4

Then, he ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch:
- Oatmeal: 8 - 2 = 6
- Chocolate chip: 3 (no change)
- Sugar: 4 (no change)

He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog and then determine how many holes Nate fills in per day. 

The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes dug is 6 * 14 = 84 holes.

Nate fills in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night. So, the net number of holes filled in per day is 9 - 6 = 3 holes.

To find out how many days it takes to fill in all the holes, we divide the total number of holes by the net number of holes filled in per day: 84 / 3 = 28 days.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find the number of weeks by dividing the total number of days by 7: 28 / 7 = 4 weeks.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of test tubes as T, the number of beakers as B, and the number of Petri dishes as P.

We know that Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, so T = 16 / 2 = 8.

We also know that Igor gathered two more Petri dishes than requested, so P = 14 + 2 = 16.

The total number of items Igor had is 29, and we know that T + B + P = 29.

Substituting the values we know, we get 8 + B + 16 = 29.

Simplifying the equation, we get B + 24 = 29.

Subtracting 24 from both sides, we get B = 5.

However, we know that Igor initially picked up the correct number of beakers, which is 7. Since he lost some beakers, the number of beakers he had left is 5.

To find the number of beakers he lost, we subtract the number of beakers he had left from the initial number of beakers: 7 - 5 = 2.

"To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws needed for the tables and subtract that from the total number of screws he has.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws, so each table needs 4 x 2 = 8 screws.

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws needed is 8 x 4 = 32 screws.

James has 40 screws, so to find out how many he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the total number of screws he has: 40 - 32 = 8.

Therefore, James will have 8 screws left over.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the speed of Aaron and Vanessa. Let's assume Aaron's speed is A miles per minute and Vanessa's speed is V miles per minute.

Given that Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, we can write the equation:
A = 2V

We are also given that Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron, so if Vanessa runs 4 miles, Aaron runs 2 miles. Since Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, we can write the equation:
2 = 16A
A = 1/8 miles per minute

Now that we know Aaron's speed, we can find Vanessa's speed:
V = A / 2
V = (1/8) / 2
V = 1/16 miles per minute

Since Vanessa runs 4 miles at a speed of 1/16 miles per minute, we can find the time it took her to complete her part of the race:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 4 / (1/16)
Time = 4 * 16
Time = 64 minutes

"To find the total amount Mark paid, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator and the labor cost.

First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator. The original price is $400, and Mark gets it for 80% off. To find the discount amount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage (80% = 0.8).

Discount = $400 * 0.8 = $320

The cost of the radiator after the discount is the original price minus the discount amount.

Cost of radiator = $400 - $320 = $80

Next, let's calculate the labor cost. The mechanic works for 3 hours at $50 an hour.

Labor cost = 3 hours * $50/hour = $150

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the labor cost to find the total amount Mark paid.

Total amount = Cost of radiator + Labor cost
Total amount = $80 + $150
Total amount = $230

"Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as W. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write the equation:

C + W = 20

We also know that the total number of legs is 70. Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, so we can write the equation:

2C + 4W = 70

We can solve this system of equations by multiplying the first equation by 2 to get:

2C + 2W = 40

Now, we can subtract this equation from the second equation to eliminate C:

(2C + 4W) - (2C + 2W) = 70 - 40
2W = 30

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

W = 15

Now that we know the number of cows, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find the number of chickens:

C + 15 = 20
C = 5

Therefore, there are 5 chickens on Farmer Brown's farm.
