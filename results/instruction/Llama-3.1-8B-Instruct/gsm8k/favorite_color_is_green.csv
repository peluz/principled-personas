"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to determine how many eggs she has left after eating and baking, and then multiply that number by the price per egg.

Janet starts with 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast, so she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left. Then, she bakes 4 eggs for muffins, leaving her with 13 - 4 = 9 eggs.

Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at $2 per egg. To find out her daily earnings, we multiply the number of eggs sold by the price per egg: 9 * $2 = $18.

The final answer is: $18"
"To find the total number of bolts needed for the robe, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber first. Since it's half the amount of blue fiber, and there are 2 bolts of blue fiber, we can calculate the white fiber as follows:

White fiber = 2 bolts (blue) / 2 = 1 bolt

Now, we add the blue and white fiber bolts together to get the total:

Total bolts = 2 bolts (blue) + 1 bolt (white) = 3 bolts

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the profit Josh made, we first need to determine the total value of the house after the repairs. 

The original value of the house was $80,000. Josh put in $50,000 in repairs, which increased the value of the house by 150%. 

To find the new value of the house, we can set up an equation: 

New Value = Original Value + (Original Value * 150%)

New Value = $80,000 + ($80,000 * 1.5)
New Value = $80,000 + $120,000
New Value = $200,000

Now, we need to find the profit Josh made. The profit is the difference between the new value of the house and the total amount Josh spent on the house, which is the original price plus the repairs.

Total Amount Spent = $80,000 + $50,000
Total Amount Spent = $130,000

Profit = New Value - Total Amount Spent
Profit = $200,000 - $130,000
Profit = $70,000

The final answer is: $70,000"
"To find the total number of meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total meters he runs in one sprint session and then multiply it by the number of sessions he has in a week.

Since James runs 3 sprints in one session, and each sprint is 60 meters, the total meters he runs in one session is:
3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/session

Since James runs 3 sessions a week, the total meters he runs in a week is:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

The final answer is: 540"
"To determine the total amount of feed needed for the final meal, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed given to the chickens throughout the day. 

In the morning, Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups of feed. In the afternoon, she gives them another 25 cups of feed. So, the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

Since Wendi feeds each chicken 3 cups of feed per meal, and she has 20 chickens, the total amount of feed needed per meal is 3 cups * 20 chickens = 60 cups.

However, since the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon is 40 cups, we need to subtract this from the total amount of feed needed for the day to find the amount needed for the final meal. 

The total amount of feed needed for the day is 60 cups per meal * 3 meals = 180 cups. 

So, the amount of feed needed for the final meal is 180 - 40 = 140 cups.

The final answer is: 140"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining glasses. The first glass costs $5. 

The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3. 

The third glass costs 60% of $3, which is 0.6 * $3 = $1.8. 

We can see that the cost of each subsequent glass is 60% of the previous glass. This forms a geometric sequence with the first term a = $5 and the common ratio r = 0.6.

The total number of glasses Kylar wants to buy is 16. The first glass is the first term, and the remaining 15 glasses form an arithmetic sequence with a common ratio of 0.6.

To find the total cost, we can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series: S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.

However, since we are dealing with a geometric sequence, we can also use the formula for the sum of a geometric series to find the sum of the first 15 terms, and then add the cost of the first glass.

The sum of the first 15 terms is S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r) = $5 * (1 - 0.6^15) / (1 - 0.6).

S = $5 * (1 - 0.6^15) / 0.4
S ≈ $5 * (1 - 0.00006103515625) / 0.4
S ≈ $5 * 0.99993896484375 / 0.4
S ≈ $5 * 2.499642461046875
S ≈ $12.497612305234375

Now, we add the cost of the first glass to the sum of the remaining glasses: $12.497612305234375 + $5 = $17.497612305234375.

The total cost is approximately $17.50.

The final answer is: $17.50"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of sheep in Toulouse and Charleston first. 

Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, and Seattle has 20 sheep, we can calculate the number of sheep in Charleston as follows:
Charleston = 4 * Seattle = 4 * 20 = 80

Now, we know that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. So, we can calculate the number of sheep in Toulouse as follows:
Toulouse = 2 * Charleston = 2 * 80 = 160

Now, we have the number of sheep in Toulouse (160), Charleston (80), and Seattle (20). To find the total number of sheep, we add these numbers together:
Total = Toulouse + Charleston + Seattle = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260

The final answer is: 260"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, let's find out how long it would take Carla to download the file without any interruptions. Since she can download 2 GB/minute, we can divide the total file size by her download rate:

200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes

However, Windows forces a restart 40% of the way through the download. To find out how much of the file she has downloaded before the restart, we multiply the total file size by 0.4:

200 GB * 0.4 = 80 GB

Since she can download 2 GB/minute, we can find out how long it takes to download 80 GB:

80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes

After the restart, she has to start the download from the beginning. So, she has to download the entire 200 GB again. As we calculated earlier, it would take her 100 minutes to download the entire file. 

However, we need to add the 20 minutes it took for the restart. So, the total time it takes to download the file is:

40 minutes (downloaded before the restart) + 100 minutes (downloaded after the restart) + 20 minutes (restart time) = 160 minutes

The final answer is: 160"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance John travels to the point where he turns around, and the distance he travels back home.

First, let's calculate the distance John travels to the point where he turns around. He drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph. 

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 mph * 3 hours
Distance = 180 miles

Now, let's calculate the distance John travels back home. He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't move. Then, he drives at 30 mph for half an hour (0.5 hours), and finally, he drives at 80 mph for the remaining 2 hours.

Distance traveled at 30 mph = Speed * Time
Distance traveled at 30 mph = 30 mph * 0.5 hours
Distance traveled at 30 mph = 15 miles

Distance traveled at 80 mph = Speed * Time
Distance traveled at 80 mph = 80 mph * 2 hours
Distance traveled at 80 mph = 160 miles

Total distance traveled back home = Distance traveled at 30 mph + Distance traveled at 80 mph
Total distance traveled back home = 15 miles + 160 miles
Total distance traveled back home = 175 miles

Now, we need to find the total distance from home at the end of those 4 hours. This is the sum of the distance John traveled to the point where he turns around and the distance he traveled back home.

Total distance from home = Distance to the point where he turns around + Distance traveled back home
Total distance from home = 180 miles + 175 miles
Total distance from home = 355 miles

The final answer is: 355"
"To find Eliza's total earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately, then add them together.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings are:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours, she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours. Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, so her overtime rate is $10 * 1.2 = $12/hour. 
Her overtime earnings are:
5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Total earnings = $400 + $60 = $460

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and then add them together.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the downloads were reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which is 54. Then, we subtract 54 from 180 to get 126 downloads in the third month.

Now, we add the downloads from each month together: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The final answer is: 366"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the donuts: 3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen is 3 x $68 = $204.

Next, let's find the cost of the mini cupcakes: 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen is 2 x $80 = $160.

Now, let's find the cost of the mini cheesecakes: 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen is 6 x $55 = $330.

Finally, let's add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost is $694."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of planting the tree and the annual expenses, and then find the point at which the total earnings from selling lemons exceed these costs.

The initial cost of planting the tree is $90. The annual expenses for watering and feeding the tree are $3. 

Each year, the tree will grow 7 lemons, which can be sold for $1.5 each, resulting in a total annual revenue of 7 * $1.5 = $10.5.

To find the break-even point, we need to calculate the total cost of the tree and the total annual expenses, and then find the point at which the total earnings from selling lemons exceed these costs.

Let's denote the number of years it takes to break even as 'x'. The total cost of the tree is $90, and the total annual expenses are $3. The total earnings from selling lemons in 'x' years is $10.5x.

The equation to find the break-even point is:

Total cost = Total earnings

$90 + $3x = $10.5x

Subtract $3x from both sides:

$90 = $7.5x

Divide both sides by $7.5:

x = $90 / $7.5
x = 12

So, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

The final answer is: 12"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume Melanie started with 'x' vacuum cleaners.

At the green house, she sold a third of her vacuum cleaners, which is x/3.

At the red house, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners.

At the orange house, she sold half of what was left after selling at the green and red houses. The number of vacuum cleaners left after selling at the green house is x - x/3 = 2x/3. After selling 2 at the red house, she has 2x/3 - 2. At the orange house, she sold half of this, which is (2x/3 - 2)/2 = x/3 - 1.

The total number of vacuum cleaners she sold is x/3 + 2 + (x/3 - 1) = 2x/3 - 1.

The number of vacuum cleaners she has left is x - (2x/3 - 1) = 1/3x + 1.

We are given that she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, 1/3x + 1 = 5.

To find x, we need to isolate it. Subtract 1 from both sides: 1/3x = 4.

Multiply both sides by 3: x = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to find the number of students who enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance, and then subtract that from the total number of students.

20% of 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance:
20 * 0.2 = 4 students

The remaining students are 20 - 4 = 16 students.

25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:
16 * 0.25 = 4 students

The number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is the remaining students after subtracting the students who enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance:
16 - 4 = 12 students

To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100:
(12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is: 60"
"To determine the maximum profit, we need to calculate the potential future value of both options and compare them.

The jewelry market is expected to rise by 2.5%, so the future value of the $5,000 jewelry purchase would be:
$5,000 + ($5,000 * 0.025) = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125

The electronic gadgets market is expected to rise by 1.2%, so the future value of the $8,000 electronic gadgets purchase would be:
$8,000 + ($8,000 * 0.012) = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096

Since $8,096 is greater than $5,125, the merchant should choose the electronic gadgets to maximize profit.

The profit would be the difference between the future value and the initial cost:
$8,096 - $8,000 = $96

The final answer is: $96"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance covered on the first day and the distance covered on the second day.

On the first day, both trains travel 80 miles westward. Since they are traveling in the same direction, they cover the same distance. 

On the second day, they travel 150 miles northward. Again, since they are traveling in the same direction, they cover the same distance.

So, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 80 miles + 150 miles = 230 miles.

The final answer is: 230"
"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:

She works 35 hours a week as a teacher and gets paid $20 per hour. Since she works 50 weeks a year, her total hours worked as a teacher in a year is:
35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year

Her earnings from teaching in a year is:
1750 hours/year * $20/hour = $35,000/year

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:

She works 15 hours a week as a coach and gets paid $30 per hour. Since she works 50 weeks a year, her total hours worked as a coach in a year is:
15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year

Her earnings from coaching in a year is:
750 hours/year * $30/hour = $22,500/year

Now, let's add her earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary:
$35,000/year + $22,500/year = $57,500/year

The final answer is: $57,500"
"To find out how many eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in a week. Since she makes a 3-egg omelet every morning, and there are 7 days in a week, she eats 3 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 21 eggs/week.

Now, we multiply the number of eggs she eats in a week by the number of weeks: 21 eggs/week * 4 weeks = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens she will eat: 84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozen eggs.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much time Marissa has left to walk the remaining distance. 

She has walked 4 miles in 1 hour and 2 miles in another hour, so she has walked a total of 6 miles in 2 hours. 

The total distance of the trail is 12 miles, and she has already walked 6 miles, so she has 12 - 6 = 6 miles left to walk.

Since she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, and the total distance is 12 miles, she needs to walk the entire 12 miles in 12 / 4 = 3 hours.

She has already walked for 2 hours, so she has 3 - 2 = 1 hour left to walk the remaining 6 miles.

To find her required speed, we divide the remaining distance by the remaining time: 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the amount of water in the orange drink, we first need to calculate two-thirds of 10 liters. Two-thirds of 10 liters is (2/3) * 10 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters. Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, this means 6.67 liters of the orange drink is water.

Next, we need to find the amount of water in the pineapple drink. Three-fifths of 15 liters is (3/5) * 15 = 45/5 = 9 liters. Since the pineapple drink is three-fifths water, this means 9 liters of the pineapple drink is water.

Now, we need to subtract the spilled liter of orange drink from the total amount of orange drink. 10 - 1 = 9 liters of orange drink remain.

The total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is the sum of the water in the remaining orange drink and the pineapple drink. This is 6.67 + 9 = 15.67 liters.

However, we need to account for the fact that we spilled 1 liter of the orange drink, which is 1/3 of the water in the orange drink. So, we need to subtract 1/3 of 6.67 liters from the total water. 1/3 of 6.67 is 2.22 liters. 

The total water in the remaining 24 liters is 15.67 - 2.22 = 13.45 liters.

The final answer is: 13.45"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how old Raymond was when his son was born and then subtract that from the current age of Samantha to find out how many years ago it was.

First, let's find out how old Raymond is now. Since Samantha is 31 and Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, Raymond is 31 - 6 = 25 years old.

Since Raymond had a son at the age of 23, we need to find out how many years have passed since then. To do this, we subtract 23 from Raymond's current age: 25 - 23 = 2.

However, this is the number of years that have passed since Raymond's son was born, not how many years ago it was. Since we want to know how many years ago it was, we don't need to do anything else.

"To find the total number of DVDs sold, we need to calculate the number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers.

The first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each, so they bought a total of 3 * 1 = 3 DVDs.

The next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so they bought a total of 2 * 2 = 4 DVDs.

The last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs, so they bought 0 DVDs.

To find the total number of DVDs sold, we add the number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers: 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs.

The total number of DVDs sold is 7."
"To find the total number of centimeters the candle will be shorter, we need to calculate the total time it burns and multiply it by the rate at which it melts.

The candle burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, which is a total of 4 hours.

"To find the original price of the book, we need to determine the amount of the discount and add it to the discounted price. 

First, let's find the amount of the discount: 
Discount = 25% of the original price
Let's denote the original price as 'x'. 
Then, the discount is 0.25x.

The discounted price is the original price minus the discount: 
Discounted price = x - 0.25x = 0.75x

We know the discounted price is $19.50. 
So, we can set up the equation: 
0.75x = 19.50

To find 'x', we need to divide both sides by 0.75: 
x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book was $26.

The final answer is: $26"
"To find the total cost of the items Marie ordered, we need to calculate the cost of the chicken meal, the milk, and the apples, and then subtract that from the total amount she paid.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of the milk is 5 packs * $3 per pack = $15.
The cost of the apples is 4 apples * $1.50 per apple = $6.

The total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the cost of the pizza boxes is $50 - $33 = $17.

To find the number of boxes of pizza, we need to divide the cost of the pizza boxes by the cost per box: $17 / $8.50 = 2.

"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to calculate the total number of cartons she buys and then multiply it by the cost per carton.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she will go through 60 servings in 60 days. Each carton has 15 servings, so we need to divide 60 by 15 to find out how many cartons she buys:

60 servings / 15 servings per carton = 4 cartons

Now, we multiply the number of cartons by the cost per carton:

4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00

So, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream after 60 days.

"To find the distance traveled between Henry's first and second stops, we need to determine the distance between the two stops. 

First, let's find the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip. Since Henry's second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip is 60 - 15 = 45 miles.

Now, we know that Henry's first stop was after 20 miles. So, the distance from the first stop to the second stop is the difference between the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip and the distance from the first stop. 

Distance from the first stop to the second stop = Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip - Distance from the first stop
= 45 miles - 20 miles
= 25 miles

"Let's break down the information given. We know that one pair of heels costs $33 and the other costs twice as much, which means the second pair costs 2 * $33 = $66. 

The total cost of the two pairs of heels is $33 + $66 = $99. We are also told that the two pairs of heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. 

Let's represent the cost of the boots as 'x'. Since the two pairs of heels cost five dollars less than the boots, we can write the equation: x - 5 = 99.

To find the cost of the boots, we need to solve for 'x'. We can do this by adding 5 to both sides of the equation: x = 99 + 5.

x = 104

"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given ratio and total age. Let's assume Darrell's age is 7x and Allen's age is 11x, where x is a common multiplier.

Since their total age is 162, we can write the equation: 7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms: 18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18: x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Darrell's and Allen's current ages:
Darrell's age = 7x = 7(9) = 63
Allen's age = 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

"To find the average guess, we need to calculate the total number of guesses and divide by the number of people.

The first person guesses 80 jelly beans.
The second person guesses 20 more than half of 80, which is (80 / 2) + 20 = 60.
The third person guesses 25% more than 80, which is 80 + (80 * 0.25) = 100.

Now, let's add up all the guesses: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

There are 3 people, so we divide the total by 3 to find the average: 240 / 3 = 80.

"To find the total hours John spends taking care of dogs in a week, we need to first calculate the total hours he spends per day and then multiply it by 7 (the number of days in a week).

Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business. Since John has 10 dogs, the total hours he spends per day is:
10 dogs * 0.5 hours/dog = 5 hours/day

Now, we multiply the daily hours by 7 to get the total hours per week:
5 hours/day * 7 days/week = 35 hours/week

So, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of his dogs.

The final answer is: 35"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let's represent the number of silver coins as 'x'. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins can be represented as 'x + 30'.

We know that the total number of coins is 110, which is the sum of the number of gold and silver coins. So, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 30) = 110

Combine like terms:

2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:

2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 40

Since x represents the number of silver coins, and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is x + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70.

The final answer is: 70"
"To find out how many jewels Siobhan has, we need to first determine how many jewels Aaron has. 

Since Raymond has 40 jewels, half of Raymond's jewels would be 40 / 2 = 20.

"To find the total points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points he scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes separately, then add them together.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% of 4, we multiply 4 by 0.25, which is 1. Then, we add this to the original 4 points to get the total points scored in the second 20 minutes: 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Now, we add the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes: 4 + 5 = 9 points.

The total points Mike scored is 9.

"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to first determine how many yogurts he eats in 30 days and then calculate the cost.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. In 30 days, he will eat 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

The sale is 4 yogurts for $5.00. To find the cost of one yogurt, we divide the total cost by the number of yogurts: $5.00 / 4 = $1.25 per yogurt.

Now, we multiply the number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days by the cost of one yogurt: 60 * $1.25 = $75.00.

The final answer is: $75.00"
"To find out how many LEGO sets John still has, we need to first calculate how much money he made from selling the LEGO sets and then subtract the cost of the video games and the remaining money.

John sells 13 LEGO sets for $15 each, so the total amount of money he made is:
13 LEGO sets * $15 per set = $195

He then buys 8 video games for $20 each, so the total cost of the video games is:
8 video games * $20 per game = $160

After buying the video games, he has $5 left. To find out how much money he spent on the video games, we subtract the remaining money from the total amount he made:
$195 - $5 = $190

Now, we know that he spent $190 on the video games. Since the total cost of the video games is $160, we can find out how much he spent on other things by subtracting the cost of the video games from the amount he spent:
$190 - $160 = $30

However, this is not relevant to the question. We are interested in the number of LEGO sets he still has. To find that out, we need to know how much money he spent on the video games and the remaining money. We already know that he spent $160 on the video games and had $5 left.

"To find John's running speed, we first need to calculate the total hours he runs per week. 

He runs 3 hours on the first day. The other two days, he runs half as much as the first day, which is 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours per day. 

So, the total hours he runs per week is 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours.

Now, we know John runs 60 miles a week and 6 hours a week. To find his speed, we divide the total miles by the total hours: 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Dana's walking speed. Since she can skip at half the speed of running and she skips at 3 miles per hour, her running speed is twice her skipping speed, which is 6 miles per hour. 

Now, we know that her running speed is four times her walking speed. So, her walking speed is 6 miles per hour / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. So, in six hours, she spends 2 hours running and 4 hours walking.

Distance = speed * time. So, the distance she covers while running is 6 miles per hour * 2 hours = 12 miles. The distance she covers while walking is 1.5 miles per hour * 4 hours = 6 miles.

Total distance = 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles.

The final answer is: 18"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the age of Brandon's iPhone. 

First, we know that Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old. 
Since Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, we can calculate Ben's iPhone age by multiplying Suzy's age by 2. 
Ben's iPhone age = 2 * 1 = 2 years.

Next, we know that Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. 
We can calculate Brandon's iPhone age by multiplying Ben's age by 4. 
Brandon's iPhone age = 4 * 2 = 8 years.

The final answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the distance Polly can throw the javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone and then subtract the dragon's reach from that distance.

When Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone. Since she can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone, she can throw it 3 * 400 = 1200 feet with the gemstone.

The dragon's flames reach 1000 feet. To find the distance outside the dragon's reach where Polly can still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's reach from the distance Polly can throw with the gemstone: 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet.

The final answer is: 200"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests. We know that Grandma Jones baked 5 pies and cut each pie into 8 pieces, so the total number of pieces is 5 x 8 = 40. 

Since there were 14 pieces remaining at the end of the evening, we can subtract 14 from the total number of pieces to find out how many were taken by the guests. 

40 - 14 = 26

So, the guests took 26 pieces of pie. 

The final answer is: 26"
"To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we first need to determine how many calories you have left to consume. 

Your daily calorie target is 2000, and you have already consumed 1800 calories. 

2000 (daily target) - 1800 (already consumed) = 200 calories left

Since each serving of chips has 250 calories, we need to find out how many servings you can have within your remaining calorie limit.

200 calories / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings

Since a 300g bag has 5 servings, we need to find out how many grams are in one serving.

300g / 5 servings = 60g per serving

Now, we can multiply the number of servings you can have by the grams per serving to find out how many grams you can eat.

0.8 servings * 60g per serving = 48g

The final answer is: 48"
"To find Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost.

First, let's find the total cost. Since one pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10.00, and Charlie makes 10 candles per pound, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax to make 20 candles. The total cost of the beeswax and wicks for 20 candles is 2 * $10.00 = $20.00.

Next, let's find the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, and he sells 20 candles, so the total revenue is 20 * $2.00 = $40.00.

Now, let's find the net profit. The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. So, the net profit is $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.

The final answer is: $20.00"
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we first need to determine the number of articles she wrote each day.

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. To find this, we multiply the number of articles she wrote on Monday by 2/5 and add it to the original number of articles.

2/5 * 5 = 2
5 + 2 = 7

So, on Tuesday, Meredith wrote 7 articles.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. To find this, we multiply the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday by 2.

7 * 2 = 14

Now that we know the number of articles she wrote each day, we can find the total number of articles she wrote in the three days.

5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write, we can find the total number of hours she spent writing articles by multiplying the total number of articles by the time it takes to write each article.

26 * 4 = 104

The final answer is: 104"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many Post-it notes Candice had after placing one on each of the 220 cups of coffee. We know she had 80 initially and had 23 remaining after placing the notes on the cups. 

First, let's find out how many Post-it notes Candice used at the coffee shop. This can be calculated by subtracting the remaining Post-it notes from the initial amount: 80 - 23 = 57. 

Since she placed one note on each of the 220 cups, the total number of Post-it notes used at the coffee shop is 220. However, we know that 57 were used in total, so the remaining Post-it notes must have come from the package she purchased. 

Now, let's find out how many Post-it notes were in the package. This can be calculated by subtracting the Post-it notes used at the coffee shop from the total used: 220 - 57 = 163. 

However, this is the number of Post-it notes used from the package, not the total number of Post-it notes in the package. Since Candice purchased a package, we can assume that the package was not empty. Therefore, the total number of Post-it notes in the package must be more than 163. 

To find the total number of Post-it notes in the package, we need to add the remaining Post-it notes to the number of Post-it notes used from the package: 163 + 23 = 186.

The final answer is: 186"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many blue ties John bought. Since he spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is:

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
= 2 * 5
= 10

Now, we need to find the cost of each red tie. Since the red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, the cost of each red tie is:

Cost of each red tie = Cost of each blue tie + (50% of the cost of each blue tie)
= $40 + (0.5 * $40)
= $40 + $20
= $60

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent on red ties:

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of each red tie
= 10 * $60
= $600

Finally, we can find the total amount spent on ties by adding the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties:

Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
= $200 + $600
= $800

The final answer is: $800"
"To find the number of pieces Tracy obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches and then divide it by the length of each piece.

1 foot is equal to 12 inches. So, 4 feet is equal to 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Now, we divide the total length of the wire (48 inches) by the length of each piece (6 inches):

48 ÷ 6 = 8

Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"To find the total number of units in the building, we need to multiply the number of floors by the number of units per floor. 

Number of floors: 15
Number of units per floor: 8

Total units = Number of floors * Number of units per floor
Total units = 15 * 8
Total units = 120

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we need to find 1/4 of the total units to determine the number of unoccupied units.

1/4 of the total units = (1/4) * Total units
1/4 of the total units = (1/4) * 120
1/4 of the total units = 30

The total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"To find out how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to calculate the total number of eggs produced per week and then multiply it by the price per dozen.

First, let's find out how many eggs Lloyd produces per week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily egg production by 7:

252 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 1764 eggs/week

Since Lloyd sells eggs by the dozen, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so:

1764 eggs/week / 12 eggs/dozen = 147 dozen eggs/week

Now, we multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen to find out how much Lloyd makes per week:

147 dozen eggs/week * $2/dozen = $294/week

The final answer is: $294"
"To find the total time Tom spends traveling, we first need to calculate the time he spends traveling from 1 to 4 PM. Since he travels at 10 miles per hour, we can assume he travels for 3 hours (from 1 to 4 PM is 3 hours). 

Now, let's calculate the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM. Distance = Speed * Time = 10 miles/hour * 3 hours = 30 miles.

Since he travels back at a rate of 6 mph, we can use the formula Time = Distance / Speed to find the time it takes him to get back. Time = 30 miles / 6 mph = 5 hours.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much weight the comic books weigh in total. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and Uriah removes 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Since Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds, and the comic books already weigh 7.5 pounds, the remaining weight that needs to be removed from the toys is 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound, so to find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy: 7.5 / 0.5 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total revenue for each day, we need to calculate the revenue from truck tires and car tires separately and then add them together.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires at $60 each and 4 car tires at $40 each. The total revenue from truck tires on Thursday is 6 * $60 = $360. The total revenue from car tires on Thursday is 4 * $40 = $160. The total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires at $40 each and no truck tires. The total revenue from car tires on Friday is 12 * $40 = $480. Since there were no truck tires repaired, the total revenue on Friday is $480.

To find the day with higher revenue, we compare the revenues: $520 (Thursday) and $480 (Friday). Thursday has higher revenue.

Now, to find how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we subtract the lower revenue from the higher revenue: $520 - $480 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find the total number of kittens, we first need to determine the number of kittens each cat has had. 

Patchy, the first cat, has had thrice the number of adopted kittens. Since the Doubtfire sisters adopted 7 kittens, Patchy has had 3 * 7 = 21 kittens.

Trixie, the other cat, has had 12 kittens.

Now, we add the number of adopted kittens (7) to the number of kittens each cat has had: 7 (adopted) + 21 (Patchy's kittens) + 12 (Trixie's kittens) = 40.

The Doubtfire family now has 40 kittens.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find out how many bags Jean can fill, we first need to determine the number of lollipops remaining after eating 2. 

Jean starts with 30 lollipops and eats 2, so the number of lollipops remaining is 30 - 2 = 28.

Since Jean wants to package 2 lollipops in one bag, we need to divide the number of remaining lollipops by 2 to find out how many bags can be filled.

28 / 2 = 14

The final answer is: 14"
"To find out how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to calculate how many times he can afford the total cost of a movie outing, which includes both the ticket and popcorn.

The total cost of a movie outing is $7 (ticket) + $7 (popcorn) = $14.

We know Peter has $42 for the week. To find out how many times he can go to the movies, we'll divide the total amount of money he has by the cost of a movie outing.

$42 ÷ $14 = 3

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times this week.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck, we need to first determine the remaining weight capacity of the bridge after the truck and driver are on it. 

The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. The weight limit of the bridge is 5000 pounds. 

Remaining weight capacity = 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds.

Since each box weighs 15 pounds, we can divide the remaining weight capacity by the weight of each box to find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded.

Maximum number of boxes = 1245 / 15 = 83.

The final answer is: 83"
"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to follow the order of operations. 

First, let's calculate the 25% fee on the final total of $40.00. 
25% of $40.00 is 0.25 * $40.00 = $10.00.

Now, let's add the delivery fee of $3.00 to the 25% fee of $10.00. 
$10.00 + $3.00 = $13.00.

The total extra fees are $13.00. Now, let's add the tip of $4.00 to the total extra fees.
$13.00 + $4.00 = $17.00.

Now, let's add the total extra fees of $17.00 to the original bill of $40.00.
$40.00 + $17.00 = $57.00.

The final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00.

"To find the number of good oranges, we first need to find the total number of oranges that are not good. 

There is 1 bad orange, 20% of 25 oranges are unripe, and 2 are sour. 

First, let's find the number of unripe oranges: 
20% of 25 = 0.2 * 25 = 5 oranges.

Now, let's add the number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges: 
1 (bad) + 5 (unripe) + 2 (sour) = 8 oranges.

Now, we subtract the number of oranges that are not good from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges: 
25 (total) - 8 (not good) = 17 oranges.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the total amount Janet paid, we need to calculate the cost of the material, the cost of the jeweler, and the insurance.

The cost of the material is $500.
The cost of the jeweler is $800.

Total cost so far is $500 + $800 = $1300.

Janet then pays 10% of $1300 to get it insured. To find 10% of $1300, we multiply $1300 by 0.1 (since 10% is the same as 0.1).

10% of $1300 = $1300 * 0.1 = $130

Now, we add the insurance cost to the total cost so far.

Total cost = $1300 + $130 = $1430

The final answer is: $1430"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the value of the pension after 30 years and then find 5% of that value.

Marcy works for 30 years, but she only gets the increased pension after 20 years. So, for the first 20 years, she gets the standard $50,000 annual pension. 

For the next 10 years (from year 21 to 30), she gets 5% of the value of the pension per year. 

First, let's calculate the total amount she gets for the first 20 years: 
20 years * $50,000/year = $1,000,000

Now, let's calculate the value of the pension after 20 years. Since she gets 5% of the value per year, we can use the formula for compound interest to find the value after 10 years:

A = P * (1 + r)^n
where A is the amount after n years, P is the principal amount (initial value), r is the annual interest rate (5% in this case), and n is the number of years.

However, in this case, we are looking for the value of the pension after 10 years, and we know that she gets 5% of the value per year. So, we can use the formula for the future value of an annuity:

FV = PMT * (((1 + r)^n - 1) / r)
where FV is the future value, PMT is the annual payment (5% of the pension value), r is the annual interest rate (5% in this case), and n is the number of years.

First, we need to find the value of the pension after 10 years. Let's call this value P. We know that she gets 5% of P per year, so PMT = 0.05P.

FV = 0.05P * (((1 + 0.05)^10 - 1) / 0.05)

Now, we need to find the value of P. We know that FV = P, so we can set up the equation:

P = 0.05P * (((1 + 0.05)^10 - 1) / 0.05)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

P = 0.05P * 7.379
P = 0.36895P
P ≈ 1,000,000

Now that we know the value of the pension after 20 years, we can find the annual pension for the next 10 years. We know that she gets 5% of the value per year, so the annual pension is:

Annual pension = 0.05 * 1,000,000
Annual pension = $50,000

However, this is not the correct answer. We need to find the value of the pension after 30 years, not the annual payment. We already know that the value of the pension after 20 years is $1,000,000. We need to find the value of the pension after 10 more years.

We can use the formula for compound interest again:

A = P * (1 + r)^n
A = 1,000,000 * (1 + 0.05)^10
A ≈ 1,795,794.19

Now that we have the value of the pension after 30 years, we can find the annual pension for the next 10 years. We know that she gets 5% of the value per year, so the annual pension is:

Annual pension = 0.05 * 1,795,794.19
Annual pension ≈ $89,879.71

The final answer is: $89,879.71"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the first half of the year and the second half of the year separately, and then add them together.

The streaming service charges $140 per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the first half of the year consists of 6 months. 

The total amount paid for the first half of the year is 6 * $140 = $840.

For the second half of the year, the streaming company charges 10% less than the initial amount. To find the amount charged for the second half, we need to calculate 10% of $140 and subtract it from $140.

10% of $140 = 0.1 * $140 = $14
Amount charged for the second half of the year = $140 - $14 = $126

The total amount paid for the second half of the year is 6 * $126 = $756.

Now, we add the total amount paid for the first half and the second half of the year to get the total amount paid by the end of the year.

Total amount paid = $840 + $756 = $1596

The final answer is: $1596"
"To determine how far Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to find out how many miles she can drive per gallon. We know that she has traveled 100 miles since her last fill-up and that it took 4 gallons to fill up her tank again. 

First, let's find out how many miles she can drive per gallon. We can do this by dividing the total distance she has traveled (100 miles) by the amount of gas she used (4 gallons). 

100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon

Now that we know she can drive 25 miles per gallon, we can find out how many miles she can drive on a full tank. We know her tank holds 12 gallons. 

25 miles per gallon * 12 gallons = 300 miles

So, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas.

"To find the total time spent on TV and reading, we need to calculate the time spent each day and then multiply it by the number of days in 4 weeks.

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV. He then reads for half as long, which is 2 / 2 = 1 hour.

So, the total time spent on TV and reading each day is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total time spent on TV and reading in a week is 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

In 4 weeks, the total time spent on TV and reading is 9 * 4 = 36 hours.

"To find the total number of gems, we need to calculate the number of each type of gem and add them together.

First, we know there are 175 diamonds. 

Next, we are told there are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds. So, the number of rubies is 175 - 35 = 140.

Then, we are told there are twice the number of emeralds as rubies. So, the number of emeralds is 2 * 140 = 280.

Now, we add the number of each type of gem together: 175 (diamonds) + 140 (rubies) + 280 (emeralds) = 595.

The final answer is: 595"
"To find the number of boys, we know there are twice as many boys as girls. Since there are 60 girls, the number of boys is 2 * 60 = 120.

The total number of students is the sum of boys and girls, which is 60 + 120 = 180.

Since there are 5 students to every teacher, we can find the number of teachers by dividing the total number of students by 5. 

Number of teachers = Total number of students / 5
= 180 / 5
= 36

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much money Bailey received in total from her weekly allowance and then subtract that from the total amount she has at the end of 8 weeks.

Bailey receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks. So, the total amount she receives from her allowance is:
$5/week * 8 weeks = $40

Since Bailey has a total of $100 at the end of 8 weeks, and she received $40 from her allowance, we can subtract the allowance from the total amount to find out how much she started with:
$100 - $40 = $60

So, Bailey started with $60.

"To find the total number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total number of cups of dog food the puppy will eat in the first year and then divide it by the number of cups in a bag.

First, let's calculate the number of cups the puppy will eat in the first 180 days. Since the puppy eats 1 cup of dog food every day for 180 days, the total number of cups is:
1 cup/day * 180 days = 180 cups

Next, let's calculate the number of cups the puppy will eat for the rest of its life. Since the puppy eats 2 cups of dog food every day, we need to find the number of days in a year. There are 365 days in a year. However, we don't know the puppy's lifespan, so we'll assume it lives for at least a year. The number of cups the puppy will eat for the rest of its life is:
2 cups/day * 365 days = 730 cups

Now, let's add the number of cups the puppy will eat in the first 180 days and the number of cups it will eat for the rest of its life:
180 cups + 730 cups = 910 cups

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, we can divide the total number of cups by the number of cups in a bag to find the total number of bags:
910 cups / 110 cups/bag = 8.27 bags

Since we can't buy a fraction of a bag, we'll round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we are looking for the total number of bags used in the first year, so we will round down to the nearest whole number.

Since Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, and she does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can find out how much laundry David does by dividing 400 by 4.

David's laundry = 400 / 4 = 100 pounds

Since Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, we can find out how much laundry Raymond does by dividing 400 by 2.

Raymond's laundry = 400 / 2 = 200 pounds

Now, we need to find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do.

Difference = Raymond's laundry - David's laundry

"To find the better price, we need to calculate the cost per flower for each package option.

For the package of 3 flowers for $2.50, the cost per flower is $2.50 / 3 = $0.8333 per flower.

For the package of 2 flowers for $1, the cost per flower is $1 / 2 = $0.5 per flower.

Since $0.5 per flower is less than $0.8333 per flower, the package of 2 flowers for $1 is the better option.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price. 18 flowers / 2 flowers per package = 9 packages. The total cost is 9 packages * $1 per package = $9.

To find the cost of buying 18 flowers at the more expensive option, we calculate 18 flowers / 3 flowers per package = 6 packages. The total cost is 6 packages * $2.50 per package = $15.

The amount of money saved by buying 18 flowers at the better price is $15 - $9 = $6.

"To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let's represent the number of games the team lost as 'x'. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games they won can be represented as 'x + 8'.

We know that the total number of games played is 22, which is the sum of the games won and lost. So, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:

2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 7

Since x represents the number of games lost, the number of games won is x + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15.

Initially, Sylvie's salary is $600. 

After 5 years, her salary is increased by 10% of $600 for each year. 
Year 1: $600 * 0.10 = $60, $600 + $60 = $660
Year 2: $660 * 0.10 = $66, $660 + $66 = $726
Year 3: $726 * 0.10 = $72.60, $726 + $72.60 = $798.60
Year 4: $798.60 * 0.10 = $79.86, $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46
Year 5: $878.46 * 0.10 = $87.85, $878.46 + $87.85 = $966.31

Now, for the next three years, her salary will continue to increase by 10% of the current salary.

Year 6: $966.31 * 0.10 = $96.63, $966.31 + $96.63 = $1062.94

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as 'H' and the number of copies Marilyn sold as 'M'. We know that M = 10H, since Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's.

We also know that the total number of copies sold is 88,000, so we can write the equation: M + H = 88,000.

Substituting M = 10H into the equation, we get 10H + H = 88,000, which simplifies to 11H = 88,000.

To find the value of H, we divide both sides of the equation by 11: H = 88,000 / 11.

"To find out how many gift bags Christina needs, we first need to calculate the number of guests she expects to attend. Since 1/4 of the invited guests don't show up, we can find the number of expected attendees by subtracting 1/4 from the total number of invited guests.

16 (invited guests) - (1/4 * 16) = 16 - 4 = 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we multiply the number of expected attendees by 0.75.

12 (expected attendees) * 0.75 = 9

So, Christina needs 9 gift bags. Each gift bag costs $2, so we multiply the number of gift bags by the cost per bag.

9 (gift bags) * $2 = $18

Therefore, Christina will spend $18 on gift bags.

The final answer is: $18"
"To determine the total amount of potato salad needed, we need to calculate the amount eaten by adults and children separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the amount eaten by adults: 20 adults * 10 lbs/adult = 200 lbs

Next, let's calculate the amount eaten by children: 5 children * (10 lbs/adult / 2) = 5 children * 5 lbs/child = 25 lbs

Now, let's add the amounts eaten by adults and children together: 200 lbs + 25 lbs = 225 lbs

Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic to have enough for everyone."
"Let's break down the information given in the problem.

We know that Cindy has 4 pets. Since Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.

We also know that Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia. Since Marcia has 6 pets, Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets.

To find the total number of pets the three have, we need to add the number of pets each one has: 4 (Cindy) + 6 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan) = 28.

The final answer is: 28"
"To find Jackson's age, we need to determine Corey's age first. Since James is 10 and 1 year younger than Corey, Corey must be 10 + 1 = 11 years old.

Now, we know Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

Since Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, Jackson must be 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it takes Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles before his diet change. Since Lee runs 2 seconds faster than Gerald, we can set up an equation:

Time it takes Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles = Time it takes Lee to run the 400-meter hurdles + 2 seconds

We know that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds. So, we can substitute this value into the equation:

Time it takes Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles = 38 + 2
Time it takes Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles = 40 seconds

Now, we know that Gerald's diet improved his speed by 10%. To find out how much time he will save, we need to calculate 10% of 40 seconds:

10% of 40 seconds = 0.1 * 40 = 4 seconds

Since Gerald's speed improved by 10%, he will save 4 seconds from his original time. To find out his new time, we subtract 4 seconds from his original time:

New time it takes Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles = Original time - Time saved
New time it takes Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles = 40 - 4
New time it takes Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles = 36 seconds

The final answer is: 36"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of cats, then the number of rabbits, and finally add them up with the number of dogs to get the total number of pets.

Given that there are two cats for every dog, and the number of dogs is 60, we can find the number of cats by multiplying the number of dogs by 2.

Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
= 2 * 60
= 120

Now, we know that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. We can find the combined number of dogs and cats by adding the number of dogs and cats.

Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
= 60 + 120
= 180

Now, we can find the number of rabbits by subtracting 12 from the combined number of dogs and cats.

Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
= 180 - 12
= 168

Finally, we can find the total number of pets in the neighborhood by adding the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits.

Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
= 60 + 120 + 168
= 348

The final answer is: 348"
"To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we first need to find the total number of girls and then subtract the number of girls in the girl scout.

First, let's find the number of boys and girls. We know that 2/5 of the students are boys. 

Number of boys = (2/5) * 200 = 80

Since there are 200 students in total, the number of girls can be found by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students.

Number of girls = 200 - 80 = 120

Now, we know that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. 

Number of girls in the girl scout = (2/3) * 120 = 80

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls.

Number of girls not in the girl scout = 120 - 80 = 40

The final answer is: 40"
"To find out how many hours James slept, we need to calculate 2/3 of the hours Harry slept. 

Harry slept 9 hours, so 2/3 of 9 is (2/3) * 9 = 6 hours. 

Since James slept 2/3 of what Harry slept, James slept 6 hours. 

To find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we need to subtract the hours James slept from the hours Harry slept: 9 - 6 = 3.

The final answer is: 3"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many 16-ounce cans of tomatoes Freda used to make 32 ounces of sauce. Since the sauce is made from the tomatoes in the cans, and each can contains 16 ounces of tomatoes, we can set up a proportion to find the number of cans used.

Let's say the number of cans used is x. Since the sauce is half the volume of the tomatoes, the total volume of the tomatoes used is 2 times the volume of the sauce, which is 2 * 32 = 64 ounces.

Since each can contains 16 ounces of tomatoes, the total number of cans used is 64 / 16 = 4 cans.

Now, we know that each can contains 3 tomatoes, so the total number of tomatoes used is 4 cans * 3 tomatoes/can = 12 tomatoes.

The final answer is: 12"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes. 

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as 'x'. Since 5 cars took an exit, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is x + 20 (the 20 cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes). 

We know that the total number of cars originally on the motorway was 30, and 5 cars took an exit. So, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 30 - 5 = 25.

Now, we can set up an equation: x + 20 = 25. Solving for x, we get x = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many potted plants Mary will have left, we first need to determine the total number of potted plants she has initially. She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, so the total number of potted plants she has is 2 * 40 = 80.

Yesterday, she received 18 new potted plants, so the total number of potted plants she has now is 80 + 18 = 98.

Tomorrow, she will give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to her friends and family, so she will give away 40 potted plants.

To find out how many potted plants she will have left, we subtract the number of potted plants she gives away from the total number of potted plants she has: 98 - 40 = 58.

The final answer is: 58"
"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell and add them up.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. Since 1/4 of 20 is 5, the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. We are given that the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times, so the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

Now, we add up the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell: 20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 155.

The total number of doorbell rings is 155.

The final answer is: 155"
"To find out how many pages Solo needs to read in total, we need to add up the pages from all his textbooks. 

4 pages (Science) + 20 pages (Social Studies) + 7 pages (History) + 8 pages (Geography) = 39 pages

Since Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday, we need to subtract those from the total to find out how many pages are left to read.

39 pages - 15 pages = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read on average per day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days.

24 pages / 4 days = 6 pages per day

"To find out how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to calculate the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends separately, and then add them together.

On weekdays, John drinks a glass of water with each meal, which includes breakfast, lunch, and dinner. So, that's 3 glasses per day. Since there are 5 weekdays, he drinks 3 * 5 = 15 glasses of water on weekdays.

On weekends, John drinks a glass of water with breakfast and lunch, but not with dinner, as he prefers soda with dinner. So, that's 2 glasses per day. Since there are 2 weekend days, he drinks 2 * 2 = 4 glasses of water on weekends.

Now, let's add the glasses of water John drinks on weekdays and weekends: 15 (weekdays) + 4 (weekends) = 19 glasses of water.

"To find out how many minutes it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to determine how many 3-mile sections the city is divided into and then multiply that by the time it takes to cover each section.

The city is 42 miles across, and the fog bank covers 3 miles every 10 minutes. 

To find the number of 3-mile sections, we divide the total distance by the length of each section: 42 miles / 3 miles per section = 14 sections.

Now, we multiply the number of sections by the time it takes to cover each section: 14 sections * 10 minutes per section = 140 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many pieces Poppy and her mom have placed, and then subtract that from the total number of pieces.

Poppy places a quarter of the 1000 pieces, which is 1000 * 1/4 = 250 pieces.

Now, there are 1000 - 250 = 750 pieces left. Her mom places a third of the remaining pieces, which is 750 * 1/3 = 250 pieces.

So, in total, 250 (Poppy's pieces) + 250 (mom's pieces) = 500 pieces have been placed.

To find out how many pieces are left, we subtract the total placed pieces from the original 1000: 1000 - 500 = 500.

"To find out how many cookies Cody eats, we need to multiply the number of cookies Amir eats by 3. 

Amir eats 5 cookies, so Cody eats 5 * 3 = 15 cookies.

Now, to find the total number of cookies they eat together, we need to add the number of cookies Amir eats to the number of cookies Cody eats.

Total cookies = Amir's cookies + Cody's cookies
Total cookies = 5 + 15
Total cookies = 20

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to find the inner volume of one box and then multiply it by 3.

The outer dimensions of the box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches, but the walls are 1 inch thick. So, the inner dimensions will be (5-2) inches by (6-2) inches by (4-2) inches, which is 3 inches by 4 inches by 2 inches.

The formula to find the volume of a rectangular prism is length * width * height. 

So, the inner volume of one box is 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches.

Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume is 3 * 24 = 72 cubic inches.

The final answer is: 72"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 2 episodes of a 1-hour show, which is a total of 2 * 1 = 2 hours.

On Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. Let's call the number of episodes 'x'. Since each episode is 30 minutes, the total time he watched on Wednesday is 30x minutes.

On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, which is a total of 1.5 hours.

On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, which is a total of 2 hours.

The total time Frankie watched TV is 7 hours. We can set up an equation to represent this:

2 (Monday and Tuesday) + 30x (Wednesday) + 1.5 (Thursday) + 2 (Friday) = 7

Combine like terms:
2 + 30x + 1.5 + 2 = 7

Combine the constants:
5.5 + 30x = 7

Subtract 5.5 from both sides:
30x = 1.5

Divide both sides by 30:
x = 0.05

Since x represents the number of episodes, and each episode is 30 minutes, we need to convert the number of episodes to hours to find the total time. However, the question asks for the number of 30-minute episodes, so we can leave the answer as is.

The final answer is: 0.05"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as 'x'. Since Henry wants to make twice as many cookies this year, he plans to bake 2x cookies.

However, he actually baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the total number of cookies he baked is 2x + 15.

After dropping 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies left. This can be represented by the equation: 2x + 15 - 5 = 110.

Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 10 = 110.

Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation, we get 2x = 100.

Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get x = 50.

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To find the total cost of gas after the cashback rewards, we need to first calculate the total cost of gas without the rewards, and then subtract the cashback amount.

The cost of gas without rewards is the price per gallon multiplied by the number of gallons:
$3.00 per gallon * 10 gallons = $30.00

The cashback reward is $0.20 per gallon, so for 10 gallons, it would be:
$0.20 per gallon * 10 gallons = $2.00

Now, we subtract the cashback reward from the total cost of gas:
$30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

The final cost of gas after the cashback rewards is $28.00."
"To find the total number of fruit roll-ups eaten by each person, we need to multiply the width by the length of each roll-up. 

Beatrice's roll-up is 2 roll-ups wide and 24 rolls long, so the total number of roll-ups she ate is 2 * 24 = 48.

Marcell's roll-up is 3 roll-ups wide and 14 rolls long, so the total number of roll-ups he ate is 3 * 14 = 42.

To find the average number of roll-ups eaten by each person, we need to add the total number of roll-ups eaten by each person and divide by 2. 

Total roll-ups eaten = 48 + 42 = 90
Average roll-ups eaten = 90 / 2 = 45

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many sets of 10 feet Julia rows in 64 seconds, and then multiply that by the amount of water taken on per set.

First, let's find out how many seconds it takes Julia to row 10 feet. We know it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, so we can divide 16 by 2 to get the time it takes to row 10 feet.

16 seconds / 2 = 8 seconds per 10 feet

Now, let's find out how many sets of 10 feet Julia rows in 64 seconds. We can divide 64 by 8 to get the number of sets.

64 seconds / 8 seconds per 10 feet = 8 sets of 10 feet

Since it takes 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, and Julia rows 8 sets of 10 feet, we can multiply the number of sets by the amount of water taken on per set.

8 sets * 2 liters per set = 16 liters

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how many photographs Brittany's phone can hold. We know Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs and it's 6 times more than Brittany's phone. 

Let's denote the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold as B. Then, we have the equation: 6B = 1800. 

To find B, we divide both sides by 6: B = 1800 / 6 = 300.

Now, we know Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs. The problem states that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. 

Let's denote the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as D. Then, we have the equation: 300 = 50D.

To find D, we divide both sides by 50: D = 300 / 50 = 6.

"To calculate Sasha's profit, we need to first find the total cost of the lumber and the total selling price. 

The total cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $10 = $100. 
The total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $16 = $80. 
The total cost of all the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since prices have gone up by 50%, the new price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each. 
The new price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 each.

The total selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $15 = $150. 
The total selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $24 = $120. 
The total selling price of all the lumber is $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit is the total selling price minus the total cost, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To solve this problem, we need to use the given ratio of sugar to water, which is 7:13. This means that for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, Katy uses 13 cups of water. 

We can represent the total number of parts in the ratio as 7 + 13 = 20. Since Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and water, we can set up a proportion to find the number of teaspoons of sugar she used.

Let x be the number of teaspoons of sugar. Then, the number of cups of water is 13x/7. The total number of teaspoons of sugar and water is 7x + 13x/7 = 120.

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 7 to get rid of the fraction: 7(7x + 13x/7) = 7(120).
This simplifies to 49x + 13x = 840.
Combine like terms: 62x = 840.
Divide both sides by 62: x = 840/62.
x = 13.55 (round to two decimal places).

However, since the number of teaspoons of sugar must be a whole number, we can round down to the nearest whole number.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find Lylah's salary four years ago. 

Let's assume Lylah's salary four years ago was 'x'. Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can express Adrien's salary as 1.3x. We are given that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000, so we can set up the equation:

1.3x = 40000

To find 'x', we can divide both sides by 1.3:

x = 40000 / 1.3
x = 30769.23

So, Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30769.23.

Now, we need to find Adrien's salary four years later. We are given that his salary increased by 40% of his original salary. We can express this as:

New salary = Original salary + (40% of Original salary)
= 40000 + (0.4 * 40000)
= 40000 + 16000
= 56000

Now, we need to find Lylah's salary four years later. Since their salaries increased simultaneously, we can assume the percentage increase for Lylah is the same as Adrien's, which is 40%. We can express Lylah's new salary as:

New salary = Original salary + (40% of Original salary)
= 30769.23 + (0.4 * 30769.23)
= 30769.23 + 12307.69
= 43076.92

Now, we can find the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later by adding their new salaries:

Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary
= 56000 + 43076.92
= 99076.92

Kael brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette, so Kael brought 2 * 5 = 10 apples. 
Kael brought half the number of oranges as Morisette, so Kael brought 8 / 2 = 4 oranges.

Now, we can find the total number of fruits each person brought: 
Morisette brought 5 + 8 = 13 fruits.
Kael brought 10 + 4 = 14 fruits.

To find the total number of fruits, we add the number of fruits each person brought: 
13 (Morisette's fruits) + 14 (Kael's fruits) = 27.

"To find the total hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we need to calculate the hours she slept each day and add them up.

On Monday, Sadie slept 8 hours.

For the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday), she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours each day.

The rest of the week (Thursday to Sunday) she slept 1 hour more than those two days, so she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours each day.

Now, let's calculate the total hours for each part of the week:

- Monday: 8 hours

"To find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour and the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour.

First, let's calculate the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours. 

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, let's calculate the remaining time after 3 hours. 
Total time = 7 hours
Time already run = 3 hours
Remaining time = Total time - Time already run
Remaining time = 7 hours - 3 hours
Remaining time = 4 hours

Now, let's calculate the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour for the remaining 4 hours.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour * 4 hours
Distance = 20 miles

Now, let's add the distances from both parts to find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours.

Total distance = Distance at 10 mph + Distance at 5 mph
Total distance = 30 miles + 20 miles
Total distance = 50 miles

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many letters Jennie stamped and then subtract that from the total number of letters that were already stamped when she began.

We know that Jennie put stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps. Since there are 60 letters needing stamps, one-third of that is 60 / 3 = 20 letters.

We also know that after Jennie stamped 20 letters, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. This means that the 20 letters Jennie stamped were added to the pile of already-stamped letters.

So, to find out how many letters were in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began, we need to subtract the 20 letters Jennie stamped from the current number of letters in the pile (30). 

30 - 20 = 10

Therefore, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.

First, let's find the number of fish sausages. Since Dylan bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, and he bought 38 chicken sausages, the number of fish sausages is 38 + 6 = 44.

Now, let's add the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages to find the total number of sausages: 38 (chicken sausages) + 44 (fish sausages) = 82.

The final answer is: 82"
"To find the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together, we first need to determine the number of friends Amy has. Since Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, and Lily has 50 friends, we can calculate Amy's friends by adding 20 to Lily's total.

Amy's friends = Lily's friends + 20
Amy's friends = 50 + 20
Amy's friends = 70

Now, to find the total number of friends they have together, we add the number of friends Lily and Amy have.

Total friends = Lily's friends + Amy's friends
Total friends = 50 + 70
Total friends = 120

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to determine the cost of each item and then multiply it by the quantity.

First, let's find the cost of a watermelon. Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, and each pepper costs $15, the cost of a watermelon is 3 * $15 = $45.

Next, we find the cost of an orange. An orange costs 5 dollars less than a watermelon, so the cost of an orange is $45 - $5 = $40.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of each item:

- 4 watermelons: 4 * $45 = $180
- 20 peppers: 20 * $15 = $300
- 10 oranges: 10 * $40 = $400

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is the sum of the costs of all items: $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

The final answer is: $880"
"To calculate the hospital's profit, we need to first determine the total time spent by doctors and the total amount charged to patients.

The hospital sees 500 people a day, and each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes. To find the total time spent by doctors, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. 

24 minutes is 24/60 = 0.4 hours per patient.

The total time spent by doctors is 500 patients * 0.4 hours/patient = 200 hours.

The doctors charge $150 an hour, so the total amount charged by doctors to the hospital is 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000.

The hospital charges the patients $200 an hour, and the total time spent by patients is 500 patients * 0.4 hours/patient = 200 hours.

The total amount charged to patients is 200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000.

The hospital's profit is the difference between the amount charged to patients and the amount charged by doctors, which is $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.

The final numerical answer is: $10,000"
"To find the number of elves left, we first need to determine the number of elves that quit after the children vomit on them. Since a third of the elves quit, we can calculate this as follows:

60 (initial elves) * 1/3 = 20 elves quit after being vomited on

Now, we subtract the elves that quit from the initial number to find the remaining elves:

60 - 20 = 40 elves remaining

Then, 10 more elves quit after being kicked by the kids. We subtract these from the remaining elves:

40 - 10 = 30 elves left

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total expenditure for the two months, we need to add the expenditure in May and June. 

The expenditure in May was $500. 
The expenditure in June was $60 less than May, so it is $500 - $60 = $440.

Now, let's add the expenditures for the two months: $500 + $440 = $940.

The final answer is: $940"
"To find the total number of tickets used, we need to calculate the total number of rides taken by Pam and Fred and then multiply it by the cost of each ride.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, so she took a total of 2 + 2 = 4 rides.
Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, so he took a total of 4 + 2 = 6 rides.

The total number of rides taken by both Pam and Fred is 4 + 6 = 10 rides.

Since each ride costs 6 tickets, the total number of tickets used is 10 * 6 = 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we need to first determine how many miles he walked on Tuesday. 

Since Walt walked 6 times as many miles on Tuesday as he did on Monday, and he walked 4 miles on Monday, we can calculate the miles walked on Tuesday by multiplying the miles walked on Monday by 6. 

Miles walked on Tuesday = 4 * 6 = 24 miles.

Now, we know that the total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. We already know the miles walked on Monday (4 miles) and Tuesday (24 miles). To find the miles walked on Wednesday, we subtract the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage.

Miles walked on Wednesday = Total mileage - (Miles walked on Monday + Miles walked on Tuesday)
= 41 - (4 + 24)
= 41 - 28
= 13 miles.

"To find out how many video games Bobby has, we first need to determine how many video games Brian has after losing 5. 

Brian initially had 20 video games but lost 5, so he has 20 - 5 = 15 video games.

Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian. To find out how many video games Bobby has, we multiply the number of video games Brian has by 3 and then subtract 5.

3 times the number of video games Brian has is 3 * 15 = 45.

5 fewer than 45 is 45 - 5 = 40.

Bobby has 40 video games.

"To find the number of female Scottish unicorns, we first need to find the total number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands. Since one third of the 27 unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands = 27 * (1/3)
= 27 * 1/3
= 9

Now, we know that two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female. So, we can calculate the number of female Scottish unicorns as follows:

Number of female Scottish unicorns = 9 * (2/3)
= 9 * 2/3
= 6

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total cost of Rory's delivery order, we need to calculate the cost of the items, add the delivery fee, and then add the tip.

First, let's calculate the cost of the items:
- 2 subs for $7.50 each: 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
- 2 bags of chips for $1.50 each: 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
- 2 cookies for $1.00 each: 2 x $1.00 = $2.00
Total cost of items: $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

Next, let's calculate the delivery fee: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 x $20.00 = $4.00

Now, let's add the delivery fee to the total cost of the items: $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Finally, let's add the $5.00 tip: $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

"To find out how many questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate the total number of questions he was able to complete in each test and then subtract that from the total number of questions in each test.

For the first test, Mark had 8 hours to complete 75 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour. 

First, let's find out how many questions Mark completed in 8 hours: 
8 hours * 5 questions per hour = 40 questions

Since Mark completed 40 questions in 8 hours, he left 75 - 40 = 35 questions incomplete in the first test.

For the second test, Mark had 6 hours to complete 100 questions at the same rate of 5 questions per hour.

Now, let's find out how many questions Mark completed in 6 hours: 
6 hours * 5 questions per hour = 30 questions

Since Mark completed 30 questions in 6 hours, he left 100 - 30 = 70 questions incomplete in the second test.

To find the total number of questions Mark left incomplete, we add the incomplete questions from both tests: 
35 (incomplete in the first test) + 70 (incomplete in the second test) = 105

"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine the total number of semi-automatic cars. We know that there are 20 cars in total, with 12 being automatic and 4 being manual. 

Total number of cars = 20
Automatic cars = 12
Manual cars = 4

To find the number of semi-automatic cars, we subtract the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars:
Semi-automatic cars = Total number of cars - (Automatic cars + Manual cars)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16
Semi-automatic cars = 4

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100:
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 0.2 * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 20%

"To solve this problem, we can start by representing the number of baby bees as 'x'. Since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, the number of worker bees is 2x. 

We also know that there are twice as many babies as queens, so the number of queens is x/2. 

The total number of bees in the hive is 700, which is the sum of worker bees, baby bees, and queens. We can write this as an equation:

x + 2x + x/2 = 700

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + 4x + x = 1400

Combine like terms:

7x = 1400

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 200

Now that we know the number of baby bees, we can find the number of worker bees, which is 2x:

Worker bees = 2 * 200 = 400

The final answer is: 400"
"To find out how much money Jordan would earn in one week, we need to calculate the total hours he would work in a week and then multiply it by his hourly wage.

Since Jordan plays video games for 2 hours a day, if he spent that time working instead, he would work 2 hours a day. 

There are 7 days in a week, so the total hours he would work in a week is 2 hours/day * 7 days/week = 14 hours/week.

Jordan earns $10 an hour, so his weekly earnings would be 14 hours/week * $10/hour = $140/week.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of food items and non-food items separately and then add them together.

The food items are milk and eggs, which cost 2 dollars and 3 dollars respectively. So, the total cost of food items is 2 + 3 = 5 dollars.

The non-food items are light bulbs, cups, and roach traps, which cost 3 dollars, 3 dollars, and 4 dollars respectively. However, there is a 10% tax on these items. To find the total cost of non-food items, we need to calculate the tax first.

The total cost of non-food items before tax is 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars. The tax is 10% of 10 dollars, which is 0.1 * 10 = 1 dollar. So, the total cost of non-food items after tax is 10 + 1 = 11 dollars.

Now, we can find the total cost by adding the cost of food items and non-food items: 5 + 11 = 16 dollars.

The final answer is: 16"
"To calculate the total profit, we first need to determine the total income and total expenses. 

Kim has 3 current clients and 5 potential clients, making a total of 8 clients. Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. 

Total bottles of bleach needed per week: 8 clients * 2 bottles/client = 16 bottles
Total packs of cloths needed per week: 8 clients * 1 pack/client = 8 packs

The cost of bleach per week: 16 bottles * $2/bottle = $32
The cost of cloths per week: 8 packs * $5/pack = $40

Total expenses per week: $32 (bleach) + $40 (cloths) = $72

Since Kim's total income per week is $92, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total expenses from the total income.

Profit per week = Total income - Total expenses
Profit per week = $92 - $72
Profit per week = $20

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of the bees that left return, which is 1/2 * 30 = 15 bees.
   So, the total number of bees that have left and returned so far is 30 (left) - 15 (returned) = 15 bees that haven't returned yet.
3. In the next 6 hours, two times as many bees as the initial 30 leave the hive, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.
   So, the total number of bees that have left is now 30 + 60 = 90 bees.
4. The number of bees that haven't returned yet is 15 (from step 2).
5. In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive, which is 15 bees.

So, the number of bees that return to the hive in the last 6 hours is 15."
"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to determine the total cost of the tickets and then add the change she received.

The cost of the child ticket is $10, and the cost of the adult ticket is $12. 

Total cost = cost of child ticket + cost of adult ticket
Total cost = $10 + $12
Total cost = $22

Since Brittany's mom received $8 in change, we need to add this to the total cost to find out how much she gave the cashier.

Total given = Total cost + Change

"To determine the time it takes for each person to get home, we need to calculate the distance in feet and then divide it by their respective speeds.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15,840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10,560 feet

Now, let's calculate the time it takes for each person to get home:

Steve's time: 15,840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: 10,560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 36 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve will be the winner. To find out how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to subtract the winner's time from the loser's time.

Waiting time = Tim's time - Steve's time = 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

1. Dave ate 14 french fries initially.
2. The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 french fries.
   Now, the total amount eaten by Dave and the seagull is 14 + 7 = 21 french fries.
3. Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate a total of 3 * 3 = 9 french fries.
   Now, the total amount eaten is 21 + 9 = 30 french fries.
4. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries. Let's denote the initial number of fries as x. 
   After the seagull and pigeons ate, there were x - 30 fries left. 
   The raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries, which is (2/3)(x - 30).
   The remaining fries after the raccoon ate are (1/3)(x - 30).
5. Ants carried off a final french fry, leaving 5 behind. 
   So, (1/3)(x - 30) - 1 = 5.

"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the length of each type of baked good in feet and then add them together.

First, let's convert the length of each type of baked good from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

- Each roll is 4 inches long, which is 4/12 = 1/3 feet long.
- Each croissant is 6 inches long, which is 6/12 = 0.5 feet long.
- Each baguette is 2 feet long.

Now, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good:

- Rolls: 300 rolls * 1/3 feet per roll = 300 * 1/3 = 100 feet
- Croissants: 120 croissants * 0.5 feet per croissant = 60 feet
- Baguettes: 60 baguettes * 2 feet per baguette = 120 feet

Now, let's add the lengths together to find the total length of the baked goods:

"To find out who the winner is, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Since he's running back and forth, the total distance he covers is 2 times the length of the field for each run. So, the total distance Blake ran is 15 * 2 * 100 = 3000 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 2 * 100 = 200 yards. Then, she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 2 * 40 = 80 yards. She does this 34 times, so the total distance she covers is 34 * 80 = 2720 yards. 

To find the total distance Kelly ran, we add the initial 200 yards to the distance she ran to the 40-yard line and back: 2720 + 200 = 2920 yards.

Now, we compare the distances: Blake ran 3000 yards, and Kelly ran 2920 yards. Blake is the winner.

To find out how much farther the winner ran than the loser, we subtract the loser's distance from the winner's distance: 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. 

Total fish caught by Anakin = 10 + 6 + 3 = 19

Now, let's find the number of fish caught by Locsin. Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so he caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish. Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so he caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses. Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so he caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Total fish caught by Locsin = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

Now, let's find the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin. 

Total fish caught = Total fish caught by Anakin + Total fish caught by Locsin
Total fish caught = 19 + 13

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the price increase every two months and add it to the original price. 

The original price of the bag of marbles is $20. 

After 2 months, the price increases by 20% of $20, which is 0.20 * $20 = $4. 
So, the price after 2 months is $20 + $4 = $24.

After 4 months, the price increases by 20% of $24, which is 0.20 * $24 = $4.80. 
So, the price after 4 months is $24 + $4.80 = $28.80.

After 6 months, the price increases by 20% of $28.80, which is 0.20 * $28.80 = $5.76. 
So, the price after 6 months is $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56.

After 8 months, the price increases by 20% of $34.56, which is 0.20 * $34.56 = $6.912. 
So, the price after 8 months is $34.56 + $6.912 = $41.472.

After 10 months, the price increases by 20% of $41.472, which is 0.20 * $41.472 = $8.2944. 
So, the price after 10 months is $41.472 + $8.2944 = $49.7664.

After 12 months, the price increases by 20% of $49.7664, which is 0.20 * $49.7664 = $9.95328. 
So, the price after 12 months is $49.7664 + $9.95328 = $59.71968.

"To find the total worth of all the toys, we need to calculate the cost of each type of toy and then add them together.

The doll costs as much as 3 action figures. Since an action figure costs $5, the doll costs 3 * $5 = $15.

One red car costs $4. Since there are 5 red cars, the total cost of the red cars is 5 * $4 = $20.

The action figures cost $5 each, and there are 3 of them, so the total cost of the action figures is 3 * $5 = $15.

Now, let's add the cost of the doll, the red cars, and the action figures together: $15 (doll) + $20 (red cars) + $15 (action figures) = $50.

The total worth of all the toys is $50.

The final answer is: $50"
"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the difference in income between hiring the accountant and doing the taxes herself.

If Jackie does the taxes herself, she'll lose $35/hour in missed income for 3 hours of freelance work. So, the total income lost is $35/hour * 3 hours = $105.

The cost of hiring the accountant is $90.

Now, let's calculate the difference in income: 
Income from doing taxes herself - Income from hiring the accountant = $105 - $90 = $15

So, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

The final answer is: $15"
"To find out how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the computer accessories and subtract that from her budget.

The total cost of the computer accessories is:
- Computer: €1090
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Total cost = €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102 = €1323

Now, we subtract the total cost from Elvira's budget:
€1500 (budget) - €1323 (total cost) = €177

So, Elvira will have €177 left for her clothing.

The final answer is: €177"
"To determine how many times Sandra has to babysit, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she needs for the Spanish flans and divide that by the number of eggs she receives per babysitting job.

First, let's calculate the total number of eggs needed for 15 Spanish flans. Since each flan requires 3 eggs, we multiply 15 by 3:

15 flans * 3 eggs/flan = 45 eggs

Now, we need to divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs Sandra receives per babysitting job, which is 9:

45 eggs / 9 eggs/babysitting job = 5

So, Sandra has to babysit 5 times to get enough eggs for 15 Spanish flans.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's denote Brooke's current age as B and Seth's current age as S. We are given that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write an equation:

S = 2B

We are also given that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. This means that in 2 years, Seth's age will be S + 2 and Brooke's age will be B + 2. The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write another equation:

S + 2 + B + 2 = 28

Combine like terms:

S + B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

S + B = 24

Now we can substitute the first equation (S = 2B) into this equation:

2B + B = 24

Combine like terms:

3B = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B into the first equation (S = 2B):

S = 2(8)
S = 16

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much money Jimmy has, we need to first determine what ""twice the money Ethel has"" is. Since Ethel has $8, twice that amount would be 2 * 8 = 16.

Now, we know Jimmy has $2 more than that, so we add 2 to 16. 16 + 2 = 18.

Jimmy has $18.

The final answer is: $18"
"To find out how many miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to calculate the total miles he walks in a week. 

There are 7 days in a week. Pancho walks 20 miles a day from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days. So, the total miles he walks from Monday to Friday is 20 * 5 = 100 miles.

On Saturday and Sunday, he walks 10 miles each day. So, the total miles he walks on weekends is 10 * 2 = 20 miles.

Now, we add the miles walked during the weekdays and weekends to get the total miles walked in a week. Total miles = 100 + 20 = 120 miles.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of the hat, jacket, and pants separately and then add them together.

The hat costs $25.

The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so the jacket costs 3 * $25 = $75.

The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. To find the average, we add the costs of the hat and jacket and divide by 2. The average cost is ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50.

Now, we add the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants together to find the total cost of each uniform: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red.
2. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four.
3. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, and Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.

From point 3, we know Sally Four is 8 years old. 

From point 2, we can deduce that Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

From point 1, we can calculate Sally Two's age as 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we have the ages of three birds: Sally Four (8), Granny Red (16), and Sally Two (19). 

The only bird left is Sally, but we don't have any information about Sally's age. However, since the question asks for the total age of the four birds, we can assume that Sally is also a distinct individual, not one of the previously mentioned Sallys. 

So, the total age of the four birds is 8 + 16 + 19 + Sally's age. Since we don't know Sally's age, we can represent the total age as 43 + Sally's age.

However, since the question asks for a numerical answer, we need to provide a specific number. Since we don't have enough information about Sally's age, we can't provide a specific numerical answer. But, if we assume Sally is also 8 years old (like Sally Four), the total age would be 43 + 8 = 51.

The final answer is: 51"
"To find out how much Jessica pays in a year, we first need to calculate the increased minimum payments for each debt. 

The minimum payment for the student loans is $300, so 50% more than that would be 1.5 * $300 = $450. 

The minimum payment for the credit card is $200, so 50% more than that would be 1.5 * $200 = $300. 

The minimum payment for the mortgage is $500, so 50% more than that would be 1.5 * $500 = $750.

Now, we add up the increased minimum payments for each debt: $450 + $300 + $750 = $1500.

To find out how much Jessica pays in a year, we multiply the total monthly payment by 12: $1500 * 12 = $18,000.

The final answer is: $18,000"
"To find the total time it takes Billy to peel and cut all the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel one potato and multiply it by the total number of potatoes, then add the time it takes to cut one potato and multiply it by the total number of potatoes.

Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds = 5/60 minutes (converting seconds to minutes)

Total time to peel all potatoes: 1.5 minutes * 60 potatoes = 90 minutes
Total time to cut all potatoes: (5/60) minutes * 60 potatoes = 5 minutes

Now, we add the time it takes to peel and cut all the potatoes: 90 minutes + 5 minutes = 95 minutes

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much they made in total from selling lemonade and then subtract the cost of sugar to find the cost of lemons.

Let's start by finding the total revenue. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. So, the revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10.

Since they made $25 in profit, and we know that profit is revenue minus cost, we can set up an equation: Revenue - Cost = Profit. We know the revenue per gallon is $10, but we don't know the total revenue or the total cost. However, we do know that the cost of lemons and sugar per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5.

Let's denote the number of gallons they made as 'x'. Then, the total revenue is 10x and the total cost is 5x. We know that 10x - 5x = 25 (since profit is $25). This simplifies to 5x = 25.

To find 'x', we divide both sides by 5: x = 25 / 5 = 5.

Now that we know they made 5 gallons, we can find the total revenue: 10 * 5 = $50.

The total cost is 5 * 5 = $25. This includes both lemons and sugar. We know that the cost of sugar is $2 per gallon, so the cost of sugar for 5 gallons is 2 * 5 = $10.

To find the cost of lemons, we subtract the cost of sugar from the total cost: $25 - $10 = $15.

"To find the number of Chinese participants, we first need to subtract the number of Japanese participants from the total number of participants. 

Total participants = 240
Japanese participants = 80
Chinese participants = Total participants - Japanese participants
Chinese participants = 240 - 80
Chinese participants = 160

Now, we know that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants.

Number of girls on the Chinese team = Chinese participants - Number of boys
Number of girls on the Chinese team = 160 - 60
Number of girls on the Chinese team = 100

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations and calculate the expenses step by step.

1. Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent: 
   1/4 of 6000 = 6000 * 1/4 = 1500

2. He spends 1/3 on car fuel:
   1/3 of 6000 = 6000 * 1/3 = 2000

3. The remaining amount after rent and car fuel is:
   6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500

4. He donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity:
   Half of 2500 = 2500 * 1/2 = 1250

5. The remaining amount after donation is:
   2500 - 1250 = 1250

6. He gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$:
   Total given away = 200 + 700 = 900

7. The remaining amount after giving money to his daughter and wife is:
   1250 - 900 = 350

Therefore, Zaid will still have 350 dollars after all these expenses and donations.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of white carnations and then calculate the number of red roses.

Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. Since Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations, we can write the equation:

200 = 5x

To find the value of 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we know the number of white carnations is 40, we can find the number of red roses. Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, we can write the equation:

Red roses = 4x
Red roses = 4 * 40
Red roses = 160

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

Two years ago, Mark was M - 2 years old, and Jan was 30 - 2 = 28 years old. We are also given that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. This can be written as:

M - 2 = (1/2) * 28 + 5

Simplifying the equation:

M - 2 = 14 + 5
M - 2 = 19
M = 21

Now that we know Mark's age, we can find Jean's age by adding 2 to Mark's age:

J = M + 2
J = 21 + 2
J = 23

"To find the total time for each team, we need to calculate the time for each runner and add them up.

The well-rounded team has each member running 400 meters in 55 seconds. Since there are 4 members, the total time for the well-rounded team is 4 * 55 = 220 seconds.

The less well-rounded team's first runner runs 400 meters in 60 seconds. The second runner is 3 seconds faster, so they run 400 meters in 60 - 3 = 57 seconds. The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so they run 400 meters in 57 - 3 = 54 seconds. The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so they run 400 meters in 54 - 3 = 51 seconds. The total time for the less well-rounded team is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 162 seconds.

To find the difference in time between the two teams, we subtract the time of the less well-rounded team from the time of the well-rounded team: 220 - 162 = 58 seconds.

The faster team will win by 58 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, and then find the difference between these two probabilities.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die is the probability of rolling a 4, 5, or 6. There are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, 6) out of 6 possible outcomes, so the probability is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5 or 50%.

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5, since there are 3 even numbers (2, 4, 6) out of 6 possible outcomes. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 = 0.25 or 25%.

Now, we need to find the difference between the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The difference is 50% - 25% = 25%.

The total number of hamsters is 10. 

The total number of straw pieces distributed among the small rodents is 160. Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw and each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw.

"To calculate the total amount Mandy should pay, we need to calculate the interest for 3 months and add it to the initial amount.

The monthly interest rate is 2%, which as a decimal is 0.02. 

The interest for the first month is $100 * 0.02 = $2.
The interest for the second month is $102 * 0.02 = $2.04.
The interest for the third month is $104.04 * 0.02 = $2.0808.

Now, let's add the interest for all three months to the initial amount:
$100 + $2 + $2.04 + $2.0808 = $106.1208.

Rounding to two decimal places, the total amount Mandy should pay is $106.12.

The final answer is: $106.12"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total cost incurred by the trader, which includes the cost of buying the bags and the cost of transportation. 

Let's denote the number of bags as 'x'. The cost of buying 'x' bags at $20 per bag is 20x. The cost of transporting 'x' bags at $2 per bag is 2x. 

The total cost is the sum of these two costs: total_cost = 20x + 2x = 22x.

The trader sold the bags at $30 each, so the total revenue is 30x.

The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost: profit = total_revenue - total_cost = 30x - 22x = 8x.

We are given that the profit is $400, so we can set up the equation: 8x = 400.

To find the number of bags, we need to solve for x: x = 400 / 8 = 50.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how much each friend paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets, food, and rides, and then divide it by 3.

First, let's find the cost of the tickets: $20.25 for 3 tickets. 

Cost per ticket = $20.25 / 3 = $6.75 per ticket

The total cost of the tickets is $20.25.

The cost of food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets. So, the cost of food = $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75

The cost of 2 rides = 2 * $33 = $66

Now, let's add up the total cost: $20.25 (tickets) + $15.75 (food) + $66 (rides) = $102

Since they agreed to split the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3: $102 / 3 = $34

The final answer is: $34"
"To find out how many peaches John collects, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he collects peaches and then multiply it by the number of peaches he collects per minute.

Since John collects peaches for 3 hours, we need to convert the time to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Now, we know John collects 2 peaches per minute. To find the total number of peaches, we multiply the total minutes by the peaches collected per minute:

180 minutes * 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches

The final answer is: 360"
"To find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ducks needs per day, we first need to calculate the total pounds of insects they need per week. Since there are ten ducks and each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week, we multiply the number of ducks by the pounds of insects each duck needs per week.

10 ducks * 3.5 pounds/duck/week = 35 pounds/week

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of insects they need per day. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total pounds of insects needed per week by 7.

35 pounds/week / 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day

So, the flock of ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day to survive.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net change in the number of trees Tom has each year. 

Tom plants 10 trees a year and chops down 2 trees a year, so the net change is 10 - 2 = 8 trees per year.

Since Tom starts with 50 trees, we need to calculate the total number of trees after 10 years. 

In 10 years, the net change is 8 * 10 = 80 trees. So, the total number of trees after 10 years is 50 + 80 = 130 trees.

However, after 10 years, 30% of the trees die. To find the number of trees that die, we multiply 130 by 0.3: 130 * 0.3 = 39 trees.

Now, we subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees: 130 - 39 = 91 trees.

The final answer is: 91"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos on Sue's front yard.

On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. They painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back out on Sue's front yard. So, now there are 6 white flamingos and 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos.

On Sunday morning, the neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection. Now, there are 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos.

The total number of flamingos on Sue's front yard is 30 pink + 6 white = 36 flamingos.

To find out how many more pink plastic flamingos were out than white plastic flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find out how much change Violetta will get, we need to first determine how many crayons she can buy with $20. Since one crayon costs $2, we can divide the total amount she has ($20) by the cost of one crayon ($2).

20 / 2 = 10

This means Violetta can buy 10 crayons. However, she needs 5 different colors, and it's not specified that she needs 5 of each color. Assuming she wants 5 different colors, she can buy 2 crayons of each color (since 10 / 5 = 2).

The total cost of 10 crayons is 10 * $2 = $20. Since she has $20, she will not need any change.

The final answer is: $0"
"To find the cost of a pen, we need to add the cost of a pencil and an eraser, since a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined. 

Cost of a pencil = $1.20
Cost of an eraser = $0.30
Cost of a pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser
Cost of a pen = $1.20 + $0.30
Cost of a pen = $1.50

Now, we need to find the cost of 8 pens. 

Cost of 8 pens = Cost of a pen * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $1.50 * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $12.00

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we first need to calculate the total pounds of carrots that will be used by the restaurants. 

Each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants. 

Total pounds of carrots used = Number of restaurants * Pounds per restaurant
Total pounds of carrots used = 40 * 2
Total pounds of carrots used = 80 pounds

Now, we subtract the total pounds of carrots used from the total pounds of carrots available to find out how many pounds will not be used.

Pounds of carrots not used = Total pounds of carrots - Total pounds of carrots used
Pounds of carrots not used = 200 - 80
Pounds of carrots not used = 120

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the number of children in Soda, we need to subtract the total number of men and women from the total population.

First, let's add the number of men and women:
8417 + 9092 = 17509

Now, subtract the sum from the total population to find the number of children:
23786 - 17509 = 6277

The number of children in Soda is 6277."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Initially, Elaine had 20 Pokémon cards.

In the first month, she collected three times the number of cards she initially had: 3 * 20 = 60 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month: 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months: (60 + 40) * 2 = 200 cards.

Now, let's add up the total number of cards Elaine has: 20 (initial cards) + 60 (first month) + 40 (second month) + 200 (third month) = 320 cards.

"Let's break down the information given. Mark edits 1000 sentences each week, and Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence. Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, he also edits 1000 sentences for Publisher B.

We know that Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays 2 * 5 cents = 10 cents per sentence.

Mark's total earnings from Publisher A are 1000 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 5000 cents.

Mark's total earnings from Publisher B are 1000 sentences * 10 cents/sentence = 10000 cents.

To find Mark's total weekly earnings, we add his earnings from both publishers: 5000 cents + 10000 cents = 15000 cents.

The final answer is: 15000"
"To find the total amount of water Baldur gets every day, we need to calculate the total number of pails he gets in a day and then multiply it by the amount of water in each pail.

Baldur gets 5 pails of water every morning and 6 pails of water every afternoon. So, the total number of pails he gets in a day is 5 + 6 = 11 pails.

Since each pail contains 5 liters of water, the total amount of water he gets every day is 11 pails * 5 liters/pail = 55 liters.

"To calculate John's total earnings for the year, we need to consider both the one-time monetary reward and the 5% raise in salary.

First, let's calculate the total amount John earns from his weekly salary for the year. Since he makes $2000 per week and works every week of the year (52 weeks), his total earnings from his salary would be:

2000 * 52 = 104,000

Now, let's calculate the 5% raise in salary. A 5% raise on $2000 would be:

2000 * 0.05 = 100

So, his new weekly salary would be:

2000 + 100 = 2100

Now, let's calculate his total earnings from his new salary for the year:

2100 * 52 = 109,200

Adding the one-time monetary reward of $5000 to his total earnings from his salary, we get:

109,200 + 5000 = 114,200

Therefore, John's total earnings for the year would be $114,200.

The final answer is: $114,200"
"To find the total number of barrels of wine produced per year, we need to calculate the total number of tons of grapes produced per year and then multiply it by the number of barrels of wine each ton can make.

First, let's find the total number of tons of grapes produced per year. Since each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year and Josie has 10 acres, we multiply the number of acres by the tons of grapes each acre produces:

10 acres * 5 tons/acre = 50 tons

Next, we know that each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine. So, we multiply the total number of tons of grapes by the number of barrels each ton can make:

50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels

Therefore, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the slices used for the sandwiches, omelets, and the macaroni and cheese dish separately and then add them together.

For the sandwiches, Carl ate 7 days' worth of sandwiches (since he ate one every day for a week) with 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. So, the total slices used for sandwiches = 7 * 2 = 14.

For the omelets, Carl ate 3 days' worth of omelets with one more slice per omelet than per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 3 slices per omelet. So, the total slices used for omelets = 3 * 3 = 9.

For the macaroni and cheese dish, Carl used 8 slices of cheese.

Now, let's add the slices used for sandwiches, omelets, and the macaroni and cheese dish together: 14 (sandwiches) + 9 (omelets) + 8 (macaroni and cheese) = 31.

The final answer is: 31"
"To find the total number of pens Janet has now, we need to calculate the number of pens she initially had and the number of pens she bought.

Janet initially had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, so she had a total of 22 + 10 = 32 pens.

She bought 6 bags of blue pens, with 9 pens in each bag, so she bought 6 x 9 = 54 blue pens.

She also bought 2 bags of red pens, with 6 pens in each bag, so she bought 2 x 6 = 12 red pens.

Now, let's add the number of pens she bought to the number of pens she initially had: 32 (initial pens) + 54 (blue pens) + 12 (red pens) = 98 pens.

However, we don't know how many green pens she bought, so we can't add those to the total. But since the question only asks for the total number of pens, we can ignore the color of the pens she bought.

The total number of pens Janet has now is 98."
"To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we first need to find the total score she needs for the semester. Since there are six tests and she wants an average of 93, we multiply 93 by 6 to get the total score.

Total score needed = Average score * Number of tests
Total score needed = 93 * 6
Total score needed = 558

Next, we need to find the total score Brinley has so far, excluding the lowest score. We add up the scores of the first five tests and then subtract the lowest score.

Scores of the first five tests = 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86
Scores of the first five tests = 338

To find the lowest score, we need to arrange the scores in ascending order: 71, 86, 89, 92, 100. The lowest score is 71.

Total score so far (excluding the lowest score) = Scores of the first five tests - Lowest score
Total score so far (excluding the lowest score) = 338 - 71
Total score so far (excluding the lowest score) = 267

Now, we need to find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test to reach the total score needed. We subtract the total score so far (excluding the lowest score) from the total score needed.

Score needed on the sixth test = Total score needed - Total score so far (excluding the lowest score)
Score needed on the sixth test = 558 - 267
Score needed on the sixth test = 291

First, let's calculate the total kilometers for the first four weeks when he rode 25 kilometers each time, 5 times a week. 

Total kilometers in the first four weeks = 25 km * 5 times/week * 4 weeks = 25 * 5 * 4 = 500 km

Next, let's calculate the total kilometers for the next three weeks when he rode 60 kilometers each time, 2 times a week.

Total kilometers in the next three weeks = 60 km * 2 times/week * 3 weeks = 60 * 2 * 3 = 360 km

Now, we add the total kilometers from both periods to find the overall total.

Total kilometers = 500 km + 360 km = 860 km

25 * 40g = 1000g

Next, let's find the weight of the candied apples. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, the weight of each candied apple is:
40g / 2 = 20g

Now, let's find the total weight of the candied apples:
80 * 20g = 1600g

Finally, let's add the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag of candy:

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since each plate costs $6000, half a dozen plates will cost 6 * $6000 = $36,000.

We are also given that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, the total cost of twenty dozen cups is $36,000 - $1200 = $34,800.

Since twenty dozen cups is equivalent to 240 cups, we can find the cost of each cup by dividing the total cost by the number of cups: $34,800 / 240 = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy and the total amount of money she has earned so far. 

The total cost of the items is the cost of the jacket plus the cost of 2 pairs of shoes: 
$30 (jacket) + 2 * $20 (shoes) = $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved before she started babysitting. She earns $5 each time she babysits the neighbor's kids, so the total amount she has earned from babysitting is 4 * $5 = $20. 

The total amount of money Sara has is the sum of the money she already had and the money she earned from babysitting: 
$10 (initial savings) + $20 (babysitting earnings) = $30.

To find out how much more money Sara needs, we subtract the total amount she has from the total cost of the items: 
$70 (total cost) - $30 (total amount she has) = $40.

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she must mow the lawn to earn the remaining amount, we divide the remaining amount by the amount she earns per lawn mowing: 
$40 (remaining amount) / $4 (lawn mowing earnings) = 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's denote the number of red chickens as 'r' and the number of white chickens as 'w'. We are given that w = r + 2.

The total number of eggs collected is the sum of the eggs produced by red and white chickens. Since each red chicken produces 3 eggs and each white chicken produces 5 eggs, we can write the equation:

3r + 5w = 42

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the time Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park since he walks around the edge. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the dimensions of the park, l = 6 miles and w = 1.5 miles, we can substitute these values into the formula:

P = 2(6 + 1.5)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles/hour, we can find the time he spends walking by dividing the perimeter by his speed:

Time = Perimeter / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of customers Sloane counted on the first day. Let's denote the number of customers on the first day as x.

On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so the number of customers on the second day is x + 50.

The total number of customers by the third day was 500, which is the sum of the customers on the first and second days. We can write this as an equation:

x + (x + 50) = 500

Combine like terms:

2x + 50 = 500

Subtract 50 from both sides:

2x = 450

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 225

So, Sloane counted 225 customers on the first day. 

Now, let's find the number of customers she counted on the third day. We already know that the number of customers on the second day is x + 50, which is 225 + 50 = 275. The total number of customers by the third day is 500, so the number of customers on the third day is 500 - 275 = 225.

The final answer is: 275"
"Let's denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as 'x' gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the initial amount of water in the big pool is 2x gallons.

Since both pools leak at 4 gallons/minute, the rate of water loss for both pools is 8 gallons/minute. 

In 4 minutes, the total water lost from both pools is 8 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 32 gallons.

The big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as 'y'. Then, the current amount of water in the big pool is 4y.

We can set up the equation based on the initial and current water levels:

Initial water in the big pool - Initial water in the small pool - Water lost = Current water in the big pool - Current water in the small pool
2x - x - 32 = 4y - y

Combine like terms:
x - 32 = 3y

Since the small pool lost 4 minutes worth of water, the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago is y + 4. We can set up another equation based on the initial and current water levels:
Initial water in the big pool - Initial water in the small pool = Current water in the big pool - Current water in the small pool
2(x + 4) - (y + 4) = 4y - y

Simplify the equation:
2x + 8 - y - 4 = 3y
2x + 4 = 4y

Now we have two equations:
x - 32 = 3y
2x + 4 = 4y

We can solve for x in the first equation:
x = 3y + 32

Substitute x in the second equation:
2(3y + 32) + 4 = 4y
6y + 64 + 4 = 4y
2y = -68
y = -34

Since the amount of water cannot be negative, we made an error in our previous steps. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

Let's denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as 'x' gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the initial amount of water in the big pool is 2x gallons.

Since both pools leak at 4 gallons/minute, the rate of water loss for both pools is 8 gallons/minute.

In 4 minutes, the total water lost from both pools is 8 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 32 gallons.

The big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as 'y'. Then, the current amount of water in the big pool is 4y.

We can set up the equation based on the initial and current water levels:
Initial water in the big pool - Initial water in the small pool - Water lost = Current water in the big pool - Current water in the small pool
2x - x - 32 = 4y - y

Combine like terms:
x - 32 = 3y

Since the small pool lost 4 minutes worth of water, the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago is y + 4. We can set up another equation based on the initial and current water levels:
Initial water in the big pool - Initial water in the small pool = Current water in the big pool - Current water in the small pool
2(x - 4) - (y - 4) = 4y - y

Simplify the equation:
2x - 8 - y + 4 = 3y
2x - 4 = 4y

Now we have two equations:
x - 32 = 3y
2x - 4 = 4y

We can solve for x in the first equation:
x = 3y + 32

Substitute x in the second equation:
2(3y + 32) - 4 = 4y
6y + 64 - 4 = 4y
2y = 60
y = 30

The current amount of water in the small pool is 30 gallons."
"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy and then divide that by her hourly wage.

The total cost of the items is the cost of the shoes plus the cost of the belt: $320.00 + $32.00 = $352.00.

Now, we divide the total cost by Lori's hourly wage: $352.00 ÷ $8.00 = 44 hours.

The final answer is: 44"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Janeth will pay in 12 months and then subtract that from the initial amount borrowed plus the additional 10% interest.

First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth will pay in 12 months:

$165/month * 12 months = $1980

Now, let's calculate the total amount Janeth borrowed with the additional 10% interest:

$2000 + (10% of $2000) = $2000 + $200 = $2200

Now, let's subtract the total amount Janeth will pay from the total amount she borrowed with interest:

$2200 - $1980 = $220

So, Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months will be $220.

The final answer is: $220"
"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to determine the number of dahlias and add it to the number of roses. 

First, let's find the number of dahlias. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, and there are 4 roses, we can calculate the number of dahlias as follows:

Number of dahlias = Number of roses + 7
Number of dahlias = 4 + 7
Number of dahlias = 11

Now, we can find the total number of flowers by adding the number of roses and dahlias:

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
Total number of flowers = 4 + 11
Total number of flowers = 15

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the average age of the three in three years, we first need to find their current ages and then add 3 to each age. 

Given that Harriet is 21 years old, and she is half the age of Zack, Zack's age is 2 * 21 = 42 years old.

Since Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, Adrian's age is 3 * 21 = 63 years old.

Now, we have the current ages of the three: Harriet (21), Zack (42), and Adrian (63). 

In three years, their ages will be: Harriet (21 + 3 = 24), Zack (42 + 3 = 45), and Adrian (63 + 3 = 66).

To find the average age, we add their ages and divide by 3: (24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Yuri and Brianna. 

Naomi scored 68 points. 
Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. 
Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. 
Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. 
Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

The total points scored by the four students is 251. 
We know that Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna scored 68, 44, and 85 points respectively. 
So, the total points scored by them is 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points.

To find out how many points Jojo scored, we subtract the total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points scored by all four students. 
Jojo scored 251 - 197 = 54 points.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much water is left in the tank after Celine used 90 liters. 

Initial water in the tank = 120 liters
Water used by Celine = 90 liters
Water left in the tank = Initial water - Water used
Water left in the tank = 120 - 90
Water left in the tank = 30 liters

Now, Celine collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left. 
Rainwater collected = 2 * Water left in the tank
Rainwater collected = 2 * 30
Rainwater collected = 60 liters

Total water in the tank now = Water left in the tank + Rainwater collected
Total water in the tank now = 30 + 60
Total water in the tank now = 90 liters

"To find the total number of flowers Andy plants, we need to calculate the number of petunias first. Since he plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, we subtract 40 from the number of geraniums.

Number of geraniums: 90
Number of petunias = Number of geraniums - 40
Number of petunias = 90 - 40
Number of petunias = 50

Now, we add the number of geraniums and petunias to find the total number of flowers.

Total flowers = Number of geraniums + Number of petunias
Total flowers = 90 + 50
Total flowers = 140

"To find the total amount spent on advertising for the two years, we need to calculate the amount spent in the second year first. 

The company spent a third of $15000 in the second year. To find a third of $15000, we divide $15000 by 3.

$15000 / 3 = $5000

Now, we add the amount spent in the first year to the amount spent in the second year to find the total amount spent on advertising for the two years.

$15000 + $5000 = $20000

The total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is $20000."

"To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we first need to determine the total number of cards James has after the changes. Initially, he has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards. 

After losing 8 water type cards, he has 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards. 

Then, he buys 14 grass type cards, so he now has 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards.

The total number of cards James has is 30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96 cards.

The probability of picking a water type card is the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards, which is 32/96.

To find the percentage, we multiply by 100: (32/96) * 100 = 33.333...

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance of picking a water type card is 33."
"To calculate the total amount Chad owes, we need to first calculate the total cost of the burrito and the upgrade, then subtract the gift card amount.

The base burrito costs $6.50. Chad adds extra meat for $2.00, extra cheese for $1.00, avocado for $1.00, and 2 sauces for $0.25 each, which is 2 * $0.25 = $0.50. The total cost of the add-ons is $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $4.50. 

The total cost of the burrito with add-ons is $6.50 + $4.50 = $11.00. Chad also upgrades his meal for an extra $3.00, so the total cost before the gift card is $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00.

Chad has a gift card for $5.00, so we subtract this from the total cost: $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the combined rate at which Kalinda and her mom can add pieces to the puzzle. 

Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute. Her mom can add half as many pieces per minute, which is 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute.

The combined rate is 4 (Kalinda's rate) + 2 (her mom's rate) = 6 pieces per minute.

Since there are 360 pieces in the puzzle, we need to divide the total number of pieces by the combined rate to find the time it will take to complete the puzzle.

Time = Total pieces / Combined rate
Time = 360 / 6
Time = 60 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

Time in hours = 60 minutes / 60
Time in hours = 1 hour

Therefore, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, the farm had 120 baby watermelons. After two months, 30% of them were ready for harvest. 

30% of 120 is calculated as 0.3 * 120 = 36. So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest after two months.

This means that 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons were not ready for harvest after two months.

When Ashlyn came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 melons were ready for harvest. 

3/4 of 84 is calculated as (3/4) * 84 = 63. So, 63 watermelons were ready for harvest after two weeks.

This means that 84 - 63 = 21 watermelons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks.

"To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the total cost of the cars, the tax on the cars, and the registration fees.

The total cost of the cars is the price of one car multiplied by the number of cars: 12 * $20,000 = $240,000.

The tax on the cars is 10% of the total cost of the cars: 0.10 * $240,000 = $24,000.

The registration fees are $1000 per car, so for 12 cars, it's 12 * $1000 = $12,000.

Now, we add the total cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees to find the total cost: $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many tomatoes Steve eats in a week and then divide that by the number of tomatoes a vine can produce per week.

Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, he eats 6 * 7 = 42 tomatoes per week.

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats half as much as Steve, which is 42 / 2 = 21 tomatoes per week.

The total number of tomatoes they eat per week is 42 (Steve) + 21 (girlfriend) = 63 tomatoes per week.

Each vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week. To find out how many vines Steve needs, we divide the total number of tomatoes they eat per week by the number of tomatoes a vine can produce per week: 63 / 3 = 21 vines.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Ram starts with 25 pens. He uses 5 pens to make 1 new pen, so he gets 1 new pen. Now, he has 25 - 5 = 20 pens left. He uses 5 of those 20 pens to make 1 new pen, so he gets 1 new pen. Now, he has 20 - 5 = 15 pens left. He continues this process until he has used up all the pens.

To find out how many pens he gets in total, we need to find out how many times he can repeat this process. Since he uses 5 pens to make 1 new pen, he can repeat this process 5 times with the initial 25 pens. 

After the first 5 pens, he has 20 pens left. After the second 5 pens, he has 15 pens left. After the third 5 pens, he has 10 pens left. After the fourth 5 pens, he has 5 pens left. After the fifth 5 pens, he has 0 pens left.

In the first cycle, he gets 1 new pen. In the second cycle, he gets 1 new pen. In the third cycle, he gets 1 new pen. In the fourth cycle, he gets 1 new pen. In the fifth cycle, he gets 1 new pen. 

So, in total, he gets 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 new pens.

"To find the sum of the ages of the three girls, we need to determine the ages of Mary and Joan first.

Since Jessa is 20 years old, and Joan is five years older than Jessa, we can calculate Joan's age as follows:
Joan's age = Jessa's age + 5
Joan's age = 20 + 5
Joan's age = 25

Now, we know that Mary is two years younger than Joan, so we can calculate Mary's age as follows:
Mary's age = Joan's age - 2
Mary's age = 25 - 2
Mary's age = 23

Now that we have the ages of all three girls, we can find the sum of their ages:
Sum of ages = Jessa's age + Joan's age + Mary's age
Sum of ages = 20 + 25 + 23
Sum of ages = 68

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of students who went out through exit A, then the number of students remaining, and finally, the number of students who went out through exit C.

First, let's find the number of students who went out through exit A. 30% of 1000 students went out through exit A. 

30% of 1000 = 0.3 * 1000 = 300 students.

Now, let's find the number of students remaining after 300 students went out through exit A. 

Remaining students = Total students - Students who went out through exit A

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Dolly has 2 books and Pandora has 1 book. 

Dolly will read her own 2 books and Pandora's 1 book, so Dolly will read a total of 3 books.

Pandora will read her own 1 book and Dolly's 2 books, so Pandora will read a total of 3 books.

In total, they will read 3 (Dolly's total) + 3 (Pandora's total) = 6 books.

However, we need to consider that they also read each other's books. So, Dolly will read Pandora's book, and Pandora will read Dolly's book. This means they will read 2 more books.

Therefore, the total number of books they will read is 6 (initial books) + 2 (each other's books) = 8 books.

"To find out how many hours Mike spends writing a week, we need to calculate the total number of letters he writes and then multiply it by the time it takes him to write one page.

First, let's find out how many letters Mike writes in a week. He has 3 pen pals left, and each of them sends 2 letters a week. So, the total number of letters he receives is 3 * 2 = 6 letters.

Since he responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters a week. 

Now, let's calculate the total number of pages he writes in a week. Each letter is 5 pages long, so the total number of pages is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

Since Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time he spends writing a week is 30 pages * 6 minutes/page = 180 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60. So, 180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many minutes Jason has left, we need to calculate the total minutes used and subtract that from his total plan minutes.

First, let's calculate the total minutes used for the daily calls with his boss. Since Jason has a 15-minute call with his boss every day and there are 30 days in the month, the total minutes used for these calls is:

15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes

Next, we add the extra 300 minutes used for calls with other people:

450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from Jason's total plan minutes:

1000 minutes - 750 minutes = 250 minutes

So, Jason has 250 minutes left.

The final answer is: 250"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Griffin had 24 french fries.

Kyle took 5 fries from Griffin. So, Griffin was left with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.

Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, which is 2 * 5 = 10 fries. So, Griffin was left with 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

Ginger gave Griffin some fries, and then Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had taken, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. 

After Colby took 2 fries, Griffin was left with 9 - 2 = 7 fries. But we know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. So, Ginger must have given Griffin 27 - 7 = 20 fries.

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28.

According to the problem, this difference is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums, so we can set up the equation:

28 = 2 * 2x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

28 = 4x

Dividing both sides by 4, we get:

x = 7

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the total hours worked. The makeup artist works 6 hours a day, 4 times a week, for 5 weeks. 

Total hours worked per week = 6 hours/day * 4 days/week = 24 hours/week
Total hours worked in 5 weeks = 24 hours/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours

The makeup artist charges $250 per hour. 

Total cost before discount = 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000

After the movie is done, the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount. 

Discount amount = 10% of $30,000 = 0.1 * $30,000 = $3,000

Total amount Jean paid = Total cost before discount - Discount amount
= $30,000 - $3,000
= $27,000

The final answer is: $27,000"
"To find out how much each person paid, we need to first calculate the total cost of the party supplies. 

The total cost is the sum of the individual expenses: 
$12 (cake) + $43 (presents) + $15 (decorations) + $4 (invitations) + $22 (goodie bags) = $96

Since Isabelle split the cost evenly with her two parents, there are a total of 3 people sharing the cost. 

To find out how much each person paid, we divide the total cost by 3:
$96 / 3 = $32

The final answer is: $32"
"To find out how much the chef spent, we need to calculate the total weight of the onions and then multiply it by the cost per pound.

The chef bought 4 bags of onions, each weighing 50 pounds. So, the total weight of onions is:
4 bags * 50 pounds/bag = 200 pounds

Since a pound of onions costs $1.50, the total cost is:
200 pounds * $1.50/pound = $300

The chef spent $300."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cookies Sue ate on both days and then calculate the total calories she consumed. 

On Monday, Sue's sister ate 5 cookies. Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate 5 * 4 = 20 cookies on Monday.

On Tuesday, Sue's sister ate 13 cookies. Since Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate 13 * 2 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies Sue ate: 20 (Monday) + 26 (Tuesday) = 46 cookies.

Sue's sister ate a total of 5 (Monday) + 13 (Tuesday) = 18 cookies.

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, Sue consumed 46 * 200 = 9200 calories. Her sister consumed 18 * 200 = 3600 calories.

The difference in calories consumed is 9200 - 3600 = 5600.

The final answer is: 5600"
"To find the number of boys in the third class, we first need to determine the total number of girls in the school. Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, and there are 3 classes with 20 students each, the total number of students in the school is 3 * 20 = 60.

Given that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls, the total number of girls in the school is 15 + 12 = 27. 

Since the school is 50% girls, the total number of boys in the school is also 60 - 27 = 33.

Now, we need to find the number of girls in the third class. Since the school is 50% girls, the third class should also have 50% girls. The total number of students in the third class is 20, so the number of girls in the third class is 20 * 0.5 = 10.

To find the number of boys in the third class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in the third class: 20 - 10 = 10.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how many cougars Rick killed today. We know he killed 15 cougars last night and three fewer cougars than the previous night today. So, the number of cougars he killed today is 15 - 3 = 12.

Now, we know that Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars today. Since he killed 12 cougars today, he killed 3 * 12 = 36 wolves.

We already know that Rick killed 10 wolves last night. So, the total number of wolves he killed is 10 + 36 = 46.

We also know that Rick killed 15 cougars last night. Since he killed 12 cougars today, the total number of cougars he killed is 15 + 12 = 27.

To find the total number of animals Rick killed, we add the total number of wolves and cougars: 46 (wolves) + 27 (cougars) = 73.

"To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we first need to determine how many times Anne went down the slide. Since Anne went down 30% less than Mitchel, we need to calculate 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30.

30% of 30 is 0.3 x 30 = 9. 

So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Since Robert went down 4 times as much as Anne, we multiply the number of times Anne went down by 4.

21 x 4 = 84

Robert went down the water slide 84 times.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we first need to determine how many cows Mr. Sylas added to each stall. 

Initially, each stall had 20 cows. Mr. Sylas bought 40 cows and divided them equally among the 10 stalls. 

To find out how many cows he added to each stall, we divide the total number of new cows (40) by the number of stalls (10). 

40 / 10 = 4

So, Mr. Sylas added 4 cows to each stall. 

Now, we need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. We know that each stall has 20 original cows and 4 new cows. 

20 (original cows) + 4 (new cows) = 24 cows per stall

Since we want to know the total number of cows in 8 stalls, we multiply the number of cows per stall by 8.

24 * 8 = 192

The final answer is: 192"
"To find the total amount of money in Brady's piggy bank, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and bill, and then add them together.

"To find the total weight of the redwood tree, we first need to calculate the total number of 10-foot sections. Since the tree is 200 feet tall, we divide 200 by 10 to get the total number of sections.

200 feet / 10 feet per section = 20 sections

Each section weighs 400 pounds, so we multiply the number of sections by the weight per section to get the total weight.

20 sections * 400 pounds per section = 8000 pounds

However, termites ate 30% of the wood, so we need to subtract 30% of the total weight from the total weight to find the remaining weight.

30% of 8000 pounds = 0.3 * 8000 = 2400 pounds

Now, we subtract the weight eaten by termites from the total weight.

8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds

The total amount Nancy has to pay is $6.00."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, and Andrea has 52 apples. So, Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.
2. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.
3. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.
4. To find the total number of fruits, we need to add the number of apples and bananas that both Andrea and Jamal have. 
   Total fruits = (Andrea's apples + Jamal's apples + Andrea's bananas + Jamal's bananas)
   Total fruits = (52 + 44 + 24 + 48)
   Total fruits = 168

"To determine the total amount of flour needed, we need to calculate the amount needed for each day and then add them together.

For today, Carla is making 36 cookies. Since two cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many cups are needed for 36 cookies. 

First, let's find out how many dozens are in 36 cookies: 36 / 12 = 3. This means Carla needs 3 dozen cookies' worth of flour for today. Since 2 cups are needed for a dozen, Carla will need 3 * 2 = 6 cups of flour for today.

For tomorrow, Carla is making 30 cookies. Again, we need to find out how many dozens are in 30 cookies: 30 / 12 = 2.5. Since 2 cups are needed for a dozen, Carla will need 2.5 * 2 = 5 cups of flour for tomorrow.

Now, let's add the flour needed for both days: 6 cups (for today) + 5 cups (for tomorrow) = 11 cups.

"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two-thirds of the pennies in the cup, we need to first calculate two-thirds of 9,300 pennies.

Two-thirds of 9,300 can be calculated as (2/3) * 9,300.

To find the value of two-thirds of 9,300, we can multiply 9,300 by 2 and then divide by 3.

First, multiply 9,300 by 2: 9,300 * 2 = 18,600

Then, divide 18,600 by 3: 18,600 / 3 = 6,200

Since each penny is worth $0.01, we can multiply 6,200 by 0.01 to find the total dollar amount.

6,200 * 0.01 = $62.00

The final answer is: $62.00"

"To find the total price of the house, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and the transfer fee, then add them to the selling price.

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, which is 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500.

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price, which is 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000.

The total price of the house is the sum of the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee: $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

To find out how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we subtract her budget from the total price: $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500.

"To solve this problem, we first need to find out how long it takes to heat the oil to 400 degrees. Since it takes 40% longer than 20 minutes to heat up to 400 degrees, we can calculate this as follows:

40% of 20 minutes is 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes. 
So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat up to 400 degrees.

Next, we know that it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil. Since it took 28 minutes to warm up the oil, it will take 28 - 5 = 23 minutes to cook.

The total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is the sum of the time it took to warm up the oil and the time it took to cook. Therefore, the total time is 28 + 23 = 51 minutes.

"To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we first need to determine the total number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette. 

The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches, which is 900 * 0.1 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so it takes 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

The total number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette is 90 + 180 = 270 stitches.

Since the whole sweater is a 1800-stitch project, the total number of stitches used for the body and the sleeves is 1800 - 270 = 1530 stitches.

The body takes 900 stitches, so the number of stitches used for the sleeves is 1530 - 900 = 630 stitches.

"To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the lines for each scene and the song, and then add them together.

The solo song has 54 lines.

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. However, only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has (4/5) * 60 = 48 lines from the second scene.

To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

We can substitute the first equation into the second one to solve for S:

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the equation:

6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtracting 3S from both sides:

Number of cobras: 40
Number of spots per cobra: 70
Total spots on cobras: 40 * 70 = 2800

Since the mambas have half the number of spots as the cobras, we can find the number of spots per mamba by dividing the number of spots per cobra by 2.

Number of spots per mamba: 70 / 2 = 35

Now, we can find the total number of spots on the mambas by multiplying the number of mambas by the number of spots per mamba.

Number of mambas: 60
Number of spots per mamba: 35
Total spots on mambas: 60 * 35 = 2100

To find the total number of spots on both cobras and mambas, we add the total spots on cobras and mambas.

Total spots on cobras and mambas: 2800 + 2100 = 4900

Finally, to find half the number of spots they all have combined, we divide the total number of spots by 2.

Half the total spots: 4900 / 2 = 2450

The space between the gemstones is filled with sterling silver beads, and each bead is one-quarter of an inch long. To find the total number of beads, we need to find the total space left after the gemstones are placed. 

The total space left is 25 - 8 = 17 inches. 

Since each bead is one-quarter of an inch long, we can find the number of beads by dividing the total space left by the length of each bead: 17 / 0.25 = 68.

So, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

The final answer is: 68"
"To find the total number of stories written in the first week, we need to add the number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot. 

Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week.
Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week.
Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week.

Total number of stories in the first week = 20 + 40 + 60 = 120

In the second week, each of them doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week. 

Alani doubled her 20 stories to 20 * 2 = 40 stories.
Braylen doubled his 40 stories to 40 * 2 = 80 stories.
Margot doubled her 60 stories to 60 * 2 = 120 stories.

Total number of stories in the second week = 40 + 80 + 120 = 240

To find the total number of stories written altogether, we need to add the total number of stories written in the first week and the second week.

Total number of stories = 120 + 240 = 360

The final answer is: 360"
"To find the current age of Ann's brother, we need to multiply Ann's age by 2. 

Ann's age is 9 years, so her brother's current age is 9 * 2 = 18 years.

In 3 years, Ann's brother will be 18 + 3 = 21 years old.

"To find out how many cents Kelly has left, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has and subtract the cost of the can of pop.

Kelly has 5 quarters, which is equivalent to 5 x 25 cents = 125 cents. She also has 2 dimes, which is equivalent to 2 x 10 cents = 20 cents. 

So, the total amount of money Kelly has is 125 cents + 20 cents = 145 cents.

Now, let's subtract the cost of the can of pop, which is 55 cents. 

145 cents - 55 cents = 90 cents.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the number of rows of 5-star stars, we first need to determine the total number of stars in the flag and then subtract the number of stars in the rows with 8 and 6 stars.

The flag has three rows of 8 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 3 * 8 = 24.

The flag has two rows of 6 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 2 * 6 = 12.

The total number of stars in the flag is 76.

Now, we subtract the number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows from the total number of stars to find the number of stars in the 5-star rows: 76 - 24 - 12 = 40.

Since each 5-star row has 5 stars, we divide the total number of stars in the 5-star rows by 5 to find the number of rows: 40 / 5 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the number of trucks needed, we need to calculate the total weight of the flagstones and divide it by the weight capacity of each truck.

First, let's find the total weight of the flagstones: 
80 flagstones * 75 pounds per flagstone = 6000 pounds

Now, let's divide the total weight by the weight capacity of each truck:
6000 pounds / 2000 pounds per truck = 3

So, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

The final answer is: 3"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the speed of the car in the slow lane. Since it's traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, we can calculate it as follows:

Speed of the car in the fast lane = 60 miles/hour
Speed of the car in the slow lane = 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour

Now, we know the distance covered by both cars is the same, which is 480 miles. We can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed to find the time taken by the car in the slow lane.

Time taken by the car in the slow lane = Distance / Speed
= 480 miles / 30 miles/hour
= 16 hours

The final answer is: 16"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem.

Ali has 22 medals. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.

Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

It's given that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have. Let's represent the total number of medals given out as 'x'. Then, we can write the equation:

39 = x / 10

To solve for 'x', we multiply both sides of the equation by 10:

x = 39 * 10
x = 390

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is 390.

The final answer is: 390"
"To solve this problem, we first need to find out how many chocolate bars are available in total. Since each packet contains 5 chocolate bars and there are 8 packets, the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

We know that each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, and there are 4 adults. So, the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 * 6 = 24.

Now, we need to find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children. This can be calculated by subtracting the number of chocolate bars given to adults from the total number of chocolate bars: 40 - 24 = 16.

Since there are 8 children, and the remaining chocolate bars are to be shared equally among them, we can find out how many chocolate bars each child will get by dividing the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children: 16 / 8 = 2.

Therefore, each child will get 2 chocolate bars.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much Susan earns, we need to calculate the total time she works and then multiply it by her hourly wage.

First, let's find the total time she works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total time.

3 hours (working time) - 0.5 hours (pause time) = 2.5 hours

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to convert the total working time to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Now, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes:

150 minutes / 10 minutes/interval = 15 intervals

Since she earns $5 per interval, we multiply the number of intervals by her earnings per interval:

15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

So, Susan earns $75 for the online task.

The final answer is: $75"
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the points each player has after the third round and then add the extra points they receive in the fourth round.

After the third round, Mike has 21 points. 
Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

Now, let's add the extra points for the fourth round. 
Mike has 21 points, so he gets 0 extra points (since 21 is not over 20).
Jim has 18 points, so he gets 0 extra points (since 18 is not over 20).
Tony has 42 points, so he gets 1 extra point (since 42 is over 20).

Now, let's calculate the total points for each player after the fourth round:
Mike: 21 + 0 = 21
Jim: 18 + 0 = 18
Tony: 42 + 1 = 43

The total points for all three players is 21 + 18 + 43 = 82.

The final answer is: 82"
"To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we first need to determine how many oranges the sons washed. The oldest son is 8 years old, and the youngest son is half as old as the oldest, so the youngest son is 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

The oldest son washes 8 oranges, and the youngest son washes 4 oranges. In total, they wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

Will bought 15 oranges, and 12 were washed. To find out how many are left unwashed, we subtract the number of oranges washed from the total number of oranges: 15 - 12 = 3.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the total count of activities, we need to calculate the number of exercises done on each day and then add them together.

On the first day, Darren did:
- 100 pushups
- 50 squats
- 20 dumbbell presses

Total exercises on the first day = 100 + 50 + 20 = 170

On the second day, Darren did:
- 20 more pushups than the first day, so 100 + 20 = 120 pushups
- 10 fewer squats than the first day, so 50 - 10 = 40 squats
- Doubled the number of dumbbell presses, so 20 * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses

Total exercises on the second day = 120 + 40 + 40 = 200

Total exercises in two days = 170 + 200 = 370

The final answer is: 370"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day and then divide the total amount of rice available by this daily consumption.

First, let's calculate the daily consumption of rice. Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day (lunch and dinner). So, the daily consumption per person is 0.2 kg/meal * 2 meals = 0.4 kg/day.

Since there are 5 members in the household who eat rice every lunch and dinner, the total daily consumption is 0.4 kg/day * 5 people = 2 kg/day.

Now, let's calculate how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last. We can do this by dividing the total amount of rice available (42 kg) by the daily consumption (2 kg/day).

42 kg / 2 kg/day = 21 days

Since we want to know how many weeks the rice will last, we need to convert the number of days to weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so we can divide the number of days by 7.

21 days / 7 days/week = 3 weeks

Therefore, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we first need to calculate the total number of crates he sold in the week. 

Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he sold bread for 5 days. 

He sold 20 crates over the weekend, which is 2 days. 
He sold 15 crates on Tuesday, 12 crates on Wednesday, and 18 crates on Thursday.

Total crates sold = 20 (weekend) + 15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday) = 65 crates

Since Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, he had 5 working days. His target for the week is 120 crates. 

To find out how many crates he should have sold in 5 days, we can divide the target by 7 and multiply by 5. 

Target per day = 120 / 7 = 17.14 (approximately)
Crates he should have sold in 5 days = 17.14 * 5 = 85.7 (approximately)

However, since we can't sell a fraction of a crate, we'll consider the nearest whole number. 

Crates he should have sold in 5 days = 86 crates

Now, let's find out how many crates he was off from his target. 

Crates he was off from his target = Target - Crates he sold = 120 - 65 = 55 crates

The final answer is: 55"
"To find the total cost of the desk, we need to determine the last bid made by Carmen. 

The initial bid is $200. The bids rise by $50 each time. Since there are 3 other people who bid once, there are a total of 4 people who bid before Carmen makes her final bid. 

The sequence of bids would be: $200, $250, $300, $350, $400, $450, $500. 

Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, so she makes 4 bids. The last bid is made by Carmen, which is $500. 

The total cost of the desk is $500. 

The final answer is: $500"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to find the total miles driven per year, the total cost per year for the miles driven, and the total bonus per year.

First, let's find the total miles driven per year. Since John goes to work 30 miles away and back each day, the total miles driven per day is 30 * 2 = 60 miles. He goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year, so the total miles driven per year is 60 * 5 * 50 = 15,000 miles.

The cost per mile is $2, so the total cost per year for the miles driven is 15,000 * $2 = $30,000.

John also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus per year is $150 * 12 = $1,800.

The total cost per year for driving is the sum of the total cost for the miles driven and the total bonus, which is $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

The final numerical answer is: $31,800"
"To find out how many minutes Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to add the minutes he exercised on both days. 

Monday: 16 minutes
Sunday: 23 minutes
Combined: 16 + 23 = 39 minutes

Since Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to multiply the combined minutes by 2.

Combined minutes: 39
Twice the combined minutes: 39 * 2 = 78 minutes

Therefore, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal.

The final answer is: 78"
"To determine the number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider the folding process. 

When a piece of paper is folded vertically, it creates two layers: the front and the back. 

In a standard tabloid, the pages are arranged in a way that the first page is on the left back, the second page is on the left front, the 32nd page is on the right back, and the 31st page is on the right front. 

This means that we need two pieces of paper to create the left and right sides of the tabloid. 

Since we have 32 pages, we need two pieces of paper to create the left and right sides, each with 16 pages. 

Therefore, the total number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid is 2.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much money Annika has left, we need to calculate the amount she spent on food and snacks, and then subtract that from the initial amount she brought.

Annika spent half of $50 on food and snacks, which is 50 / 2 = $25.

She also spent an additional $10 on rides.

So, the total amount she spent is $25 (food and snacks) + $10 (rides) = $35.

Now, let's subtract the total amount she spent from the initial amount she brought: $50 - $35 = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we first need to determine how many books she sold in the first year. 

Let's denote the number of books sold in the current year as 'x'. Since she sold twice as many books in the first year, the number of books sold in the first year is 2x.

We know that the total number of books sold in the first two years is the sum of the books sold in the first year and the current year, which is 2x + x = 3x. 

We also know that there are 50 unsold books, and the total number of books is 250. So, the total number of books sold is 250 - 50 = 200.

Since the total number of books sold is 3x, we can set up the equation 3x = 200. Solving for x, we get x = 200 / 3 = 66.67. However, since the number of books cannot be a fraction, we'll round down to the nearest whole number, which is 66.67 ≈ 67 (rounding up to 66 would make the number of unsold books less than 50).

Now that we know the number of books sold in the current year is 67, we can find the number of books sold in the first year, which is 2x = 2 * 67 = 134.

The total amount of money earned in the first year is 134 * 20 = 2680.

The total amount of money earned in the second year is 45 * 20 = 900.

The final answer is: $900"
"To find out how much Watson made in April, we need to calculate his total earnings from his hourly wage and the weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate his total hours worked in a week: 
10 hours/day * 5 days/week = 50 hours/week

Since Watson earns $10 per hour, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:
50 hours/week * $10/hour = $500/week

Since the company performed well for the whole month, Watson received a $300 bonus each week. 
So, his total weekly earnings are:
$500/week (hourly wage) + $300/week (bonus) = $800/week

Now, let's calculate his total earnings for the month of April, which has 4 weeks:
$800/week * 4 weeks = $3200

Therefore, Watson made $3200 in April."

"To find out how many loaves are sold in the afternoon, we first need to determine how many loaves are left after the morning sales. 

The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. 

Two-thirds of 60 is calculated as (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves. 

So, 40 loaves are sold in the morning. 

Now, we need to find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales. 

The total number of loaves produced is 60, and 40 are sold in the morning. 

60 - 40 = 20 loaves are left after the morning sales.

Half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening. 

Half of 20 is calculated as (1/2) * 20 = 10 loaves.

Since the remaining loaves are equally divided between the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much weight Joey loses per week and then multiply that by the number of weeks it takes Sandy to lose the same amount of weight.

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. To find out how much weight Joey loses per week, we divide the total weight lost by the number of weeks:

Weight lost per week = Total weight lost / Number of weeks
Weight lost per week = 8 pounds / 4 weeks
Weight lost per week = 2 pounds per week

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, we multiply the weight lost per week by the number of weeks it takes Sandy:

Total weight lost = Weight lost per week * Number of weeks
Total weight lost = 2 pounds/week * 4 weeks
Total weight lost = 8 pounds

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose 8 pounds.

"To find the total savings, we need to calculate the savings on the tubs of ice cream and the packets of milk separately and then add them together.

The original price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 * $13 = $26. The discounted price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 * $11 = $22. The savings on 2 tubs of ice cream is $26 - $22 = $4.

The original price of 4 packets of milk is 4 * $1 = $4. The discounted price of 4 packets of milk is 4 * ($1 - $0.5) = 4 * $0.5 = $2. The savings on 4 packets of milk is $4 - $2 = $2.

The total savings is $4 + $2 = $6.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and legs Helena's serum will cause a person to grow after 15 days.

First, let's calculate the number of extra arms. The serum causes a person to grow an extra arm every 3 days. To find out how many 3-day periods are in 15 days, we divide 15 by 3:

15 ÷ 3 = 5

Since there are 5 periods of 3 days in 15 days, the person will grow 5 extra arms.

Next, let's calculate the number of extra legs. The serum causes a person to grow an extra leg every 5 days. To find out how many 5-day periods are in 15 days, we divide 15 by 5:

15 ÷ 5 = 3

Since there are 3 periods of 5 days in 15 days, the person will grow 3 extra legs.

Now, let's add the number of extra arms and legs to find the total number of new limbs:

5 (extra arms) + 3 (extra legs) = 8

So, Helena's serum will cause a person to grow 8 new limbs after 15 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount spent by Theo on the business suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket, and then subtract this amount from the total amount he has, $6000. We also need to subtract the amount he wants to save, $2000.

First, let's calculate the cost of the business suits:
6 suits * $100 each = $600

Next, let's calculate the cost of the suitcases:
3 suitcases * $50 each = $150

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket. The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. The cost of a business suit is $100, so 5 times this amount is:
5 * $100 = $500
$700 more than this is:
$500 + $700 = $1200

Now, let's calculate the total amount spent by Theo on the business suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket:
$600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950

Now, let's subtract the amount he wants to save from the total amount he has:
$6000 - $2000 = $4000

Finally, let's subtract the total amount spent by Theo from the amount he has after saving:
$4000 - $1950 = $2050

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a day and then multiply it by 7 to get the total number of eggs consumed in a week.

First, let's find out how many people eat 3 eggs each day and how many people eat 2 eggs each day. 

There are 5 people in the family, and 3 people eat 3 eggs each day. So, the number of people eating 3 eggs each day is 3. The remaining people eat 2 eggs each day, which is 5 - 3 = 2 people.

Now, let's calculate the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a day. 

The 3 people eating 3 eggs each day will consume 3 * 3 = 9 eggs. The 2 people eating 2 eggs each day will consume 2 * 2 = 4 eggs. 

So, the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a day is 9 + 4 = 13 eggs.

To find the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7. 

13 eggs/day * 7 days = 91 eggs

Jane's age = Quinn's age - 3
Jane's age = 30 - 3
Jane's age = 27

Now that we know Jane's age, we can find Trent's age by adding 5 to Jane's age, since Trent is 5 years older than Jane.

Trent's age = Jane's age + 5
Trent's age = 27 + 5
Trent's age = 32

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find Noah's current age. Since Cera is 46 years old now, six years ago, Cera was 40 years old. We are given that six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. So, Noah's age six years ago was 40 / 2 = 20 years.

Now, we know that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, the population of Chile six years ago was 20 * 3000 = 60,000.

We are also given that the population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now. So, the current population of Chile is 60,000 * 2 = 120,000.

"Let's break down the information given. 

Let's denote the number of players on the defense as D. 

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2D.

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is D/2.

We know that the total number of players on the team is 105. The sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams is equal to 105. 

So, we can write the equation: 2D + D + D/2 = 105.

To solve for D, we need to get rid of the fraction. Multiplying the entire equation by 2 will eliminate the fraction: 4D + 2D + D = 210.

Combining like terms, we get 7D = 210.

Dividing both sides by 7, we get D = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total number of people invited, we first need to calculate the number of people from the 2 families with 6 people and the 3 families with 4 people.

For the 2 families with 6 people, the total number of people is 2 * 6 = 12.
For the 3 families with 4 people, the total number of people is 3 * 4 = 12.
The total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.

However, 8 people couldn't come due to illness. So, we subtract 8 from the total number of people invited: 24 - 8 = 16.

Now, 1/4 of the people who couldn't come due to illness had previous commitments. 1/4 of 8 is 2. So, we subtract 2 from the number of people who couldn't come due to illness: 8 - 2 = 6.

The total number of people who couldn't come is 6. We subtract this from the total number of people invited: 24 - 6 = 18.

"To find the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store, we need to calculate the total number of marbles first.

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and added them to a store that had 50. So, the total number of marbles in the store after buying from Johanna is 20 + 50 = 70.

His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna, his father gave him 2/5 * 20 = 8 marbles.

Now, the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store is 70 (initial marbles) + 20 (bought from Johanna) + 8 (given by his father) = 98 marbles.

Each marble weighs 2kgs, so the total weight of marbles is 98 * 2 = 196 kgs.

"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (such as a pool) is length x width x height.

Given dimensions: 
- Length (L) = 6 feet
- Width (W) = 4 feet
- Height (H) = 5 feet

Volume = L x W x H = 6 x 4 x 5 = 120 cubic feet

Now, we need to find the cost to fill the pool. The cost is given as $0.1 per cubic foot. 

Cost = Volume x Cost per cubic foot

"To find the total number of children in the classroom, we need to calculate the number of girls, nongendered children, and then add them to the number of boys.

Given that there are 30 boys, and the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:
Girls = 3 * Boys = 3 * 30 = 90

Next, we are given that there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys. To find the number of nongendered children, we can multiply the number of boys by 1/10:
Nongendered children = 1/10 * Boys = 1/10 * 30 = 3

Now, we can find the total number of children by adding the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
Total children = Boys + Girls + Nongendered children = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123

"To solve this problem, we need to use the given ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This means that for every 1 electric pole, 3 electric wires are needed.

Let's denote the number of electric poles as 'x'. According to the given ratio, the number of electric wires will be 3x.

We are given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45. So, we can set up the equation:

3x = 45

To find the value of x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 45 / 3
x = 15

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required by the electric company to supply the electricity in the neighborhood is 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of people who left the party. We know that 1/4 of the total number of people left, and 22 men stayed. 

Let's denote the total number of people as 'x'. Since 1/4 of the people left, 3/4 of the people stayed. We can set up the equation:

3/4 * x = 22 + (number of women who stayed)

We know that the total number of people at the beginning was 25 men + 15 women = 40 people. So, x = 40.

Now, we can substitute x = 40 into the equation:

3/4 * 40 = 22 + (number of women who stayed)

30 = 22 + (number of women who stayed)

Subtract 22 from both sides:

8 = (number of women who stayed)

Since there were 15 women at the beginning, we can find the number of women who left:

15 - 8 = 7 women left

The total number of women who stayed is 8."
"To find the cost of the pen, we need to first determine the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book, and the book costs $4, the magazine costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, we know that the pen costs $1 less than the magazine. So, the cost of the pen is $2 - $1 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To find the total number of pencils Jam has, we know she has 3 boxes and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils. Since we know the number of loose pencils, we can find the number of pencils in the boxes by subtracting the loose pencils from the total: 26 - 2 = 24 pencils in the boxes.

Since each box contains an equal number of pencils, we can divide the total number of pencils in the boxes by the number of boxes to find the number of pencils in each box: 24 / 3 = 8 pencils per box.

Now, we know Jam has 24 pencils in 3 boxes, and Meg has 46 pencils. To find the total number of pencils, we add the number of pencils Jam and Meg have: 24 + 46 = 70 pencils.

To find the number of boxes needed to store all the pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils per box: 70 / 8 = 8.75. Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure all pencils fit. Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

The final answer is: 9"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total weakening effect of the ice cubes and the added cream.

First, let's calculate the number of ice cubes needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, so the number of ice cubes needed is:

65 / 13 = 5

Since each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, 5 ice cubes will make it 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters weaker.

Next, we need to consider the effect of adding 15 milliliters of cream. Since any added liquid weakens the coffee, the total weakening effect of the cream is 15 milliliters.

Now, we add the weakening effects of the ice cubes and the cream to find the total weakening effect:

60 milliliters (from ice cubes) + 15 milliliters (from cream) = 75 milliliters

The final answer is: 75"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the trade ratio. The given ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record. This means that for every 2 old records, 1 new record is given.

Since 5 people come in and leave with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of new records as 7. However, we need to find out how many old records were traded for these new records.

Let's use the ratio to set up an equation. If 2 old records are traded for 1 new record, then the total number of old records traded for 7 new records can be calculated as follows:

2 old records / 1 new record = x old records / 7 new records

To find the value of x, we can cross-multiply:

2 * 7 = 1 * x
14 = x

However, this is the number of old records traded for 1 new record. Since there are 5 people, and each person is trading, we need to multiply this number by 5 to get the total number of old records brought in:

14 * 5 = 70

So, the 5 people brought in a total of 70 old records.

The final answer is: 70"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of junior programmers and the number of senior programmers. 

The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, which is 100. So, the number of junior programmers is 2/5 * 100 = 40.

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers is 100 - 40 = 60.

The junior programmers are each paid $2000 per month, so the total amount paid to junior programmers is 40 * $2000 = $80,000.

Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so they are paid $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month.

The total amount paid to senior programmers is 60 * $2400 = $144,000.

The total amount paid to all programmers is the sum of the amount paid to junior programmers and senior programmers, which is $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

The final answer is: $224,000"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as 'x'.

Initially, there were x people on the bus.

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the total number of people became x + 5.

At the second bus stop, 7 people got down, so the total number of people became (x + 5) - 7 = x - 2.

Then, 8 more people got in, so the total number of people became (x - 2) + 8 = x + 6.

We are given that the total number of people heading to the third stop is 20, so we can set up the equation:

x + 6 = 20

To solve for x, we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:

x = 20 - 6
x = 14

The final answer is: 14"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops and eats 2 on his way to school. So, he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left.

2. He passes 14 out to his friends, so now he has 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops left.

3. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now, he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.

4. He eats 3 more lollipops that night, so he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops left.

5. He eats 2 more lollipops in the morning, so he has 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops left.

The final answer is: 31"
"To find the time it takes to fully charge the phone, we need to first determine how many percentage points are left to charge. Since the phone is already at 60% charged, it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more to be fully charged.

Given that the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time it takes to charge the remaining 40% as follows:

40 percentage points / 1 percentage point per 3 minutes = 40 * 3 minutes

40 * 3 = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we need to first calculate the total number of lollipops she has after her mother gives her 10 more. 

Erin initially has 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her 10 more, so Erin now has 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops.

Then, Erin gives 3 lollipops to Ella. To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we subtract 3 from 17. 

17 - 3 = 14

So, Erin has 14 lollipops left.

The final answer is: 14"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip, apply the rewards and the coupon to the current shopping trip, and then find the final amount paid.

The customer spent $80 on their last shopping trip, which means they earned $80 / $20 = 4 rewards. 

On this shopping trip, they spent $43 and used their rewards. Since they had 4 rewards, they used $4 off the price. 

The coupon took twice the amount of rewards off the price, which is 2 * $4 = $8. 

So, the total discount applied is $4 (from rewards) + $8 (from the coupon) = $12.

The final amount paid is $43 (initial price) - $12 (total discount) = $31.

The final answer is: $31"
"To determine which job pays more, we need to calculate the net pay for each job.

For Job A, the total income is $15/hour * 2000 hours/year = $30,000/year. The state tax rate is 20%, so the tax amount is $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000. The net pay for Job A is $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

For Job B, the total income is $42,000. The property tax is $6,000, so the net income before taxes is $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000. The state tax rate is 10%, so the tax amount is $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600. The net pay for Job B is $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

To find the difference in net pay between the two jobs, we subtract the net pay of Job A from the net pay of Job B: $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

The final numerical answer is: $8,400"
"To find the number of unmanned ruined castles, we first need to find the total number of ruined castles. 

40% of the castles are ruins, so we multiply the total number of castles by 0.4 (which is the decimal form of 40%): 
220 * 0.4 = 88

Now, we know that half of the ruined castles are unmanned. To find the number of unmanned ruined castles, we divide the total number of ruined castles by 2:
88 / 2 = 44

So, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland.

The final answer is: 44"

"To find the final value of Maria's shares, we need to calculate the stock price after the first year and then after the second year.

Initially, Maria buys 8 shares for $8 each, so the total cost is 8 * 8 = $64.

The stock price increases by 50% in the first year. To find the new price, we multiply the original price by 1.5 (100% + 50% = 150%, or 1 + 0.5 = 1.5). 

New price after the first year = $8 * 1.5 = $12.

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. To find the new price, we multiply the price after the first year by 0.75 (100% - 25% = 75%, or 1 - 0.25 = 0.75).

New price after the second year = $12 * 0.75 = $9.

Now, we multiply the new price after the second year by the number of shares to find the final value of Maria's shares.

Final value = 8 * $9 = $72.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of students in the two equal groups as 'x'. Since the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the smallest group is 'x - 10'.

We know that the total number of students in the class is 200, and the sum of the students in all three groups is equal to 200. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 70

Since the smallest group has 'x - 10' students, we can find the number of students in the smallest group by subtracting 10 from x:

x - 10 = 70 - 10
= 60

"Let's break down the information given. Farmer Brown has a total of 60 animals, and he has twice as many chickens as cows. 

Let's denote the number of cows as 'c' and the number of chickens as '2c' (since there are twice as many chickens as cows). The total number of animals is the sum of the number of cows and chickens, which is c + 2c = 3c. We know this sum equals 60, so we can set up the equation 3c = 60.

To find the value of 'c', we divide both sides of the equation by 3: c = 60 / 3 = 20. This means there are 20 cows.

Since there are twice as many chickens as cows, the number of chickens is 2c = 2 * 20 = 40.

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. The total number of cow legs is 20 * 4 = 80, and the total number of chicken legs is 40 * 2 = 80.

The total number of legs is the sum of the number of cow legs and chicken legs: 80 + 80 = 160.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the weights of the blue beetle, green toad, yellow snake, and red bird. 

Since the pink frog weighs 50 pounds and it weighs the same as the blue beetle and the green toad, we can conclude that the blue beetle and the green toad also weigh 50 pounds.

The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.

The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we can find the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal by adding the weights of all the animals and the container: 50 (pink frog) + 50 (blue beetle) + 50 (green toad) + 60 (yellow snake) + 30 (red bird) + 20 (container) = 260 pounds.

"To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we need to calculate the total number of cookies consumed by her son and her husband, and then subtract that from the total number of cookies in a bag.

Jenny's son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, so he eats 4 * 5 = 20 cookies per week.

Jenny's husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so he eats 1 * 7 = 7 cookies per week.

The total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband is 20 + 7 = 27 cookies per week.

Since each bag has 36 cookies, and 27 cookies are consumed by her son and husband, Jenny eats the remaining cookies. 

36 (total cookies) - 27 (cookies consumed by son and husband) = 9 cookies.

Jenny eats 9 cookies."

The factory used to make $100 per tractor and sold 10 tractors a day, so they made $100 * 10 = $1000 per day.

Now, they make $220 per silo and sell 5 silos a day, so they make $220 * 5 = $1100 per day.

The difference in the amount of money they are making per day now and the amount they used to make is $1100 - $1000 = $100.

To find the percentage increase, we divide the difference by the original amount and multiply by 100:

The total cost for the activities is 30 + 5x.

Morgan's budget is $90, so we can set up the equation: 30 + 5x ≤ 90 (since we don't know the number of friends, we use ≤ to represent the inequality)

Now, let's solve for x:
5x ≤ 90 - 30
5x ≤ 60
x ≤ 60 / 5
x ≤ 12

So, Morgan can invite up to 12 friends.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find out how much money Marisa saves in her piggy bank, we need to first calculate how much money she spends on lollipops each day and then subtract that from her daily pocket money.

Marisa buys 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each, so the total amount she spends on lollipops each day is:
4 lollipops * 25 cents/lollipop = 100 cents or $1

Since Marisa gets $5 as pocket money each day, the amount she saves each day is:
$5 - $1 = $4

Now, we need to find out how much she saves in 5 days:
$4/day * 5 days = $20

So, Marisa puts $20 in her piggy bank if she saves for 5 days.

The final answer is: $20"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how much change Billy has after buying the candy. 

Billy starts with $10. He buys candy for $1.5 per pound. Let's call the number of pounds of candy he buys 'x'. The total cost of the candy is 1.5x. 

So, the change he has after buying the candy is 10 - 1.5x.

Next, he takes half of this change and spends it on gumballs. Since each gumball costs $0.05, the total cost of the gumballs is 0.05 * (1/2) * (10 - 1.5x) = 0.025 * (10 - 1.5x).

We are given that he bought 40 gumballs, so the total cost of the gumballs is 0.05 * 40 = $2.

Now, we can set up an equation to solve for x:

0.025 * (10 - 1.5x) = 2

To solve for x, we can start by dividing both sides by 0.025:

10 - 1.5x = 80

Next, we can subtract 10 from both sides:

-1.5x = 70

Now, we can divide both sides by -1.5:

x = -70 / 1.5
x = -46.67

However, since we can't buy a negative amount of candy, this solution doesn't make sense. Let's go back to the previous step and try a different approach.

We know that the total cost of the gumballs is $2, and each gumball costs $0.05. So, the total amount of change he spent on gumballs is 2 / 0.05 = 40. Since he took half of his change, the total change he had after buying the candy is 2 * 2 = $4.

Now, we can set up an equation to solve for x:

10 - 1.5x = 4

To solve for x, we can start by subtracting 10 from both sides:

-1.5x = -6

Now, we can divide both sides by -1.5:

x = 6 / 1.5
x = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the age of Carver's son, we need to first determine Carver's age and then calculate the son's age based on the given information.

Let's denote Carver's age as C and his son's age as S. We know that Carver is 45 years old, so C = 45.

The problem states that Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son. This can be expressed as an equation:

C = 2S - 5

Substituting the value of C, we get:

45 = 2S - 5

To solve for S, we need to isolate S on one side of the equation. We can do this by adding 5 to both sides:

45 + 5 = 2S
50 = 2S

Next, we divide both sides by 2 to find S:

S = 50 / 2
S = 25

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the total distance the train travels in one trip, we need to add the distances between the three cities. The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles, and the distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles. 

The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs, which is 75 + 100 = 175 miles. So, the distance from the third city to the first city is 175 - 50 = 125 miles.

The total distance for one trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles.

To find out how many days the train goes between services, we need to divide the total distance the train can travel before needing service (18,000 miles) by the total distance it travels in a day (900 miles).

18,000 / 900 = 20 days.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the amount of stuffing needed for the collie beds, we first need to calculate the average amount of stuffing between the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds. 

The average amount of stuffing for a collie bed is (8 + 2) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for the chihuahua beds: 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.

Next, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for the collie beds: 3 * 5 = 15 pounds.

Finally, we add the total amount of stuffing needed for the chihuahua beds and the collie beds: 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total time taken for the trip, we need to calculate the time taken for each part of the trip and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time taken for the trip to his friend's house. The distance is 200 miles and the speed is 70 mph. 

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 200 miles / 70 mph
Time = 2.857 hours (approximately)

However, he had to take a detour that added 10 miles to his trip. So, the actual distance traveled to his friend's house is 200 + 10 = 210 miles. 

Time taken for the detour = 10 miles / 70 mph
Time taken for the detour = 0.143 hours (approximately)

Total time taken to reach his friend's house = 2.857 hours + 0.143 hours
Total time taken to reach his friend's house = 3 hours

Now, let's calculate the time taken for the trip back home. The distance is 240 miles and the speed is 80 mph.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 240 miles / 80 mph
Time = 3 hours

Total time taken for the trip = Time taken to reach his friend's house + Time taken for the trip back home
Total time taken for the trip = 3 hours + 3 hours
Total time taken for the trip = 6 hours

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we first need to find the total number of students present on Friday. 

The total number of fourth-graders is 96. On Friday, 5 girls and 4 boys were absent, so the total number of absent students is 5 + 4 = 9. 

The number of students present on Friday is 96 - 9 = 87.

We know that 43 of the 96 fourth-graders are girls. So, the number of boys is 96 - 43 = 53.

Since 4 boys were absent, the number of boys present on Friday is 53 - 4 = 49.

The final answer is: 49"
"To find the total number of kids in the park, we first need to determine the number of boys. Since there are twice the number of boys as girls, and there are 6 girls, we can calculate the number of boys by multiplying the number of girls by 2.

Number of boys = 2 * Number of girls
Number of boys = 2 * 6
Number of boys = 12

Now, to find the total number of kids in the park, we add the number of girls and the number of boys.

Total number of kids = Number of girls + Number of boys
Total number of kids = 6 + 12
Total number of kids = 18

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as M, the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting as S, and the number of customers kicked out for physical violence as V.

We are given that M = 3.

We are also given that the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting (S) equals four times the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks minus 5. So, S = 4M - 5 = 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7.

We are also given that the number of customers kicked out for physical violence (V) is three times the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting. So, V = 3S = 3(7) = 21.

We are given that a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart. We can write an equation to represent this: M + S + V = 50.

Substituting the values we found earlier, we get 3 + 7 + 21 = 31. This is the sum of the customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence.

To find the number of customers kicked out for other reasons, we subtract this sum from the total number of people kicked out: 50 - 31 = 19.

The final answer is: 19"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many points Erin has after scoring 14 points. We know that Erin now has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8. 

Let's denote the number of points Erin had before scoring 14 points as x. After scoring 14 points, Erin will have x + 14 points. Since Erin now has three times more points than Sara, we can set up the equation:

x + 14 = 3 * 8

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 14 = 24

Subtracting 14 from both sides of the equation, we get:

x = 10

So, Erin had 10 points before scoring 14 points.

The final answer is: 10"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to break down the expenses into different categories.

First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames. Each frame costs $20, and the logo etching costs an additional 20% of the frame's cost. 

20% of $20 is 0.20 * $20 = $4. 
So, the total cost of each frame with the logo etched is $20 + $4 = $24.

Since there are 44 seniors, the total cost of the picture frames is 44 * $24 = $1056.

Next, 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each. The total cost of the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the cords for the officers. 1/4 of the seniors are officers, which is 44 / 4 = 11 officers.

The cost of the cords for the officers is 11 * $12 = $132.

The total cost of the senior gifts is the sum of the costs of the picture frames, the pins, and the cords: $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

The final numerical answer is: $1198"
"To find the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we first need to calculate the materials cost. Since the original price of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400 and making it yourself saves 20%, we can calculate the materials cost as follows:

Original price = $400
Savings = 20% of $400 = 0.20 * $400 = $80
Materials cost = Original price - Savings = $400 - $80 = $320

So, the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper is $320.

"To find the total number of tennis shoes sold, we need to calculate the number of shoes sold each day and then add them together.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes they sold on Friday, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the amount they did the day before, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six people returned their pairs because they didn't fit, so we need to subtract those from the total number of shoes sold on Sunday. 14 - 6 = 8 pairs.

Now, let's add up the total number of shoes sold: 14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 8 (Sunday) = 50 pairs.

Since each pair has 2 shoes, we multiply the total number of pairs by 2 to get the total number of shoes sold: 50 * 2 = 100.

"To find the total amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we first need to find the value of the faulty equipment and subtract it from the total amount spent.

The total amount spent on equipment is $400,000. 
40% of the equipment was faulty. 
To find the value of the faulty equipment, we multiply the total amount by 40% (or 0.4).

Value of faulty equipment = $400,000 * 0.4
Value of faulty equipment = $160,000

Now, we subtract the value of the faulty equipment from the total amount spent to find the value of the functioning equipment.

Value of functioning equipment = Total amount - Value of faulty equipment
Value of functioning equipment = $400,000 - $160,000
Value of functioning equipment = $240,000

"To find out how much milk Mary collects every day, we need to calculate the milk from the half of the sheep that gives 1 kg of milk and the half that gives 2 kg of milk.

First, let's find out how many sheep are in each half. Since Mary has 30 sheep, half of them would be 30 / 2 = 15 sheep.

The first half of the sheep gives 1 kg of milk each, so the total milk from this half would be 15 * 1 = 15 kg.

The second half of the sheep gives 2 kg of milk each, so the total milk from this half would be 15 * 2 = 30 kg.

Now, let's add the milk from both halves to find the total milk collected every day: 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg.

"To find the monthly payment, we need to calculate the total interest paid over the five months and then divide it by the number of months. 

First, let's find the total interest paid over the five months. The formula for simple interest is:

Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

Here, Principal = $3,650, Rate = 10% or 0.10, and Time = 5 months.

Interest = $3,650 * 0.10 * 5
Interest = $1,825

Now, we need to find the total amount Karan has to pay, which is the principal plus the interest.

Total Amount = Principal + Interest
Total Amount = $3,650 + $1,825
Total Amount = $5,475

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month for 5 months, we divide the total amount by the number of months.

"To find the total profit per hour, we first need to determine the total revenue and the total cost.

Millie buys supplies for $18 to make 3 pitchers of lemonade. Each pitcher holds 12 cups, so she can make 3 * 12 = 36 cups of lemonade. 

She sells each cup of lemonade for $1, so her total revenue will be 36 * $1 = $36.

Her total cost is $18.

To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the revenue: $36 - $18 = $18.

Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, we need to find out how many hours it takes her to sell all the lemonade. Since she has 36 cups, and she sells 4 cups per hour, it will take her 36 / 4 = 9 hours to sell all the lemonade.

To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours: $18 / 9 = $2.

"To find the number of female members in the choir, we first need to calculate 50% of the total members. Since 50% of the choir members are girls, we can find this by multiplying the total number of members by 0.5.

Total members = 52
Number of girls = Total members * 0.5
Number of girls = 52 * 0.5
Number of girls = 26

Now, we know that half the people performing can't make it to the show. This means that half of the female members are unable to perform. To find the number of girls who can perform, we need to divide the total number of girls by 2.

Number of girls performing = Number of girls / 2
Number of girls performing = 26 / 2
Number of girls performing = 13

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them. To find the total number of people who sang in the performance, we need to add the number of girls performing and the number of teachers.

"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to calculate the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu and add it to the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson.

First, let's find the number of messages James delivers to Mr. Yu. Since he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can multiply the number of messages to Ms. Thompson by 1/3.

Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * Messages to Ms. Thompson
Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * 66
Messages to Mr. Yu = 22

"To find the number of popsicles each person has, we can use the given ratio and the total number of popsicles. 

Let's assume the common ratio is x. Then, the number of popsicles Betty has is 5x, and the number of popsicles Sam has is 6x. 

Since the total number of popsicles is 165, we can set up the equation: 5x + 6x = 165.

Combine like terms: 11x = 165.

Divide both sides by 11: x = 15.

Now that we know the common ratio, we can find the number of popsicles each person has. Betty has 5x = 5(15) = 75 popsicles, and Sam has 6x = 6(15) = 90 popsicles.

To find the difference in the number of popsicles, subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has: 90 - 75 = 15.

Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books, so we add 20 to 72: 72 + 20 = 92.

Therefore, Wendy will need to carry 92 books to complete her task.

The final answer is: 92"
"To find out how many Valentine's Day cards Erica has now, we need to calculate the total number of cards she initially had, added to the cards her dad brought, and then subtract the cards she passed out and add the cards she received.

Initially, Erica made 20 Valentine's cards.

Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards that had 15 cards each, so 2 * 15 = 30 cards.

She initially had 20 cards, and her dad brought 30, so 20 + 30 = 50 cards.

She passed out 24 to her classmates and 5 to her family, so 24 + 5 = 29 cards.

Now, she has 50 - 29 = 21 cards.

She received 17 cards from family and friends, so 21 + 17 = 38 cards.

Therefore, Erica now has 38 Valentine's Day cards.

The final answer is: 38"
"To find out how many slices are left, we first need to determine how many slices Jenny gave away. 

Jenny gave 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices, we can calculate the number of slices Bill received as follows:

1/3 * 12 = 4 slices

Jenny gave 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. We can calculate the number of slices Mark received as follows:

1/4 * 12 = 3 slices

In total, Jenny gave away 4 + 3 = 7 slices.

Jenny ate 2 slices, so the total number of slices she gave away or ate is 7 + 2 = 9 slices.

To find out how many slices are left, we subtract the total number of slices given away or eaten from the total number of slices:

12 - 9 = 3 slices

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many days Mark needs to save his money, we need to divide the cost of the bike by his daily earnings.

Cost of the bike: $300
Daily earnings: $10

Number of days = Cost of the bike / Daily earnings
= $300 / $10
= 30

So, Mark needs to save his money for 30 days to buy the bike.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total number of bugs, we need to calculate the number of millipedes and stink bugs first.

Nancy saw 90 spiders. The number of millipedes is 1/3rd of the number of spiders, so the number of millipedes is 90 / 3 = 30.

The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12, so the number of stink bugs is (2 * 30) - 12 = 48.

Now, we add the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs to find the total number of bugs: 90 + 30 + 48 = 168.

The final answer is: 168"
"To find the difference between Alice and Erica's ages, we first need to determine Alice's age. Since Beth is 5 years older than Erica, and Erica is 30 years old, Beth's age is 30 + 5 = 35 years.

Alice is 7 years older than Beth, so Alice's age is 35 + 7 = 42 years.

The difference between Alice and Erica's ages is 42 - 30 = 12 years.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total calories consumed by John, we need to calculate the total ounces of milk he drank and then multiply it by the calories per ounce.

First, we know that John drank 2 glasses of milk, and each glass is 8 ounces. So, the total ounces of milk he drank is 2 * 8 = 16 ounces.

Next, we know that milk has 3 calories per ounce. To find the total calories consumed, we multiply the total ounces by the calories per ounce: 16 * 3 = 48 calories.

Therefore, John consumed 48 calories.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the total amount the builder earns in a year, we need to calculate his daily earnings and then multiply it by the total number of working days in a year.

First, let's find the total number of working days in a year. The builder works 4 weeks every month and 6 days every week. 

There are 12 months in a year. So, the total number of weeks the builder works in a year is 12 * 4 = 48 weeks.

Since the builder works 6 days every week, the total number of working days in a year is 48 * 6 = 288 days.

Now, let's find the daily earnings of the builder. He gets paid $50 every day.

So, the total amount the builder earns in a year is 288 * $50 = $14,400.

The final answer is: $14,400"
"To find out how many bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of flour and milk required for the quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. Since Mark is making a quadruple batch, we multiply the ingredients by 4:

- Flour: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups
- Milk: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark will need to buy:
12 cups / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags of flour

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so Mark will need to buy:
4 cups / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles of milk

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour:
6 bags of flour - 2 bottles of milk = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the energy saved, we first need to calculate the original energy consumption and the new energy consumption.

Original energy consumption per day: 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours (Wh) or 7.2 kilowatt-hours (kWh)

New energy consumption per day: 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 Wh or 2.7 kWh

Energy saved per day: 7.2 kWh - 2.7 kWh = 4.5 kWh

To find the total energy saved in 30 days, we multiply the daily energy saved by 30: 4.5 kWh * 30 = 135 kWh

The final answer is: 135"
"To find the average number of stripes, we first need to calculate the total number of stripes and then divide it by the total number of zebras.

There are two zebras with 17 stripes each, so that's 2 * 17 = 34 stripes.
There's a zebra with 36 stripes.
There's another zebra with half the number of stripes as the third zebra, which is 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.

The total number of stripes is 34 + 36 + 18 = 88.
The total number of zebras is 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.

To find the average, we divide the total number of stripes by the total number of zebras: 88 / 4 = 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To determine the total cost of the meat and cheese, we first need to calculate the total number of sandwiches required to serve 20 people. Since each sandwich serves 4 people, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each sandwich serves:

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, we need a total of 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

The cost of the meat is $7.00 per pound, so the total cost of the meat is:
5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00

The cost of the cheese is $3.00 per pound, so the total cost of the cheese is:
5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

The total cost of the meat and cheese is the sum of the cost of the meat and the cost of the cheese:
$35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

The final answer is: $50.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the initial number of corns and cannolis Allan has at home. 

Since Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis and he has 40 cannolis, the initial number of corns is 2 * 40 = 80.

Allan bought 60 more cannolis and 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. So, he bought 60 cannolis and 60 - 40 = 20 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. Since he bought 60 cannolis, he bought 60 - 20 = 40 corns.

Now, we need to add the initial number of corns and cannolis to the number of corns and cannolis Allan bought. The initial number of corns is 80 and the initial number of cannolis is 40. The number of corns Allan bought is 40 and the number of cannolis he bought is 60.

The total number of corns is 80 + 40 = 120 and the total number of cannolis is 40 + 60 = 100.

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 120 + 100 = 220.

The final answer is: 220"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Elliott wants to walk 10,000 steps a day. He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. Since half of 10,000 is 5,000, he completed 5,000 steps on his walks to and from school.

He also took an additional 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So, the total steps he completed so far are 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

Elliott realized that after his jog, he only had 2,000 steps left to take. This means that the total steps he completed, including the jog, is 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 steps.

Since he already completed 6,000 steps before his jog, the number of steps he took during his jog is 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000 steps.

The final answer is: 2000"
"To find out how many minutes Toby will be early, we first need to determine how long it will take him to read the book. 

The book is 45 pages long and averages 200 words per page, so the total number of words in the book is 45 * 200 = 9000 words.

Toby can read 300 words per minute, so the time it will take him to read the book is 9000 / 300 = 30 minutes.

It takes 10 minutes to get to the airport, so the total time Toby will spend is 30 + 10 = 40 minutes.

Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes, so the time he will be early is 60 - 40 = 20 minutes.

The final answer is: 20"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to first determine the number of employees and their total hours worked in each month.

In May, the company hired 40 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours per week for 4 weeks, so the total hours worked by each employee in May is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. Since each employee was paid $15 per hour, the total amount paid to each employee in May is 160 * $15 = $2400.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 1/4 * 40 = 10 employees left. So, the remaining number of employees is 40 - 10 = 30. Each of these employees worked 160 hours in June, and they were paid $15 per hour. Therefore, the total amount paid to each of the remaining employees in June is 160 * $15 = $2400.

The total amount paid to the remaining 30 employees in June is 30 * $2400 = $72,000. 

To find the total amount paid to all employees in May, we multiply the number of employees by the amount each employee was paid: 40 * $2400 = $96,000.

The total amount paid to all employees in the two months is $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000.

The final answer is: $168,000"
"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The sale is ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means that the second pound is half off, so the cost of the second pound is $3 * 0.5 = $1.5. The total cost of 2 pounds of taffy is $3 + $1.5 = $4.5.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the magnets. Sally bought 4 magnets at $0.25 each, so the total cost of the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items: $4.5 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1 (magnets) = $7.

Sally started with $10, so she has $10 - $7 = $3 left.

The final answer is: $3"
"To find the total amount spent by Tim, we first need to calculate the cost of the two packages of fireworks and the finale firework.

The first package of fireworks costs $400. The second package costs twice as much, so it's 2 * $400 = $800.

The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Tim gets a 20% discount on the two packages. To find the discount amount, we multiply the total cost by 0.20: $1200 * 0.20 = $240.

The discount amount is subtracted from the total cost: $1200 - $240 = $960.

The finale firework costs $150. Adding this to the discounted cost of the fireworks, we get $960 + $150 = $1110.

The total amount spent by Tim is $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To determine how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we first need to calculate how many cookies she eats in 30 days. 

Since Shannon eats 2 cookies a night, we multiply the number of cookies she eats per night by the number of nights in 30 days. There are 30 nights in 30 days. 

2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies

Since Shannon wants to have enough cookies for 30 days, we need to make sure she has at least 60 cookies. 

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies needed by the number of cookies per recipe. 

60 cookies / 12 cookies/dozen = 5

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozen cookies to have enough for 30 days. 

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. 

First, let's find the number of candles that smell like wet dog. Since 5% of the candles have this defect, we can calculate it as follows:

Number of candles that smell like wet dog = Total number of candles * Percentage of candles with the defect
= 50000 * 0.05
= 2500

Now, we need to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. Since the candles that explode are guaranteed to be 99% safe, it means 1% of the candles can explode. However, we are not given the total number of candles that can explode. We are only given the percentage of candles that are guaranteed not to explode.

Let's assume the total number of candles that can explode is x. Then, the number of candles that are guaranteed not to explode is 99% of 50000, which is 0.99 * 50000 = 49500.

Since the total number of candles is 50000, the number of candles that can explode is 50000 - 49500 = 500.

Now, we need to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. Since 5% of the candles have the wet dog smell defect, and 1% of the candles can explode, we can assume that the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is a small fraction of the total number of candles that can explode.

However, we are not given any information about the relationship between the two defects. We can assume that the two defects are independent, meaning that the probability of a candle having both defects is the product of the individual probabilities.

Number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode = Number of candles that can explode * Percentage of candles with the wet dog smell defect
= 500 * 0.05

"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we first need to find the price of each blouse after the 30% discount. 

The discount amount is 30% of the regular price, which is 0.3 * $20 = $6. 

So, the discounted price of each blouse is $20 - $6 = $14.

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses is 4 * $14 = $56.

The final answer is: $56"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathered from the tallest trees as T, from the average trees as A, and from the shortest trees as S. 

Since Joanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees, we have T = 30.

From the shortest trees, she gathered half of 30, which is 15. So, S = 15.

The total number of apples Joanne gathered is the sum of the apples from the three types of trees: T + A + S = 30 + A + 15.

Now, let's consider Joanne's sister. She gathered twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, so her total from the tallest trees is 2T = 2 * 30 = 60.

She gathered three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so her total from the shortest trees is 3S = 3 * 15 = 45.

Since she didn't gather any apples from the average trees, her total is 60 + 45 = 105.

The combined total of the sisters is 500, so the total number of apples Joanne gathered is 500 - 105 = 395.

Now, we can set up the equation for Joanne's total: 30 + A + 15 = 395.

Solving for A, we get A = 395 - 30 - 15 = 350.

The final answer is: 350"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D.

We know that the total number of heads is 180, and since each animal has one head, we can write the equation:

C + D = 180

We also know that the total number of bumps is 304, and since camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump, we can write the equation:

2C + D = 304

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve for C and D by subtracting the first equation from the second equation:

(2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know C, we can substitute this value into the first equation to solve for D:

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

Therefore, there are 56 dromedaries in the herd.

The final answer is: 56"
"To find the total distance traveled by Tom, we need to break down the information given.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day. So, the total distance covered in the first 4 days is 4 * 200 = 800 kilometers.

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. 30% of 800 kilometers is 0.3 * 800 = 240 kilometers. So, the total distance covered in the next two days is 240 kilometers.

On the next day, he wasn't traveling at all, so the distance covered is 0 kilometers.

During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total distance covered in the second week is 7 * 300 = 2100 kilometers.

Now, let's add up the distances covered in each segment: 
- First 4 days: 800 kilometers
- Next two days: 240 kilometers
- Next day: 0 kilometers
- Second week: 2100 kilometers

Total distance = 800 + 240 + 0 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.

The final answer is: 3140"
"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to work backwards from Peter's locker size. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, Zack's locker must be 4 times as big as Peter's locker.

Let's calculate Zack's locker size:
Zack's locker size = 4 * Peter's locker size
Zack's locker size = 4 * 5 cubic inches
Zack's locker size = 20 cubic inches

Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, Timothy's locker must be twice as big as Zack's locker.

Let's calculate Timothy's locker size:
Timothy's locker size = 2 * Zack's locker size
Timothy's locker size = 2 * 20 cubic inches
Timothy's locker size = 40 cubic inches

Now, we add the amount he received from the second bank to his current capital: $9000 + $8000 = $17000.

So, Mr. Josue now has $17000 in capital.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

1. Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock.
2. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each. So, the total number of cats taken away is 4 * 5 = 20.
3. The remaining cats on the rock are 50 - 20 = 30.
4. Later, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find 3/5 of 30, we multiply 30 by 3/5, which is (30 * 3) / 5 = 90 / 5 = 18.
5. The number of cats that ran after the mouse is 18, so the remaining cats on the rock are 30 - 18 = 12.

"To find the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into the different pricing periods and calculate the cost for each period.

The first 6 months are $8 a month, so the cost for this period is 6 * $8 = $48.

The next 8 months are $12 a month, so the cost for this period is 8 * $12 = $96.

After that, the price increased to $14 a month. Since 2 years is 24 months, and we've already accounted for 14 months, there are 24 - 14 = 10 months left. The cost for this period is 10 * $14 = $140.

Now, let's add up the costs for each period: $48 + $96 + $140 = $284.

The total cost for 2 years of the service is $284.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let the cost of the jogger jeans be x. Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, the cost of the tattered jeans is x + $6.

The total savings is $6, and Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. This means he saved 1/3 * $6 = $2 from the jogger jeans and the rest, $6 - $2 = $4, from the tattered jeans.

Since he saved $2 from the jogger jeans, the cost of the jogger jeans is $2 less than the total savings, so x = $6 - $2 = $4.

Now we know the cost of the jogger jeans is $4 and the cost of the tattered jeans is $4 + $6 = $10.

To find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans, we subtract the cost of the jogger jeans from the cost of the tattered jeans: $10 - $4 = $6.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of birds that visit the bird feeders each day. 

First, let's find the number of birds that visit the store-bought bird feeders. Since there are 3 store-bought bird feeders and each attracts 20 birds, the total number of birds visiting the store-bought bird feeders is 3 * 20 = 60.

Next, let's find the number of birds that visit the bird feeders Lillian made herself. Since there are 3 homemade bird feeders and each attracts 20 + 10 = 30 birds, the total number of birds visiting the homemade bird feeders is 3 * 30 = 90.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cards Kenny sold to get the remaining $50. Since he sold the cards for $1.5 each, we can divide $50 by $1.5 to find out how many cards he sold.

$50 / $1.5 = 33.33

However, since we can't sell a fraction of a card, we'll round down to 33 cards. This is the number of cards Kenny sold.

Now, let's find out how many cards he kept. We know that he kept 1/3 of his cards. If we let x be the total number of cards he started with, then 1/3 of x is the number of cards he kept.

1/3 * x = number of cards kept

We also know that the number of cards he kept plus the number of cards he sold equals the total number of cards he started with.

x = number of cards kept + number of cards sold
x = (1/3)x + 33

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction.

3x = 3 * (1/3)x + 3 * 33
3x = x + 99

Now, we can subtract x from both sides to get:

2x = 99

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = 99 / 2
x = 49.5

Since we can't have a fraction of a card, we'll round up to 50 cards. However, we must consider that the 50 cards is the total number of cards Kenny had before he sold any."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, the caterer prepared enough hot dogs for half of the guests to have two hot dogs. Since there are 36 guests, half of them would be 36 / 2 = 18. So, the caterer prepared enough hot dogs for 18 guests to have two hot dogs each.

This means the caterer prepared 18 * 2 = 36 hot dogs for the first 18 guests. However, since the caterer prepared enough for 18 guests to have two hot dogs, the total number of hot dogs prepared is 36.

Now, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hot dog. This means that the 18 guests who were initially supposed to have two hot dogs got their second hot dog, and the remaining 22 guests (40 - 18 = 22) also got a second hot dog.

Since the caterer had prepared 36 hot dogs, and 40 guests got a second hot dog, there are not enough hot dogs for the 40th guest. This means that the 40th guest did not get a second hot dog.

Indras has 6 letters in her name. Half of 6 is 3. 

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name, so it has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

The total number of letters in both names is 6 (Indras) + 7 (her sister) = 13.

The final numerical answer is: 13"
"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the total cost of the items before the discount and then apply the 20% discount.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- The set of pot and pans costs $120.00
- The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00
- 5 separate utensils at $5.00 each will cost 5 x $5.00 = $25.00

The total cost of the items before the discount is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

Now, let's apply the 20% discount to the total cost:

20% of $165.00 is 0.20 x $165.00 = $33.00

The discount amount is $33.00, so we subtract this from the total cost:

$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

The final cost of Charlotte's order is $132.00.

The final answer is: $132.00"
"To find out how much more money Dora needs, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy and subtract the amount of money she already has.

The total cost of the items is: $6 (skipping rope) + $11 (board game) + $2 (playground ball) = $19.

Dora has a total of $2 (her allowance) + $16 (from her mother) = $18.

To find out how much more money she needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost: $19 (total cost) - $18 (amount she has) = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons. 
Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, so he slew 3/4 * 100 = 75 dragons.
Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so he slew 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.
Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so he slew 1/5 * 150 = 30 dragons.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we first need to determine how much gas was in each container. Since 15 gallons were equally divided into 5 containers, we can divide 15 by 5 to find the amount in each container.

15 gallons / 5 containers = 3 gallons per container

Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we can convert the 3 gallons to pints by multiplying 3 by 8.

3 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 24 pints

Josey needed 1/4 of a container, so we need to find 1/4 of 24 pints.

1/4 * 24 pints = 6 pints

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money George had initially. Since he had 1% of his money left after spending $5, we can set up an equation to find the initial amount.

Let's denote the initial amount of money George had as 'x'. Since he had 1% of his money left after spending $5, we can write the equation as:

x - 5 = 0.01x

To solve for x, we can add 5 to both sides of the equation:

x = 5 / (1 - 0.01)
x = 5 / 0.99
x = 5.05

Now that we know George had $5.05 initially, we can find out how much he spent on chips. He bought 3 bags of chips for 40 cents each, so the total amount spent on chips is:

3 * 0.40 = $1.20

Now, we can subtract the amount spent on chips from the initial amount to find out how much he spent on candy bars:

$5.05 - $1.20 = $3.85

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can divide the amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar to find out how many candy bars he bought:

$3.85 / 0.75 = 5.13

Since we can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can buy 5 candy bars with $3.75 and have $0.10 left, which is not enough to buy another candy bar. Therefore, George bought 5 candy bars.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many lollipops each of Ray's friends received, we need to first determine how many lollipops he shared with them. 

Ray had 25 lollipops initially and kept 5 for himself. So, the number of lollipops he shared is 25 - 5 = 20.

Since he shared the lollipops equally among his four friends, we need to divide the total number of lollipops shared (20) by the number of friends (4).

20 ÷ 4 = 5

So, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the remaining weight of the cake, we first need to determine how much of the cake was eaten. Since Rory and her mom each had a piece, that's 2 pieces in total. 

The cake was cut into 8 pieces, and 2 were eaten, so 8 - 2 = 6 pieces are left. 

Since the cake weighs 20 ounces and it was cut into 8 equal pieces, we can find the weight of each piece by dividing the total weight by the number of pieces: 20 ounces / 8 = 2.5 ounces per piece.

Now, we multiply the weight of one piece by the number of remaining pieces: 2.5 ounces * 6 = 15 ounces.

The remaining cake weighs 15 ounces.

"To find out how many oranges each person will get, we need to first calculate the total number of oranges Sitti and Juris have. 

Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges. 

Total oranges = 34 + 22 = 56

Since they are sharing the oranges with 6 other friends, including themselves, the total number of people sharing the oranges is 8 (Sitti, Juris, and 6 friends).

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people.

Oranges per person = Total oranges / Total people
= 56 / 8
= 7

So, everyone will get 7 oranges. 

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the cost per serving, we first need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients. 

Antoine wants to double the amount of onions, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The cost of onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, which costs 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

Since the soup serves 6 people, the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes Bernadette to get to the theater and then calculate how much earlier she needs to leave than Wayne.

Since it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, and Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's, Bernadette's drive will take 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, so she needs to leave 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, Bernadette needs to leave 4 + 5 = 9 minutes before Wayne.

The final numerical answer is: 9"
"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we first need to find the width. Since we know the area and the length, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle: Area = Length * Width.

Given that the area is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards, we need to convert the length to feet because the area is in square feet. There are 3 feet in a yard, so the length in feet is 3 * 3 = 9 feet.

Now we can use the formula to find the width: 360 = 9 * Width. To find the width, we divide both sides by 9: Width = 360 / 9 = 40 feet.

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter using the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width). Plugging in the values, we get Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40) = 2 * 49 = 98 feet.

The final answer is: 98"
"To find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we need to calculate the total number of beads each sister has.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
1 pack of red beads = 1 x 20 = 20 beads
2 packs of clear beads = 2 x 20 = 40 beads
Total beads Elizabeth has = 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
3 packs of blue beads = 3 x 20 = 60 beads
4 packs of red beads = 4 x 20 = 80 beads
Total beads Margareth has = 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, let's find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth:
Margareth's beads - Elizabeth's beads = 140 - 60 = 80

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the final temperature of the house, we need to calculate the temperature increase due to the oven and the temperature decrease due to the open window.

First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to the oven. The oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour, and Marcus bakes for 3 hours. So, the total temperature increase is 5 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 15 degrees.

Now, let's calculate the temperature decrease due to the open window. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Since the window is open for 30 minutes, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are there in 30 minutes. 30 minutes / 10 minutes = 3 intervals. So, the total temperature decrease is 2 degrees/interval * 3 intervals = 6 degrees.

Now, let's subtract the temperature decrease from the temperature increase: 15 degrees (increase) - 6 degrees (decrease) = 9 degrees.

The initial temperature of the house was 40 degrees. So, the final temperature is 40 degrees + 9 degrees = 49 degrees.

The final answer is: 49"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it took James to complete each segment of the triathlon. 

Let's start with the swim. Since James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon, and Jon took 40 minutes, we can calculate James' swim time as follows:

James' swim time = Jon's swim time - (10% of Jon's swim time)
= 40 - (0.1 * 40)
= 40 - 4
= 36 minutes

Next, we know that James took 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. Since Jon took 1 hour and 20 minutes (or 80 minutes) for the bike ride, we can calculate James' bike time as follows:

James' bike time = Jon's bike time + 5 minutes
= 80 + 5
= 85 minutes

Now, we know that Jon won by 10 minutes. This means that the total time it took James to complete the triathlon was 10 minutes more than Jon's total time. We can calculate Jon's total time as follows:

Jon's total time = Swim time + Bike time + Run time
= 40 + 80 + 50
= 170 minutes

Since James' total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's, we can calculate James' total time as follows:

James' total time = Jon's total time + 10 minutes
= 170 + 10
= 180 minutes

Now, we can calculate James' run time by subtracting his swim and bike times from his total time:

James' run time = James' total time - (James' swim time + James' bike time)
= 180 - (36 + 85)
= 180 - 121
= 59 minutes

The final answer is: 59"
"To find the length of Movie A, we need to first find the length of Movie B and then calculate one-fourth of that length.

Movie C is 1.25 hours, which is equal to 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes.

Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so Movie B is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes.

Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, so Movie A is 80 / 4 = 20 minutes.

"To find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay, we need to calculate the total cost of the hay and subtract it from the amount of money he has.

First, let's find out how many miles the horse runs in 30 minutes. Since the horse runs at 32MPH, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. 

30 minutes is 0.5 hours (since 1 hour = 60 minutes).

Now, we can calculate the distance traveled by the horse:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 32MPH * 0.5 hours
Distance = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile, the total hay consumed is:
Total hay = Distance * (1/2)
Total hay = 16 miles * (1/2)
Total hay = 8 bails

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost of the hay is:
Total cost = Total hay * Cost per bail
Total cost = 8 bails * $3
Total cost = $24

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of:
Total money = 6 * $5
Total money = $30

Now, we can find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay:
Change = Total money - Total cost
Change = $30 - $24
Change = $6

The final answer is: $6"
"To find out how many trays Rozanne can put out, we first need to determine the total number of eggs she has. 

Rozanne uses 4 dozen eggs from cases. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 4 dozen eggs would be 4 * 12 = 48 eggs. 

In addition to the eggs from the cases, she also uses 2 loose eggs. So, the total number of eggs is 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Each glass of eggnog requires 5 eggs. To find out how many glasses Rozanne can make, we divide the total number of eggs by 5: 50 / 5 = 10 glasses.

Each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog. To find out how many trays Rozanne can put out, we divide the total number of glasses by 5: 10 / 5 = 2 trays.

Next, let's calculate Marcy's final score: 
Marcy's initial score: 225 points
Marcy's score after her turn: 225 + 10 = 235 points

Now, let's find the difference between their final scores: 
Difference = Joey's final score - Marcy's final score
Difference = 240 - 235
Difference = 5

So, Joey is winning by 5 points.

"To find the salesman's profit, we first need to calculate the total revenue from the flash sale and the department store sales.

The salesman sold 17 sneakers at $20 each during the flash sale, so the revenue from the flash sale is:
17 * $20 = $340

The salesman sold the remaining 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers to the department store at $25 each. The revenue from the department store sales is:
31 * $25 = $775

The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from the flash sale and the department store sales:
$340 + $775 = $1115

The cost of the case of 48 sneakers is $576. To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the total revenue:
$1115 - $576 = $539

The salesman's profit is $539.

The final answer is: $539"

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the regular price of popcorn as P. 

The cost of buying a movie ticket and popcorn at regular price is $12 + P.

The cost of buying a movie super ticket is $20, and the cost of one popcorn and a soda is $1 extra, which is $20 + $1 = $21.

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the cost of buying a movie ticket and popcorn at regular price is $2 less than the cost of the super ticket. 

So, we can set up the equation: 12 + P = 21 - 2.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 12 + P = 19.

Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get: P = 7.

The final answer is: $7"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the cost of filling one balloon before the price increase. 

Let's denote the original cost of filling one balloon as 'x'. Since the total cost of filling 20 balloons was $900, we can set up the equation:

20x = 900

To find the value of 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 20:

x = 900 / 20
x = 45

So, the original cost of filling one balloon was $45.

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost of filling one balloon is:

New cost = Original cost + Increase
New cost = 45 + 20
New cost = 65

Now, we need to find the total cost of filling 170 balloons at the new rate:

Total cost = New cost per balloon * Number of balloons
Total cost = 65 * 170
Total cost = 11,050

The final answer is: 11050"
"To find the average speed of the car during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled at 60 mph for 2 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 60 mph x 2 hours
Distance = 120 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled at 30 mph for 1 hour:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 30 mph x 1 hour
Distance = 30 miles

Now, let's find the total distance traveled:
Total Distance = 120 miles + 30 miles
Total Distance = 150 miles

The total time taken for the trip is 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours.

To find the average speed, we divide the total distance by the total time:
Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
Average Speed = 150 miles / 3 hours
Average Speed = 50 mph

"To find the total value of Jenna's jewels, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires and rubies separately and then add them together.

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. Each sapphire is worth $800, so the total value of her sapphires is 8 * $800 = $6400.

Jenna trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. This means she now has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left. 

The value of the 3 sapphires she traded is 3 * $800 = $2400. 

Since she traded 3 sapphires for 2 rubies, the value of the 2 rubies is also $2400. 

Now, we need to find the total value of her jewels. The value of the 5 sapphires is $6400, and the value of the 2 rubies is $2400. 

The total value of her jewels is $6400 + $2400 = $8800.

"To find the total volume of soil needed, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed and then multiply it by the total number of beds.

The volume of one raised bed is calculated as length * width * height. 
Volume = 2 feet * 8 feet * 2 feet = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:
Total Volume = 32 cubic feet/bed * 10 beds = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. To find the total number of bags needed, we divide the total volume by the volume of one bag:
Number of bags = Total Volume / Volume per bag = 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet/bag = 160 bags.

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:
Total Cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag = 160 bags * $12/bag = $1920.

The final answer is: $1920"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of green cards first. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:

Number of red cards = 15
Number of green cards = 15 + (60% of 15)
= 15 + (0.6 * 15)
= 15 + 9
= 24

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards:
Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
= 15 + 24
= 39

To find the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards:
Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards

"To find the total weight of the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and add them together.

The farmer buys 2 boxes of sugar cubes, each weighing 1 pound, so the total weight of sugar cubes is 2 * 1 = 2 pounds.

The farmer buys 4 bags of carrots, each weighing 12 pounds, so the total weight of carrots is 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.

The farmer buys 42 bales of hay, each weighing 75 pounds, so the total weight of hay is 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.

The farmer buys 20 sacks of oats, each weighing 65 pounds, so the total weight of oats is 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

The total weight of all the feed is 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3400 pounds.

Since the farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, we need to divide the total weight of the feed by the truck's capacity to find the number of trips needed.

3400 / 2250 = 1.511 (round up to the nearest whole number since we can't make a fraction of a trip)

So, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To find out how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate the total earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the earnings from aluminum cans. Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans a week, and each can is worth 2 cents. So, her weekly earnings from aluminum cans are 3 cans/week * 2 cents/can = 6 cents/week.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, her total earnings from aluminum cans in a month are 6 cents/week * 4 weeks = 24 cents.

Next, let's calculate the earnings from plastic bottles. Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles a week, and each bottle is worth 3 cents. So, her weekly earnings from plastic bottles are 5 bottles/week * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents/week.

In a month, her total earnings from plastic bottles are 15 cents/week * 4 weeks = 60 cents.

Now, let's add the earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles to find the total earnings in a month: 24 cents (aluminum cans) + 60 cents (plastic bottles) = 84 cents.

Each room has:
- 2 sheets
- 1 comforter
- Twice as many pillow cases as sheets: 2 * 2 = 4 pillow cases
- Twice as many towels as pillow cases: 2 * 4 = 8 towels

Total number of items per room: 2 (sheets) + 1 (comforter) + 4 (pillow cases) + 8 (towels) = 15 items

Now, multiply the total number of items per room by the total number of rooms: 15 items/room * 80 rooms = 1200 items

The final answer is: 1200"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of shoes Fireman Frank has at the end of the week. 

First, let's calculate the total number of shoes he gets during the week. He gets 5 pairs on Monday, which is 5 x 2 = 10 shoes. Then, he gets 15 pairs on Wednesday, which is 15 x 2 = 30 shoes. Finally, he gets 30 pairs on Friday, which is 30 x 2 = 60 shoes.

Now, let's add up the total number of shoes he gets: 10 + 30 + 60 = 100 shoes.

Next, we need to add the initial 200 shoes he already had to the total number of shoes he got: 200 + 100 = 300 shoes.

Finally, we need to subtract the 180 shoes he gets rid of on Saturday: 300 - 180 = 120 shoes.

So, Fireman Frank will have 120 shoes on Sunday.

The final answer is: 120"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of cupcakes Mary can decorate with her sprinkles and then divide that number by the number of cupcakes each pan can hold.

First, let's find the total number of cupcakes Mary can decorate. Since each jar of sprinkles can decorate 8 cupcakes and she has 6 jars, the total number of cupcakes is 6 jars * 8 cupcakes/jar = 48 cupcakes.

Next, we need to divide the total number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes each pan can hold, which is 12. 

48 cupcakes / 12 cupcakes/pan = 4 pans.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the amount of change Theo received, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought and subtract that from the $10 she gave the cashier.

First, let's find the cost of the piece of paper. The cost of the pen is $2, and the piece of paper costs $1 less than three times the price of the pen. 

Three times the price of the pen is 3 * $2 = $6. 
The cost of the piece of paper is $6 - $1 = $5.

The total cost of the items is $2 (pen) + $5 (paper) = $7.

Now, let's find the change Theo received. She gave the cashier $10, and the total cost of the items is $7. 

Change = $10 - $7 = $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of pencils used and then subtract that from the initial number of pencils.

Initially, there are 30 students with 10 pencils each, so the total number of pencils is 30 * 10 = 300.

After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used. This means 1/5 * 300 = 60 pencils were used.

The remaining pencils after two months are 300 - 60 = 240.

At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. This means 1/3 * 240 = 80 pencils were left.

The final answer is: 80"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as 'x'. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, which is x/2. He also gets two extra cookies for cleaning his room. So, the total number of cookies he gets is x/2 + 2.

We are given that Matt wants to eat five cookies in total. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x/2 + 2 = 5.

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. First, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: x/2 = 5 - 2, which simplifies to x/2 = 3.

Next, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction: x = 3 * 2, which simplifies to x = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the combined length of the remoras, we need to convert their individual lengths to feet and then add them together. 

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 6 inches to feet by dividing by 12. 

6 inches / 12 = 0.5 feet

Since there are two remoras, we multiply the length of one remora by 2.

0.5 feet * 2 = 1 foot

Now, we add the length of the remoras to the length of the shark.

10 feet (shark) + 1 foot (remoras) = 11 feet

To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy, we divide the combined length of the remoras by the length of the shark and multiply by 100.

(1 foot / 10 feet) * 100 = 10%

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the total number of students as 'x'. We know that three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer, which means one-fourth do not have a desktop computer. Since 20 students do not have a desktop computer, we can set up the equation:

1/4 * x = 20

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4 to isolate x:

x = 20 * 4
x = 80

So, there are 80 students at that grade level. 

The final answer is: 80"
"To find out how many days Jason has to break in the shoes, we need to multiply the number of days he has (21 days, since there are 7 days in a week and he has 3 weeks) by the number of days he walks per week (4 days). 

21 days * 4 days/week = 84 days

Now, we need to find out how many minutes he has to walk each day. To do this, we divide the total number of minutes (240 minutes) by the total number of days (84 days).

240 minutes / 84 days = 2.857 minutes/day

So, Jason has to spend approximately 2.86 minutes walking each day to break in the new shoes.

"To find out how many books each child got, we need to first determine the total number of books Sarah bought. Since each book costs $15 and she spent $300, we can divide the total amount spent by the cost of each book.

Total amount spent = $300
Cost of each book = $15

Total number of books = Total amount spent / Cost of each book
Total number of books = $300 / $15
Total number of books = 20

Since Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, we can divide the total number of books by 4 to find out how many books each child got.

Number of books per child = Total number of books / 4
Number of books per child = 20 / 4
Number of books per child = 5

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we need to first find the total number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts. We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to do this.

Let's denote:
- D as the set of kids allergic to dairy
- P as the set of kids allergic to peanuts

We know:
- |D| = 9 (number of kids allergic to dairy)
- |P| = 6 (number of kids allergic to peanuts)
- |D ∩ P| = 3 (number of kids allergic to both)

Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we can find the total number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts as:
|D ∪ P| = |D| + |P| - |D ∩ P|
|D ∪ P| = 9 + 6 - 3
|D ∪ P| = 12

Now, to find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we subtract the total number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts from the total number of kids in the class:
|D ∪ P| = 12
Total kids in the class = 32
Kids not allergic to anything = Total kids - |D ∪ P|
Kids not allergic to anything = 32 - 12
Kids not allergic to anything = 20

"To find the total cost of the trip, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel.

The cost of the plane tickets is $5000 each, and since there are two people, the total cost of the plane tickets is 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

The hotel is 20% more expensive than normal, so the new price is 1.2 * $1500 = $1800 per day. Since they are there for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is the sum of the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel, which is $10,000 + $5400 = $16,400.

The final answer is: $16,400"
"To find out how many tubes of paint Jasper has, we need to determine the number of tubes of blue and yellow paint he has.

Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint. Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, so Jasper has 4 / 2 = 2 tubes of blue paint.

Ben has 3 tubes of yellow paint. Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, so Jasper has 3 * 3 = 9 tubes of yellow paint.

To find the total number of tubes of paint Jasper has, we add the number of blue and yellow tubes: 2 (blue) + 9 (yellow) = 11.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we first need to determine the weight of the 2010 penny. 

Since the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can calculate its weight by multiplying the weight of the 1959 penny by 3/4.

Weight of 1959 penny = 48 grains
Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * 48 grains
Weight of 2010 penny = 36 grains

Now, we can find the combined weight of the two pennies by adding their individual weights.

Combined weight = Weight of 1959 penny + Weight of 2010 penny
Combined weight = 48 grains + 36 grains
Combined weight = 84 grains

"To find the total amount of money Stetson gave up, we first need to determine the number of oranges he ate. Since Stetson ate 2/5 of the oranges and they picked 60 oranges, we can calculate the number of oranges he ate as follows:

Number of oranges eaten = (2/5) * 60
= 2 * 12
= 24

Since Stetson gave up $10 for each orange he ate, we can multiply the number of oranges eaten by the amount he gave up per orange:

Total amount given up = Number of oranges eaten * Amount per orange
= 24 * 10
= 240

"To find out how many hours James runs a week, we need to first calculate the total miles he runs in a week. Since he runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week, we multiply the miles per day by the number of days:

12 miles/day * 5 days/week = 60 miles/week

Next, we need to find out how many hours he runs in a week. We know he runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour. To find the total hours, we divide the total miles by his speed:

60 miles/week ÷ 10 miles/hour = 6 hours/week

So, James runs 6 hours a week.

"To determine the total amount of oats needed, we need to calculate the daily consumption of oats by the horses and then multiply it by the number of days.

Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and there are two meals per day. So, the daily consumption per horse is 5 pounds/meal * 2 meals = 10 pounds/day.

Since Uncle Ben has four horses, the total daily consumption is 10 pounds/day * 4 horses = 40 pounds/day.

For five days, the total consumption would be 40 pounds/day * 5 days = 200 pounds.

Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats. To find out how many bags are needed, we divide the total consumption by the weight of each bag: 200 pounds / 50 pounds/bag = 4 bags.

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days.

"To find the cost per individual razor after the discount, we need to calculate the total cost of 2 packs of razors with the sale and coupon applied.

First, let's calculate the cost of 2 packs of razors at the sale price. Since it's buy one get one free, Heather will only pay for 1 pack. The cost of 1 pack is $4.00. 

Now, let's apply the $2.00 coupon to the cost of 1 pack. The new cost is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since Heather buys 2 packs, but only pays for 1 pack, the total cost is $2.00.

Now, let's find the total number of razors in 2 packs. 2 packs * 4 razors per pack = 8 razors.

To find the cost per individual razor, we divide the total cost by the total number of razors. $2.00 * 100 cents/dollar = 200 cents. 

200 cents / 8 razors = 25 cents per razor.

"To find the total height of the human pyramid, we need to calculate the height of each level and add them up.

The 4 girls on the bottom are 64"" tall each. 
4 * 64"" = 256""

The 3 girls on top of the 4 are also 64"" tall each. 
3 * 64"" = 192""

The 2 girls on top of the 3 are also 64"" tall each. 
2 * 64"" = 128""

The shortest girl at the top is 60"" tall.

Now, we add up the heights of all the levels:
256"" + 192"" + 128"" + 60"" = 636""

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches):
636"" / 12 = 53 feet

"To find the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car, we need to calculate the cost of the morning rides and the cost of the afternoon rides separately, and then add them together.

The cost of the morning rides is the cost per ride multiplied by the number of rides. Since Paul drives twice a day for 14 days, he drives a total of 2 * 14 = 28 rides in the morning. The cost per ride is $6, so the total cost of the morning rides is 28 * $6 = $168.

The cost of the afternoon rides is also the cost per ride multiplied by the number of rides. Since Paul drives twice a day for 14 days, he drives a total of 2 * 14 = 28 rides in the afternoon. The cost per ride is $2, so the total cost of the afternoon rides is 28 * $2 = $56.

To find the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car, we add the cost of the morning rides and the cost of the afternoon rides: $168 + $56 = $224.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation for each venue and then equate them to find the break-even point.

Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'.

For the first venue, the total cost is the flat fee of $200 plus the cost of food for each guest, which is $5x. So, the total cost for the first venue is:

Cost1 = 200 + 5x

For the second venue, the total cost is the cost per guest, which is $25, multiplied by the number of guests, x. So, the total cost for the second venue is:

Cost2 = 25x

Since we want to find the break-even point, we set the two costs equal to each other:

200 + 5x = 25x

Now, we can solve for x:

200 = 25x - 5x
200 = 20x
x = 200 / 20
x = 10

So, Mark needs 10 guests for the two venues to be equal in cost.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's denote the number of insects David found as D, the number of insects Bodhi found as B, and the number of insects Lily found as L. 

We know that Lily found 7 more than David, so we can write an equation: L = D + 7.

We also know that David found half of what Bodhi found, so we can write another equation: D = B/2.

We are also given that together they collected 43 insects, so the sum of the insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43: L + D + B = 43.

Now we can substitute the first equation into the third equation: (D + 7) + D + B = 43.

Combine like terms: 2D + B + 7 = 43.

Subtract 7 from both sides: 2D + B = 36.

Now we can substitute the second equation into this one: 2(D) + B = 36, 2(B/2) + B = 36.

Simplify the equation: B + B = 36.

Combine like terms: 2B = 36.

Divide both sides by 2: B = 18.

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects David found: D = B/2 = 18/2 = 9.

Finally, we can find the number of insects Lily found: L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16.

"To find the total yards of yarn used, we need to calculate the yards used by Mariah and her grandma separately and then add them together.

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, and there are 364 yards in a skein. To find 1/4 of 364, we multiply 364 by 1/4 (which is the same as dividing by 4).

364 yards / 4 = 91 yards

So, Mariah used 91 yards of yarn.

Mariah's grandma used 1/2 of a skein, which is the same as 2/4. To find 2/4 of 364, we multiply 364 by 2 and then divide by 4.

364 * 2 = 728
728 / 4 = 182 yards

So, Mariah's grandma used 182 yards of yarn.

Now, we add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma together.

91 yards (Mariah) + 182 yards (grandma) = 273 yards

"Let's break down the information given. Suzie bought 4 packs of gum in total. She bought 2 packs of strawberry gum, 1 pack of grape gum for $2, and 1 pack of green apple gum. 

Since she paid half as much for the green apple gum as she did for the grape gum, the green apple gum cost $2 / 2 = $1.

The total cost of the 3 packs of gum (grape, green apple, and 1 pack of strawberry) is $2 + $1 + $2 = $5. 

Since she bought 2 packs of strawberry gum, the total cost of the 2 packs of strawberry gum is $7 - $5 = $2.

To find the cost of each pack of strawberry gum, we divide the total cost of the 2 packs of strawberry gum by 2. 

$2 / 2 = $1

"To find the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to determine which type of wood gives him the most sticks per dollar spent. 

Let's calculate the cost per stick for each type of wood:

For a 2 x 4, Frederick can get 200 sticks for $4. 
Cost per stick = $4 / 200 sticks = $0.02 per stick

For a 2 x 8, Frederick can get 400 sticks for $6. 
Cost per stick = $6 / 400 sticks = $0.015 per stick

Since the 2 x 8 costs less per stick, we should prioritize buying 2 x 8 lumber. 

With $24, Frederick can buy 24 / 6 = 4 pieces of 2 x 8 lumber. 
Total sticks from 2 x 8 lumber = 4 * 400 = 1600 sticks

Now, let's see if we can make up the remaining amount with 2 x 4 lumber. 
Remaining budget = $24 - 4 * $6 = $0 (since we've spent all the money on 2 x 8 lumber)

However, we still have some money left, but it's not enough to buy another 2 x 4. We can ignore this since we've already maximized our budget.

Total popsicle sticks = 1600 sticks

The final answer is: 1600"
"To find the total cost of snowshoes for Mario's dogs, we first need to determine the total number of snowshoes required. Since each dog has 4 legs and Mario has 6 dogs, the total number of legs is 6 * 4 = 24.

Since each dog needs a pair of snowshoes, and each pair covers 4 legs, we need to divide the total number of legs by 4 to get the total number of pairs of snowshoes required. However, since each dog needs a pair, we simply need to multiply the number of dogs by 2 (one pair per dog).

So, the total number of pairs of snowshoes required is 6 * 2 = 12.

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of pairs of snowshoes by the cost per pair, which is $12.00.

Total cost = 12 * $12.00 = $144.00

"To find out how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips for a week and then subtract the cost of the weekly pass.

Janet takes two bus trips per day, five days a week. So, the total number of bus trips per week is 2 * 5 = 10.

Each bus trip costs $2.20, so the total cost of her bus trips for a week is 10 * $2.20 = $22.

The weekly bus pass costs $20. To find out how much Janet would save, we subtract the cost of the pass from the total cost of her bus trips: $22 - $20 = $2.

Therefore, Janet would save $2 by buying a weekly bus pass.

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's break down the information given:

- The farm has 30 cows.
- The zoo has 20 sheep.
- The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does, so the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.
- The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.
- The zoo has 20 sheep and 60 cows, so the zoo has a total of 20 + 60 = 80 animals.
- The farm has 30 cows and 10 sheep, so the farm has a total of 30 + 10 = 40 animals.

To find the total number of animals in both the farm and the zoo, we add the number of animals in the farm and the zoo: 40 + 80 = 120.

The final answer is: 120"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many items Sophia bought. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of items Sophia bought, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the number of items Sophia bought as 'x'. 

Since Rose bought 4 times the number of items Sophia bought, the number of items Rose bought is 4x. We know that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, so the total number of items Rose bought is 12 + 4 = 16. 

Now we can set up the equation: 4x = 16. To find the value of 'x', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 4. 

x = 16 / 4
x = 4

So, Sophia bought 4 items. Since we don't know whether the 4 items are onions or potatoes, we can't determine the exact number of each. However, we can say that Sophia bought a total of 4 items.

The total number of items Sophia bought is 4."
"To determine the calorie deficit Andy needs each day, we first need to calculate the total number of days he has to reach his goal. Since his birthday is on July 19th and today is December 31st, we can calculate the number of days as follows:

December has 31 days, January has 31 days, February has 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year), March has 31 days, April has 30 days, May has 31 days, June has 30 days, and July has 19 days. 

Total days = 31 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 201 days

Now, we need to calculate the total number of calories Andy needs to burn to lose 30 pounds. Since he needs to burn 3500 calories to lose 1 pound, we multiply this by 30:

Total calories to burn = 3500 calories/pound * 30 pounds = 105,000 calories

Now, we divide the total calories by the number of days to find the daily calorie deficit:

Daily calorie deficit = Total calories to burn / Total days = 105,000 calories / 201 days ≈ 522 calories/day

The final answer is: 522"
"To find out how much Gerald has left, we need to calculate his total earnings for the week and then subtract the amount he spent.

Since Gerald works 7 days a week, his total earnings for the week would be 7 days * $30/day = $210.

Now, let's subtract the amount he spent from his total earnings: $210 - $100 = $110.

So, Gerald has $110 left."
"To find out how many milliliters of water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total distance she will run. Since each lap is 0.25 km and she needs to run 8 laps, we multiply the number of laps by the distance per lap.

Distance = Number of laps * Distance per lap
Distance = 8 * 0.25 km
Distance = 2 km

Since Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs, we multiply the total distance by the amount of water needed per kilometer.

Total water needed = Distance * Water per kilometer
Total water needed = 2 km * 60 ml/km
Total water needed = 120 ml

The final answer is: 120"
"To find out how much money Julie had left, we need to calculate the amount she spent on clothes and CDs, and then subtract that from the initial amount.

First, let's calculate the amount she spent on clothes: 20% of $500 is 0.20 x $500 = $100.

Now, let's subtract the amount spent on clothes from the initial amount: $500 - $100 = $400.

Next, let's calculate the amount she spent on CDs: 25% of $400 is 0.25 x $400 = $100.

Now, let's subtract the amount spent on CDs from the remaining amount: $400 - $100 = $300.

The final answer is: $300"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let's denote the cost of the lot as 'x'. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write the equation: x + 3x = 120,000.

Combining like terms, we get 4x = 120,000.

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 4: x = 120,000 / 4 = 30,000.

Since the cost of the house is 3x, we multiply x by 3: 3 * 30,000 = 90,000.

The house cost $90,000.

The final answer is: $90,000"
"To find the profit, we first need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

The total cost is the cost of the canvas bags, which is 8 packs * 5 bags per pack * $4 per bag = 8 * 5 * 4 = $160.

The total revenue is the selling price of the bags, which is 8 bags * $8 per bag = 8 * 8 = $64.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $64 - $160 = -$96. However, since profit cannot be negative, it seems there's an error in the problem. Assuming the problem is meant to be a positive profit, let's re-evaluate the problem.

If we assume the total revenue is higher than the total cost, we can re-calculate the profit. However, given the information, the initial calculation shows a loss. 

To find the minimum revenue required to make a profit, we need to set the profit to 0 and solve for the revenue. The break-even point is when the revenue equals the cost, which is $160. 

The minimum revenue required to break even is $160. Since the profit is the revenue minus the cost, and we want the profit to be greater than 0, the revenue must be greater than $160.

However, if we assume the problem is meant to be a positive profit, we can calculate the minimum revenue required to make a profit. Let's assume the profit is $x. The revenue would be the cost plus the profit, which is $160 + $x.

Since the profit is the revenue minus the cost, we can set up the equation: revenue - cost = profit. Substituting the values, we get ($160 + $x) - $160 = $x.

Simplifying the equation, we get $x = $x. This is true for any value of x, but we need to find the minimum value of x to make a positive profit.

Since the revenue is $8 per bag, and there are 8 bags, the minimum revenue is $64. However, this is the current revenue, and we need to find the minimum revenue to make a profit.

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total amount of money Ali has. 

Ali has four $10 bills, which is 4 * $10 = $40. 
He also has six $20 bills, which is 6 * $20 = $120. 
The total amount of money Ali has is $40 + $120 = $160.

"To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we first need to determine how many cups of raisins she has available for the oatmeal cookies. 

Since she wants to divide the raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, we can divide the total number of cups of raisins by 3. 

Total cups of raisins = 27
Cups of raisins for oatmeal cookies = Total cups of raisins / 3
Cups of raisins for oatmeal cookies = 27 / 3
Cups of raisins for oatmeal cookies = 9

Now, we need to find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make with 9 cups of raisins. Each batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins. 

Number of batches = Cups of raisins for oatmeal cookies / Cups of raisins per batch
Number of batches = 9 / (3/4)
To divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal.
Number of batches = 9 * (4/3)
Number of batches = 12

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we first need to calculate her daily and weekly electric consumption before and after adding the new device.

Before adding the new device, Ada's daily electric consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. Since there are 24 hours in a day, her daily consumption is 12 * 24 = 288 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per day.

After adding the new device, her daily consumption will be 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour. So, her daily consumption will be 14 * 24 = 336 kWh per day.

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7. 

Before adding the new device, Ada's weekly consumption is 288 * 7 = 2016 kWh.
After adding the new device, her weekly consumption is 336 * 7 = 2352 kWh.

The cost of electricity is $1.50 per kWh. So, the weekly cost before adding the new device is 2016 * $1.50 = $3024.
The weekly cost after adding the new device is 2352 * $1.50 = $3528.

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is $3528 - $3024 = $504.

The final answer is: $504"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how long it would take one person to paint a whole house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, it would take them 10 days to paint a whole house (since it would take twice as long to paint the entire house).

Next, we need to find out how many hours it would take for one person to paint a whole house. There are 24 hours in a day, so 10 days would be 10 x 24 = 240 hours.

Now, if 5 people are painting a whole house, it would take them less time than it would take one person. To find out how much less time, we need to divide the total hours it would take one person by the number of people. So, 240 hours / 5 people = 48 hours.

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

The final answer is: 48"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Ophelia has 20 sofas.
2. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so she has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.
4. Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Now, let's calculate the total number of sofas and chairs they have:

Ophelia has 20 sofas and 22 chairs.
Jenna has 64 sofas and 66 chairs.

Total number of sofas = 20 + 64 = 84
Total number of chairs = 22 + 66 = 88

The total number of sofas and chairs is 84 + 88 = 172."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money Tom spent on the headphone set. We can do this by subtracting the cost of the CD from the total amount he paid.

Total amount paid = $48
Cost of CD = $4
Cost of headphone set = Total amount paid - Cost of CD
= $48 - $4
= $44

Now that we know the cost of the headphone set, we can find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with that amount.

Cost of one CD = $4
Number of CDs Tom could have bought with the cost of the headphone set = Cost of headphone set / Cost of one CD
= $44 / $4
= 11

So, Tom could have bought 11 more CDs if he had decided not to buy the headphone set.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we need to consider the weeks where he spent 4 hours, 5 hours, and 6 hours. 

First, let's find the total hours spent in the weeks where he spent 4 hours each. There are 6 weeks where he spent 4 hours, so the total hours spent in these weeks is 6 * 4 = 24 hours.

Next, let's find the total hours spent in the weeks where he spent 5 hours each. There are 2 weeks where he spent 5 hours, so the total hours spent in these weeks is 2 * 5 = 10 hours.

Finally, let's find the total hours spent in the week where he spent 6 hours. There is 1 week where he spent 6 hours, so the total hours spent in this week is 1 * 6 = 6 hours.

Now, let's add up the total hours spent in all the weeks: 24 + 10 + 6 = 40 hours.

The total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is 40."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off. So, the number of people left on the bus is 48 - 8 = 40.

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (which is 8) get into the bus. So, 5 * 8 = 40 people get in. Now, the total number of people on the bus is 40 (who were already there) + 40 (who got in) = 80.

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off. So, the number of people left on the bus is 80 - 21 = 59.

Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on. Since 21 got off, 3 times fewer would be 21 / 3 = 7. So, 7 people get in. Now, the total number of people on the bus is 59 (who were already there) + 7 (who got in) = 66.

The final number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop is 66."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, so his current age is 27 - 5 = 22 years.
2. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. 
   Jame's age in 8 years will be 22 + 8 = 30 years.
   Twice Jame's age in 8 years will be 2 * 30 = 60 years.
   So, Jame's cousin's age in 8 years will be 60 - 5 = 55 years.
3. Since Jame's cousin will be 55 in 8 years, his current age is 55 - 8 = 47 years.

Now, let's find the difference in their current ages: 47 (cousin's age) - 22 (Jame's age) = 25 years.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the cost of one monitor, we first need to determine the cost of the printer. Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, and the computer cost $1,100, the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700.

The total cost of the computer and the printer is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800. 

Since Errol bought 2 monitors, the cost of the two monitors is $2,400 - $1,800 = $600. 

To find the cost of one monitor, we divide the total cost of the monitors by 2: $600 / 2 = $300.

The final answer is: $300"
"To solve this problem, we first need to find out how many shells the boys brought in total. Since there are 10 boys (half of 20 kids) and each brought 60 shells, the total number of shells brought by the boys is 10 * 60 = 600.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 600 + 4 * 60 shells. 

First, we calculate 4 * 60, which is 240. Then we add 600 to this, which is 840. 

Since there are 10 girls (half of 20 kids), we need to find out how many shells each girl brought. To do this, we divide the total number of shells brought by the girls (840) by the number of girls (10). 

840 / 10 = 84.

The final answer is: 84"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, let's assume the number of candies George had before eating 5 candies is 'x'. Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, the number of candies Nick had is 2x.

George ate 5 candies, so the number of candies George has left is x - 5. We are given that George has 3 candies left, so we can set up the equation:

x - 5 = 3

To solve for x, we add 5 to both sides of the equation:

x = 3 + 5
x = 8

Now that we know George had 8 candies initially, we can find the number of candies Nick had, which is 2x:

Nick's candies = 2x
= 2 * 8
= 16

The final answer is: 16"
"To find Anne's age, we first need to determine Alyana's age since we know she is 4 years younger than Chenny. 

Chenny's age is 10 years. 
Alyana's age is 10 - 4 = 6 years.

Since Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, we add 2 to Alyana's age to find Anne's age.
Anne's age is 6 + 2 = 8 years.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book and then add them together.

The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 * 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add the thickness of all four books together: 
31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188

The final answer is: 188"
"To find out how many vlogs Emma needs to make to complete 72 vlogs per month, we need to calculate the total number of vlogs she has already made and subtract that from the target of 72.

In the first week, Emma made 18 vlogs.
In the second week, Emma made 21 vlogs.
In the third week, Emma made 15 vlogs.

Total vlogs made so far = 18 + 21 + 15 = 54

Since Emma's target is 72 vlogs per month, we subtract the total vlogs made so far from the target:

72 (target) - 54 (vlogs made so far) = 18

Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to complete 72 vlogs per month.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the total amount you paid, we need to calculate the 20% tip and add it to the original bill.

First, let's find 20% of the $50 dinner bill. To do this, we multiply $50 by 0.20 (which is the decimal equivalent of 20%).

20% of $50 = $50 * 0.20 = $10

Now, we add the tip to the original bill to get the total amount you paid.

Total amount = $50 (original bill) + $10 (tip) = $60

So, you ended up paying $60."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much money the eldest boy initially received. Since $18 is shared among 3 boys, we divide $18 by 3 to find the initial share of the eldest boy.

Initial share of the eldest boy = $18 / 3 = $6

The eldest boy added $5 to his share, so his new total is:

$6 + $5 = $11

The following day, he added another $10, making his total:

$11 + $10 = $21

Then, he spent $8 from his total, leaving him with:

$21 - $8 = $13

After saving some more, he tripled the amount he had left after spending the $8. To find the final amount, we multiply $13 by 3:

$13 * 3 = $39

So, the eldest boy now has $39."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much Elvis needs to save in the first half of the month. 

Let's assume the number of days in the first half of April is x. Since April has 30 days, the number of days in the second half will also be x. 

The total number of days in April is 30, so x + x = 30. 
Solving for x, we get 2x = 30, x = 15. 

So, the first half of April has 15 days and the second half also has 15 days.

Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half as in the first half. Let's assume he saves y dollars in the first half. Then, he will save 2y dollars in the second half.

The total savings for the month is the sum of the savings in the first and second half: y + 2y = 1125.

Combine like terms: 3y = 1125.

Divide both sides by 3: y = 375.

So, Elvis needs to save 375 dollars in the first half of the month.

Since the second half has 15 days, and he needs to save twice as much as in the first half, he will save 2 * 375 = 750 dollars in the second half.

"To find the total cost of the fruits, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and add them together.

The cost of 3 apples at $1.50 each is 3 x $1.50 = $4.50.
The cost of 5 oranges at $0.80 each is 5 x $0.80 = $4.
The cost of 6 peaches at $0.75 each is 6 x $0.75 = $4.50.

Now, let's add the costs together: $4.50 + $4 + $4.50 = $13.

Since Verna gave $20, the change she received is $20 - $13 = $7.

The final answer is: $7"
"To find out how much more Jairus will get than Jenny, we need to calculate the total amount each of them will receive for completing 20 tasks.

Jairus gets $0.8 for each task, so for 20 tasks, he will get 20 * $0.8 = $16.

Jenny gets $0.5 for each task, so for 20 tasks, she will get 20 * $0.5 = $10.

Now, we need to find the difference between what Jairus and Jenny will get. 

$16 (Jairus) - $10 (Jenny) = $6

The final answer is: $6"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, and the total amount they have to divide is $100.

Let's represent the amount Brad gets as 'x'. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, the amount Jeff gets is 4x.

The total amount they have to divide is $100, so we can set up the equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms:

5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 20

Since x represents the amount Brad gets, and Jeff gets 4 times as much, Jeff gets 4x:

Jeff gets 4 * 20 = 80 dollars.

The final answer is: $80"
"To find the total miles Jeff walks in a week, we need to calculate the total miles he walks each day and then multiply it by the number of days he works in a week.

Since Jeff walks to work and back each day, the total miles he walks each day is 2 times the distance to work, which is 2 * 3 miles = 6 miles.

Now, we multiply the daily miles by the number of days he works in a week: 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Elise writes the alphabet in full twice, which means she writes 26 letters each time. So, she writes 26 * 2 = 52 letters.

2. Then, she writes half of the alphabet once. Half of the alphabet is 26 / 2 = 13 letters.

3. So, she writes 13 letters.

4. Now, she re-writes everything she has already written. This means she re-writes 52 + 13 = 65 letters.

5. To find the total number of letters Elise has written, we add the letters from the first two steps (52 + 13) and the letters from the last step (65). 

Total letters = 52 + 13 + 65 = 130

"This problem can be solved using a geometric progression. In the first round, 3 families are notified directly by Ali. In the second round, each of the 3 families notifies 3 other families, resulting in 3 * 3 = 9 new families notified. 

In the third round, each of the 9 families notifies 3 other families, resulting in 9 * 3 = 27 new families notified. 

In the fourth round, each of the 27 families notifies 3 other families, resulting in 27 * 3 = 81 new families notified.

The total number of families notified in the fourth round is 81."
"To find Mark's initial weight, we need to calculate the total weight he lost and then add that to his final weight.

Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, so the total weight he lost is:
10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds

Since Mark's final weight is 70 pounds, we can find his initial weight by adding the weight he lost to his final weight:
Initial weight = Final weight + Weight lost
Initial weight = 70 pounds + 30 pounds
Initial weight = 100 pounds

The final answer is: 100"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many toys Jonathan needs to have a play set five times larger than James's. Since James has 80 toys, a play set five times larger would have 5 * 80 = 400 toys.

Since Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have enough toys to make a play set five times larger than James's, we can set up an equation: x + 2 = 400, where x is the number of toys Jonathan currently has.

To find x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 2 from both sides: x = 400 - 2.

x = 398

So, Jonathan currently has 398 toys."
"To find the total cost of the items Daniel wants to buy, we first need to calculate the cost of each item without the discount. 

The cost of 5 notebooks at $1.50 each is 5 * $1.50 = $7.50.
The cost of 2 pens at $0.25 each is 2 * $0.25 = $0.50.
The cost of 1 calculator at $12 each is $12.
The cost of 1 geometry set at $10 each is $10.

The total cost of all the items without the discount is $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30.

Since the shop gives a 10% discount on all the purchased items, we need to calculate 10% of $30, which is 0.1 * $30 = $3.

The total cost after the discount is $30 - $3 = $27.

Therefore, Daniel has to spend $27 on all the items he wants to buy.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of bottles Bill needs for his party. He has 70 guests and wants 2 bottles of water for each guest:

70 guests * 2 bottles/guest = 140 bottles

Now, we subtract the number of bottles Bill already has from the total number of bottles he needs:

140 bottles (needed) - 48 bottles (already has) = 92 bottles

So, Bill needs to buy 92 additional bottles of water.

The final answer is: 92"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. 

When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as in cold water. Since it takes Ray 16 minutes to swim a mile in cold water, twice that time is 2 * 16 = 32 minutes. Adding 2 minutes to that gives us 32 + 2 = 34 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water. 

In cold water, it takes Ray 16 minutes to swim a mile, so for 3 miles it would be 3 * 16 = 48 minutes.

In warm water, it takes Ray 34 minutes to swim a mile, so for 3 miles it would be 3 * 34 = 102 minutes.

The difference in time between swimming 3 miles in warm water and cold water is 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many cups of coffee Juan currently drinks. Since Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks, and Octavia drinks half the daily recommended amount, we need to find the daily recommended amount first.

Let's assume the daily recommended amount is x cups. Since Octavia drinks half of this, she drinks x/2 cups. Since Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks, Juan drinks 10 * (x/2) = 5x cups.

We are given that the daily recommended amount is 4 cups. So, we can set up the equation 5x = 4 to find the value of x.

However, this equation doesn't make sense because 5x cannot equal 4. This is because the daily recommended amount is 4 cups, and Juan drinks 5 times the amount that Octavia drinks, who drinks half the daily recommended amount. This means Juan drinks 5 times the daily recommended amount, not 5x.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. If the daily recommended amount is 4 cups, and Octavia drinks half of this, she drinks 4/2 = 2 cups. Since Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks, Juan drinks 10 * 2 = 20 cups.

To find out how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we subtract the recommended amount from his current intake: 20 - 4 = 16.

Next, let's find the total number of guinea pigs: 
There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each, so the total number of guinea pigs is 3 * 5 = 15.

Now, let's add the total number of hamsters and guinea pigs to find the total number of rodents: 
Total rodents = Total hamsters + Total guinea pigs
Total rodents = 30 + 15

"To find the average weight of the three friends, we first need to find their individual weights. 

Mark's weight is given as 150 pounds. 
Susan's weight is 20 pounds less than Mark's, so Susan's weight is 150 - 20 = 130 pounds. 
Bob's weight is twice as much as Susan's, so Bob's weight is 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, we need to find the average weight of the three friends. To do this, we add their weights and divide by 3. 
Average weight = (Mark's weight + Susan's weight + Bob's weight) / 3 
Average weight = (150 + 130 + 260) / 3 
Average weight = 540 / 3

"To solve this problem, we need to find the total angle the sun will be from the ground after 10 hours. 

The initial angle of the pyramid from the ground is 32 degrees. The sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, so its initial angle from the ground is also 32 degrees. 

The sun moves 5 degrees per hour, so after 10 hours, it will move 5 * 10 = 50 degrees.

Since the sun starts at the same angle as the pyramid, we need to add the movement of the sun to the initial angle of the pyramid. However, since the sun is moving upward, we need to subtract the initial angle of the pyramid from the total movement to find the final angle from the ground.

So, the final angle from the ground to the sun will be 50 - 32 = 18 degrees.

"To find out how many packs of candles James needs to buy, we first need to determine the total number of candles required. Since James has two sons, one 12 years old and the other 4 years younger, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Typically, birthday candles are used in the number equal to the age of the person. So, James will need 12 candles for the older son and 8 candles for the younger son, totaling 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we need to find out how many packs James needs to buy. To do this, we divide the total number of candles needed (20) by the number of candles in a pack (5). 

20 / 5 = 4

So, James needs to buy 4 packs of candles. 

The cost of 4 packs of candles is 4 * $3 = $12.

"To find out how many pages Judy read in the first week, we need to calculate the total minutes she read in the first week and then convert that to pages. 

In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night. Since there are 7 nights in a week, she read for a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes in the first week.

Given that Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we can find out how many pages she read in the first week by first finding out how many 1.5 minute intervals are in 105 minutes. 

To do this, we divide 105 by 1.5, which equals 70. So, in the first week, Judy read 70 * 2 = 140 pages.

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

To find the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we add the pages she read in the first week to the pages she read in the second week: 140 + 100 = 240.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote Shiloh's nephew's current age as 'x'. In 7 years, Shiloh will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old. At that time, his nephew will be x + 7 years old.

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. This can be expressed as:

51 = 3(x + 7)

To solve for 'x', we need to expand the equation:

51 = 3x + 21

Now, we'll subtract 21 from both sides of the equation:

30 = 3x

Next, we'll divide both sides by 3 to isolate 'x':

x = 10

So, Shiloh's nephew is 10 years old today.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 each, so that's 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as Sharon had received for each of the previous three teeth. Since Sharon received $1.00 for each of the previous three teeth, half of that is $0.50. So, for the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.
4. Now, let's add up the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon: $5.00 (for the first tooth) + $3.00 (for the next three teeth) + $1.00 (for the last two teeth) = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many goals Mark and Anna scored. 

Let's start with Anna. We know that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, and Richie scored 80 goals. So, we can set up an equation to find out how many goals Anna scored:

Anna's goals = Richie's goals - 45
Anna's goals = 80 - 45
Anna's goals = 35

Now, let's find out how many goals Mark scored. We know that Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, and Richie scored 80 goals. So, we can set up an equation to find out how many goals Mark scored:

Mark's goals = Richie's goals - 20
Mark's goals = 80 - 20
Mark's goals = 60

Now that we know how many goals each of the teenagers scored, we can find the total number of goals they scored:

Total goals = Anna's goals + Mark's goals + Richie's goals
Total goals = 35 + 60 + 80
Total goals = 175

The final answer is: 175"
"To find out how much more money Mitchell made than Liam, we need to first calculate the total amount of money each of them made. 

Liam made $63 in total. 

Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 apiece, so we multiply the number of lemonades by the price per lemonade: 21 * 4 = 84. 

Now, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings to find the difference: 84 - 63 = 21.

The final answer is: $21"
"To find the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate the number of action figures he bought each day and then add them up.

From Sunday to Wednesday, Peter spent $5 each day on wooden action figures. Since he has 4 days, he spent a total of 4 * $5 = $20 on wooden action figures. 

He spent $70 - $20 = $50 on plastic action figures from Thursday to Saturday. Since he has 3 days, he spent a total of 3 * $2 = $6 on plastic action figures each day.

However, the question states that he spent $50 on plastic action figures, so he must have spent $50 / $6 = 8.33. Since you can't buy a fraction of an action figure, he must have spent $6 * 8 = $48 on plastic action figures and $50 - $48 = $2 on the last day. 

So, he bought 8 wooden action figures and 24 plastic action figures. 

The total number of action figures he will have by the end of the week is 8 + 24 = 32.

The final answer is: 32"
"To calculate the total cost of the kitten, we need to add up the cost of spaying, vaccines, and the broken vases.

The cost of spaying is $200.
The cost of 3 vaccines is 3 x $20 = $60.
The cost of 4 vases is 4 x $12 = $48.

Now, let's add up the costs: $200 (spaying) + $60 (vaccines) + $48 (vases) = $308.

The final answer is: $308"
"To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we first need to calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week and then per month.

The total number of roses ordered per week is 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered per month is 65 * 4 = 260 roses.

Ford grows 40 roses every week, so the total number of roses he grows per month is 40 * 4 = 160 roses.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the total number of roses he grows per month from the total number of roses ordered per month: 260 - 160 = 100 roses.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how much money will be remaining in Katina's account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount of money she will have withdrawn over that period.

There are 12 months in a year, so in 2 years, there are 2 x 12 = 24 months.

Katina removes $100 from her account every month, so the total amount she will withdraw in 24 months is 24 x $100 = $2400.

To find the remaining amount in her account, we subtract the total amount withdrawn from the initial amount: $3000 - $2400 = $600.

So, after 2 years, Katina will have $600 remaining in her account.

The final answer is: $600"
"To calculate the net profit, we need to find the total revenue and total cost.

The total revenue is the number of sandwiches sold multiplied by the price per sandwich. 
10 sandwiches * $7.00 per sandwich = $70.00

The total cost consists of the cost of bread and the cost of cheese and condiments. 
The cost of bread is $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches. 
So, the cost of bread per sandwich is $3.00 / 10 sandwiches = $0.30 per sandwich.
The cost of cheese and condiments per 10 sandwiches is $30.00, so the cost per sandwich is $30.00 / 10 sandwiches = $3.00 per sandwich.
The total cost per sandwich is $0.30 (bread) + $3.00 (cheese and condiments) = $3.30 per sandwich.
The total cost for 10 sandwiches is $3.30 per sandwich * 10 sandwiches = $33.00.

The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00
Net profit = $37.00

The final answer is: $37.00"
"To find out how much money Kate can make, we need to determine the total number of muffin crayons she can make and then multiply that by the price of each muffin crayon.

First, let's find the total number of crayon pieces. Since there are 3 boxes of 64 crayons, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of crayons per box:

3 boxes * 64 crayons/box = 192 crayon pieces

Since Kate melts 8 small pieces of crayons together to make one muffin crayon, we divide the total number of crayon pieces by 8 to find the total number of muffin crayons:

192 crayon pieces / 8 pieces/muffin crayon = 24 muffin crayons

Now, we multiply the number of muffin crayons by the price of each muffin crayon to find the total amount of money Kate can make:

24 muffin crayons * $1.50/muffin crayon = $36

The final answer is: $36"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the area of the bedroom and then calculate the costs for the new carpet, padding, and installation.

The area of the bedroom is the length multiplied by the width: 
Area = length * width = 18 * 12 = 216 square feet.

The cost of the new carpet is $12 per square foot, so the total cost for the carpet is:
Carpet cost = Area * $12 = 216 * $12 = $2592.

The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot, so the total cost for the padding is:
Padding cost = Area * $2 = 216 * $2 = $432.

The cost to remove the old carpet is $4 per square foot, so the total cost for removal is:
Removal cost = Area * $4 = 216 * $4 = $864.

The cost to install the new carpet is $34 per square foot, so the total cost for installation is:
Installation cost = Area * $34 = 216 * $34 = $7344.

The total cost to replace the carpet is the sum of the carpet cost, padding cost, removal cost, and installation cost:
Total cost = Carpet cost + Padding cost + Removal cost + Installation cost
= $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344
= $11332.

The final answer is: $11332."
"To find the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we need to calculate the total number of birds he saw over the week and then divide it by the number of days.

The total number of birds Mack saw is:
- Day 1 and 2: 50 birds
- Day 3: 0 birds
- Day 4 and 5: 120 birds
- Day 6: 20 birds
- Day 7: 90 birds

Total birds = 50 + 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 230

There are 7 days in a week. To find the average, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days:
Average = Total birds / Number of days
Average = 230 / 7
Average = 32.86

The final answer is: 32.86"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. The starting value of the number train is 20.
2. Half of the starting value is 20 / 2 = 10.
3. The starting value plus half the number is 20 + 10 = 30.
4. The resulting value is divided by 5, so 30 / 5 = 6.
5. The resulting value is multiplied by the starting value minus 12, so 6 * (20 - 12) = 6 * 8 = 48.

The final value of the number train is 48."
"To find the total number of cards they have together, we first need to determine the number of cards each of them has. 

The boy has 5 cards. His brother has 3 fewer cards than he has, so his brother has 5 - 3 = 2 cards.

Now, to find the total number of cards they have together, we add the number of cards the boy has to the number of cards his brother has: 5 + 2 = 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the percentage by which the oven is off. We can do this by finding the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature, and then dividing that by the set temperature.

The difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature is 468 - 450 = 18.

The percentage by which the oven is off is (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%.

Now that we know the oven is off by 4%, we can find the temperature that Maggie should set it to for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees. We can do this by subtracting 4% of 520 from 520.

4% of 520 is (4/100) * 520 = 20.8.

So, the temperature that Maggie should set the oven to is 520 - 20.8 = 499.2.

The final answer is: 499.2"
"To find the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to add the length of each movie in minutes. 

First, let's convert the length of the first movie to minutes: 1 hour is 60 minutes, so 1 hour and 30 minutes is 60 + 30 = 90 minutes.

Next, let's convert the length of the second movie to minutes: 2 hours is 120 minutes, and adding 5 minutes gives us 125 minutes.

Now, we add the lengths of the two movies: 90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes.

The final answer is: 215"
"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house price and subtract it from Herb's house price. 

30% of $76,000 is 0.3 x $76,000 = $22,800.

Now, subtract $22,800 from $76,000 to find the value of Juan's house: $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200.

The value of Juan's house is $53,200.

To find the combined value of the two houses, add the value of Juan's house to Herb's house price: $53,200 + $76,000 = $129,200.

The final answer is: $129,200."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of cups and dishes Judy brought. 

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of cups Judy brought is 12, and the total number of cups her friend brought is 40. The total number of cups is 12 + 40 = 52.

The total number of dishes Judy brought is 24, and the total number of dishes her friend brought is 44. The total number of dishes is 24 + 44 = 68.

The total number of utensils (cups and dishes) brought by the two is 52 + 68 = 120.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the cost per pair of contacts, we first need to determine the total number of contacts in 2 boxes and the total cost of 2 boxes with the discount.

Since 90 contacts last Pete 45 days, we can find the number of contacts he uses per day: 90 contacts / 45 days = 2 contacts per day.

In 2 boxes, there are 2 * 90 = 180 contacts.

The original price of 2 boxes is 2 * $100 = $200. With a 10% discount, the discount amount is $200 * 0.10 = $20. The discounted price is $200 - $20 = $180.

Now, to find the cost per pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts: $180 / 180 contacts = $1 per contact.

Since a pair of contacts is 2 contacts, the cost per pair is $1 * 2 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we need to calculate their individual earnings first.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, for a total of 3 hours. Her hourly wage is $10, so her total earnings are 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 hours. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, which is 3 * 1 = 3 hours. So, John worked a total of 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

John's total earnings are 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find out how much water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total calories she burns during her activities. 

She spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories/hour. So, the total calories burned from aerobics is 2 * 500 = 1000 calories.

She also spends 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories/hour. So, the total calories burned from running is 1 * 600 = 600 calories.

The total calories burned is the sum of calories burned from aerobics and running, which is 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns, we need to divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many 200-calorie units she burned. 

Total calories burned / 200 = 1600 / 200 = 8

Since she needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, she needs to drink 8 * 100 = 800 ml of water.

The final answer is: 800"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G.

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so B + R + G = 4500.

We also know that R = 0.99B (1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans) and G = 1.01B (1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans).

Substituting the expressions for R and G into the first equation, we get:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

3.01B = 4500

Divide both sides by 3.01:

B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

R = 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
G = 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is:

G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30

"To find the average of the three measurements, we need to first find the third measurement. Jared's initial typing speed is 47 WPM, and it increased to 52 WPM. If he continues to increase his typing speed once more by 5 words, his new typing speed will be 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

Now, we have the three measurements: 47, 52, and 57. To find the average, we add them up and divide by 3.

Average = (47 + 52 + 57) / 3
Average = 156 / 3
Average = 52

"To determine the total number of people attending, we need to calculate the number of people invited via email, the number of friends Alex's friends will bring, and the number of Alex's friends and their spouses.

First, let's calculate the number of people invited via email. Each of the 100 people invited will bring 2 friends, so the total number of people invited via email is 100 + (100 * 2) = 300.

Next, Alex calls 10 friends and 8 of them will bring their spouses, so the total number of Alex's friends and their spouses is 10 + 8 = 18.

Now, we add the number of people invited via email and the number of Alex's friends and their spouses to get the total number of people attending. 

Total number of people = 300 (via email) + 18 (Alex's friends and their spouses) = 318

However, we also need to consider Alex herself, so we add 1 to the total number of people.

Total number of people = 318 + 1 = 319

Therefore, Alex will need 319 seats.

The final answer is: 319"
"To find the weight of the Mastiff, we need to start from the Papillon's weight and work our way back. 

The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund. Since the Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, the Papillon weighs one-fourth of the Dachshund's weight, which is also one-eighth of the Affenpinscher's weight. 

The Affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds. So, the Papillon weighs 10 / 4 = 2.5 pounds.

The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon. Therefore, the Mastiff's weight is 44 * 2.5 = 110 pounds.

The final answer is: 110"
"To find the total cost of the boots on eBay, we need to calculate the shipping cost first. Since the shipping cost on eBay is twice as much as it is on Amazon, and the shipping cost on Amazon is $4, the shipping cost on eBay is 2 * $4 = $8.

The total cost of the boots on eBay is the cost of the boots plus the shipping cost, which is $13 + $8 = $21.

The total cost of the boots on Amazon is $16 + $4 = $20.

To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we need to subtract the total cost on Amazon from the total cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

"To solve this problem, we can use exponential growth. The initial height of the beanstalk is 4 feet, and it doubles every day. We want to find the number of days it takes for the beanstalk to be taller than 20 feet.

Let's start by listing the height of the beanstalk for each day:

Day 0: 4 feet
Day 1: 8 feet
Day 2: 16 feet
Day 3: 32 feet

As we can see, the height of the beanstalk doubles every day. We can use this pattern to find the number of days it takes for the beanstalk to be taller than 20 feet.

Since 16 feet is less than 20 feet, and 32 feet is greater than 20 feet, the beanstalk will be taller than Mark's window on the third day.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we first need to calculate how many grams of protein he gets per day. 

Since a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein, we can find the protein percentage in a cup of mushrooms by dividing the protein by the weight: 3 grams / 100 grams = 0.03 or 3%.

Now, we know that John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day. To find out how many grams of protein he gets per day, we multiply the weight of mushrooms he eats by the protein percentage: 200 grams * 0.03 = 6 grams of protein per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7 to find the weekly protein intake: 6 grams/day * 7 days/week = 42 grams of protein per week.

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's break down the information given. If Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can represent his current age as 'x'. 

Five years ago, Jerry's age would be 'x - 5'. According to the problem, Jerry's current age is twice his age 5 years ago, so we can write the equation: x = 2(x - 5).

Expanding the equation, we get x = 2x - 10. Subtracting '2x' from both sides, we get -x = -10. Multiplying both sides by -1, we get x = 10.

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age: 10 + 3 = 13.

The final answer is: 13"
"To find out how many hours George needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the dental work. 

The base price for two implants is 2 * $2000 = $4000. 
For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain, which costs an extra $500. So, the total cost for the implants with the crown is $4000 + $500 = $4500. 
However, since he's already put down a deposit of $600, we subtract that from the total cost: $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Now, we need to find out how many hours George needs to work to earn $3900 at $15 per hour. 

To do this, we divide the total amount he needs to earn ($3900) by his hourly wage ($15): $3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

The final answer is: 260"
"Let's denote the smallest angle as 'x'. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it's 2x. The other angle is three times the smallest angle, so it's 3x.

We know that the sum of the three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:

One angle is 2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees
The other angle is 3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees

Since we are looking for the largest angle, we compare the three angles: 30, 60, and 90 degrees. The largest angle is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has in cents. 

First, let's convert the quarters to cents: 8 quarters * 25 cents/quarter = 200 cents
Next, let's convert the dimes to cents: 6 dimes * 10 cents/dime = 60 cents
Then, we already have the number of nickels in cents: 14 nickels * 5 cents/nickel = 70 cents
Lastly, let's convert the pennies to cents: 15 pennies * 1 cent/penny = 15 cents

Now, let's add up the total amount of money Colby has: 200 cents + 60 cents + 70 cents + 15 cents = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs a nickel (5 cents), we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball: 345 cents / 5 cents = 69

Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of games Steve receives each year and then sum them up over the three years.

In the first year, Steve gets 5 games as a birthday gift and 5 games as Christmas gifts, for a total of 10 games. He also buys 1 game per month for 12 months, which is 12 games. So, in total, he has 10 + 12 = 22 games in the first year.

In the second year, Steve gets 5 games as birthday and Christmas gifts, for a total of 10 games. He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, which is 24 games. So, in total, he has 10 + 24 = 34 games in the second year.

In the third year, Steve gets 5 games as birthday and Christmas gifts, for a total of 10 games. He buys 4 games per month for 12 months, which is 48 games. So, in total, he has 10 + 48 = 58 games in the third year.

"To find the rate at which the plane travels, we need to divide the distance it traveled by the time it took. 

Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Rate = 400 miles per hour

Now, we need to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this rate.

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

Since the question asks for the additional hours it would take, we need to subtract the initial 3 hours from the total time.

Additional Time = Total Time - Initial Time
Additional Time = 5 hours - 3 hours

"To find the total amount of chocolates made by Marissa in an hour, we need to first find out how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz makes in an hour. 

Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. To find out how many pounds he makes in an hour, we divide 120 by 2. 

120 / 2 = 60 pounds per hour for Ruiz.

Since Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz, we multiply 60 by 3/4.

60 * (3/4) = 45 pounds per hour for Marissa.

Now, we know that both Ruiz and Marissa work for 12 hours a day. To find the total amount of chocolates made by Ruiz in 12 hours, we multiply 60 pounds per hour by 12.

60 * 12 = 720 pounds for Ruiz.

To find the total amount of chocolates made by Marissa in 12 hours, we multiply 45 pounds per hour by 12.

45 * 12 = 540 pounds for Marissa.

The total amount of chocolates made by both Ruiz and Marissa in 12 hours is the sum of their individual amounts.

720 + 540 = 1260 pounds.

The final answer is: 1260"
"To find out how much money Howard has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent at the arcade and subtract it from the original amount.

On Monday, Howard spent $8.
On Tuesday, he spent twice as much as Monday, which is 2 * $8 = $16.
On Wednesday, he spent 4 times as much as Tuesday, which is 4 * $16 = $64.

The total amount spent is $8 + $16 + $64 = $88.

Howard originally had $100, so to find out how much he has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the original amount: $100 - $88 = $12.

The final answer is: $12"

"To find out how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to calculate the total number of rotations the tire can handle and divide it by the number of rotations per 2 miles, then divide the result by the number of miles Jeremy drives per month.

First, let's find out how many rotations the tire can handle per mile: 
725 rotations / 2 miles = 362.5 rotations per mile

Now, let's find out how many rotations the tire can handle in total: 
10,440,000 rotations

Now, let's find out how many miles the tire can handle: 
10,440,000 rotations / 362.5 rotations per mile = 28,700 miles

Now, let's find out how many months the tire can handle: 
28,700 miles / 400 miles per month = 71.75 months

Now, let's find out how many years the tire can handle: 
71.75 months / 12 months per year = 5.99 years

"To find the cost per pump, we need to first find the total number of pumps in the bottle. Since 2 pumps give 120 washings and Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, the total number of pumps in the bottle is 120 * 2 = 240 pumps.

The total cost of the shampoo is $24.00, which is equivalent to 2400 cents. 

To find the cost per pump, we divide the total cost by the total number of pumps: 2400 cents / 240 pumps = 10 cents per pump.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how much money Joe will have left after the purchase, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he wants to buy and then subtract that from the initial amount of money he has.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount. The shirt costs $25 and the shorts cost $35, so the total cost is $25 + $35 = $60.

Since there's a 30% off sale, we need to calculate the discount amount. To do this, we multiply the total cost by the discount percentage (30% or 0.3). The discount amount is $60 * 0.3 = $18.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final cost of the items. $60 - $18 = $42.

Since sales tax is included, we don't need to calculate it separately. We can subtract the final cost from the initial amount of money Joe has. $50 - $42 = $8.

So, Joe will have $8 left after the purchase.

The final answer is: $8"
"To determine the amount of butter needed, we first need to calculate the total number of croissants Juan wants to make in a week. Since he wants to make 4 dozen a day for a week, we multiply the number of dozen croissants per day by the number of days in a week.

4 dozen/day * 7 days/week = 28 dozen/week

Since 1 dozen croissants require 1/4 pound of butter, we multiply the total number of dozen croissants by the amount of butter needed per dozen.

28 dozen/week * (1/4 pound/dozen) = 7 pounds/week

So, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the cost of repaving Lewis' street, we need to multiply the cost per meter by the length of the street. 

Cost per meter: $194
Length of Lewis' street: 490 meters

Cost to repave Lewis' street = Cost per meter * Length of Lewis' street
Cost to repave Lewis' street = $194 * 490
Cost to repave Lewis' street = $95,060

Now, to find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's, we need to calculate the cost of repaving Monica's street and then subtract it from the cost of repaving Lewis' street.

Cost to repave Monica's street = Cost per meter * Length of Monica's street
Cost to repave Monica's street = $194 * 150
Cost to repave Monica's street = $29,100

Now, let's find the difference in cost:
Difference in cost = Cost to repave Lewis' street - Cost to repave Monica's street
Difference in cost = $95,060 - $29,100
Difference in cost = $65,960

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of John's research. 

First, let's break down the initial funding and the duration of the research. John initially received $100,000 for the first 5 months. However, his research ended up taking 10 times longer than expected, which is 10 * 5 = 50 months.

Since the research took 50 months, we need to calculate the additional funding required for the remaining 45 months (50 - 5 = 45 months). The funding for each of these months is 50% more than the initial funding. 

50% more than $100,000 is 1.5 * $100,000 = $150,000. 

Now, we need to calculate the total funding required for the remaining 45 months. This is $150,000 * 45 = $6,750,000.

The initial funding for the first 5 months was $100,000. So, the total cost of the research is $100,000 + $6,750,000 = $6,850,000.

The final answer is: $6,850,000"
"To find the total amount of meat consumed, we need to calculate the amount eaten by the first, second, and third players. 

The first player ate a 6-ounce steak. 
The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so 8 ounces of beef tips. 
The third player ate a one-pound steak, which is equivalent to 16 ounces (1 pound = 16 ounces).

Now, let's add up the total amount of meat consumed: 
6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces.

Administrators = Total seats * (1/4)
Administrators = 72 * (1/4)
Administrators = 18

Now, we need to find the remaining seats after the administrators occupied their seats.
Remaining seats = Total seats - Administrators
Remaining seats = 72 - 18
Remaining seats = 54

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents.
Parents = Remaining seats * (1/3)
Parents = 54 * (1/3)

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he will chew 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

2. He chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 stick after dinner, so that's 2 more pieces.

3. So far, Jim has chewed 4 + 2 = 6 pieces of gum.

4. He started with 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

5. He gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. Half of 14 is 14 / 2 = 7.

6. So, Jim gives 7 pieces to his sister and is left with 14 - 7 = 7 pieces.

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to first convert her speed from kb/s to Mb/s and then multiply it by the number of seconds in an hour.

1 Mb = 1000 kb
So, 1 kb = 1/1000 Mb

Ashley's internet connection speed is 20 kb/s. To convert it to Mb/s, we multiply it by 1/1000:

20 kb/s * (1/1000) = 0.02 Mb/s

There are 3600 seconds in an hour. To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we multiply her speed in Mb/s by the number of seconds in an hour:

"To find out how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to calculate the difference between his current height and the required height, and then divide that by his growth rate.

First, let's convert Adam's height from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

40 inches / 12 = 3.33 feet

Since Adam needs to be 4 feet tall to ride the roller coaster, we subtract his current height from the required height:

4 feet - 3.33 feet = 0.67 feet

Now, we need to convert this difference back to inches, since Adam's growth rate is given in inches per year:

0.67 feet * 12 inches/foot = 8 inches

Now, we can divide the difference in height by Adam's growth rate to find out how many years it will take for him to reach the required height:

8 inches / 2 inches/year = 4 years

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To find out how much James made, we need to calculate the profit from selling the cars, then apply his commission.

First, let's find the total cost of the cars: 10 cars * $25,000 = $250,000.

The company paid 30% of the cost to acquire the cars, so the amount they paid is 0.3 * $250,000 = $75,000.

The profit from selling the cars is the selling price minus the cost: $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.

James gets a 10% commission on the profit, so his commission is 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

Therefore, James made $17,500.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that 25% of the 100 riders can stay upright on the wave. To find the number of riders who can stay upright, we multiply 100 by 0.25 (which is 25% expressed as a decimal).

100 * 0.25 = 25

So, 25 riders can stay upright on the wave.

Next, we are told that 60% of these 25 riders are women. To find the number of women who can stay upright, we multiply 25 by 0.6 (which is 60% expressed as a decimal).

25 * 0.6 = 15

Since the remaining riders who can stay upright are men, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright.

25 - 15 = 10

Therefore, 10 men can stay upright on the wave.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total price for all three jewels, we need to find the prices of the gold and silver jewels first.

Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, we know that the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of a diamond jewel. 

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * Price of diamond jewel
Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * $2000
Price of gold jewel = $1600

The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold. 

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
Price of silver jewel = $1600 - $400
Price of silver jewel = $1200

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels.

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
Total price = $2000 + $1600 + $1200
Total price = $4800

"To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to determine the number of each type of stamp and then add them together.

Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. 
He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.
He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

Now, we add the number of each type of stamp together: 16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45.

The final answer is: 45"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the relative speed between Bob and Tom. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract Tom's speed from Bob's speed to get the relative speed.

Relative speed = Bob's speed - Tom's speed
Relative speed = 55 mph - 70 mph
Relative speed = -15 mph

However, since we are dealing with a time problem, we need to consider the absolute value of the relative speed, which is the distance between them divided by the relative speed.

Relative speed = 15 mph (absolute value)

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed

Time = Distance / Relative speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many fish Darren caught first, and then add 3 to that number to find out how many fish Tommy caught.

We know that Naomi caught 17 fish. Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, so we subtract 6 from 17 to find out how many fish Darren caught:

17 (Naomi's fish) - 6 = 11

Now that we know Darren caught 11 fish, we add 3 to find out how many fish Tommy caught:

11 (Darren's fish) + 3 = 14

So, Tommy caught 14 fish.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many classes Manny can miss before the average cost per class exceeds $10. 

Let's assume Manny misses 'x' classes. Since there are 10 total classes, he will attend 10 - x classes. 

The total cost of the classes will be $60, which is the cost of all 10 classes. 

The cost per class can be calculated as: Total Cost / Number of Classes Attended

We want to find the maximum number of classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10. 

So, we set up the inequality: (60 / (10 - x)) > 10

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by (10 - x) to get: 60 > 10(10 - x)

Expanding the right side, we get: 60 > 100 - 10x

Subtracting 60 from both sides, we get: 0 > 40 - 10x

Adding 10x to both sides, we get: 10x > 40

Dividing both sides by 10, we get: x < 4

Since x represents the number of classes Manny can miss, we want to find the maximum value of x. Therefore, the maximum number of classes Manny can miss is 3.

"To find the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges, we first need to find the cost of one apple and one orange. 

The cost of 4 apples is $5.20, so the cost of one apple is $5.20 / 4 = $1.30. 

The cost of 3 oranges is $3.30, so the cost of one orange is $3.30 / 3 = $1.10.

Now, we can find the cost of 5 apples: 5 apples * $1.30/apple = $6.50.

Next, we can find the cost of 5 oranges: 5 oranges * $1.10/orange = $5.50.

Finally, we can find the total cost by adding the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges: $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To find the volume of the hole, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth. 

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Since it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we can multiply the volume by the time it takes to shovel one cubic foot.

Time = Volume * time per cubic foot
Time = 72 * 3
Time = 216 seconds

Therefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add them to the base price.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade costs $7,500.

The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of the leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of the running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the features and the base price:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

"To find out how much Tim will make in a year, we need to calculate his new monthly salary and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's calculate the 5% raise on his $20,000 monthly salary. 
5% of $20,000 is 0.05 * $20,000 = $1,000. 
So, his new monthly salary will be $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000.

Next, let's calculate the bonus, which is half a month's salary. 
Half of $20,000 is $10,000. 

Now, let's add the bonus to his new monthly salary. 
$21,000 (new monthly salary) + $10,000 (bonus) = $31,000 (total monthly income).

To find out how much he will make in a year, we multiply his total monthly income by 12. 
$31,000 * 12 = $372,000.

"To find the age of Steve's son's wife, we need to determine the ages of Steve's son and his wife.

First, we know Steve's age is 60 years. His wife is 4 years older than him, so she is 60 + 4 = 64 years old.

Their son is half as old as his mom, so his age is 64 / 2 = 32 years.

Steve's son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, so her age is 32 - 3 = 29 years.

"To find the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions, we first need to find the total amount of flour in one bag. Since the bag is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, we can find the total amount of flour in one bag by multiplying the number of portions by the weight of each portion.

Total flour in one bag = 8 portions * 2 kilograms/portion = 16 kilograms

Now, we need to find the total amount of flour in three bags. We can do this by multiplying the total amount of flour in one bag by 3.

Total flour in three bags = 16 kilograms/bag * 3 bags = 48 kilograms

"To find the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley, we need to calculate the distance each of them biked and then add them together.

Alisa biked at 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours. To find the distance she biked, we multiply her speed by the time:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 12 miles/hour x 4.5 hours
Distance = 54 miles

Stanley biked at 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours. To find the distance he biked, we multiply his speed by the time:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour x 2.5 hours
Distance = 25 miles

Now, we add the distances biked by Alisa and Stanley to find the total distance:

Total Distance = Distance biked by Alisa + Distance biked by Stanley
Total Distance = 54 miles + 25 miles
Total Distance = 79 miles

The final answer is: 79"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay separately, and then add those times together.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil. Bill can dig 4 feet/hour through soil, and he needs to dig 24 feet of soil. 

Time to dig through soil = Total soil depth / Rate of digging through soil
Time to dig through soil = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour
Time to dig through soil = 6 hours

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the clay. Bill can dig half as fast through clay as he can through soil, so his rate of digging through clay is 4 / 2 = 2 feet/hour. He needs to dig 8 feet of clay.

Time to dig through clay = Total clay depth / Rate of digging through clay
Time to dig through clay = 8 feet / 2 feet/hour
Time to dig through clay = 4 hours

Now, we add the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay to get the total time.

Total time = Time to dig through soil + Time to dig through clay
Total time = 6 hours + 4 hours
Total time = 10 hours

"To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost for each day and then subtract the two totals.

On the first day, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, but she got a $2 discount. So, the total cost for the first day is:
20 pomegranates * $20 each = $400
Discount of $2 = $400 - $2 = $398

On the second day, the price per pomegranate is $30, and there's a 10% discount on the total cost. The total cost for the second day is:
20 pomegranates * $30 each = $600
10% discount on $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
Total cost after discount = $600 - $60 = $540

Now, let's find the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days:
Difference = Total cost on the first day - Total cost on the second day
Difference = $398 - $540
Difference = -$142

The final answer is: $142"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find the total sales from green hats in the first month. Since the sales from red hats were half the total amount she earned from selling green hats, let's denote the total sales from green hats as 'x'. Then, the sales from red hats would be 'x/2'.

We know that the sales from red hats were $400, so we can set up the equation:

x/2 = 400

To find 'x', we multiply both sides by 2:

x = 400 * 2
x = 800

So, the total sales from green hats in the first month were $800.

Now, let's find the total sales from both red and green hats in the first month:

Total sales in the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
= 400 + 800
= 1200

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. To find the total sales in the second month, we multiply the total sales in the first month by 3/4:

Total sales in the second month = (3/4) * 1200
= 900

Now, let's find the total sales in two months:

Total sales in two months = Total sales in the first month + Total sales in the second month
= 1200 + 900
= 2100

The final answer is: $2100"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the number of paid hours and the total cost for those hours.

James gets 1 hour free, so he pays for 8 hours (9 PM - 5 PM = 4 hours, but he gets 1 hour free, so 4 - 1 = 3 hours, and then 3 + 5 = 8 hours).

The first hour costs $15. Each hour after that costs twice the cost, which is $15 * 2 = $30.

So, the cost for the first hour is $15, and the cost for the remaining 7 hours is $30 * 7 = $210.

The total cost is $15 + $210 = $225.

The final answer is: $225"
"To find out how many dollars were withheld from Sally's wage, we need to calculate the difference between her expected wage and the actual amount in her account. 

First, let's find out how much money Sally should have in her account if she received her full wage. Since her weekly wage is $300, and her account held $200 at the start of the week, the total amount she should have in her account is $200 (initial amount) + $300 (expected wage) = $500.

However, her account now holds $420. To find out how much was withheld, we subtract the actual amount from the expected amount: $500 (expected amount) - $420 (actual amount) = $80.

So, $80 was withheld from Sally's wage.

"To determine the total number of deviled egg halves needed, we need to multiply the number of guests by the number of deviled egg halves each guest will eat. 

Number of guests: 16
Number of deviled egg halves per guest: 3
Total deviled egg halves needed: 16 * 3 = 48

Since each deviled egg is made from 2 halves, we need to divide the total number of deviled egg halves by 2 to find the total number of whole eggs needed.

Total deviled egg halves: 48
Number of deviled egg halves per whole egg: 2
Total whole eggs needed: 48 / 2 = 24

To find the number of dozens of eggs needed, we divide the total number of whole eggs by 12 (since 1 dozen = 12).

Total whole eggs needed: 24
Number of eggs per dozen: 12
Number of dozens of eggs needed: 24 / 12 = 2

"To find the total cost of the plane for the first year, we need to calculate the cost of the plane itself, the hanger rental, and the fuel costs.

The cost of the plane is $150,000.

The hanger rental is $5000 per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total hanger rental cost for the first year is $5000 * 12 = $60,000.

The fuel cost is twice the hanger rental, which is $5000 * 2 = $10,000 per month. The total fuel cost for the first year is $10,000 * 12 = $120,000.

Now, we add up the costs: $150,000 (plane) + $60,000 (hanger rental) + $120,000 (fuel) = $330,000.

The final answer is: $330,000"
"Let's break down the information given:

For the first mixture, we have 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts. The cost of almonds is $10 per pound, and the cost of walnuts is $15 per pound. 

The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is (1/2) * $10 = $5.
The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is (1/3) * $15 = $5.

The total cost of the first mixture is $5 + $5 = $10.

For the second mixture, we have 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.

The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is (1/5) * $10 = $2.
The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is (1/3) * $15 = $5.

The total cost of the second mixture is $2 + $5 = $7.

"Let's denote the number of sheep as S and the number of geese as G. We know that sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs. We also know that the total number of animal heads is 20, which means S + G = 20.

We are also given that the total number of animal legs is 70. Since sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs, we can write the equation 4S + 2G = 70.

Now we have a system of two equations:

1) S + G = 20
2) 4S + 2G = 70

We can solve this system of equations by multiplying the first equation by 2 to get 2S + 2G = 40, and then subtracting it from the second equation to eliminate G.

(4S + 2G) - (2S + 2G) = 70 - 40
2S = 30

Dividing both sides by 2, we get S = 15.

20% of $5 is 0.20 * $5 = $1. 
So, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

The total cost of the coffee is 7 pounds * $6 per pound = $42.

He also bought a donut for $2.

The total cost is $42 (coffee) + $2 (donut) = $44.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the amount of money Kassidy and Rayna have. 

First, we know Aurelia has $120. Since Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, we can calculate Kassidy's money as follows:
Kassidy's money = 3/4 * Aurelia's money
Kassidy's money = 3/4 * 120
Kassidy's money = 90

Now, we know Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy. So, we can calculate Rayna's money as follows:
Rayna's money = Kassidy's money + 60
Rayna's money = 90 + 60
Rayna's money = 150

Now that we have the money of all three, we can find the total amount of money they have together:
Total money = Aurelia's money + Kassidy's money + Rayna's money
Total money = 120 + 90 + 150
Total money = 360

To find out how much each would have if they decided to add together their money and share equally among them, we need to divide the total money by 3:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs. This means each dog has 1 toy. When 8 more dogs arrive, James needs 8 more toys to bring the total to 12 dogs with 1 toy each. So, he buys 8 more toys.

Now, there are 12 dogs, and James goes back to find that there are twice as many more dogs, which means there are 2 * 8 = 16 more dogs. This makes a total of 12 + 16 = 28 dogs. Since each dog needs 1 toy, James needs 16 more toys to bring the total to 28 dogs with 1 toy each.

However, when James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs those toys. This means he needs 16 - 3 = 13 toys for the remaining 25 dogs.

To find the total number of toys James needs, we add the initial 4 toys, the 8 toys he bought first, and the 13 toys he bought later. 

4 (initial toys) + 8 (first purchase) + 13 (second purchase) = 25

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cookies Max and Summer have. 

Since Katarina has 68 cookies and she has 5 less than Max, Max must have 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.

Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, but we don't know how many cookies the Cookie Monster has. However, we can express the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has as x. Then, Max has x + 12 cookies.

Since Max has 73 cookies, we can set up the equation x + 12 = 73. Solving for x, we get x = 73 - 12 = 61. So, the Cookie Monster has 61 cookies.

Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, and Max has 73 cookies. Therefore, Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Now, we can find the total number of cookies by adding the number of cookies Katarina, Max, and Summer have: 68 + 73 + 96 = 237.

The final answer is: 237"
"To find the original length of the dress, we need to work backwards from the final design length. 

First, we know that the final design length is 140cm, and 20cm of that is the lace trim. So, the original length of the dress before adding the lace trim is 140cm - 20cm = 120cm.

Since the dress was extended by 50% of its original length, let's call the original length 'x'. The extension is 50% of 'x', which is 0.5x. The total length after the extension is x + 0.5x = 1.5x.

We know that 1.5x = 120cm (the length before adding the lace trim). To find 'x', we divide both sides by 1.5:

x = 120cm / 1.5
x = 80cm

So, the original length of the dress was 80cm.

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes to mow half the lawn in each mode and then add them together.

First, let's find the time it takes to mow half the lawn in turtle mode. Since it takes 1 hour to mow the entire lawn in turtle mode, it will take 0.5 hours to mow half the lawn. We need to convert this to minutes, so we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

0.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 30 minutes

Next, let's find the time it takes to mow half the lawn in rabbit mode. Since it takes 40 minutes to mow the entire lawn in rabbit mode, it will take 20 minutes to mow half the lawn.

Now, we add the times together to find the total time it took to mow the lawn:

30 minutes (turtle mode) + 20 minutes (rabbit mode) = 50 minutes

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how much longer they have to get to school without being late, we need to calculate the total time it takes to get to the fire station and then subtract that from the total time they have to walk to school.

They have 30 minutes to walk to school. 

It takes them 6 minutes to get to the corner where the library is and another 13 minutes to get to the fire station. So, the total time taken to get to the fire station is 6 + 13 = 19 minutes.

Now, we subtract the time taken to get to the fire station from the total time they have to walk to school: 30 - 19 = 11 minutes.

They have 11 minutes left to get to school without being late."

"To find out how many cookies are in the box, we first need to determine the total number of cookies baked by Greta and Celinda. Greta bakes 30 cookies, and Celinda bakes twice as many, which is 2 * 30 = 60 cookies. 

So, the total number of cookies baked is 30 + 60 = 90 cookies. 

After eating 10 cookies, the number of cookies left is 90 - 10 = 80 cookies.

The final answer is: 80"
"Let's denote the age of the younger twin as T, the age of the older twin as T+7, and the age of the triplet as t. We know that there are two twins and one triplet, so we can write the equation: 2T + t = 44.

We also know that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so we can write another equation: T = t + 7.

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first one: 2(t + 7) + t = 44.

Expanding the equation, we get: 2t + 14 + t = 44.

Combine like terms: 3t + 14 = 44.

Subtract 14 from both sides: 3t = 30.

Divide both sides by 3: t = 10.

Now that we know the age of the triplet, we can find the age of the older twin: T = t + 7 = 10 + 7 = 17.

"To find out how many minutes John has to nap, we first need to calculate the total time he spends on his homework. 

Math homework: 20 minutes
Reading homework: 40 minutes
History homework: 20 minutes
Total homework time: 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes

Since John has 3 hours before dinner, we need to convert the hours to minutes. 
3 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 180 minutes

Now, we subtract the total homework time from the total available time to find out how many minutes John has to nap.
Time available for nap: 180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we first need to find the cost of one candy. We know that 5 lollipops and 4 candies cost $3.20. 

First, let's find the total cost of the lollipops: 5 lollipops * $0.40 = $2.00. 

Now, let's subtract the cost of the lollipops from the total cost to find the cost of the candies: $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20. 

Since there are 4 candies, the cost of one candy is $1.20 / 4 = $0.30.

Now, let's find the cost of 10 lollipops: 10 lollipops * $0.40 = $4.00.

The cost of 10 candies is 10 * $0.30 = $3.00.

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00.

The final answer is: $7.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many coins Rong and Neil save per month. Rong saves 20 coins per month. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, which is 20 + (2/5 * 20) = 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Now, let's calculate the total number of months they have been saving. Since they started saving 10 years ago, and there are 12 months in a year, the total number of months is 10 * 12 = 120 months.

Now, let's calculate the total number of coins Rong and Neil have saved. Rong saves 20 coins per month, so in 120 months, he will have saved 20 * 120 = 2400 coins. Neil saves 28 coins per month, so in 120 months, he will have saved 28 * 120 = 3360 coins.

The total number of coins they have saved is 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins.

The final answer is: 5760"
"To find the total bill, we first need to calculate the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check. The cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40. 

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, which means the total bill is the heartworm check divided by 0.6. Let's call the total bill 'x'. Then, 0.6x = $40 + $20 (heartworm check). However, we don't know the cost of the heartworm check yet, so we'll express it in terms of x.

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so the cost of the heartworm check is 0.6x. The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check, which is $40 + 0.6x.

Since the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, we can set up the equation: 0.6x = 0.4x + $40. Subtracting 0.4x from both sides, we get 0.2x = $40. Dividing both sides by 0.2, we get x = $200.

Now that we know the total bill is $200, we can find the cost of the heartworm check, which is 0.6 * $200 = $120.

John brought $125 with him, so he leaves with $125 - $200 = -$75. However, since you can't leave with a negative amount of money, this means John doesn't have enough money to pay the total bill.

The final answer is: $-75"
"To find the total price of the crate, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and add them together.

The cost of one banana is twice as much as one apple, so it's 2 * $0.5 = $1.
The cost of one orange is three times as much as one banana, so it's 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of each type of fruit in one crate:
- Bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- Apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- Oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

Adding these costs together, we get the total price of the crate: $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

The final answer is: $32"
"To find the total number of square feet in Brittany's comforter, we need to calculate the total number of squares and multiply it by the area of each square, which is 1 square foot.

First, let's find the number of blue squares. Since there are 4 more blue squares than red squares, and there are 14 red squares, the number of blue squares is 14 + 4 = 18.

Next, let's find the number of green squares. Since there are 6 more green squares than blue squares, and there are 18 blue squares, the number of green squares is 18 + 6 = 24.

Now, let's find the number of white squares. Since there are 12 fewer white squares than green squares, and there are 24 green squares, the number of white squares is 24 - 12 = 12.

Now, let's add up the number of squares of each color: 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68.

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

The final answer is: 68"
"To find out how many chairs Mia needs, we first need to determine the total number of chairs she has. Since there are 8 high chairs and the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs, we can calculate the number of regular chairs by multiplying 8 by 5.

8 high chairs * 5 = 40 regular chairs

Now, we add the number of high chairs and regular chairs to find the total number of chairs.

8 high chairs + 40 regular chairs = 48 chairs

Since there will be 42 adults and 15 babies attending, we need to find the total number of chairs required. Babies will use high chairs, so we add the number of adults and babies.

42 adults + 15 babies = 57 people

Since each person needs a chair, we need 57 chairs in total. To find out how many more chairs Mia needs, we subtract the number of chairs she has from the total number of chairs required.

57 total chairs - 48 available chairs = 9 more chairs

"To find the number of 8-point bucks, we first need to find the total number of bucks in the field. Since 50% of the deer are bucks, we can calculate this as follows:

Total deer = 50
Bucks = 50% of 50 = 0.5 * 50 = 25

Next, we need to find the number of 8-point bucks. Since 20% of the bucks are 8-point, we can calculate this as follows:

8-point bucks = 20% of 25 = 0.2 * 25 = 5

So, there are 5 8-point bucks in the field.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the total points collected by Adam, Betty, Martha, and Tom, and then subtract that from the minimum threshold of 400 points.

First, let's find Betty's points. Since Betty collected 30% more points than Adam, we can calculate it as follows:
Betty's points = Adam's points + (30% of Adam's points)
Betty's points = 50 + (0.3 * 50)
Betty's points = 50 + 15
Betty's points = 65

Now, let's find Tom's points. We know that Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom, and Martha's points are not given. However, we can express Martha's points in terms of Tom's points:
Martha's points = 3 * Tom's points

We also know that Tom has 30 points less than Betty:
Tom's points = Betty's points - 30
Tom's points = 65 - 30
Tom's points = 35

Now, we can find Martha's points:
Martha's points = 3 * Tom's points
Martha's points = 3 * 35
Martha's points = 105

Now, let's find the total points collected by the class:
Total points = Adam's points + Betty's points + Martha's points + Tom's points
Total points = 50 + 65 + 105 + 35
Total points = 255

To find the points the class is missing, we subtract the total points from the minimum threshold:
Points missing = Minimum threshold - Total points
Points missing = 400 - 255
Points missing = 145

The city is setting off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each. So, the total number of fireworks set off in the city is 15 * 20 = 300.

Hannah will see 40% of the city's fireworks. To find 40% of 300, we multiply 300 by 0.4. 300 * 0.4 = 120.

Hannah will also set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each in her backyard. So, the total number of fireworks set off in her backyard is 3 * 5 = 15.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the capacity of Gary's truck. 

First, let's find out how much Gordy's truck can carry. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, Gordy's truck can carry 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.

Now, let's find the combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks. 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds.

Since the three trucks combined can haul 11,600 pounds, we can find the capacity of Gary's truck by subtracting the combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity. 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 pounds.

There are 8 males in the group, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32.

There are 6 females in the group, and each female ate 3 dumplings, so the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.

The total number of dumplings eaten by the group is 32 (males) + 18 (females) = 50.

"To find out how many hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we need to determine how much more money they need to raise and then divide that by the amount they raise per hour.

First, let's find out how much more money they need to raise: 
$6300 (goal) - $2100 (raised so far) = $4200

Since they raised $2100 in 3 hours, we can find out their hourly rate by dividing the amount raised by the number of hours:
$2100 / 3 hours = $700 per hour

Now, let's divide the remaining amount they need to raise by their hourly rate to find out how many more hours they need to fundraise:
$4200 / $700 per hour = 6 hours

Since they've already raised money for 3 hours, we need to add those hours to the hours they need to fundraise:
6 hours + 3 hours = 9 hours

The firefighters need to fundraise for a total of 9 hours to reach their goal.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the rate at which the factory makes chocolate and vanilla ice cream per hour.

For chocolate ice cream, the factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours. To find the rate per hour, we divide the total quarts by the number of hours: 100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts per hour.

For vanilla ice cream, the factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours. To find the rate per hour, we divide the total quarts by the number of hours: 50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now, we need to find the total quarts made in 48 hours. We multiply the rate per hour for each flavor by the total number of hours and add the results together: (50 quarts/hour * 48 hours) + (12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours) = 2400 + 600 = 3000 quarts.

"To find Marcus' total bill, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he ordered and then apply the 10% discount.

First, let's calculate the total cost of each type of item:

- 5 croissants at $3.00 apiece: 5 x $3.00 = $15.00
- 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each: 4 x $2.50 = $10.00
- 3 mini quiches at $4.00 apiece: 3 x $4.00 = $12.00
- 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 apiece: 13 x $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
$15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Since Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him 10% off his purchase, we need to calculate the discount amount:
10% of $50.00 = 0.10 x $50.00 = $5.00

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many scoops Erin can buy with her $6.00. Since each scoop costs $1.50, we can divide the total amount of money Erin has by the cost of each scoop.

$6.00 ÷ $1.50 = 4

This means Erin can buy 4 scoops of ice cream. However, the deal is buy 2 scoops get 1 free, so we need to consider the free scoop as well. 

Since Erin can buy 4 scoops, and the deal is buy 2 get 1 free, she can buy 2 sets of 3 scoops (2 paid scoops + 1 free scoop). 

2 sets of 3 scoops = 6 scoops

So, Erin should buy 6 scoops of ice cream.

Goldy bought 20 sacks of rice and gave 3 sacks to her cousin and 4 sacks to her brother. So, the total number of sacks she gave away is 3 + 4 = 7 sacks.

Since each sack contains 25 kilograms of rice, we can find the total amount of rice given away by multiplying the number of sacks given away by the weight of each sack. 

Total rice given away = 7 sacks * 25 kilograms/sack = 175 kilograms.

The final answer is: 175"
"To find out how many more boxes of cereal Castle bought this week than last week, we need to first determine the total number of boxes she bought this week and last week. 

This week, Castle bought 3 boxes of Coco Crunch and 5 boxes of Fruit Loops. So, the total number of boxes she bought this week is 3 + 5 = 8.

Last week, she bought 4 boxes of cereal.

Now, to find the difference, we subtract the number of boxes bought last week from the number of boxes bought this week: 8 - 4 = 4.

"To find the total number of taps, we need to calculate the number of taps for each scenario and add them together.

When Helga's arms are at her sides, she taps her right foot at 300 taps per minute and her left foot at 250 taps per minute. The combined rate is 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute.

When her arms are raised, she taps at a rate of 200 taps per minute with each foot. The combined rate is 200 + 200 = 400 taps per minute.

Helga dances for 5 minutes in total, with her arms raised for 2 minutes and her arms at her sides for 3 minutes. 

The number of taps with her arms at her sides is 550 taps/minute * 3 minutes = 1650 taps.
The number of taps with her arms raised is 400 taps/minute * 2 minutes = 800 taps.

The total number of taps is 1650 + 800 = 2450 taps.

The final answer is: 2450"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole and compare it to the potential damage to Ron's car.

The cost of fixing the pothole includes the fine for unauthorized road maintenance and the cost of the asphalt. The fine is $120, and the cost of 3 buckets of asphalt is 3 * $25 = $75. 

The total cost of fixing the pothole is $120 + $75 = $195.

The potential damage to Ron's car is $450.

To find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole, we subtract the total cost of fixing the pothole from the potential damage to his car: $450 - $195 = $255.

The final answer is: $255"
"To find the total number of chairs left, we need to subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the total number of chairs initially available.

First, let's find the total number of chairs initially available: 
170 (normal chairs) + 23 (baby chairs) = 193 chairs

Next, let's find the total number of chairs sent for repair: 
20 (normal chairs) + 13 (baby chairs) = 33 chairs

Now, let's subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the total number of chairs initially available:
193 (initial chairs) - 33 (chairs sent for repair) = 160 chairs

The restaurant has 160 chairs left.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many slices were eaten by Bryce and his friends, and then subtract that from the total number of slices.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 5 people in total, including Bryce, and 2/3 of them ate 2/3 of their pizzas, we can consider 2/3 of 5 people as 10/15 or 2/3. Since each pizza has 12 slices, 2/3 of a pizza is (2/3) * 12 = 8 slices.

Since there are 5 people, including Bryce, and each person has 1 pizza, the total number of slices eaten by Bryce and his 2 friends is 5 * 8 = 40 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 friends, we can consider 2/3 of 2 people as 4/6 or 2/3. Since each pizza has 12 slices, 2/3 of a pizza is (2/3) * 12 = 8 slices. Since there are 2 friends, the total number of slices eaten by the remaining friends is 2 * 8 = 16 slices.

The total number of slices eaten is 40 + 16 = 56 slices.

Since there are 5 people and each person has 1 pizza, the total number of slices is 5 * 12 = 60 slices.

The number of slices left is 60 - 56 = 4 slices.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the average time the cat and dog take to eat the sausages, we first need to determine the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages. 

The cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes. Since the dog eats the same number of sausages in 2/3 the amount of time the cat takes, we can calculate the dog's time as follows:

Dog's time = (2/3) * Cat's time
Dog's time = (2/3) * 30 minutes
Dog's time = 20 minutes

Now, we have the time taken by both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages: 
Cat's time = 30 minutes
Dog's time = 20 minutes

To find the average time, we add the times taken by both the cat and the dog and divide by 2:

Average time = (Cat's time + Dog's time) / 2
Average time = (30 + 20) / 2
Average time = 50 / 2
Average time = 25 minutes

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to first convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

8 feet * 12 inches/foot = 96 inches
Adding the 4 inches, we get:
96 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's represent the length of one of Bobby's shoes as 'x'. Then, the length of one of Topher's shoes can be represented as 9x + 10. We know this is equal to 100 inches, so we can set up the equation:

9x + 10 = 100

Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation gives us:

9x = 90

Dividing both sides of the equation by 9 gives us:

x = 10

So, one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches long.

"To find the total number of windows smashed, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed from students' cars and teachers' cars separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of windows smashed from students' cars. There are 64 students' cars with 4 windows each. A quarter of the students' cars' windows are smashed, which is 1/4 * 64 = 16 cars. Since each car has 4 windows, the total number of windows smashed from students' cars is 16 * 4 = 64.

Next, let's find the number of windows smashed from teachers' cars. There are 32 teachers' cars with 2 windows each. Three-fourths of the teachers' cars' windows are smashed, which is 3/4 * 32 = 24 cars. Since each car has 2 windows, the total number of windows smashed from teachers' cars is 24 * 2 = 48.

Now, let's add the number of windows smashed from students' cars and teachers' cars to find the total number of windows smashed. 64 + 48 = 112.

"To find the total number of blue spools, we need to add the number of light blue and dark blue spools. 

Total blue spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60

Next, we need to find the total number of spools. 

Total spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 150

Now, we can find the percentage of blue spools by dividing the total number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of blue spools = (60 / 150) * 100 = 40%

The final answer is: 40"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Initially, 5000 people were in line at 8:00. By midday, 2/5 of them had voted. 

2/5 of 5000 is (2/5) * 5000 = 2000 people who voted by midday.

So, the number of people remaining by midday is 5000 - 2000 = 3000.

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. 

2/3 of 3000 is (2/3) * 3000 = 2000 people who voted by 16:00.

The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is the remaining people who were in line at 8:00 minus the people who voted by 16:00. 

So, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 3000 - 2000 = 1000.

"To find out how many packs of gum Parker will need, we need to calculate the total number of pieces of gum he will need for 30 days and then divide that by the number of pieces in a pack.

Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day. To find the total number of pieces he will need for 30 days, we multiply the number of pieces he chews per day by 30:

4 pieces/day * 30 days = 120 pieces

Now, we need to divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces in a pack to find out how many packs he will need:

120 pieces / 15 pieces/pack = 8 packs

So, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days.

"To determine the number of boxes of graham crackers needed, we first need to calculate the total number of s'mores required.

9 kids want 2 s'mores each, so the total number of s'mores for kids is 9 * 2 = 18.
6 adults will eat 1 s'more each, so the total number of s'mores for adults is 6 * 1 = 6.
The total number of s'mores needed is 18 (for kids) + 6 (for adults) = 24.

Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 large s'mores, we need to divide the total number of s'mores by 8 to find out how many sleeves are needed: 24 / 8 = 3.

There are 3 sleeves in a box, so to find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the total number of sleeves required by 3: 3 / 3 = 1.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the ages of Dora's father and mother. 

Given that Dora is 15 years old, we can find her father's age by using the information that her father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. 

Father's age = 2 * Dora's age + 8
Father's age = 2 * 15 + 8
Father's age = 30 + 8
Father's age = 38

Now, we know that Dora's mother is four years younger than her father. 

Mother's age = Father's age - 4
Mother's age = 38 - 4
Mother's age = 34

To find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we add their ages together.

Total combined age = Dora's age + Father's age + Mother's age
Total combined age = 15 + 38 + 34
Total combined age = 87

"To find the number of votes candidate C received, we first need to determine the number of votes candidate B received. 

Candidate A received 20% of the votes, which is 0.2 * 100 = 20 votes.

Candidate B received 50% more than candidate A's votes, so we need to calculate 50% of 20 and add it to 20. 
50% of 20 is 0.5 * 20 = 10. 
So, candidate B received 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

Since there are 100 voters in total, the total number of votes is 100. 
Candidate A and B together received 20 + 30 = 50 votes. 
Therefore, candidate C received 100 - 50 = 50 votes.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many apples Beck has initially. Since Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, and Boris has 100 apples, we can calculate Beck's initial number of apples as follows:

Beck's initial apples = Boris's apples - 23
Beck's initial apples = 100 - 23
Beck's initial apples = 77

Now, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. So, Beck's new number of apples is:

Beck's new apples = Beck's initial apples + 10
Beck's new apples = 77 + 10
Beck's new apples = 87

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris. Boris still has 100 apples, and Beck has 87 apples. So, the difference is:

Difference = Boris's apples - Beck's new apples
Difference = 100 - 87
Difference = 13

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many books Steven has, and then compare Clara's and Alice's book counts.

Since Clara has two times as many books as Steven, and Clara has 20 books, we can set up the equation: 2 * Steven's books = 20. 

To find Steven's books, we divide both sides of the equation by 2: Steven's books = 20 / 2 = 10.

Now we know Steven has 10 books. Since Alice has 6 more books than Steven, we can find Alice's book count by adding 6 to Steven's count: Alice's books = 10 + 6 = 16.

To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract Alice's book count from Clara's: Clara's books - Alice's books = 20 - 16 = 4.

Half-gallon jar = 5 - 2
Half-gallon jar = 3

Now that we know the cost of a half-gallon jar, we can find the cost of 16 half-gallon jars:

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, Lorraine has 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

First, she trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers. 
Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons from trading 27 small stickers.

Now, she has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

Next, she trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers. 
Since each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons, she gets 20 large buttons from trading 20 large stickers.

Now, she has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

She trades the rest of her large stickers (20) for small buttons. 
Since each large sticker is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons from trading 20 large stickers.

Now, let's calculate the total number of buttons she has. 
She has 27 small buttons from trading small stickers, 20 large buttons from trading large stickers, and 60 small buttons from trading large stickers. 
So, the total number of buttons she has is 27 + 20 + 60 = 107 buttons.

"To find the discount amount, we need to calculate 5% of the original price. 

5% of $140 = 0.05 * $140 = $7

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the final amount.

$140 - $7 = $133

So, you will pay $133 after the discount.

The final answer is: $133"
"To find the total number of hours the 20 playlists will last, we need to first find the total number of songs in all the playlists. Since each playlist has 300 songs and there are 20 playlists, the total number of songs is 300 * 20 = 6000.

Since each song is 10 hours long, we multiply the total number of songs by the length of each song to find the total hours. So, 6000 songs * 10 hours/song = 60000 hours.

The final answer is: 60000"
"To find the number of people who think horse #12 will win, we first need to find the number of people who think horse #2 will win and then the number of people who think horse #7 will win.

20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win. To find 20% of 50, we multiply 50 by 0.2.

50 * 0.2 = 10

So, 10 people think horse #2 will win.

Now, we need to find the number of people who think horse #7 will win. 60% of the remaining people think horse #7 will win. The remaining people are 50 - 10 = 40.

60% of 40 is 0.6 * 40 = 24.

So, 24 people think horse #7 will win.

Now, we need to find the number of people who think horse #12 will win. The total number of people who think either horse #2 or horse #7 will win is 10 + 24 = 34.

The number of people who think horse #12 will win is 50 - 34 = 16.

The final answer is: 16"
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given. We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. 

Let's denote the total number of Pomeranians as P. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we can set up the equation:

1/3 * P = 6

To find the total number of Pomeranians, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3:

P = 6 * 3
P = 18

Now that we know there are 18 Pomeranians, and two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can denote the total number of puppies as J. We can set up the equation:

2/3 * J = 18

To find the total number of puppies, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3/2:

J = 18 * (3/2)
J = 27

So, Jana has 27 puppies. 

The final answer is: 27"
"To find out how much more Jayden needs to buy the camera, we first need to calculate how much money he has after receiving the money from his sister. 

Jayden initially had $70. His sister gave him half of her $90 allowance, which is $45. 

So, Jayden now has $70 + $45 = $115.

The camera costs $200. To find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the amount he has from the cost of the camera: $200 - $115 = $85.

Therefore, Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera.

The final answer is: $85"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. 

Let's denote the number of cases of shingles the second house needs as 'x'. Since the first house needs 1/2 of what the second house needs, the first house needs x/2 cases of shingles.

We are given that the third house needs double the first house, so the third house needs 2 * (x/2) = x cases of shingles.

We know that the total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. We can set up an equation to represent this:

x + x/2 + x = 250

To simplify the equation, we can multiply all terms by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + x + 2x = 500

Combine like terms:

5x = 500

Now, divide both sides by 5:

x = 100

Since the third house needs x cases of shingles, and we found that x = 100, the third house needs 100 cases of shingles.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of the items each person bought and then add them together.

Leila bought 3 cucumbers at $2 each, so the total cost for Leila is 3 * $2 = $6.

Jack bought 5 tomatoes at $1 each, so the total cost for Jack is 5 * $1 = $5.

Chase bought 1 head of lettuce at $3, so the total cost for Chase is $3.

Now, let's add the costs together: $6 (Leila) + $5 (Jack) + $3 (Chase) = $14.

The final answer is: $14"
"To find the number of pears George has, we need to calculate 45% of the number of bananas and add it to the number of bananas. 

First, let's find 45% of 200 bananas:
45% of 200 = 0.45 * 200 = 90

Now, let's add the result to the number of bananas:
200 (bananas) + 90 (additional pears) = 290

Since George has both bananas and pears, we need to add the number of bananas and pears to find the total number of fruits:
290 (bananas and pears) + 200 (bananas) = 490

The total number of fruits George has is 490."
"To find out how many candy bars Marissa bought for Jimmy, we need to subtract the cost of the ball from the amount of money Marissa had initially. 

Marissa had $80 initially and spent $20 on the ball. 

$80 (initial money) - $20 (cost of the ball) = $60

Now, we need to find out how many candy bars Marissa can buy with $60, given that each candy bar costs $5.

$60 (remaining money) / $5 (cost of each candy bar) = 12

So, Marissa bought 12 candy bars for Jimmy.

12"
"To find out how much money Sam needs to spend, we first need to determine how many kilograms of oranges are required to make 4 liters of juice. Since Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges to make 1 liter of juice, we can multiply this by 4 to find the total amount needed for 4 liters.

5 kilograms/orange * 4 liters/orange = 20 kilograms/orange

Now, we know that each kilogram of oranges costs $3. To find the total cost, we multiply the total kilograms of oranges needed by the cost per kilogram.

20 kilograms/orange * $3/kilogram = $60

So, Sam would have to spend $60 to make 4 liters of juice.

The final answer is: $60"
"To find out how many books Ahmed read, we need to divide the number of books Ezra read by 2, since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed. 

Ezra read 300 books, so Ahmed read 300 / 2 = 150 books.

Now, we need to add the number of books Ezra decided to read to the number of books he has already read. Ezra decided to read 150 more books, so he will have read 300 + 150 = 450 books in total.

To find the total number of books they have read altogether, we need to add the number of books Ezra will have read to the number of books Ahmed has read. 

Total books read = 450 (Ezra) + 150 (Ahmed) = 600

The final answer is: 600"
"To calculate Tanya's earnings, we need to break down her earnings into two parts: her hourly earnings and her daily bonus.

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Since she earns $15 per hour, her total hourly earnings for Monday are 5 hours * $15/hour = $75. 

However, she also earns a daily bonus of $5 for teaching more than 3 classes. Since she taught 4 classes, she qualifies for the bonus, so her total earnings for Monday are $75 (hourly earnings) + $5 (daily bonus) = $80.

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Her hourly earnings for Wednesday are 2 hours * $15/hour = $30.

Since she taught fewer than 3 classes on Wednesday, she does not qualify for the daily bonus. Therefore, her total earnings for Wednesday are $30 (hourly earnings).

To find Tanya's total earnings for the two days, we add her earnings for Monday and Wednesday: $80 (Monday) + $30 (Wednesday) = $110.

The final answer is: $110"
"To find the difference in the number of vanilla scents sold compared to the fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of each type of scent sold.

The company sold 5 vanilla scents and there are 4 vanilla scents available, so the total number of vanilla scents sold is 5 * 4 = 20.

The company sold 2 fruity scents and there are 8 fruity scents available, so the total number of fruity scents sold is 2 * 8 = 16.

Now, we need to find the difference between the total number of vanilla scents sold and the total number of fruity scents sold. 

Difference = Total vanilla scents sold - Total fruity scents sold
Difference = 20 - 16
Difference = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate how much money Bennet will make from selling the eggplants. 

He sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total amount he will make from eggplants is 20 * 3 = $60.

Since Bennet wants to make a total of $135, and he will make $60 from the eggplants, he needs to make $135 - $60 = $75 from selling the corn.

He has 25 ears of corn, and he needs to make $75 from them. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the total amount he needs to make from corn ($75) by the number of ears of corn (25).

$75 / 25 = $3

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To find the total time Tatiana has available for soccer, video games, and reading, we need to add the hours she has on Saturday and Sunday. 

Total time available = 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

She reads for 3 hours, so the remaining time for soccer and video games is:
Remaining time = Total time available - Time spent reading
Remaining time = 12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours

She plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time:
Time spent playing video games = 1/3 * 9 hours = 3 hours

Now, we can find the time spent playing soccer:
Time spent playing soccer = Remaining time - Time spent playing video games
Time spent playing soccer = 9 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours

To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we divide the time spent playing soccer by the total time available and multiply by 100:
Percentage of weekend spent playing soccer = (Time spent playing soccer / Total time available) * 100
Percentage of weekend spent playing soccer = (6 hours / 12 hours) * 100 = 50%

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how many pencils Anthony kept, we need to follow the steps of the problem.

Anthony started with 50 pencils. He gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon. 

1/2 of 50 is 25, so Anthony gave 25 pencils to Brandon. This leaves him with 50 - 25 = 25 pencils.

Now, he gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. 

3/5 of 25 is 15, so Anthony gave 15 pencils to Charlie. This leaves him with 25 - 15 = 10 pencils.

Therefore, Anthony kept 10 pencils.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time it takes for him to drive to the museum, the time he spends at the museum, and the time it takes for him to drive back home.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Jack to drive to the museum. Since he drives 75 mph and the distance is 150 miles, we can use the formula time = distance / speed.

Time to drive to the museum = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

Since he spends 6 hours at the museum, we need to add this to the time it takes to drive to the museum.

Total time so far = 2 hours (to drive to the museum) + 6 hours (at the museum) = 8 hours

Now, we need to calculate the time it takes for Jack to drive back home. Since the distance is the same (150 miles) and his speed is the same (75 mph), the time it takes to drive back home is also 2 hours.

Total time = 8 hours (so far) + 2 hours (to drive back home) = 10 hours

Therefore, Jack is gone from home for 10 hours.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many wheels Henry will need in total, we need to calculate the number of wheels required for the cars and the motorcycles separately and then add them together.

For the cars, Henry needs 4 wheels for each of the 57 cars. So, the total number of wheels required for the cars is 57 * 4 = 228.

For the motorcycles, Henry needs 2 wheels for each of the 73 motorcycles. So, the total number of wheels required for the motorcycles is 73 * 2 = 146.

Now, we add the total number of wheels required for the cars and the motorcycles: 228 + 146 = 374.

Since Henry has a box with 650 wheels, we subtract the total number of wheels required from the total number of wheels available: 650 - 374 = 276.

The final answer is: 276"
"To find the amount you have to pay after a 20% discount, we need to calculate 20% of the original price and subtract it from the original price.

First, let's find 20% of $1000. 
20% of $1000 = 0.20 * $1000 = $200

Now, subtract the discount from the original price.
$1000 - $200 = $800

So, you have to pay $800 after the 20% discount.

The final answer is: $800"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how many movies are in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of movies in series = Total movies / 3
= 600 / 3
= 200

Now, we know that the cost of buying the series is $6 per movie, but we need to find the total cost of the series. Since we don't know the number of movies in each series, we'll assume that the cost of the series is $6 times the number of movies in series. However, we can't calculate the total cost of the series yet because we don't know the number of series. We'll come back to this later.

Next, let's find out how many movies are not in series. We can do this by subtracting the number of movies in series from the total number of movies:

Number of movies not in series = Total movies - Number of movies in series
= 600 - 200
= 400

Now, let's find out how many of these movies are older movies. Since 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of older movies = Number of movies not in series * 0.4
= 400 * 0.4
= 160

The remaining movies are not older movies, so they are normal movies. We can find the number of normal movies as follows:

Number of normal movies = Number of movies not in series - Number of older movies
= 400 - 160
= 240

Now, we know that the cost of a normal movie is $10, and the cost of an older movie is $5. We can calculate the total cost of the normal movies as follows:

Total cost of normal movies = Number of normal movies * Cost of a normal movie
= 240 * 10
= 2400

We still need to calculate the total cost of the series. Since we don't know the number of series, we'll assume that the number of series is 'x'. Then, the total cost of the series is $6 times the number of movies in series, which is $6 times 'x' times 200 (the number of movies in series). However, we can't calculate the total cost of the series yet because we don't know the number of series. We'll come back to this later.

However, we can calculate the total cost of the older movies as follows:

Total cost of older movies = Number of older movies * Cost of an older movie
= 160 * 5
= 800

Now, let's go back to the total cost of the series. We know that the total cost of the series is $6 times the number of movies in series, which is $6 times 'x' times 200. However, we also know that the total cost of the series is equal to the total cost of the movies minus the total cost of the normal movies and the total cost of the older movies. We can set up an equation to represent this:

Total cost of series = Total cost of movies - Total cost of normal movies - Total cost of older movies
6 * x * 200 = 600 * 10 - 2400 - 800
1200x = 6000 - 3200
1200x = 2800
x = 2800 / 1200
x = 2.33

Since we can't buy a fraction of a series, we'll round down to 2 series. Now, we can calculate the total cost of the series as follows:

Total cost of series = 2 * 6 * 200
= 2400

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the movies as follows:

Total cost of movies = Total cost of normal movies + Total cost of older movies + Total cost of series
= 2400 + 800 + 2400
= 5600

The final answer is: $5600"
"To find the total amount Winston spent on fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then add them together.

The cost of peaches is 6 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $12.00.
The cost of plums is 8 pounds * $1.00 per pound = $8.00.
The cost of apricots is 6 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $18.00.

Now, we add the costs together: $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00.

The final answer is: $38.00"
"To find the distance to their vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance they traveled by driving and hiking, and then add them together.

First, let's find the speed at which they hiked. They drove at an average of 50 miles per hour, and they hiked at an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Half of 50 is 25, and 5 miles per hour less than that is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

Now, let's calculate the distance they traveled by driving. They drove for 6 hours at 50 miles per hour, so the distance they traveled by driving is 6 * 50 = 300 miles.

Next, let's calculate the distance they traveled by hiking. They hiked for 1.5 hours at 20 miles per hour, so the distance they traveled by hiking is 1.5 * 20 = 30 miles.

Now, we add the distance they traveled by driving and hiking to find the total distance to their vacation spot: 300 + 30 = 330 miles.

The final answer is: 330"
"To find the difference in their scores, we need to calculate the points each of them earns from enemies, berries, and the time left on the timer.

Let's assume Emma's score from enemies is x. Since Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, Ava's score from enemies will be x + 8.

Emma's score from berries is 3 (since she collects 3 berries), and Ava collects 3 + 3 = 6 berries.

Now, let's consider the time left on the timer. The more time left, the higher the score. Since Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, Emma has 4 more seconds left on the timer than Ava. Let's assume Emma has y seconds left on the timer. Then, Ava has y - 4 seconds left.

The score from the timer is 30 points per second. So, Emma's score from the timer is 30y, and Ava's score from the timer is 30(y - 4).

The total score for each of them is the sum of the points from enemies, berries, and the timer.

Emma's total score = x + 3 + 30y
Ava's total score = x + 8 + 6 + 30(y - 4)

We want to find the difference between their scores, which is Ava's score - Emma's score.

Ava's score - Emma's score = (x + 8 + 6 + 30(y - 4)) - (x + 3 + 30y)
= 14 + 30y - 120 - 30y
= -106

The difference in their scores is -106 points."
"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we first need to determine the total cost of the two pizzas that are already known. Since two pizzas cost 30 dollars each, the total cost for these two pizzas is 2 * 30 = 60 dollars.

Now, we subtract the cost of these two pizzas from the total cost of all four pizzas to find the total cost of the other two pizzas. The total cost of all four pizzas is 64 dollars, so the total cost of the other two pizzas is 64 - 60 = 4 dollars.

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we can find the cost of each pizza by dividing the total cost of the other two pizzas by 2. The cost of each of the other two pizzas is 4 / 2 = 2 dollars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Chase and Rider ride their bikes 3 times a day for 5 days, which is a total of 3 * 5 = 15 times.

On the two other days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, which means they ride 2 * 3 = 6 times each day.

So, for the two special days, they ride a total of 6 * 2 = 12 times.

Now, let's add the total number of times they ride on the usual days (15) and the special days (12) to get the total number of times they ride in a week.

15 + 12 = 27

"Let's break down the information given:

Initially, Bob had 7 fish in his pond, with 3 orange and 4 white.

After buying more fish, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Let's denote the number of white fish he bought as 'x'. The number of orange fish he bought would then be 2x.

The total number of fish in the pond after buying more fish is 7 (initial fish) + 17 (new fish) = 24.

The total number of orange fish in the pond is 3 (initial orange fish) + 2x (new orange fish) = 3 + 2x.

The total number of white fish in the pond is 4 (initial white fish) + x (new white fish) = 4 + x.

Since the total number of fish in the pond is 24, we can set up the equation: 3 + 2x + 4 + x = 24.

Combine like terms: 7 + 3x = 24.

Subtract 7 from both sides: 3x = 17.

Divide both sides by 3: x = 17/3.

However, since we can't have a fraction of a fish, we need to re-examine the problem. The issue here is that the number of fish bought is 17, which is not a multiple of 3. This means that the number of white fish bought must be a whole number.

Let's re-examine the equation: 3 + 2x + 4 + x = 24.

Combine like terms: 7 + 3x = 24.

Subtract 7 from both sides: 3x = 17.

Since 3x is not a multiple of 3, we need to re-examine the problem. However, we can see that 3x is 17, which is 5 more than a multiple of 3 (15). This means that the number of white fish bought must be 5 more than a multiple of 3.

Let's try x = 5. Then, the total number of white fish in the pond is 4 + 5 = 9.

"To calculate the weekly fuel consumption, we need to determine the total miles driven per week and then divide it by the car's fuel efficiency.

The one-way distance between home and office is 5 miles, and Andy drives to and from work, so the total daily distance is 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles.

Since Andy drives to work from Monday to Friday, the total weekly distance is 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.

Now, we can calculate the weekly fuel consumption by dividing the total weekly distance by the car's fuel efficiency: 50 miles/week / 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week.

The price of regular gas is $3/gallon, so the weekly fuel cost is 5 gallons/week * $3/gallon = $15/week.

The final numerical answer is: $15"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Carrie was given and then subtract the amount she spent.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie was given. She was given 10 twenties and 140 quarters. 

The value of 10 twenties is 10 * $20 = $200.
The value of 140 quarters is 140 * $0.25 = $35.

So, the total amount of money Carrie was given is $200 + $35 = $235.

Carrie spent all the quarters, which is $35, and 3/5 of the twenties, which is 3/5 * $200 = $120.

The total amount of money Carrie spent is $35 + $120 = $155.

Therefore, the total amount of money she paid for lunch is $155.

"To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we first need to determine the total percentage of smart TVs and analog TVs sold. 

One-fourth of the TVs are smart TVs, which is 1/4 or 25%. One-eighth of the TVs are analog TVs, which is 1/8 or 12.5%. 

The total percentage of smart TVs and analog TVs sold is 25% + 12.5% = 37.5%. 

Since the rest of the TVs are OLED, we subtract the total percentage of smart and analog TVs from 100% to find the percentage of OLED TVs. 

100% - 37.5% = 62.5%

Now, we can find the number of OLED TVs sold by multiplying the total number of TVs sold (40) by the percentage of OLED TVs (62.5% or 0.625).

Number of OLED TVs sold = 40 * 0.625 = 25

"To find out how much money John is missing, we first need to determine how much the school will cover. Since the school is covering half the cost of the trip, we can calculate this as half of $300, which is $300 / 2 = $150.

Now, we know that John has $50 and the total cost of the trip is $300. Since the school is covering $150, John only needs to cover the remaining amount. This can be calculated as $300 - $150 = $150.

However, John already has $50, so we need to subtract this from the amount he needs to cover. This can be calculated as $150 - $50 = $100.

Therefore, John is missing $100.

The final answer is: $100"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the temperature at night and then calculate how many logs Carson needs to burn to raise the temperature to 32 degrees.

First, let's find the temperature at night. It's 33 degrees colder during the night compared to the day, and the day temperature is 45 degrees. 

Night temperature = Day temperature - 33
Night temperature = 45 - 33
Night temperature = 12 degrees

Since the pipes will freeze at 32 degrees, Carson needs to raise the temperature from 12 degrees to 32 degrees. 

Temperature to be raised = 32 - 12
Temperature to be raised = 20 degrees

Each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees. To find the number of logs needed, we divide the temperature to be raised by the temperature increase per log.

Number of logs = Temperature to be raised / Temperature increase per log
Number of logs = 20 / 5
Number of logs = 4

"To solve this problem, we first need to find the total number of groups formed. Since 90 people were divided into 9-person groups, we can find the total number of groups by dividing 90 by 9.

90 people / 9 people per group = 10 groups

Next, we need to find the number of groups that had members bring back 2 seashells each. Since 3/5 of the groups did this, we can multiply the total number of groups by 3/5.

3/5 * 10 groups = 6 groups

Now, we need to find the total number of seashells brought back by these 6 groups. Since each group brought back 2 seashells, we can multiply the number of groups by 2.

6 groups * 2 seashells per group = 12 seashells

At the first stop, 47 people get off, so we subtract 47 from 172:
172 - 47 = 125

Then, 13 people get on, so we add 13 to 125:
125 + 13 = 138

At the next stop, 38 people get off, so we subtract 38 from 138:
138 - 38 = 100

Therefore, there are 100 people on the train.

"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to first determine the total number of employees after three months. 

The company initially has 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. So, after one month, the total number of employees will be 200 + 20 = 220. 

After two months, the total number of employees will be 220 + 20 = 240. 

After three months, the total number of employees will be 240 + 20 = 260.

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees. Each employee is paid a $4000 salary per month. 

The total amount of money paid to the initial 200 employees for one month is 200 * $4000 = $800,000. 

The total amount of money paid to the 20 new employees hired in the first month for one month is 20 * $4000 = $80,000. 

The total amount of money paid to the 20 new employees hired in the second month for one month is 20 * $4000 = $80,000. 

The total amount of money paid to the 20 new employees hired in the third month for one month is 20 * $4000 = $80,000.

The total amount of money paid to all employees for one month is $800,000 + $80,000 + $80,000 + $80,000 = $1,140,000.

Since we want to calculate the total amount of money paid for three months, we multiply the total amount of money paid for one month by 3. 

The total amount of money paid for three months is $1,140,000 * 3 = $3,420,000.

"To find out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we first need to calculate their total earnings after working 20 hours.

Billy's initial hourly wage was $10. After 2 months, he received a raise of $0.50 per hour, making his new hourly wage $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. On his first anniversary, he received another raise of $1.00 per hour, making his final hourly wage $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50.

Billy's total earnings for 20 hours of work at $11.50 per hour is 20 * $11.50 = $230.

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary, which was $10. So, Sally's starting salary is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. 

However, Sally also received the same raises as Billy, so her final hourly wage is also $11.50.

Sally's total earnings for 20 hours of work at $11.50 per hour is 20 * $11.50 = $230.

Since both Billy and Sally have the same total earnings, the difference in their earnings is $0.

"To find out how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we first need to calculate the total number of stuffed animals she currently has. 

She has 3 puppies, 5 koalas, 2 zebras, and 4 frogs. 

Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Now, we need to find 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. 

30% of 14 = 0.3 * 14 = 4.2

Since we can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, we'll round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we'll consider the context of the problem. If Bubbles buys 5 stuffed goats, the percentage of stuffed goats will be 5/19, which is approximately 26.32%. This is less than 30%. If she buys 6 stuffed goats, the percentage of stuffed goats will be 6/19, which is approximately 31.58%. This is more than 30%. Therefore, Bubbles should buy 5 stuffed goats to get as close to 30% as possible.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total hours Kris has played and subtract that from the target of 30 hours.

First, let's calculate the hours Kris played in the first 2 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, 2 weeks is 2 * 7 = 14 days. If Kris plays for half an hour every day, she plays 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours in the first 2 weeks.

Next, let's calculate the hours Kris played in the next week. If Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week, she plays 7 * 2 = 14 hours in the next week.

Now, let's add the hours Kris played in both periods: 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours.

To find out how many hours Kris still needs to play, we subtract the total hours played from the target of 30 hours: 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

The second car is traveling at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel:
Distance = Speed x Time = 70 miles/hour x 2 hours = 140 miles

The difference in distance between the two cars after 2 hours is:
Difference = 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

So, after 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car.

"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school.

First, let's find the number of students who passed in each grade level:

- Third grade: 340 students passed
- Fourth grade: 40 students passed
- Fifth grade: Since the pass rate for the fifth graders is twice the pass rate of the fourth graders, and the fourth graders had a 40% pass rate (40/100), the fifth graders had a 80% pass rate (2 * 40/100). The total number of fifth graders is 400, so the number of fifth graders who passed is 0.8 * 400 = 320.

Now, let's find the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school:

- Total students who passed: 340 (third grade) + 40 (fourth grade) + 320 (fifth grade) = 700
- Total students in the school: 500 (third grade) + 100 (fourth grade) + 400 (fifth grade) = 1000

To find the overall pass rate, we divide the total number of students who passed by the total number of students in the school and multiply by 100:

"To find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we first need to determine how many square inches of mosaic he can make with the glass chips he has. 

Since it takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic, and each bag holds 72 chips, we need to find out how many chips Milo has in total. 

Milo has 2 bags of glass chips, so he has 2 * 72 = 144 chips.

Since it takes 12 chips to make 1 square inch, we can divide the total number of chips by 12 to find out how many square inches Milo can make: 144 / 12 = 12 square inches.

Since Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall, and he can make 12 square inches of mosaic, we can find the length by dividing the total square inches by the height: 12 square inches / 3 inches = 4 inches.

Therefore, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long.

Since there are 10 quarts of tea left, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is 38 + 10 = 48 quarts.

To convert quarts to gallons, we know that 1 gallon is equal to 4 quarts. 

So, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party in gallons is 48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to first determine how many candies he has in total. 

Dale initially ordered 100 candies and then ordered 100 more. So, the total number of candies he has is 100 + 100 = 200.

However, he has already sold 150 candies. To find out how many he still needs to sell, we subtract the number of candies sold from the total number of candies he has. 

200 (total candies) - 150 (candies sold) = 50

So, Dale still needs to sell 50 candies to sell all of his candy.

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students at the end of each month and then subtract the initial number of students from it.

At the beginning of the year, there are 10 students.

- At the end of January, the number of students doubles, so there are 10 * 2 = 20 students.
- At the end of February, the number of students doubles again, so there are 20 * 2 = 40 students.
- At the end of March, the number of students doubles again, so there are 40 * 2 = 80 students.
- At the end of April, the number of students doubles again, so there are 80 * 2 = 160 students.
- At the end of May, the number of students doubles again, so there are 160 * 2 = 320 students.

Now, let's subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May: 320 - 10 = 310.

The number of additional students who joined by the end of May is 310."
"To find the total number of branches Felix climbed, we need to divide the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch. 

Total money made = $105
Cost per branch = $0.25

Total branches climbed = Total money made / Cost per branch
Total branches climbed = $105 / $0.25
Total branches climbed = 420

Since Felix worked during the week, which has 5 days, we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day.

Average branches per day = Total branches climbed / Number of days
Average branches per day = 420 / 5
Average branches per day = 84

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the total number of petals, we need to calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers and then subtract the petals that were lost.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers:

- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 * 5 = 15 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 * 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 * 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 * 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add up the total number of petals: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

However, Rose dropped 1 petal from each set of flowers, so we need to subtract 4 petals (1 from each set) from the total: 101 - 4 = 97 petals

The final answer is: 97"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many marshmallows were used in total. John and DeSean each made 9 S'mores, so together they made 9 + 9 = 18 S'mores. Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, they used 18 marshmallows. 

They also dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground, so the total number of marshmallows used or dropped is 18 + 3 = 21. 

The bag originally had 35 marshmallows, so the number of marshmallows left is 35 - 21 = 14.

Since there are 2 kids, to find out how many S'mores each kid can have, we need to divide the remaining marshmallows by 2. 

14 / 2 = 7

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time each person plays and then determine how many quarters are used.

Jack can play for 20 minutes. His two friends who are worse can play for half as long, which is 20 / 2 = 10 minutes. The friend who is better can play for 1.5 times as long, which is 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes.

Since they play for 4 hours, we need to convert this to minutes: 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the total time each person plays:

- Jack: 240 minutes
- Two worse friends: 2 * 10 minutes = 20 minutes each, so 2 * 20 minutes = 40 minutes total
- Better friend: 240 minutes

Now, let's calculate the total time played by all friends: 240 (Jack) + 40 (worse friends) + 240 (better friend) = 520 minutes.

Since Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter, we need to calculate how many 20-minute intervals are in 520 minutes: 520 / 20 = 26.

However, we need to account for the fact that the better friend plays for 30 minutes, which is 1.5 times 20 minutes. So, we need to calculate how many 30-minute intervals are in 240 minutes: 240 / 30 = 8. Since 8 * 30 = 240, we can subtract 8 * 20 = 160 minutes from the total time played by the better friend, leaving 80 minutes. We can then calculate how many 20-minute intervals are in 80 minutes: 80 / 20 = 4.

Now, we can calculate the total number of quarters used by Jack: 26. The two worse friends play for 40 minutes, which is 2 * 20 minutes. We can calculate the total number of quarters used by the two worse friends: 2 * (40 / 20) = 4. The better friend plays for 80 minutes, which is 4 * 20 minutes. We can calculate the total number of quarters used by the better friend: 4.

Now, we can calculate the total number of quarters used: 26 (Jack) + 4 (worse friends) + 4 (better friend) = 34.

The final answer is: 34"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the amount of citrus zest as Z, the amount of fragrance as F, the amount of salt as S, the amount of sugar as S, and the amount of oil as O.

We know that Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, so F = Z.

We also know that she uses the same amount of salt as sugar, so S = S.

We know that she uses twice as much oil as salt, so O = 2S.

We also know that she uses twice as much salt as zest, so S = 2Z.

Since F = Z, we can substitute F with Z in the equation S = 2Z, so S = 2Z.

Now we have O = 2S and S = 2Z. We can substitute S with 2Z in the equation O = 2S, so O = 2(2Z) = 4Z.

Since the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, the sum of all the ingredients is 10. We can write the equation as Z + F + S + S + O = 10.

Since F = Z and S = 2Z, we can substitute F and S with Z and 2Z in the equation, so Z + Z + 2Z + 2Z + 4Z = 10.

Combine like terms, so 10Z = 10.

Divide both sides by 10, so Z = 1.

Now that we know Z = 1, we can find the amount of oil. Since O = 4Z, we can substitute Z with 1, so O = 4(1) = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total amount of money John spent, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows separately and then add them together.

The cost of the goats is 3 * $500 = $1500.
The cost of the cows is 2 * $1500 = $3000.

Now, we add the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows together: $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

The final answer is: $4500"
"To find out how many more cupcakes Paul needs to buy, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs.

Paul needs 63 cupcakes in total. He already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes, so the total number of cupcakes he has is 8 + 40 = 48.

Now, let's subtract the number of cupcakes he has from the total number of cupcakes he needs: 63 - 48 = 15.

So, Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes.

The final answer is: 15"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars. So, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

2. Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find 20% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.2. 40 * 0.2 = 8. So, Joe sells 8 cars.

3. Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars to his mother.

4. Now, let's find out how many cars Joe has left. He started with 40 cars, sold 8, and gave away 16. So, he has 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 cars left.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to first determine the total amount raised by the students. Since the charity raised a total of $175,000 and $50,000 came from organizations, the amount raised by the students is $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000.

Now, we know that there are 20 students and they all raised the same amount. To find out how much each student raised, we divide the total amount raised by the number of students: $125,000 / 20 = $6,250.

The final answer is: $6,250"
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the first day and the second day, and then add them together.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. 

On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she walked on the first day. Since she walked 8 hours on the first day, she walked 8 / 2 = 4 hours on the second day.

To find the total time in hours, we add the time from both days: 8 hours + 4 hours = 12 hours.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time from hours to minutes by multiplying by 60: 12 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 720 minutes.

The final numerical answer is: 720"
"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to first determine the total number of cars in the parking lot when he got out of class for lunch.

Initially, Hunter counted 50 cars. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, making the total 50 + 20 = 70 cars.

When he got out of class for lunch, 1/2 of the cars had left. This means that 1/2 of 70 cars had left, which is 70 / 2 = 35 cars.

So, the number of cars that remained in the parking lot when Hunter got out of class for lunch is 70 - 35 = 35 cars.

However, the question asks for the total number of cars he counted during the lunch break. Since 1/2 of the cars had left, the other half remained. Therefore, the total number of cars he counted during the lunch break is also 35.

The final answer is: 35"
"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of tasks he completes in a day and then multiply it by the number of days he works in a week.

First, let's find out how many tasks John completes in a day. Since he does 30 cycles of work a day and each cycle has 5 tasks, we multiply the number of cycles by the number of tasks per cycle:

30 cycles/day * 5 tasks/cycle = 150 tasks/day

Now, we know that each task pays $1.20. To find out John's daily earnings, we multiply the number of tasks he completes in a day by the pay per task:

150 tasks/day * $1.20/task = $180/day

Since John works a full 7-day week, we multiply his daily earnings by the number of days he works:

$180/day * 7 days = $1260

The final answer is: $1260"
"To find the total points scored by Sasha, we need to calculate her points in both games. 

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. 

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points in the first game. 

So, in the second game, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points.

To find the total points scored by Sasha, we add her points from both games: 14 + 4 = 18.

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as 'x'. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is 341, which is the sum of the cards Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have. We can write the equation as x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341.

Combine like terms: 7x + 12 = 341.

Subtract 12 from both sides: 7x = 329.

Divide both sides by 7: x = 47.

Since PJ has x cards, PJ has 47 cards. Smendrick has 3x cards, so Smendrick has 3 * 47 = 141 cards. Becca has 3x + 12 cards, so Becca has 3 * 47 + 12 = 147 cards.

The final answer is: 147"
"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color of eggs and then add them together.

Cindy had 5 green eggs. 
She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.
She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.
She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add the number of eggs of each color together: 5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"To calculate the total cost of shipping, we need to calculate the cost per pound and the cost per mile, then multiply them by their respective weights and distances. 

The cost per pound is $0.35, and the book weighs 4 pounds, so the cost for the weight is 4 * $0.35 = $1.40. 

The cost per mile is $0.08, and the book needs to be returned 20 miles away, so the cost for the distance is 20 * $0.08 = $1.60.

The total shipping cost is $1.40 + $1.60 = $2.00.

The book's purchase price is $32, and Amazon will only refund 75% of it, so the refund amount is 0.75 * $32 = $24.

The total cost of shipping minus the refund is $2.00 - $24 = -$22. However, since you can't lose a negative amount of money, this is incorrect. The correct interpretation is that Milly will receive $22 from Amazon, but she will have to pay $2 for shipping, so she will lose $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find out how much money Mulan has left, we need to calculate the total amount of money she spent and subtract it from the initial amount she had, including the money her father gave her.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Mulan had initially: $40 (initial money) + $100 (money from her father) = $140.

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money she spent: 2 pairs of jeans at $30 each = 2 x $30 = $60, and a bag for $20. So, the total amount spent is $60 + $20 = $80.

Now, let's subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $140 - $80 = $60.

So, Mulan has $60 left.

"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the production for the first three weeks and then determine the pattern.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.
In the second week, he produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.
In the third week, he produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Now, let's add up the production for the first three weeks: 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in total each month, we can find out how much he produces in the fourth week by subtracting the production of the first three weeks from the total production: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

The final answer is: 14,000"
"To find the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends on TikTok in a week and then multiply it by 4.

First, let's calculate the time Britany spends on TikTok in a week:

- She records 18 videos, each taking 4 minutes. So, the total time spent recording videos is 18 * 4 = 72 minutes.
- She spends 2 hours writing songs, which is 2 * 60 = 120 minutes.
- She spends 15 minutes each day for 6 days on makeup, so the total time spent on makeup is 15 * 6 = 90 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time spent on TikTok in a week: 72 + 120 + 90 = 282 minutes.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly time by 4: 282 * 4 = 1128 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 1128 / 60 = 18.8 hours.

The final answer is: 1128"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to first determine the cost of the initial installation and then add the cost of the additional items.

The initial installation includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. However, Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures that she needs installed. Since the initial installation already includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, and 1 chandelier, we only need to consider the additional items.

Angela has 2 extra mirrors (6 - 4 = 2), 1 extra chandelier (2 - 1 = 1), and 10 extra pictures (20 - 10 = 10). The cost of the initial installation is $129.00.

The cost of the additional items is $15.00 per item. So, the total cost of the additional items is:
2 (mirrors) + 1 (chandelier) + 10 (pictures) = 13 items
13 items * $15.00 per item = $195.00

Now, we add the cost of the initial installation and the cost of the additional items:
$129.00 (initial installation) + $195.00 (additional items) = $324.00

The final answer is: $324.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much money Anthony has saved, and then calculate 40% more than that amount.

First, we know that Eva has saved $20.00. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, so Anthony has saved $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.

Since Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony, we need to find 40% of $30.00 and add it to $30.00. 

40% of $30.00 is 0.4 x $30.00 = $12.00. 

So, Roy has saved $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

The final answer is: $42.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain in relation to Pompei's lifting capacity. 

First, we know that Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, and Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch. So, Saskay can lift a mountain 12 * 1 = 12 inches.

Next, Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Finally, Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 since there are 12 inches in a foot. 

480 / 12 = 40 feet.

Distance = Speed x Time

For the first 4 hours:
Distance = 8 miles/hour x 4 hours = 32 miles

For the next 6 hours:
Distance = 8 miles/hour x 6 hours = 48 miles

Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the speed of the kangaroos. Since it takes 3 kangaroos 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can assume that the total distance is the same for all animals. Let's denote the speed of a kangaroo as 'k'. 

The total distance traveled by 3 kangaroos in 18 hours is 3k * 18. 

Now, we need to find the speed of the turtles, which is half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of a turtle is k/2.

Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of the kangaroos, it will take them twice as long to cover the same distance. 

The time taken by 4 turtles to travel the same distance is (3k * 18) / (4 * (k/2)) = (3k * 18) / (2k) = 27 hours.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. We know that Kora made 20 dishes. Since Rory makes 20 more clay dishes than Kora, Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes. 

Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

To find the total number of clay dishes they all made together, we need to add the number of dishes made by each of them: 20 (Kora) + 40 (Rory) + 80 (Jada) = 140.

"Let's break down the information given. Erika's goal is to buy a laptop that costs $600. She gets a discount of $200 for trading in her old laptop, so the new price is $600 - $200 = $400.

She already has some savings in her purse, let's call it x. She also earned $150 from her part-time job and received $80 from her mom. So, the total amount of money she has is x + $150 + $80.

We know that after getting this total amount, she only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop. This means the total amount she has is $400 (the price of the laptop after the discount) + $50 (the amount she still needs) = $450.

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the situation: x + $150 + $80 = $450. 

To find the value of x, we need to subtract $150 and $80 from both sides of the equation: x = $450 - $150 - $80.

x = $220.

The final answer is: $220"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of apple slices Adam has initially and then subtract the number of slices he eats.

First, let's calculate the total number of slices from the large apples. Since Adam slices 3 large apples and each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces, the total number of slices from large apples is 3 * 5 = 15.

Next, let's calculate the total number of slices from the small apples. Since Adam slices 5 small apples and each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces, the total number of slices from small apples is 5 * 3 = 15.

Now, we add the total number of slices from large and small apples to get the initial total number of slices. 15 (large) + 15 (small) = 30.

Finally, we subtract the number of slices Adam eats, which is 15, from the initial total number of slices. 30 - 15 = 15.

"To find out how many cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to determine the total amount of milk the farmer currently produces. Since he extracts 5 liters of milk a day from each cow and he has 3 cows, the total amount of milk he currently produces is 5 * 3 = 15 liters.

Now, we need to find out how many more cows he needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day. To do this, we subtract the current milk production from the target milk production: 25 - 15 = 10 liters.

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, we need to find out how many cows are needed to produce 10 liters of milk a day. We can do this by dividing the target milk production by the milk production per cow: 10 / 5 = 2.

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the length of each used portion and subtract it from the original length of the glue stick.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so the used portion is 1 - 1/6 = 5/6. The length of the used portion is 5/6 * 12 mm = 10 mm.

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so the used portion is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3. The length of the used portion is 1/3 * 12 mm = 4 mm.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so the used portion is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2. The length of the used portion is 1/2 * 12 mm = 6 mm.

Now, let's calculate the total length of the used portions: 10 mm + 4 mm + 6 mm = 20 mm.

The total length of the glue sticks is 3 * 12 mm = 36 mm.

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 36 mm - 20 mm = 16 mm.

3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. Since Jack has an unknown number of socks, let's call it 'x'. Then, Peter has 2x socks.
4. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so the number of socks Jack has is 60 / 2 = 30.
5. Now we know that Peter has 2x socks and Jack has 30 socks. Since Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, we can set up the equation 2x = 30. Solving for x, we get x = 15.
6. So, Jack has 30 socks and Peter has 2x = 2 * 15 = 30 socks.
7. The total number of socks is 30 (Jack's socks) + 30 (Peter's socks) = 60 socks.
8. The total number of dishes is 30 (Peter's dishes) + 60 (Jack's dishes) = 90 dishes.

The total number of socks and dishes together is 60 + 90 = 150."
"To find the number of students good at math, we need to consider the total number of students and the number of students good at both subjects. 

Let's denote the number of students good at both math and English as x. We know that the total number of students is 20, and the number of students good at math only is 5, and the number of students good at English only is 8.

We can set up the equation: 5 (math only) + 8 (English only) + x (both) = 20 (total)

Simplifying the equation, we get: 13 + x = 20

Subtracting 13 from both sides, we get: x = 7

This means that 7 students are good at both math and English. To find the total number of students good at math, we need to add the number of students good at math only (5) and the number of students good at both subjects (7).

Total number of students good at math = 5 (math only) + 7 (both) = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find out how many groups can perform, we need to calculate the total available time for performances. The concert is 2 hours long, which is 120 minutes. Subtracting the 10-minute intermission, we have 120 - 10 = 110 minutes left for performances.

Each group takes 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit the stage, for a total of 10 minutes per group. 

Now, we can divide the total available time for performances (110 minutes) by the time each group takes (10 minutes) to find out how many groups can perform: 110 / 10 = 11.

The final answer is: 11"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand that it's a simple interest scenario. The interest rate is 3/4 of the original amount per year, which can be expressed as 0.75 or 75% of the principal amount.

The formula for simple interest is: A = P(1 + rt), where A is the total amount, P is the principal amount, r is the interest rate, and t is the time period in years.

Given that the principal amount (P) is $300, the interest rate (r) is 0.75, and the time period (t) is 3 years, we can plug these values into the formula:

A = 300(1 + 0.75*3)
A = 300(1 + 2.25)
A = 300(3.25)
A = 975

So, after 3 years, Brenda will have a total of $975.

The final answer is: $975"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of white shirts with no collars and the number of floral shirts with no buttons.

First, let's find the number of white shirts with collars. Since half of the white shirts have collars, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of white shirts with collars = Total number of white shirts / 2
= 40 / 2
= 20

Now, let's find the number of white shirts with no collars:

Number of white shirts with no collars = Total number of white shirts - Number of white shirts with collars
= 40 - 20
= 20

Next, let's find the number of floral shirts with buttons. We are given that 20 of the floral shirts have buttons.

Now, let's find the number of floral shirts with no buttons:

Number of floral shirts with no buttons = Total number of floral shirts - Number of floral shirts with buttons
= 50 - 20
= 30

Finally, let's find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars:

Difference = Number of floral shirts with no buttons - Number of white shirts with no collars
= 30 - 20
= 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how much the farmer will earn, we need to determine how many trays he can fill with 900 eggs. 

Since each tray holds 30 eggs, we can divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs per tray to find the number of trays.

Number of trays = Total eggs / Eggs per tray
= 900 / 30
= 30 trays

Now, we know the farmer has 30 trays. To find out how much he will earn, we multiply the number of trays by the price per tray.

Earnings = Number of trays * Price per tray
= 30 * $2.5
= $75

The final answer is: $75"
"To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we first need to determine the number of goats sold from each farm. 

From Farm X, Mr. Smith sold 10 goats. 
From Farm Y, he sold twice as many goats as from Farm X, which is 2 * 10 = 20 goats.

Now, let's calculate the number of goats left in each farm. 
In Farm X, he had 55 goats initially and sold 10, so he has 55 - 10 = 45 goats left.
In Farm Y, he had 45 goats initially and sold 20, so he has 45 - 20 = 25 goats left.

To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the number of goats left in each farm: 45 (Farm X) + 25 (Farm Y) = 70.

The final answer is: 70"
"To find the average cost of each pair of shoes, we need to divide the total amount spent on shoes per year by the number of pairs bought per year.

First, let's calculate the number of pairs James buys per year. Since he buys 2 pairs of shoes a month, and there are 12 months in a year, he buys 2 * 12 = 24 pairs of shoes per year.

Now, let's divide the total amount spent on shoes per year ($2640) by the number of pairs bought per year (24):

$2640 ÷ 24 = $110

So, James pays an average of $110 per pair of shoes."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food, then subtract the discount for the red food baskets.

The cost of 3 baskets of green food is 3 * $25 = $75.

The cost of 3 baskets of red food is 3 * $18 = $54.

Since you get $2 off for each basket of red food, the total discount is 3 * $2 = $6.

The total cost is $75 (green food) + $54 (red food) - $6 (discount) = $123.

The final answer is: $123"
"To find the time it takes to clean one-half of the rooms, we first need to determine the number of rooms that is half of 90. 

90 / 2 = 45 rooms

Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, we multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room.

45 rooms * 20 minutes/room = 900 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours

The final numerical answer is: 15"
"To find the total number of homes built over the next three years, we need to calculate the number of homes built each year and then add them together.

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will count the total number of homes built in the first two years and double it. The total number of homes built in the first two years is 12 + 36 = 48. Doubling this amount gives 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

Now, let's add the number of homes built each year: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144.

The final answer is: 144"
"Let's denote my age as 'x'. Since I am three years younger than my brother, my brother's age is 'x + 3'. My sister is 2 years younger than me, so her age is 'x - 2'.

My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, which can be expressed as 3(x + 3) - 1.

The sum of all our ages is 87, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + 3(x + 3) - 1 = 87.

Combine like terms: 5x + 10 + 3x - 1 = 87.

Combine the x terms: 8x + 9 = 87.

Subtract 9 from both sides: 8x = 78.

Divide both sides by 8: x = 9.75.

Since age cannot be a fraction, we need to find the closest integer that satisfies the given conditions. We can test the ages of the family members with x = 10.

If x = 10, then my brother's age is 13, my sister's age is 8, and my mom's age is 38.

10 + 13 + 8 + 38 = 69, which is less than 87.

If x = 11, then my brother's age is 14, my sister's age is 9, and my mom's age is 41.

11 + 14 + 9 + 41 = 75, which is still less than 87.

If x = 12, then my brother's age is 15, my sister's age is 10, and my mom's age is 44.

12 + 15 + 10 + 44 = 81, which is still less than 87.

If x = 13, then my brother's age is 16, my sister's age is 11, and my mom's age is 47.

13 + 16 + 11 + 47 = 87.

Therefore, I am 13 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{13}$"
"To find out how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs, we first need to determine the total number of glue sticks required. Since each student needs 2 glue sticks and there are 27 students, the total number of glue sticks needed is 27 * 2 = 54.

Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks required by the number of glue sticks per pack to find out how many packs are needed. However, since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs and expects to have some extra glue sticks left over, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.

To do this, we can divide 54 by 8, which gives us 6.75. Since we can't buy a fraction of a pack, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 7.

Therefore, Mr. Jackson will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water passing through the river at the given point over the three days.

On the first day, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

On the second day, the amount of water passing through the river doubles, so it becomes 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.

On the third day, the amount of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons, so it becomes 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

To find the total amount of water passing through the river at that point over the three days, we need to add the amounts from each day: 4000 + 8000 + 14000 = 24000 gallons.

The total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 24000 gallons.

The final answer is: 24000"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of exponential growth, as the number of infected people increases by a fixed factor each day. 

On the first day, the initial 10 people infect 6 others, resulting in a total of 10 + 6 = 16 people infected.

On the second day, the 16 people infect 6 others, resulting in a total of 16 + (16 * 6) = 16 + 96 = 112 people infected.

On the third day, the 112 people infect 6 others, resulting in a total of 112 + (112 * 6) = 112 + 672 = 784 people infected.

Therefore, after three days, there are 784 people infected.

The final answer is: 784"
"To find out how much money Julieta received, we need to calculate 10% of Rafaela's total tips and subtract that from Rafaela's total tips. 

Rafaela received $20 from each of the 40 customers, so her total tips are 40 * $20 = $800.

10% of $800 is 0.1 * $800 = $80. 

Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela, so she received $800 - $80 = $720.

To find the total amount of money they received altogether, we add their tips together: $800 + $720 = $1520.

The final answer is: $1520"
"To find out how many oranges Jennifer remained with, we need to calculate the total number of oranges given to her children. 

First, let's calculate the total number of oranges given to her daughters: 3 daughters * 2 oranges per daughter = 6 oranges. 

Then, we add the oranges given to her son: 6 oranges + 3 oranges = 9 oranges.

Now, we subtract the total number of oranges given away from the initial number of oranges Jennifer bought: 12 oranges - 9 oranges = 3 oranges.

So, Jennifer remained with 3 oranges.

The final answer is: 3"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Claire earns 1 badge per month.
- Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge than Claire, so Amber earns 1/2 badge per month.
- Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so Wendy earns 3 badges per month.

In a 1-year time frame (12 months), the number of badges earned by each girl is as follows:

- Claire: 1 badge/month * 12 months = 12 badges
- Amber: 0.5 badges/month * 12 months = 6 badges
- Wendy: 3 badges/month * 12 months = 36 badges

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a 1-year time frame, we subtract the number of badges earned by Amber from the number of badges earned by Wendy:

36 badges (Wendy) - 6 badges (Amber) = 30 badges

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how much Paige raised, we need to calculate the total number of slices she baked and sold. 

First, let's find out how many hours she baked. She baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is 5 hours.

Since she can bake 2 loaves per hour, and each loaf is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices she baked per hour is 2 * 8 = 16 slices.

In 5 hours, she baked 16 * 5 = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, so the total amount she raised is 80 * 0.5 = 40 dollars.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find the total number of coins Gretchen has, we need to determine the number of silver coins first. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, and Gretchen has 70 gold coins, we can set up an equation to find the number of silver coins.

Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins can be represented as 'x + 30'. We know that the number of gold coins is 70, so we can set up the equation:

x + 30 = 70

To solve for 'x', we subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:

x = 70 - 30
x = 40

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins. To find the total number of coins, we add the number of gold coins and silver coins:

Total coins = 70 (gold coins) + 40 (silver coins)
Total coins = 110

The final answer is: 110"
"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we first need to determine the total number of burritos consumed. 

There were 50 students at the picnic, and each student was given 10 burritos. So, the total number of burritos given to the students is 50 * 10 = 500.

Mr. George also ate 20 burritos. Therefore, the total number of burritos consumed is 500 (by the students) + 20 (by Mr. George) = 520.

Since there were 600 burritos ordered initially, the total number of leftover burritos is 600 - 520 = 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the number of yellow cars, we first need to determine the number of green, blue, and red cars. 

We know there are 12 red cars. The rink has 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so the number of green cars is 12 - 2 = 10.

The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars, so the number of blue cars is 3 * 10 = 30.

Now, we know the total number of red, green, and blue cars: 12 (red) + 10 (green) + 30 (blue) = 52.

Since the rink has 75 cars in total, the number of yellow cars is 75 - 52 = 23.

The final answer is: 23"
"Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as F, the number of books Anne has as A, and the number of books Sofie has as S.

We are given that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so we can write this as S = A + 25.

We are also given that Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so we can write this as A = F - 12.

Now, we are told that together, Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have 85 books. This can be written as S + A + F = 85.

Substituting the first two equations into the third, we get (A + 25) + A + F = 85, which simplifies to 2A + F + 25 = 85.

Subtracting 25 from both sides gives us 2A + F = 60.

Now, we can substitute the second equation (A = F - 12) into this equation to get 2(F - 12) + F = 60.

Expanding this, we get 2F - 24 + F = 60.

Combining like terms, we get 3F - 24 = 60.

Adding 24 to both sides gives us 3F = 84.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get F = 28.

The final answer is: 28"
"To find the weight of the carrots, we first need to determine the weight of the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, the sweet potatoes weigh 2 * 5 = 10 pounds.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find out how much Greg will spend on Jello, we first need to determine how many Jello cups he needs to buy. Since there will be 30 kids and each kid will have 4 Jello cups, we multiply the number of kids by the number of cups per kid: 30 kids * 4 cups/kid = 120 cups.

Since one 3-ounce box of Jello makes 10 small Jello cups, we need to find out how many boxes Greg needs to buy. We divide the total number of cups needed by the number of cups per box: 120 cups / 10 cups/box = 12 boxes.

Now, we need to find out how much Greg will spend on Jello. Each box costs $1.25, so we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box: 12 boxes * $1.25/box = $15.

"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we first need to determine how much Keenan spends in a month. Since Madeline pays 60% of the total cost, Keenan pays the remaining 40%. 

First, let's calculate Keenan's monthly expenditure: 
Total monthly expenditure = $400
Madeline's share = 60% of $400 = 0.6 * $400 = $240
Keenan's share = Total monthly expenditure - Madeline's share = $400 - $240 = $160

Now, we need to find out how much Keenan spends per week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we divide Keenan's monthly expenditure by 4:
Keenan's weekly expenditure = $160 / 4 = $40

The final answer is: $40"
"To find out how many pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he ate on each day and add them up.

On the first day, he ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces. To find 2/5 of 60, we multiply 60 by 2 and divide by 5:
60 * 2 = 120
120 / 5 = 24

So, on the first day, he ate 24 pieces.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces. To find the remaining pieces after the first two days, we subtract the pieces eaten on the first two days from the total:
60 - 24 - 10 = 26

Now, we need to find 7/13 of 26:
26 * 7 = 182
182 / 13 = 14.15 (round to 14, since you can't eat a fraction of a piece)

So, on the third day, he ate 14 pieces.

Now, let's add up the pieces eaten on each day:
24 (first day) + 10 (second day) + 14 (third day) = 48

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water, we first need to determine the cost per bottle of soda and the cost per bottle of water.

The cost of 7 bottles of soda is $21.00, so the cost per bottle of soda is $21.00 / 7 = $3.00 per bottle.

The cost of 4 bottles of water is $8.00, so the cost per bottle of water is $8.00 / 4 = $2.00 per bottle.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:

Cost of 3 bottles of soda = 3 * $3.00 = $9.00
Cost of 2 bottles of water = 2 * $2.00 = $4.00
Total cost = $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00

Total cost = 16 * $0.03
Total cost = $0.48

Now, we subtract the total cost from the initial amount of money David has:

Initial amount = $12.48
Total cost = $0.48
Amount left = Initial amount - Total cost
Amount left = $12.48 - $0.48
Amount left = $12.00

"To find out how much Ella would earn after 12 hours of dog walking at the same rate, we need to first determine her hourly rate. 

We know that Ella earned $33 for 3 hours of dog walking. To find her hourly rate, we can divide the total amount earned by the number of hours worked.

Hourly rate = Total amount earned / Number of hours worked
Hourly rate = $33 / 3 hours
Hourly rate = $11 per hour

Now that we know her hourly rate, we can calculate how much she would earn after 12 hours of dog walking.

Total earnings after 12 hours = Hourly rate * Number of hours worked
Total earnings after 12 hours = $11 per hour * 12 hours
Total earnings after 12 hours = $132

Initially, Paul has 52 marbles. His friend gave him 28 marbles, so now he has 52 + 28 = 80 marbles.

Then, he lost 1/4 of his marbles. To find 1/4 of 80, we multiply 80 by 1/4, which is the same as dividing 80 by 4. 

80 / 4 = 20

So, Paul lost 20 marbles. To find out how many marbles he has left, we subtract 20 from 80.

80 - 20 = 60

Therefore, Paul has 60 marbles left.

"To find Amy's total score, we need to calculate the points she earns from each type of question and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the points from the multiple-choice questions. Amy correctly answers 80% of the 10 multiple-choice questions, so she gets 0.8 * 10 = 8 questions correct. Since each multiple-choice question is worth 1 point, she earns 8 points from the multiple-choice questions.

Next, let's calculate the points from the true/false questions. Amy correctly answers 90% of the 20 true/false questions, so she gets 0.9 * 20 = 18 questions correct. Since each true/false question is worth 1 point, she earns 18 points from the true/false questions.

Now, let's calculate the points from the long-answer questions. Amy correctly answers 60% of the 5 long-answer questions, so she gets 0.6 * 5 = 3 questions correct. Since each long-answer question is worth 5 points, she earns 3 * 5 = 15 points from the long-answer questions.

Finally, we add up the points from each type of question to find Amy's total score: 8 + 18 + 15 = 41.

"To find out how much money Isaias bought the chickens for, we first need to determine how many chickens he plans to sell. Since he has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them, we can calculate the number of chickens he plans to sell as follows:

Number of chickens to sell = 300 * (3/5)
= 300 * 0.6
= 180 chickens

Now, we know that Isaias needs to make a profit of $2000 by selling these chickens at $50 each. To find the total revenue, we multiply the number of chickens by the selling price:

Total revenue = Number of chickens to sell * Selling price
= 180 * $50
= $9000

Since Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000, we can find the total cost by subtracting the profit from the total revenue:

Total cost = Total revenue - Profit
= $9000 - $2000
= $7000

Therefore, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for sale for $7000.

The final answer is: $7000"

Glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell = Total glasses sold / 2 = 32 / 2 = 16

Since Julie sold 14 glasses, we can find out how many more glasses she sold than Micah by subtracting the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold.

Glasses sold by Julie = 14
Glasses sold by Micah = 16
Difference = Glasses sold by Julie - Glasses sold by Micah = 14 - 16 = -2

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Sarah will get from selling the rope and then subtract the cost of the new rope.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Sarah will get from selling the rope. The rope is 20 meters long, and her friend wants to buy it for $2 a meter. 

Total money from selling the rope = Length of the rope * Price per meter
Total money from selling the rope = 20 * $2
Total money from selling the rope = $40

Now, let's calculate the cost of the new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 a meter, and Sarah wants to buy a rope of the same length (20 meters).

Cost of the new rope = Length of the new rope * Price per meter

Cost of the new rope = $30

Now, let's calculate how much money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope.

Money left over = Total money from selling the rope - Cost of the new rope
Money left over = $40 - $30
Money left over = $10

The final answer is: $10"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Melanie's current age. Since in 10 years, she will be 18 years old, we can subtract 10 from 18 to find her current age.

Current age = 18 - 10 = 8 years

Now, we need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her present age. Let's assume the number of years is 'x'. 

In 'x' years, her age will be 8 + x. This age should be thrice her current age, which is 3 * 8 = 24.

So, we can set up the equation: 8 + x = 24

Now, we can solve for 'x' by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation.

x = 24 - 8
x = 16

Therefore, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age in 16 years.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's find the cost of the chicken. Since each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, and a pack of bacon costs $10 in total for 5 packs, the cost of one pack of bacon is $10 / 5 = $2. Therefore, the cost of one packet of chicken is $2 * 2 = $4. Since Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, the total cost of the chicken is 6 * $4 = $24.

Next, let's find the cost of the strawberries. Each pack of strawberries costs $4, and Kelly has 3 packs, so the total cost of the strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.

Now, let's find the cost of the apples. Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is $4 / 2 = $2. Since Kelly has 7 packs of apples, the total cost of the apples is 7 * $2 = $14.

The total cost of all the items in Kelly's cart is $10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60.

Kelly's budget is $65, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget: $65 - $60 = $5.

The final answer is: $5"
"Let's break down the information given. Elaina's final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, and the total runtime of the final concert, including the encore, is 65 minutes. 

Let's denote the runtime of her usual concerts as 'x'. Since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, its runtime is 2x. Adding the 15-minute encore, the total runtime of the final concert is 2x + 15.

We are given that the total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes. So, we can set up the equation:

2x + 15 = 65

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x' on one side of the equation. Subtract 15 from both sides:

2x = 65 - 15
2x = 50

Now, divide both sides by 2:

x = 50 / 2
x = 25

So, Elaina's usual concerts run for 25 minutes.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how many toys Argo has now, we need to subtract the number of toys he gave away from the total number of toys he initially had.

Argo initially had 200 toys. He gave away 40 toys to Alyssa, 80 toys to Bonnie, and 30 toys to Nicky. 

First, let's add up the number of toys he gave away: 40 + 80 + 30 = 150 toys.

Now, let's subtract the number of toys he gave away from the initial number of toys: 200 - 150 = 50.

So, Argo has 50 toys now.

On Tuesday, they make 125 chimichangas. 
On Wednesday, they also make 125 chimichangas. 
On Friday, they make twice as many as on Tuesday and Wednesday, which is 2 * 125 = 250 chimichangas.

Now, let's add the number of chimichangas made on each day: 
125 (Tuesday) + 125 (Wednesday) + 250 (Friday) = 500

The final answer is: 500"
"To find the number of pairs of microphones that can be arranged, we first need to find the total number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs. 

Let's assume the total number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs is 'x'. Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the total number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs is 2x.

However, we know that the singer has 50 microphones in total. Since 20% of the microphones won't find any space to fit in, the number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs is 80% of 50, which is 0.8 * 50 = 40.

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs of microphones that can be arranged is 40 / 2 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total number of birds, we need to calculate the number of birds in each group and add them together.

First, let's find the number of birds nesting in the bushes: 6.

Next, we need to find 2/3 of the number of birds nesting in the bushes. To do this, we multiply 6 by 2/3, which is the same as multiplying 6 by 2 and then dividing by 3. 

6 * 2 = 12
12 / 3 = 4

So, 2/3 of the number of birds nesting in the bushes is 4. Since Jerry also sees 4 birds flying overhead, we add these to the number of birds nesting in the bushes: 6 + 4 = 10.

Now, let's find the number of birds feeding. Jerry sees 3 groups of 8 birds each, so we multiply 3 by 8 to find the total number of birds feeding: 3 * 8 = 24.

Finally, we add the number of birds nesting, flying, and feeding to find the total number of birds: 6 + 10 + 24 = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find out how many cookies were in each jar, we need to first determine how many cookies Lani had left after eating 5. 

Lani started with 55 cookies and ate 5, so she had 55 - 5 = 50 cookies left.

Since she placed the remaining cookies equally into 5 jars, we need to divide the remaining cookies by 5.

50 cookies / 5 jars = 10 cookies per jar.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of petals on the orchids, we multiply the number of orchids by the number of petals per orchid: 5 orchids * 5 petals/orchid = 25 petals.

To find the total number of petals on the daisies, we multiply the number of daisies by the number of petals per daisy: 4 daisies * 10 petals/daisy = 40 petals.

Now, we subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies to find the difference: 40 petals - 25 petals = 15 petals.

The daisies have 15 more petals compared to the orchids.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the percentage of flowering plants, we first need to determine the number of flowering plants. 

There are 100 plants in total. One-fourth of them are indoor plants, which is 100 * (1/4) = 25 plants. 

The remaining plants are 100 - 25 = 75 plants. Two-thirds of these remaining plants are outdoor plants, which is 75 * (2/3) = 50 plants. 

The rest of the remaining plants are flowering plants, which is 75 - 50 = 25 plants.

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100: (25/100) * 100 = 25%.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to determine the speed of the thingamabob first. Since the whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob, and the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, we can find the speed of the thingamabob by dividing the speed of the whatchamacallit by 11.

Speed of thingamabob = Speed of whatchamacallit / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 121 / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 11 meters per second

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig by multiplying the speed of the thingamabob by 5.

Speed of whirligig = Speed of thingamabob * 5
Speed of whirligig = 11 * 5
Speed of whirligig = 55 meters per second

The final answer is: 55"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the price of one carrot as 'c'. Since the yogurt is half the price of the salad, the price of the yogurt is $6 / 2 = $3.

Ellen eats two carrots every day, so the total cost of carrots is 2c.

The total cost of the salad and the yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9.

Since Ellen pays a total of $11 for her goods, the cost of the carrots can be found by subtracting the cost of the salad and the yogurt from the total cost: 2c = $11 - $9 = $2.

To find the price of one carrot, we divide the total cost of carrots by 2: c = $2 / 2 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To find out how much Mark makes a week, we need to calculate his new hourly wage and then multiply it by the number of hours he works in a week.

Mark's new hourly wage is $10 (old wage) + $2 (raise) = $12 per hour.

Mark works 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, so the total number of hours he works in a week is 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week.

Now, we multiply his new hourly wage by the total number of hours he works in a week: $12/hour * 40 hours/week = $480/week.

The final answer is: $480"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn. Let's denote the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. 

Since she mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as Joe's, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times. 

The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.

The total number of lawns she mowed is the sum of the lawns she mowed each week, which is 3x + x + 5x = 9x.

We know that she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn, and since she mowed Joe's lawn 'x' times, she made a total of $6x from mowing lawns.

We also know that she made a total of $80 from both lemonade sales and mowing lawns. So, we can set up the equation:

6x + lemonade sales = 80

We also know that she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn, and since she mowed Joe's lawn 'x' times, she made a total of $6x from mowing lawns. We also know that she mowed Joe's lawn 'x' times, so the total number of lawns she mowed is 9x. Since she made $6 for each lawn, the total amount she made from mowing lawns is 9x * 6 = 54x.

We can now set up the equation:

54x + lemonade sales = 80

Since we know that she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn, we can substitute 6x for 54x - 48 in the equation:

6x + lemonade sales = 80
6x + lemonade sales = 80
6x = 80 - lemonade sales
6x = 80 - (80 - 54x)
6x = 54x - 26
6x - 54x = -26
-48x = -26
x = 26/48
x = 13/24

Now that we know x, we can find the total amount she made from mowing lawns:
54x = 54 * (13/24)
54x = 702/24
54x = 29.25

Now that we know the total amount she made from mowing lawns, we can find the amount she made from lemonade sales:
lemonade sales = 80 - 29.25
lemonade sales = 50.75

"To find Harry's weight, we need to calculate the weights of Carl and Christian first. 

Martin's weight is 55 kg. 
Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so Carl's weight is 55 + 16 = 71 kg.
Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight is 71 + 8 = 79 kg.
Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight is 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

"To calculate John's profit, we need to first find out how much he earns from renting his car per month. 

He rents his car 10 times a month for 3 hours each time, so the total hours he rents his car per month is 10 * 3 = 30 hours.

Since he gets paid $25 an hour, his total earnings per month are 30 hours * $25/hour = $750.

Now, we need to subtract his car payment from his total earnings to find out his profit. 

Profit = Total earnings - Car payment
Profit = $750 - $500
Profit = $250

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Martha initially had some number of notebooks, but we don't know what that number is. However, we do know that after buying 5 more notebooks, she had a total of 7 notebooks. This means that Martha initially had 7 - 5 = 2 notebooks.

We are also told that Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha. Since Martha initially had 2 notebooks, Joseph had 3 * 2 = 6 notebooks.

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph. To do this, we subtract the number of notebooks Joseph has from the number of notebooks Martha has. Martha has 7 notebooks, and Joseph has 6 notebooks, so Martha has 7 - 6 = 1 more notebook than Joseph.

"To find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we first need to determine the distance rowed by Anis. 

Dijana rowed 50 miles. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. To find 1/5 of Dijana's distance, we multiply 50 by 1/5, which is 10 miles. 

So, Anis rowed 50 + 10 = 60 miles. 

Now, to find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we add their individual distances: 50 (Dijana's distance) + 60 (Anis's distance) = 110 miles.

"To find out how many cookies each of Susan's nephews will get, we first need to determine the total number of cookies available after her husband took some. 

Initially, Susan had 100 cookies. Her husband took 4 cookies, so we subtract 4 from 100 to get the remaining number of cookies: 100 - 4 = 96.

Now, we need to divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews, which is 6. To do this, we'll divide 96 by 6.

96 ÷ 6 = 16

So, each of Susan's nephews will get 16 cookies."
"To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we need to calculate the total number of pages each of them read.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. 

Today, Denise read 5 more than as many pages as Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read 5 + 13 = 18 pages today.

So, Denise's total pages read is 10 (yesterday) + 18 (today) = 28 pages.

Daniel's total pages read is 13 (yesterday) + 0 (today) = 13 pages.

The difference in the number of pages read by Denise and Daniel is 28 - 13 = 15.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many bowls of soup will be used for dinner and then find out how many bowls of soup will be left over. 

For dinner, there are 3 adults and 2 children, so a total of 5 people. Since each person eats one bowl, 5 bowls will be used for dinner. 

The pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls, so it can fill 4 + 4 = 8 bowls in total. 

Since 5 bowls will be used for dinner, there will be 8 - 5 = 3 bowls left over. 

The leftover soup can fill 8 child bowls, so each child can have a bowl of soup 3 / 2 = 1.5 times. However, since you can't have a fraction of a bowl, we'll round down to 1 time for each child to have a bowl of soup for lunch."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Adam's age four years ago as 'x'. Since Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, we can write an equation:

Duncan's age eight years ago = 2 * Adam's age four years ago
Duncan's age eight years ago = 2x

We know that Duncan's current age is 60. To find his age eight years ago, we subtract 8 from his current age:

Duncan's age eight years ago = 60 - 8
Duncan's age eight years ago = 52

Now we can equate this to 2x:

52 = 2x

To find x, we divide both sides by 2:

x = 52 / 2
x = 26

This means Adam's age four years ago was 26. To find Adam's current age, we add 4 to x:

Adam's current age = 26 + 4
Adam's current age = 30

Finally, to find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8
Adam's age in 8 years = 38

"To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount of money Julia and Nadine had, and then divide it by 2 to find out how much each of them received as allowance.

First, let's find the cost of the balloons. 1 dozen balloons is equal to 12 balloons. Since 2 balloons cost $0.5, 1 balloon costs $0.5 / 2 = $0.25. Therefore, 12 balloons cost 12 * $0.25 = $3.

The total cost of the cake and the balloons is $11 + $3 = $14. The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is $7 * 2 = $14. Since the total cost of the cake, balloons, and ice cream is $14, this means that the remaining money was used to buy these items.

Therefore, the total amount of money Julia and Nadine had is the cost of the cake, balloons, and ice cream, which is $14 + $14 = $28.

Since they had the same amount of allowance, each of them received $28 / 2 = $14.

The final answer is: 47"
"To find out how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to determine the total number of slices both Abby and Josh can eat per day. 

Abby eats 2 slices a day. Josh eats twice as much as Abby, so Josh eats 2 * 2 = 4 slices a day.

Together, they eat 2 + 4 = 6 slices a day.

To find out how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of slices they eat per day. 

24 slices / 6 slices per day = 4 days.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many shells Martha has collected by her 10th birthday, we need to calculate the number of months she has been collecting shells. Since she started collecting shells at 5 years old and we want to know the total by her 10th birthday, we need to consider the months from her 5th birthday to her 10th birthday.

There are 12 months in a year. From her 5th birthday to her 10th birthday, Martha would have been 5 years old for 1 year, 6 years old for 1 year, 7 years old for 1 year, 8 years old for 1 year, and 9 years old for 1 year. 

So, the total number of months is 5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months.

Since Martha collects one shell every month, the total number of shells she has collected by her 10th birthday is 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many cups of tea are in each row. Since Lana divides the 27 cups into 3 rows, we can divide 27 by 3 to get the number of cups in each row.

27 cups / 3 rows = 9 cups per row

Since Lana creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, the number of mint tea cups in each row will be half of the total cups in each row.

9 cups per row / 2 = 4.5 cups of mint tea per row

However, since we can't have a fraction of a cup, we can assume that Lana will make whole cups of tea. This means that she will make 4 cups of mint tea in each row and 5 cups of chamomile tea in each row, as the total number of cups in each row is 9.

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip. 

Let's break down the information given:

- The sloth takes 4 hours to make a round trip (down and back up) to collect berries.
- The sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

Since the sloth takes 4 hours for a round trip, in 8 hours, he can make 8 / 4 = 2 round trips.

If he makes 2 round trips, he will collect a total of 2 * x berries, where x is the number of berries he picks up per trip.

We want to find the minimum value of x such that 2 * x = 24.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 12.

So, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip is 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the amount of water in the tank. Since Anthony and his father fill the tank with half the amount of water in the pool, we can calculate this as follows:

10000 gallons (pool) / 2 = 5000 gallons (tank)

Next, we need to find out how much water is used from the tank over 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so we can multiply this rate by the number of days:

500 gallons/day * 6 days = 3000 gallons

Now, we subtract the amount of water used from the initial amount in the tank to find the remaining water:

5000 gallons (initial) - 3000 gallons (used) = 2000 gallons

The final answer is: 2000"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much money Colby has left and then determine how many movies he can see with the remaining money.

Colby's initial budget is $150. He has already spent money on:

- 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays: 5 * $10 = $50
- 8 movies on other days: 8 * $7 = $56
- 2 tubs of popcorn: 2 * $8 = $16
- 4 boxes of candy: 4 * $2 = $8

Total money spent: $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130

Colby has $150 - $130 = $20 left.

Each movie costs $10, and he wants to buy a popcorn ($8) and a box of candy ($2) for the last movie. So, the cost for the last movie will be $10 + $8 + $2 = $20.

Colby can see 1 more movie with the remaining money.

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the total calories of the pastries, we first need to calculate the calories of each type of mini pastry. 

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories. 

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, we can calculate the total calories of each type of pastry. 
200 mini cinnamon rolls have 200 * 200 = 40,000 calories.
300 mini blueberry muffins have 300 * 150 = 45,000 calories.

The total calories of the pastries are 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories.

The final answer is: 85000"
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed and then divide it by the number of days.

On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday, she removed twice as many as Monday, so 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs.
On Wednesday, she removed twice as many as Tuesday, so 2 * 78 = 156 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 78 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 378

There are 5 days in total. 

Average number of Junebugs removed per day = Total Junebugs removed / Number of days
= 378 / 5

"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to calculate the total distance each vehicle traveled.

The bus travels at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours. To find the distance traveled by the bus, we multiply the speed by the time: 60 miles/hour * 5 hours = 300 miles.

The car travels at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours. To find the distance traveled by the car, we multiply the speed by the time: 30 miles/hour * 8 hours = 240 miles.

Now, we need to find the difference in distance between the bus and the car. To do this, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus: 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles.

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car.

"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to subtract the total number of toys Sophie had before buying the bouncy balls from the total number of toys she has now.

The total number of toys before buying the bouncy balls is the sum of the blocks, stuffed animals, and stacking rings. 

Total toys before = 31 (blocks) + 8 (stuffed animals) + 9 (stacking rings) = 48

Now, we subtract this from the total number of toys after buying the bouncy balls to find the number of bouncy balls.

Number of bouncy balls = Total toys after - Total toys before
= 62 - 48
= 14

"Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as Pp, and John's age as J. 

We are given that Pp = J + 10. 

We are also given that P = Pp + J.

We are also given that P + Pp + J = 100.

Substituting Pp from the first equation into the second equation, we get P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10.

Substituting P and Pp into the third equation, we get (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100.

Combine like terms: 4J + 20 = 100.

Subtract 20 from both sides: 4J = 80.

Divide both sides by 4: J = 20.

Now that we know J, we can find Pp: Pp = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30.

Now that we know Pp, we can find P: P = Pp + J = 30 + 20 = 50.

"To find the total number of balloons, we need to calculate the initial number of balloons and then add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, Maria had 1 water balloon, and her 4 friends had 2 balloons each. So, the total initial number of balloons is:
1 (Maria's balloon) + (4 friends * 2 balloons per friend) = 1 + 8 = 9 balloons

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional balloons is:
5 people * 3 balloons per person = 15 balloons

Now, we add the initial number of balloons to the additional balloons:
9 (initial balloons) + 15 (additional balloons) = 24 balloons

The final answer is: 24"
"To find out how many tables they need, we first need to calculate the total number of boxes of stuff they have. 

10 people donate 5 boxes each, so they have 10 * 5 = 50 boxes from donations. 
They already have 10 boxes, so the total number of boxes is 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

Since they can fit 2 boxes per table, they will need 60 / 2 = 30 tables.

However, they already own 15 tables. To find out how many more tables they need, we subtract the number of tables they have from the total number of tables needed: 30 - 15 = 15.

So, they need 15 new tables.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the average total distance spat, we need to calculate the total distance spat by each person and then divide it by the total number of seeds spat.

Zoey spits 40 seeds, each 10 feet, so the total distance spat by Zoey is 40 * 10 = 400 feet.

Sydney spits 35 seeds, each 12 feet, so the total distance spat by Sydney is 35 * 12 = 420 feet.

The total number of seeds spat is 40 (Zoey) + 35 (Sydney) = 75 seeds.

The total distance spat is 400 (Zoey) + 420 (Sydney) = 820 feet.

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the total distance spat by the total number of seeds spat: 820 / 75 = 10.93 feet.

"To determine how much money Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his stay with the two options and then find the difference.

Option 1: 24-hour stay - The hotel charges 1600 pesos for a 24-hour stay.

Option 2: 12-hour stay + additional hours - Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours. The 12-hour stay costs 1000 pesos, and the additional 5 hours (17 - 12 = 5) will cost 5 * 70 = 350 pesos. So, the total cost for this option is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

Now, let's calculate the amount of money Cameron would save by choosing the second option:

"To find the total amount of hay needed, we first need to calculate the amount each sheep needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds, and each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, we can calculate the amount each sheep needs as follows:

Twice the amount each goat needs: 2 * 5 = 10 pounds
3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs: 10 - 3 = 7 pounds

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep separately:

For the goats: 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds
For the sheep: 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds

To find the total amount of hay needed, we add the amount needed for the goats and the sheep:

Total hay needed = 75 pounds + 84 pounds = 159 pounds

First, let's calculate the labor cost. The job took 2.25 hours, and the labor rate is $35 per hour. Since the labor is charged per hour or part thereof, we need to round up to the nearest hour. However, in this case, we can simply multiply 2.25 hours by the labor rate.

Labor cost = 2.25 hours * $35/hour = $78.75

Next, we add the cost of parts, which is $60.

Total cost = Labor cost + Cost of parts
Total cost = $78.75 + $60
Total cost = $138.75

"To find out how much James spent on the CDs, we first need to calculate the original price of the CDs and then subtract the discount. 

The original price of 10 CDs is 10 * $15 = $150. 

Since James gets a 40% discount, we need to find 40% of $150. 
40% of $150 = 0.4 * $150 = $60.

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price: $150 - $60 = $90.

James spent $90 on the CDs.

Next, we need to find out how much he got back from selling 5 CDs. 
He sold each CD for $40, so he got 5 * $40 = $200.

To find out how much money James was out, we subtract the amount he got back from the amount he spent: $90 - $200 = -$110.

However, since James can't be out a negative amount of money, this means he actually lost money. He spent more than he got back. 

The final numerical answer is: -$110"

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's calculate the time James takes to swim 60% of the distance. The total distance is 20 miles, and 60% of that is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles. 

Since James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time taken to swim 12 miles is 12 / 2 = 6 hours.

After swimming 12 miles, James rests for half the time he spent swimming. So, he rests for 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

Now, James has to swim the remaining 20 - 12 = 8 miles. However, he swims at half the speed, which is 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour. 

The time taken to swim the remaining 8 miles is 8 / 1 = 8 hours.

The total time taken is the sum of the swimming time, resting time, and the time taken to swim the remaining distance. So, the total time is 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.

"To find out how many points Azibo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Bahati and Dinar. 

Let's denote the points scored by Dinar as 'x'. Since Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, Bahati's points can be represented as 'x + 10'. 

We know that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so Azibo's points can be represented as '(x + 10) - 20' or 'x - 10'.

The total points scored by the team is 45, which is the sum of the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar. We can write this as an equation:

x + (x + 10) + (x - 10) = 45

Combine like terms:

3x = 45

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 15

Now that we know Dinar scored 15 points, we can find Azibo's points by subtracting 10 from Bahati's points. However, we first need to find Bahati's points. Since Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, and we know Dinar scored 15 points, we can represent Bahati's points as '15 + 20' or '35'. 

Azibo's points can be found by subtracting 20 from Bahati's points: 35 - 20 = 15.

However, we know that Azibo's points can also be represented as 'x - 10'. Since we found that x = 15, we can confirm that Azibo's points are indeed 15 - 10 = 5.

"To find the total number of reports Vince stapled, we need to calculate the total time he spent stapling reports and then multiply it by his stapling rate.

First, let's find the total time Vince spent stapling reports. He stapled from 8:00 AM until 11:00 PM, which is a total of 15 hours.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 15 hours by 60 to get the total minutes:
15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Now, we know Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many sets of 15 minutes are in 900 minutes, we divide 900 by 15:
900 minutes / 15 minutes = 60 sets

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we multiply the number of sets by his stapling rate:
60 sets * 30 reports/set = 1800 reports

So, Vince stapled 1800 reports altogether.

The final answer is: 1800"
"To find out how many minutes Kim slept on her bed, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m. This is a total of 8 hours, which is 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 5:55 a.m. instead of 6 a.m. This means she slept from 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m., which is a total of 7 hours and 55 minutes, or 7 * 60 + 55 = 455 minutes.

Now, we need to subtract the time she was sleepwalking, which was from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. This is a total of 23 minutes.

So, the total time she slept on her bed is 455 - 23 = 432 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many measuring spoons Jonathan has initially. Since he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, and he has two dozen cups, we can calculate the number of measuring spoons.

Two dozen cups is equal to 2 x 12 = 24 cups.

Since Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, we can multiply the number of cups by 2/3 to find the number of measuring spoons:

Measuring spoons = 24 cups * (2/3) = 16 spoons

Now, Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so we need to subtract 6 from the initial number of measuring spoons to find the remaining number of measuring spoons:

Remaining measuring spoons = 16 - 6 = 10

Since we are also asked to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we need to add the remaining measuring spoons to the number of measuring cups:

Total utensils = Remaining measuring spoons + Measuring cups

"To find the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we first need to calculate the number of occupied beds and then subtract that from the total capacity.

The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 of them are occupied. 

1/5 of 1000 is 100. So, the number of occupied beds is 100.

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, we need to calculate the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks is 14 days.

The total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks is 50 * 14 = 700.

Now, we add the initial occupied beds (100) to the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks (700) to get the total occupied beds after 2 weeks.

Total occupied beds = 100 + 700 = 800

Now, we subtract the total occupied beds from the total capacity to get the number of unoccupied beds.

Total unoccupied beds = 1000 - 800 = 200

"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number Courtney reported and subtract it from the number she reported.

Let's assume the number Courtney reported is 100%. Since she overstated the number by 20%, the actual number is 80% of the number she reported.

Let x be the actual number of people who attended the concert. We can set up the equation:

x = 0.8 * 48

To find x, we multiply 0.8 by 48.

x = 0.8 * 48
x = 38.4

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 38.4.

The final answer is: 38.4"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. We know that Jason carried 2 balls, and Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey. This means Jeffrey carried half the number of balls Jason carried, which is 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried 2 balls, Jordan carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls carried by each of them: 1 (Jeffrey) + 2 (Jason) + 4 (Jordan) = 7 balls.

However, this is the number of balls the boys carried, not the total number of balls the coach brought to practice. Since the boys carried all the balls in one trip, the total number of balls the coach brought to practice is equal to the number of balls the boys carried.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many holes the pirates dug in total by the end of the third day, and then determine how many holes they dug on the fourth day.

The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day, 13 holes on the second day, and 8 holes on the third day. However, they filled in 2 holes on the third day. So, the total number of holes at the end of the third day is:

10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29

The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is:

10 * 4 = 40

Since there were 29 holes at the end of the third day, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:

40 - 29 = 11

So, the pirates dug 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.

The final answer is: 11"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and the third person got 15 more than each of them. 

Let's denote the number of corn chips the third person got as x. Since the third person got 15 more than Amora and Lainey, we can write an equation:

x = 70 + 15
x = 85

So, the third person got 85 corn chips. 

Now, we know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and the third person got 85 corn chips. To find the total number of corn chips, we add the number of corn chips each person got:

Total corn chips = 70 + 70 + 85
Total corn chips = 225

The final answer is: 225"
"To find the cost of travel, we need to calculate 50% more than the cost of supplies. 

First, let's find 50% of the cost of supplies. 50% of $400 is 0.5 * 400 = $200.

Now, we add this to the cost of supplies to find the total cost of travel. $400 (supplies) + $200 (50% of supplies) = $600.

The final answer is: $600"
"Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, Stan as S, and Alex as X. We are given the following information:

1. X = S + 5
2. S = 4A - 13
3. A + S + X = 339

We can substitute the first equation into the third equation to get:
A + S + (S + 5) = 339
Combine like terms:
2S + A + 5 = 339

Now, substitute the second equation into the above equation:
2(4A - 13) + A + 5 = 339
Expand the equation:
8A - 26 + A + 5 = 339
Combine like terms:
9A - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:
9A = 360

Divide by 9:
A = 40

Now that we know A, we can find S:
S = 4A - 13
S = 4(40) - 13
S = 160 - 13
S = 147

The final answer is: 147"
"To find the total number of episodes, we need to determine how many episodes there are in total. Since there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, and each episode is 20 minutes long, we can set up an equation.

Let's denote the number of episodes as 'e'. Since there are half as many episodes as minutes per episode, we can write the equation as e = 20 / 2. 

Solving for 'e', we get e = 10. 

Now that we know there are 10 episodes, we can find the total time John will spend watching the show by multiplying the number of episodes by the length of each episode: 10 * 20 = 200 minutes.

The final answer is: 200"
"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in the southerly direction and then add it to the distance traveled in the northerly direction.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled in the southerly direction for the first 10 hours:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 10 hours
Distance = 300 miles

Then, the bird flies towards the north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 36 miles

Since the bird is flying north, this distance is subtracted from the total southerly distance:
Total southerly distance = 300 miles - 36 miles
Total southerly distance = 264 miles

Finally, the bird flies towards the south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours
Distance = 110 miles

To find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we add the total southerly distance and the distance traveled in the final southerly direction:
Total distance = Total southerly distance + Distance in the final southerly direction
Total distance = 264 miles + 110 miles
Total distance = 374 miles

The final answer is: 374"
"To find the total number of brownies Greta had left over, we need to calculate the total number of brownies she received and subtract the number of brownies eaten.

Greta made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies for herself, which is 12 brownies. 
She received 1/2 a dozen brownies from her office, which is 6 brownies. 
Her friends brought 4 dozen brownies, which is 48 brownies. 
So, the total number of brownies Greta received is 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies.

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies.

To find the number of brownies Greta had left over, we subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies she received: 66 - 18 = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the total age of all three family members, we first need to determine their individual ages.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 2 * 8 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means her age is 75% of Nani's age. To find 75% of Nani's age, we multiply his age by 0.75: 8 * 0.75 = 6 years.

Now that we have the ages of all three family members, we can find the total age by adding their ages together: 8 (Nani) + 16 (brother) + 6 (sister) = 30 years.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time it takes for each type of stringing and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time for synthetic gut racquets: 3 racquets * 15 minutes per racquet = 45 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time for polyester string racquets: 5 racquets * 22 minutes per racquet = 110 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time for hybrid sets: 4 racquets * 18 minutes per racquet = 72 minutes.

Finally, we add the times together: 45 minutes + 110 minutes + 72 minutes = 227 minutes.

The final answer is: 227"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first two phones and the remaining phones. 

The first two phones cost the full price of $600 each, so the total cost for the first two phones is 2 * $600 = $1200.

The remaining phones are 2 (for the kids and the wife), and each of these phones is half the price of the first two, which is $600 / 2 = $300.

The total cost for the remaining phones is 2 * $300 = $600.

Now, we add the cost of the first two phones and the remaining phones to get the total cost: $1200 + $600 = $1800.

The final answer is: $1800"
"To find the total number of players in both teams, we first need to determine the number of players on Zeke's team. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, and Carlton's team has 13 players, we can calculate the number of players on Zeke's team by adding 7 to 13.

13 (Carlton's players) + 7 = 20

Now that we know Zeke's team has 20 players, we can find the total number of players in both teams by adding the number of players on each team.

20 (Zeke's players) + 13 (Carlton's players) = 33

The final answer is: 33"
"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2l + 2w, where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the length (l) is 15 feet and the width (w) is 10 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

P = 2(15) + 2(10)
P = 30 + 20
P = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

50 feet * 2 slats/foot = 100 slats

Therefore, Robert will need 100 wooden slats for his fence.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we first need to determine the total number of oranges she had initially. Since she bought 12 boxes of oranges, and each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges is:

12 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 240 oranges

Next, Mrs. Harrington gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes each, which is a total of 4 boxes. Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges given away is:

4 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 80 oranges

Now, we subtract the number of oranges given away from the total number of oranges to find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington had left:

240 oranges - 80 oranges = 160 oranges

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the remaining oranges, which is:

160 oranges * 1/4 = 40 oranges

To find out how many oranges she sold, we subtract the number of oranges she kept from the total number of oranges she had left:

160 oranges - 40 oranges = 120 oranges

Mrs. Harrington sold 120 oranges.

The final answer is: 120"
"To solve this problem, we need to know the number of states in the USA and India. The USA has 50 states. 

First, let's find half the number of states in the USA: 50 / 2 = 25.

Since India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, we add 4 to 25: 25 + 4 = 29.

Now, we know India has 29 states. To find the total number of states in both countries together, we add the number of states in the USA and India: 50 + 29 = 79.

The final numerical answer is: 79"
"To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books. 

The total cost of the books is the sum of the cost of the dictionary, the dinosaur book, and the children's cookbook. 

Total cost = $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39

Since Tyler has already saved $14 from his allowance, we need to subtract this from the total cost to find out how much more he needs to earn.

Amount needed to earn = Total cost - Amount saved = $39 - $14 = $25

Now, we can find out how many hours Tyler needs to work by dividing the amount he needs to earn by his hourly wage.

Hours needed to work = Amount needed to earn / Hourly wage = $25 / $5 = 5 hours

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many cherries Richard and Jerry have. 

Since Robert has 30 cherries and has 10 more than Richard, we can find out how many cherries Richard has by subtracting 10 from Robert's total. 

Richard's cherries = Robert's cherries - 10
Richard's cherries = 30 - 10
Richard's cherries = 20

Now, we know that the total number of cherries is 60. We can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting the total number of cherries that Robert and Richard have from the total.

Total cherries = Robert's cherries + Richard's cherries + Jerry's cherries
60 = 30 + 20 + Jerry's cherries
Jerry's cherries = 60 - 50
Jerry's cherries = 10

Now that we know how many cherries each person has, we can find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry.

Robert's cherries - Jerry's cherries = 30 - 10
Robert's cherries - Jerry's cherries = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many boxes of gingerbread and apple pie Sunny sold on both days and then calculate the total earnings.

Let's denote the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday as G and the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday as A.

We know that on Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread. So, G = 10.

We also know that on Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. Let's denote the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday as B. Then, A = B - 4.

On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday. So, the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday is G + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15.

We also know that on Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie. So, B = 15.

Now, we can find the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday: A = B - 4 = 15 - 4 = 11.

Now that we know the number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie sold on both days, we can calculate the total earnings.

The total number of boxes of gingerbread sold is G + (G + 5) = 10 + 15 = 25.
The total number of boxes of apple pie sold is A + B = 11 + 15 = 26.

The total earnings from gingerbread is 25 * $6 = $150.
The total earnings from apple pie is 26 * $15 = $390.

The total earnings for two days is $150 + $390 = $540.

The final answer is: $540"
"To determine the total amount of sunscreen needed, we need to calculate the total number of ounces Pamela will use over the 8 days. 

Since she reapplies sunscreen every hour and will be outside 4 hours a day, she will reapply sunscreen 4 times a day. 

Over 8 days, she will reapply sunscreen 4 times/day * 8 days = 32 times.

Since each application is 1 ounce, she will need 32 ounces of sunscreen.

Each bottle contains 8 ounces, so to find out how many bottles she needs, we divide the total ounces needed by the ounces per bottle: 32 ounces / 8 ounces per bottle = 4 bottles.

Therefore, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the price of the red car, we need to calculate 40% of the price of the blue car and subtract it from the price of the blue car.

First, let's find 40% of the price of the blue car. 40% of $100 is 0.4 x $100 = $40.

Now, subtract $40 from the price of the blue car to find the price of the red car: $100 - $40 = $60.

So, the price of the red car is $60.

The price of the blue car is $100.

The final answer is: $60"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Emil is 19 years old now. When he turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad and twice as old as his brother. 

Let's denote Emil's current age as E, his dad's current age as D, and his brother's current age as B. 

We know that E = 19. 

When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad, so 24 = 0.5D. 

We can solve for D by multiplying both sides by 2: 48 = D.

When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother, so 24 = 2B. 

We can solve for B by dividing both sides by 2: B = 12.

Now that we have the current ages of Emil's dad and brother, we can find the sum of their ages: D + B = 48 + 12 = 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to calculate the number of beads she received from her mother, sister, and friend, and then add them together.

Adrianne's mother gave her 20 beads.
Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the beads together: 20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the total amount of crawfish Joe caught, we need to calculate the amount he caught each day and add them together.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.
On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount of Thursday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 pounds.
On Saturday, he caught half the amount of Friday, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the total amount of crawfish Joe caught: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can find the total number of servings by dividing the total amount of crawfish by the serving size: 21 / 3 = 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the number of students leaving early, we first need to find the number of football players, and then add the number of cheerleaders or band members.

First, let's find the number of football players. 20% of 30 students are football players. 

20% of 30 = 0.20 * 30 = 6

So, there are 6 football players.

Now, let's find the number of remaining students. Since 6 students are football players, the remaining students are 30 - 6 = 24.

Out of the remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band.

25% of 24 = 0.25 * 24 = 6

So, there are 6 cheerleaders or band members.

Now, let's add the number of football players and cheerleaders or band members to find the total number of students leaving early.

6 (football players) + 6 (cheerleaders or band members) = 12

"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we first need to determine Charlie's shoe size. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size five boots, we can calculate Charlie's size as follows:

Charlie's size = 5 * Sophie's size
Charlie's size = 5 * 5
Charlie's size = 25

Now, we can find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie by adding their sizes and dividing by 2:

Average size = (Sophie's size + Charlie's size) / 2
Average size = (5 + 25) / 2
Average size = 30 / 2
Average size = 15

"To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to calculate the total space available for plants. 

First, let's convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches, since the width of the plants is given in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches

Now, let's subtract the space needed for the 1.5 feet (18 inches) between each plant. Since Pat already owns 17 flowers, we need to calculate the space for 18 plants (17 + 1 for the last plant). 

Let's assume the number of plants is 'n'. The total space for 'n' plants and 'n-1' spaces between them is:

n * (width of plant + space between plants) = n * (12 + 18) = 30n

The total space available for plants is 1332 inches. So, we can set up the equation:

30n = 1332

Now, let's solve for 'n':

n = 1332 / 30
n = 44.4

Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we'll round down to 44 plants (we can't fit 45 plants in the flower bed).

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the plants:

Total cost = (Number of plants - Number of plants Pat already owns) * Cost per plant
= (44 - 17) * 6
= 27 * 6
= 162

"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day, we need to calculate 1/2 of the number of pretzels Edgar eats in a day. 

Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day. 
1/2 of 18 is 18 / 2 = 9 pretzels.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we need to multiply the number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day by 7.

9 pretzels/day * 7 days = 63 pretzels

The final answer is: 63"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of petunias: 
5 baskets * 3 petunias per basket = 15 petunias
Cost of 15 petunias = 15 * $3.00 = $45.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of sweet potato vines:
5 baskets * 2 sweet potato vines per basket = 10 sweet potato vines
Cost of 10 sweet potato vines = 10 * $2.50 = $25.00

Now, let's add the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines together:
Total cost = $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00

The final answer is: $70.00"
"To find out how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we first need to determine how much soil is left after planting the sunflowers and carnations.

First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations. 
4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds
Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations = 12 + 15 = 27 pounds

Now, let's subtract the amount of soil used from the total amount of soil they bought.
30 pounds (total soil) - 27 pounds (used soil) = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, we can plant 3 roses with the remaining soil.

"To find out how many shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we first need to calculate how much she saves each month for shoes. 

Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month and sets 25% of her paycheck aside for shoes. To find 25% of $2,000.00, we multiply $2,000.00 by 0.25.

$2,000.00 * 0.25 = $500.00

So, Jessica saves $500.00 each month for shoes. 

To find out how many shoes she can buy in a year, we need to multiply the monthly savings by 12 (the number of months in a year).

$500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00

Now, we need to find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy with $6,000.00. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00.

$6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6

So, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two separate tasks: peeling and cooking. 

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp. Emily can peel 6 shrimp a minute, so to find the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp, we divide 90 by 6. 

90 / 6 = 15 minutes to peel the shrimp.

Next, we need to calculate the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp. Emily can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, so to find the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp, we divide 90 by 30 and then multiply by 10.

90 / 30 = 3, then 3 * 10 = 30 minutes to cook the shrimp.

However, since peeling and cooking are done sequentially, we need to add the time it takes for both tasks. 

15 minutes (peeling) + 30 minutes (cooking) = 45 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

The final answer is: 45"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net change in temperature after the air conditioner has been running and turned off.

First, let's calculate the temperature change when the air conditioner is running on low for 3 hours:

Temperature change on low = -2 degrees/hour * 3 hours = -6 degrees

Then, let's calculate the temperature change when the air conditioner is running on high for 4 hours:

Temperature change on high = -3 degrees/hour * 4 hours = -12 degrees

The total temperature change when the air conditioner is running is the sum of the temperature changes on low and high:

Total temperature change while running = -6 degrees - 12 degrees = -18 degrees

Now, let's calculate the temperature change when the air conditioner is turned off for 2 hours:

Temperature change when off = 2 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 4 degrees

The net temperature change is the sum of the total temperature change while running and the temperature change when the air conditioner is turned off:

Net temperature change = -18 degrees + 4 degrees = -14 degrees

Since the air conditioner cools the room, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how old Bill's dad was when Bill saw the comet for the second time. 

Since Bill saw the comet when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet, let's denote the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet as 'x'. Then, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time would be 3x.

We know that the time between the two sightings is 75 years, so we can set up the equation: 

x + 75 = 3x

Subtracting x from both sides of the equation gives us:

75 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = 37.5

Now that we know Bill's dad was 37.5 years old when he saw the comet, we can find out how old Bill was when his dad saw the comet. We are given that Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. 

So, the age difference between Bill and his dad is 37.5 - 30 = 7.5 years.

Since Bill was 30 years old when his dad saw the comet, we can find Bill's age when his dad was 30 by subtracting 7.5 from 30:

30 - 7.5 = 22.5

However, this is the age of Bill when his dad saw the comet, not when Bill saw the comet for the first time. Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, and Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old, Bill saw the comet for the first time 75 years before that. 

So, we need to subtract 75 from 30 to find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time:

30 - 75 = -45

However, this is not possible since age cannot be negative. This means that the initial assumption that Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old is incorrect. 

Let's re-evaluate the problem. We know that the time between the two sightings is 75 years, and Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time is three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. 

Let's denote the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet as 'x'. Then, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time would be 3x.

We can set up the equation: 

x + 75 = 3x

Subtracting x from both sides of the equation gives us:

75 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = 37.5

However, this is the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet for the second time. Since Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time is three times the age his father was when he saw the comet, we can find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time by multiplying 37.5 by 3:

37.5 * 3 = 112.5

Now, we know that the time between the two sightings is 75 years, so we can set up the equation: 

x + 75 = 112.5

Subtracting 75 from both sides of the equation gives us:

x = 37.5

However, this is the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet for the second time. We need to find the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet for the first time. Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, and Bill's dad saw the comet for the second time when he was 37.5 years old, Bill's dad saw the comet for the first time 75 years before that.

So, we need to subtract 75 from 37.5 to find Bill's dad's age when he saw the comet for the first time:

37.5 - 75 = -37.5

However, this is not possible since age cannot be negative. This means that the initial assumption that Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old is incorrect. 

Let's re-evaluate the problem. We know that the time between the two sightings is 75 years, and Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time is three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. 

Let's denote the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet as 'x'. Then, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time would be 3x.

We can set up the equation: 

x + 75 = 3x

Subtracting x from both sides of the equation gives us:

75 = 2x

"To find the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks for each category and then add them together.

1. Checks for the electric bill: Since Buford writes a check once per month, and there are 12 months in a year, he writes 12 checks for the electric bill per year.
2. Checks for the gas bill: Similarly, since Buford writes a check once per month, he writes 12 checks for the gas bill per year.
3. Checks to the church: Buford writes a check twice per month, so in a year, he writes 2 * 12 = 24 checks to the church.
4. Checks to the pest and lawn service: Buford writes a check quarterly, which means 4 times a year. So, he writes 4 checks to the pest and lawn service per year.

Now, let's add the total number of checks: 
12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn service) = 52

The final answer is: 52"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the total number of flights made by the first plane as 'x'. Since the second plane makes half the number of trips as the first plane, it makes x/2 trips.

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, which is (3/4)x. The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of flights to France is (1/4)x.

We are given that the second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. So, we can set up the equation:

x/2 = 44

To find the value of x, we can multiply both sides by 2:

x = 88

Now that we know the first plane makes 88 trips, we can find the number of flights to France:

Flights to France = (1/4)x
= (1/4)(88)
= 22

The final answer is: 22"
"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the individual howling times and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. 
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, let's add the individual howling times together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents and subtract that from the cost of the trousers.

Adam's mother gave him $6. 
His father gave him twice as much as his mother, so his father gave him 2 * $6 = $12.

The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Since the trousers cost $30, we subtract the amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers to find out how much he had to contribute from his savings: $30 - $18 = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To find the age of Wilfred, we first need to find the average age of the group. We know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. Let's denote the average age as 'x'. 

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age, Helene's age is 2x. 

We also know that the total age of the children is 20. We can set up an equation to represent this:

Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age + Wilfred's age = Total age
3 + 4 + 2x + Wilfred's age = 20

Combine the constants:
7 + 2x + Wilfred's age = 20

Subtract 7 from both sides:
2x + Wilfred's age = 13

We also know that the average age of the group is x, and the total age is 20. We can set up another equation to represent this:

x + x + x + x = 20 (since there are 4 children in the group)
4x = 20

Divide both sides by 4:
x = 5

Now that we know the average age is 5, we can substitute this value into the equation 2x + Wilfred's age = 13:
2(5) + Wilfred's age = 13
10 + Wilfred's age = 13

Subtract 10 from both sides:
Wilfred's age = 3

"To find out how much Walter's lawyer will contribute, we need to calculate the total amount collected from Walter's neighbors and the online fund, and then multiply it by 3.

Walter collects $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. 

Total amount collected so far = $500 + $1500 = $2000

Walter's friend donates $200, but this is not included in the amount that the lawyer will base his donation on. The lawyer will donate three times the amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund, which is $2000.

So, the lawyer will donate 3 * $2000 = $6000.

"To find out how many cookies were given to the church, we first need to find out the total number of cookies. Since each guest brought 15 cookies and there were 100 guests, the total number of cookies is 100 * 15 = 1500.

The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door. So, the number of cookies given to the church is 1500 * 1/2 = 750.

Now, we know that each person in the church next door got 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church next door, we need to divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person got. 

Number of people in the church next door = Total cookies given to the church / Number of cookies per person
= 750 / 15
= 50

"To solve this problem, let's assume the total number of slices the watermelon is divided into is 'x'. Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices is 6. 

Let's denote the number of slices each kid gets as 'k'. Since each adult gets twice as many slices as each kid, the number of slices each adult gets is '2k'. 

We know that the total number of slices is 6, so we can write the equation: 2k + 2k + 4k = 6. Combining like terms, we get 8k = 6. 

To find the value of 'k', we divide both sides of the equation by 8, which gives us k = 6/8 = 0.75. 

Since each adult gets twice as many slices as each kid, the number of slices each adult gets is 2k = 2 * 0.75 = 1.5. 

The total number of slices is 6, so the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets is (1.5/6) * 100 = 25%."
"To determine how many hours Doctor Jones has left to update his records, we first need to calculate the total time spent on rounds and appointments.

Time spent on rounds: 
- Number of inpatients: 9
- Time per inpatient: 20 minutes
- Total time spent on rounds: 9 * 20 = 180 minutes

Time spent on appointments: 
- Number of appointments: 10
- Time per appointment: 30 minutes
- Total time spent on appointments: 10 * 30 = 300 minutes

Total time spent on rounds and appointments: 180 + 300 = 480 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we need to convert the total time spent to hours:
- Total time spent in hours: 480 / 60 = 8 hours

Doctor Jones spends 9 hours at the clinic, so we subtract the time spent on rounds and appointments from his total time:
- Time left to update records: 9 - 8 = 1 hour

"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake. 

First, let's add the time it takes to make the cake batter (20 minutes) and bake the cake (30 minutes): 20 + 30 = 50 minutes.

Next, we add the time it takes to cool the cake (2 hours or 120 minutes) and the time to frost the cake (10 minutes): 120 + 10 = 130 minutes. 

Now, we add the time it takes to make the cake batter and bake the cake to the time it takes to cool and frost the cake: 50 + 130 = 180 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 180 minutes to hours by dividing by 60: 180 / 60 = 3 hours.

Now, we need to add the 3 hours to the time at which Jordan wants to serve the cake, which is 5:00 pm. 

5:00 pm + 3 hours = 8:00 pm.

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 8:00 pm - 180 minutes = 5:20 pm.

The final answer is 5:20."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we need to first determine the total number of boxes sold by both Lisa and Peter. We know they sold 64 chocolate bars together, and we also know that Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes.

Let's add the number of boxes sold by Lisa and Peter: 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

Now, we know that they sold 64 chocolate bars in total and that they sold 8 boxes. To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we can divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes: 64 / 8 = 8.

The number of chocolate bars in a box is 8.

"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to first calculate the daily earnings and then multiply it by the number of days in a month.

The daily earnings can be calculated as follows:

- The cost to rent the studio per session is $25.
- The cost per student per session is $1.50.
- The studio has 10 students, so the total cost per session for students is 10 * $1.50 = $15.
- The total cost per session is $25 (rent) + $15 (students) = $40.
- The studio is rented 3 days a week, so the weekly earnings are 3 * $40 = $120.
- There are approximately 4 weeks in a month, so the monthly earnings are 4 * $120 = $480.

However, this calculation does not take into account the number of sessions per week. Since we don't know the number of sessions per week, let's assume the studio is rented for one session per day, which is a common scenario.

The monthly earnings would then be 4 weeks * 7 days/week * $120/week = $3360.

However, this is not the final answer. We need to consider the number of sessions per week. If the studio is rented for one session per day, the weekly earnings would be $120. If the studio is rented for two sessions per day, the weekly earnings would be $240. If the studio is rented for three sessions per day, the weekly earnings would be $360.

Since we don't know the number of sessions per day, we need to make an assumption. Let's assume the studio is rented for two sessions per day, which is a common scenario.

The monthly earnings would then be 4 weeks * 7 days/week * $240/week = $6720.

However, we still need to consider the number of students. If the studio has 10 students, the monthly earnings would be $6720. If the studio has 20 students, the monthly earnings would be $13440. If the studio has 30 students, the monthly earnings would be $20160.

Since we don't know the number of students, we need to make an assumption. Let's assume the studio has 20 students.

The final answer is: $13440"
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box for both Peter and Martha, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes.

For Peter: 64 chocolate bars / 4 boxes = 16 chocolate bars per box
For Martha: 56 chocolate bars / 7 boxes = 8 chocolate bars per box

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter and Martha. 
16 (Peter's chocolate bars per box) - 8 (Martha's chocolate bars per box) = 8

"To find the number of female porcupines, we multiply the total population by 3/5. 

Number of female porcupines = 50 * (3/5) = 30

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, we need to find the total number of babies born in a year. There are 12 months in a year.

Total babies born in a year = 30 * 4 * 12 = 1440

Now, we add the total number of babies born in a year to the initial population to find the total number of porcupines after a year.

Total porcupines after a year = 50 + 1440 = 1490

The final answer is: 1490"
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth of the pool. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (such as a swimming pool) is V = l * w * h, where l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height (or depth).

Given the dimensions of the pool: 
- Length (l) = 25 feet
- Width (w) = 14 feet
- Depth (h) = 4 feet

We can calculate the volume as follows:
V = l * w * h
V = 25 * 14 * 4
V = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company instructed them to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the number of gallons of water needed, we do this next:
Gallons = V * 5.9
Gallons = 1400 * 5.9
Gallons = 8260 gallons

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon, so we multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon:
Cost = Gallons * $0.10
Cost = 8260 * $0.10
Cost = $826

To find the difference in distance, we subtract Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance:

Difference = Shandy's distance - Matteo's distance = 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

The final answer is: 230"
"To find the number of female students, we first need to determine the number of students over 16 and under 16, and then find the number of female students in each group.

Half of the students are over 16 years old: 3000 / 2 = 1500 students.
One-fourth of the students over 16 are male: 1500 / 4 = 375 male students over 16. 
So, the number of female students over 16 is 1500 - 375 = 1125.

The remaining half of the students are under 16 years old: 3000 / 2 = 1500 students.
One-half of the students under 16 are male: 1500 / 2 = 750 male students under 16.
So, the number of female students under 16 is 1500 - 750 = 750.

Now, we add the number of female students over 16 and under 16 to find the total number of female students: 1125 + 750 = 1875.

The final answer is: 1875"
"To find out how many laps each person can run, we need to calculate their individual lap counts.

Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.

Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.

Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.

Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract Quinn's lap count from Bethany's lap count: 10 - 5 = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank and subtract it from the tank's capacity.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped into the tank is 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 12000 gallons. 

The remaining amount of water needed to fill the tank is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is: 6000"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation representing the charge of the power bank at the end. Let's denote the initial charge as 'x'. 

For the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour. The remaining charge after 5 hours can be calculated as:

x * (1 - 0.09)^5

After 5 hours, the power bank starts losing 7% of its capacity each hour for 3 hours. The remaining charge after 8 hours can be calculated as:

x * (1 - 0.09)^5 * (1 - 0.07)^3

We are given that the remaining charge is 28% of the initial capacity. So, we can set up the equation:

x * (1 - 0.09)^5 * (1 - 0.07)^3 = 0.28x

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by (1 - 0.09)^5 * (1 - 0.07)^3:

x = 0.28 / ((1 - 0.09)^5 * (1 - 0.07)^3)

Now, let's calculate the values:

(1 - 0.09) = 0.91
(1 - 0.07) = 0.93

(0.91)^5 ≈ 0.606
(0.93)^3 ≈ 0.863

Now, let's substitute these values into the equation:

x = 0.28 / (0.606 * 0.863)
x = 0.28 / 0.522
x ≈ 0.536

So, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 53.6%.

The final answer is: 53.6"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate Janet's total weekly earnings and then determine how many weeks she needs to work to save 20% of the car's cost.

First, let's calculate Janet's total weekly earnings. She makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, so her total hourly earnings are $10 + $15 = $25 per hour.

Since she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are $25/hour * 40 hours/week = $1000/week.

Next, we need to calculate 20% of the car's cost. 20% of $10,000 is 0.20 * $10,000 = $2000.

Now, we can determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save $2000. We can do this by dividing the amount she needs to save ($2000) by her weekly earnings ($1000). 

$2000 / $1000 = 2

So, Janet needs to work 2 weeks to save the down payment for the car.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of money he has spent so far. 

3 peaches at $0.5 each will be 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
4 pears at $0.5 each will be 4 * $0.5 = $2
2 kiwis at $1 each will be 2 * $1 = $2
5 apples at $0.75 each will be 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Adding these amounts together, Jamaar has spent $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9 so far.

Since Jamaar has $10, he has $10 - $9 = $1 left.

Plums cost $0.25 each, so we can divide the remaining money by the cost of a plum to find out how many plums he can buy: $1 / $0.25 = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many pieces of sweets each friend received, we first need to determine the total number of packs Anne gave away. Since she kept 2 packs for herself, she gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs.

Next, we need to find out how many packs each friend received. Since Anne gave the packs to 10 friends equally, we divide the total number of packs given away (13) by the number of friends (10). 

13 packs / 10 friends = 1.3 packs per friend. However, since each pack contains 60 pieces, we need to multiply the number of packs each friend received by the number of pieces in each pack.

1.3 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 78 pieces per friend.

The final answer is: 78"
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the increase in price each year and add it to the original price.

Year 1: 
Original price = $120
Increase in price = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Original price = $126
Increase in price = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Original price = $132.30
Increase in price = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many pictures Olivia put into each album. Since she put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide the total number of pictures by 8.

Total pictures = 72
Pictures per album = Total pictures / Number of albums
Pictures per album = 72 / 8
Pictures per album = 9

Now, we know that 3 albums were selfies only and 2 albums were portraits. Since the number of pictures per album is 9, we can multiply this by the number of albums for each category to find the total number of selfies and portraits.

Selfies = Pictures per album * Number of selfie albums
Selfies = 9 * 3
Selfies = 27

Portraits = Pictures per album * Number of portrait albums
Portraits = 9 * 2
Portraits = 18

The final answer is: 
Selfies: 27
Portraits: 18"
"To find out how long James spends reading, we need to determine how many sets of 3 pages he reads and then multiply that by the time it takes him to read one set of 3 pages.

Since James reads 18 pages, we can divide 18 by 3 to find out how many sets of 3 pages he reads: 18 / 3 = 6.

Now, we know it takes James 10 minutes to read one set of 3 pages. Since he reads 6 sets, we multiply 10 minutes by 6: 10 * 6 = 60.

James spends 60 minutes reading his book."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, the hotel had 100 guests.

24 guests checked out early, so the number of guests remaining is 100 - 24 = 76.

15 guests opted for a late checkout, so the number of guests remaining is still 76.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout, which is 2 * 15 = 30. So, the number of guests now is 76 + 30 = 106.

After dinner, 7 more people checked in, so the final number of guests is 106 + 7 = 113.

"To find the number of points Aries is sure to get, we first need to determine the number of easy, average, and difficult questions in the quiz.

There are 60 questions in total. 40% of the questions are easy, so the number of easy questions is 0.4 * 60 = 24.

The rest of the questions are equally divided between average and difficult, so the number of average questions is (60 - 24) / 2 = 18, and the number of difficult questions is also 18.

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, which is 0.75 * 24 = 18. She is also sure to get half of the average and difficult questions, which is 0.5 * 18 = 9 for each.

So, the total number of points Aries is sure to get is 18 + 9 + 9 = 36.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote the number of small stuffed animals as 's' and the number of large stuffed animals as 'l'. We know that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so we can write an equation:

s = 2l

We also know that the price of a small stuffed animal is $4. Since Teresa sold 's' small stuffed animals, the total amount of money she earned from small stuffed animals is 4s.

The price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal, which is 3 * 4 = $12. Since Teresa sold 'l' large stuffed animals, the total amount of money she earned from large stuffed animals is 12l.

We are given that Teresa earned a total of $120 from the sales. So, we can write another equation:

4s + 12l = 120

Now we can substitute the expression for 's' from the first equation into the second equation:

4(2l) + 12l = 120

Expanding the equation, we get:

8l + 12l = 120

Combine like terms:

20l = 120

Divide both sides by 20:

l = 6

Now that we know the number of large stuffed animals, we can find the number of small stuffed animals:

s = 2l
s = 2(6)
s = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total number of sandwiches the family eats in one week, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches each person eats in a week and then add them together.

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, so in a week (7 days), he eats 5 * 7 = 35 sandwiches.

The wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, so in a week (7 days), she eats 4 * 7 = 28 sandwiches.

The son eats 2 sandwiches per day, so in a week (7 days), he eats 2 * 7 = 14 sandwiches.

Now, let's add the total number of sandwiches each person eats in a week: 35 (man) + 28 (wife) + 14 (son) = 77 sandwiches.

The family eats 77 sandwiches in one week.

"To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we need to calculate her total earnings and then subtract the amount she gave to her sisters.

First, let's calculate her earnings from selling cookies: 80 cookies * $1 each = $80.

Next, let's calculate her earnings from selling cupcakes: 60 cupcakes * $4 each = $240.

Now, let's add her earnings from cookies and cupcakes: $80 + $240 = $320.

Suzanne gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave away a total of 2 * $10 = $20.

To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the amount she gave away from her total earnings: $320 - $20 = $300.

"To find the number of eggs found by the friends, we first need to determine the total number of eggs found by the Smith twins. Since each twin found 30 eggs, the total number of eggs found by the twins is 2 * 30 = 60.

Now, we know that all the eggs except 10 were found by the twins and their friends. This means that the total number of eggs found by the twins and their friends is 100 - 10 = 90.

Since the twins found 60 eggs, the number of eggs found by the friends can be calculated by subtracting the number of eggs found by the twins from the total number of eggs found by the twins and their friends. 

Number of eggs found by friends = Total eggs found by twins and friends - Eggs found by twins

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe and then multiply it by 40 dwarves and 30 days.

First, let's find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with an iron pickaxe. Since he can mine twice as much with an iron pickaxe as with his bare hands, he can mine 2 * 12 = 24 pounds of ore per day with an iron pickaxe.

Next, let's find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe. Since he can mine 50% more with a steel pickaxe than with an iron pickaxe, he can mine 24 + (24 * 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe.

Now, let's find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day with steel pickaxes. Since one dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe, 40 dwarves can mine 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds of ore per day.

Finally, let's find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in 30 days with steel pickaxes. Since they can mine 1440 pounds of ore per day, they can mine 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds of ore in 30 days.

"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to determine the ratio of the price to the number of sandwiches for the first two packages. 

The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3, so the price per sandwich is $3 / 2 = $1.5 per sandwich. 

The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6, so the price per sandwich is $6 / 4 = $1.5 per sandwich. 

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is consistent across all packages. Therefore, the price per sandwich is $1.5.

To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we multiply the price per sandwich by the number of sandwiches: $1.5 * 8 = $12.

"To find the number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons after each event.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

First, 40% of the red balloons burst. 40% of 25 is 0.4 * 25 = 10. So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

Next, Sally released half of the yellow balloons. Half of 12 is 12 / 2 = 6. So, 6 yellow balloons were released, leaving 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.

Then, Sally found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch. 75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6. So, she added 6 blue balloons to her clutch.

Now, let's calculate the total number of balloons Sally had before adding the blue balloons: 15 red balloons + 7 green balloons + 6 yellow balloons = 28 balloons.

Adding the 6 blue balloons, Sally had 28 + 6 = 34 balloons.

"To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to consider the scenarios where he won't get an extension. 

First, let's consider the scenario where the substitute teacher is present. In this case, there's a 50% chance of the substitute teacher being present, and since the homework won't be collected in this scenario, the probability of having to turn in the homework is 0%.

Next, let's consider the scenario where the normal teacher is present. In this case, there's a 60% chance (100% - 40% extension chance). Within this 60%, there's a 80% chance (100% - 20% chance of getting a personal extension) that Marcus won't get an extension.

Now, we can calculate the overall probability of having to turn in the homework:

- Probability of substitute teacher: 50% * 0% = 0%
- Probability of normal teacher with no extension: 60% * 80% = 48%

The total probability of having to turn in the homework is the sum of these two probabilities: 0% + 48% = 48%.

The final answer is: 48%"

"To solve this problem, we need to find the relationship between the number of small beans and the number of large beans. 

First, we know that eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean. This means that the number of small beans is 3 times the number of medium beans.

Since Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, the number of medium beans is 2 times the number of large beans. 

Let's denote the number of large beans as L. Then, the number of medium beans is 2L, and the number of small beans is 3 * 2L = 6L.

We are given that it takes 75 large beans to fill Grandpa up. Therefore, L = 75.

Now, we can find the number of small beans by substituting L = 75 into the equation for the number of small beans: 6L = 6 * 75 = 450.

"To find out how much Melissa makes per hour after expenses, we need to first calculate her total earnings and total expenses. 

Melissa spends 6 hours a day for 3 days, so her total hours worked is 6 * 3 = 18 hours. 

Her total earnings are $15 per day for 3 days, which is 15 * 3 = $45.

Her total expenses for parking are $3 per day for 3 days, which is 3 * 3 = $9.

Now, we subtract her total expenses from her total earnings to find her net earnings: 45 - 9 = $36.

"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to first determine the total number of soda bottles he will place along the driveway.

The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. To find the total number of bottles, we can divide the width of the driveway by the spacing between the bottles:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Since it takes Richard 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, we can multiply the number of bottles by the time it takes to set off each one:

8 bottles * 5 seconds per bottle = 40 seconds

Therefore, it will take Richard 40 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim lost due to loans and lost income while in college. 

First, let's calculate the total amount of loans he took: 
4 years * $50,000/year = $200,000

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money he lost due to not working while in college. 
His income before college was $25,000/year. 
His income after college is $25,000/year * 3 = $75,000/year. 
The difference in income is $75,000/year - $25,000/year = $50,000/year. 
The total amount of money he lost due to not working while in college is $50,000/year * 4 years = $200,000.

The total amount of money he needs to earn is the sum of the loans and the lost income: 
$200,000 (loans) + $200,000 (lost income) = $400,000.

Now, let's calculate how long it will take him to earn this amount at his new income of $75,000/year:

"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then add them together.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. One-fifth of 425 is 425 / 5 = 85. 17 more than that is 85 + 17 = 102. So, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. Twice as many as Tuesday is 102 * 2 = 204. 5 more than that is 204 + 5 = 209. So, on Wednesday, they delivered 209 letters.

Now, let's add the number of letters delivered each day: 425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736.

Since the second person took $80 more than the first, the amount taken by the second person is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the amount taken by the third person is 2(x + 80).

We know that the total amount divided is $1920, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920

Combine like terms again:

4x + 240 = 1920

Subtract 240 from both sides:

4x = 1680

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 420

So the first person took $420.

The final answer is: $420"
"To find the total hours worked by each painter, we first need to calculate the total hours worked in 3 weeks. 

There are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks have 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Since the painters worked 3/8ths of a day every day, we need to convert 3/8ths to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3/8 * 24 = 9 hours.

Now, we multiply the hours worked per day by the number of days to get the total hours worked: 9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours.

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4 to get the hours worked by each painter: 189 hours / 4 = 47.25 hours.

The final numerical answer is: 47.25"
"Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as 'x'. 

Since Rory retrieved four more balls in the first set than in the second, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set, which is given as 19. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for x, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Expanding the equation:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

Number of balls in the first set = x + 4
= 6 + 4
= 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation of the car from 2007 to 2010.

The car was bought in 2007 for $20,000. 

The price of the car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year. 

First, we'll calculate the depreciation for 2008:
Price in 2008 = 20,000 - (20,000 * 0.21) = 20,000 - 4,200 = $15,800

Next, we'll calculate the depreciation for 2009:
Price in 2009 = 15,800 - (15,800 * 0.21) = 15,800 - 3,318 = $12,482

Finally, we'll calculate the depreciation for 2010:
Price in 2010 = 12,482 - (12,482 * 0.21) = 12,482 - 2,623.22 = $9,858.78

The price of the car in 2010 is $9,858.78."
"To find the number of Spanish books, we first need to determine the total number of books that are not written in English. Since half of the books are written in English, that's 50 / 2 = 25 books in English.

We also know that 10% of the books are written in German. To find the number of German books, we multiply 50 by 0.1 (which is the decimal equivalent of 10%): 50 * 0.1 = 5 books in German.

Now, to find the number of Spanish books, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books: 50 - 25 - 5 = 20 books in Spanish.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we need to subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance. 

First, let's calculate the total distance Bernice has driven: 
Distance driven = Speed * Time
However, the speed is not given, but we know the distance driven and the time taken. We can rearrange the formula to find the speed: 
Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 325 km / 4 days
Speed = 81.25 km/day

Now, we can use the speed to find the total distance driven: 
Distance driven = Speed * Time
Distance driven = 81.25 km/day * 4 days
Distance driven = 325 km

However, we are given the total distance from San Diego to New York City, which is 1955 km. To find the remaining distance, we subtract the distance driven from the total distance:
Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance driven
Remaining distance = 1955 km - 325 km
Remaining distance = 1630 km

The final answer is: 1630"
"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to first calculate how many cups she drinks in 30 days and then convert that to gallons.

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. To find out how many cups she drinks in 30 days, we multiply the number of cups she drinks per day by 30.

8 cups/day * 30 days = 240 cups

Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we can now convert the total number of cups to gallons by dividing the total cups by 16.

240 cups / 16 cups/gallon = 15 gallons

So, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days.

The final answer is: 15"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Romeo boards the train with 120 people.

At the first stop, 20 more people board the train. So, the total number of people on the train becomes:
120 (initial people) + 20 (new people) = 140

At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, and twice that number (100 people) board the train. So, the total number of people on the train becomes:
140 (people after the first stop) - 50 (people who descended) = 90
90 + 100 (new people) = 190

At the third stop, 80 more people descend from the train. So, the total number of people on the train becomes:
190 (people after the second stop) - 80 (people who descended) = 110

The final answer is: 110"
"To find the total amount Alison spent on athletic gear, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

1. The tank top costs $10.
2. The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $10 + $5 = $15.
3. The tennis shoes were originally $48, but they were on sale for half price. Half of $48 is $48 / 2 = $24.
4. The athletic socks cost $8, and she had a coupon for $2 off, so the socks cost $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items: $10 (tank top) + $15 (shorts) + $24 (tennis shoes) + $6 (socks) = $55.

The final answer is: $55"
"To determine the total cost of renovating your kitchen floor, we need to calculate the total number of tiles required and then multiply it by the cost of each tile.

First, let's find the area of a single tile. Since each tile is a square with a side length of 1 ft, the area of a single tile is 1 ft * 1 ft = 1 SqFt.

Next, we need to find the total number of tiles required to cover the kitchen floor. Since the total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt and each tile covers 1 SqFt, we need 200 tiles.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the tiles. The cost of each tile is $12, and we need 200 tiles. So, the total cost is 200 * $12 = $2400.

The final answer is: $2400"
"To find the increased cost of the insurance, we need to calculate 60% of the normal cost and add it to the normal cost. 

60% of $120 is 0.6 x $120 = $72. 

The increased cost is $120 + $72 = $192 per month.

To find the yearly cost, we multiply the monthly cost by 12. 

$192 x 12 = $2,304 per year.

The final answer is: $2,304"
"To find out how many loads of laundry Greg does in a week, we need to calculate the total number of twin and king size sheets he puts on the beds and then divide that by the number of sheets he can wash at a time.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. Since each twin bed requires 1 set of sheets and the king size bed requires 1 set, the total number of sets of sheets he puts on the beds is 4 (twin) + 1 (king) = 5 sets.

Since the laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 2 and 1, which is 2. This means that Greg can wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set at a time.

Now, let's calculate the number of loads of laundry he does in a week. He has 5 sets of sheets to wash, and he can wash 3 sets at a time (2 twin + 1 king). So, the number of loads of laundry he does in a week is 5 / 3 = 1.67. However, since we can't have a fraction of a load, we round up to the nearest whole number. In this case, we round up to 2 loads of laundry per week.

To find the total number of loads of laundry he does in a year, we multiply the number of loads per week by the number of weeks in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total number of loads of laundry he does in a year is 2 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 104 loads/year.

The final answer is: 104"
"To find the total number of movies Jill and her friends watch in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the number of movies they watch in one weekend and then multiply it by 4.

They watch 4 movies on Saturday. On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies they watch on Saturday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies.

So, in one weekend, they watch 4 + 2 = 6 movies.

To find the total number of movies they watch in 4 weeks, we multiply the number of movies they watch in one weekend by 4: 6 * 4 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find out how many stickers Leo has in his collection, we need to calculate the total number of stickers he collected over the past three years.

Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers. 
Last year, he collected 50 stickers, so he had 100 + 50 = 150 stickers.
This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which is 2 * 50 = 100 stickers.
So, this year he has 150 + 100 = 250 stickers.

The total number of stickers Leo has in his collection is 250 + 150 = 400 stickers.

"To find out how many days the cat food will last, we need to divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the amount of cat food each cat eats per day (60 grams).

First, we need to calculate the total amount of cat food Imma's 3 cats eat per day. Since each cat eats 60 grams of food twice a day, we multiply 60 grams by 2 to get the daily consumption per cat, which is 120 grams. Then, we multiply this by the number of cats (3) to get the total daily consumption: 120 grams * 3 = 360 grams.

Now, we divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the total daily consumption (360 grams) to find out how many days it will last: 720 grams / 360 grams = 2 days.

The final answer is: 2"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

We know that Becky ate 10 slices. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake did, Jake must have eaten 10 - 3 = 7 slices.

We also know that Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake did. Since Jake ate 7 slices, Silvia must have eaten 2 * 7 = 14 slices.

To find the total number of slices eaten, we need to add up the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia. 

Total slices eaten = Becky's slices + Jake's slices + Silvia's slices
Total slices eaten = 10 + 7 + 14
Total slices eaten = 31

"Let's denote the time Donovan took to make his part as 'x'. Since Betsy took 18 minutes longer than Donovan, the time Betsy took can be represented as 'x + 18'. 

The total time taken to make the meal is the sum of the time taken by both Betsy and Donovan, which is given as 98 minutes. So, we can write the equation as:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:
2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Since x represents the time Donovan took, and Betsy took 18 minutes longer, Betsy's time is x + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

The final answer is: 58"
"To calculate the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to calculate the costs of the cast, the visit, the painkillers, and the parking.

The cost of the cast is $200.

The cost of the visit is $300/hour for 0.5 hours (30 minutes). So, the cost of the visit is $300 * 0.5 = $150.

The cost of the painkillers is $4/pill for 30 pills. So, the cost of the painkillers is $4 * 30 = $120.

The cost of parking is $6/hour for 2 hours. So, the cost of parking is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, let's add up the costs: $200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482.

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"To find out how many emails James responds to, we first need to find out how many emails he doesn't respond to. 

20% of 80 emails is 0.2 * 80 = 16 emails. 

Since James doesn't respond to these 16 emails, he responds to the rest. The rest of the emails are 80 - 16 = 64 emails.

Now, we need to find out how many emails James responds to in a 5-day work week. Since he responds to 64 emails per day, in a 5-day work week, he responds to 64 * 5 = 320 emails.

The final answer is: 320"
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center, we need to calculate the number of classes that visited each day and then add them up.

On Tuesday, twice as many visited, so 2 * 32 = 64 classes visited.
On Wednesday, three times as many visited, so 3 * 64 = 192 classes visited.
On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add up the number of classes that visited each day:
32 + 64 + 192 + 30 + 25 = 303

"To find the total number of pizzas left, we first need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by both the glee club and the football team.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. To find 70% of 20, we multiply 20 by 0.7:
20 * 0.7 = 14 pizzas eaten by the glee club.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. They ate 80% of them. To find 80% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.8:
40 * 0.8 = 32 pizzas eaten by the football team.

Now, we add the number of pizzas eaten by both groups to find the total number of pizzas eaten:
14 (glee club) + 32 (football team) = 46 pizzas eaten in total.

Since the total number of pizzas ordered was 20 (glee club) + 40 (football team) = 60 pizzas, we subtract the total number of pizzas eaten from the total number of pizzas ordered to find the number of pizzas left:
60 - 46 = 14 pizzas left.

"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of big coupons. Since Anthony wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, and he's sending out 700 small coupons, he'll send out 2 * 700 = 1400 big coupons.

The cost of mailing the small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents.

The cost of mailing the big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

Now, let's add the cost of mailing the small and big coupons together: 3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100: 24500 / 100 = 245 dollars.

2. Each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs. So, the total number of meatballs in the 7 sub sandwiches is 7 * 4 = 28.

3. Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. This means there are now 7 - 4 = 3 sub sandwiches left.

4. Since each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the remaining 3 sub sandwiches is 3 * 4 = 12.

"To find the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we first need to determine the number of trucks that did not experience mechanical failures. 

Since a quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures, we can calculate the number of trucks that failed as follows:

Number of trucks dispatched = 20
Number of trucks with mechanical failures = 20 * (1/4) = 5

Now, we subtract the number of trucks with mechanical failures from the total number of trucks dispatched to find the number of trucks that reached the farmers:

Number of trucks that reached the farmers = 20 - 5 = 15

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. To find the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we multiply the number of trucks that reached the farmers by the tons of fertiliser each truck carried:

Total tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers = 15 * 20 = 300

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the butter Dennis needs to buy. 

First, let's determine how many pounds of butter Dennis needs. Since he needs to make 6 dozen croissants and he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter.

Now, let's consider the promotion at the grocery store. For every pound of butter he buys, he gets one half off on the second pound. This means that for every two pounds of butter, he pays the full price for one pound and half the price for the other pound.

To calculate the cost, we can break it down as follows:

- For the first 3 pounds of butter, he pays the full price of $4.00 per pound. So, the cost for the first 3 pounds is 3 * $4.00 = $12.00.
- For the next 3 pounds of butter, he gets one half off on the second pound of each set of two pounds. So, for the second pound of each set, he pays $2.00 (half of $4.00). The cost for the second pound of each set is 3 * $2.00 = $6.00.
- The cost for the first pound of each set remains the same, which is $4.00. So, the cost for the first pound of each set is 3 * $4.00 = $12.00.

Now, let's add up the costs: $12.00 (first 3 pounds) + $6.00 (second pound of each set) + $12.00 (first pound of each set) = $30.00.

The final answer is: $30.00"
"To find the total cost of the party, we need to calculate the number of guests and then apply the given fee structure.

First, let's find the total number of guests. Kayla invited 25 classmates, 7 dance class girls, and 13 family members, but 4 people said they couldn't come. So, the total number of guests is:
25 (classmates) + 7 (dance class girls) + 13 (family members) - 4 (those who couldn't come) = 41

Since the theater can accommodate 20 guests for $125, and there are 41 guests, we need to calculate the additional guests:
41 (total guests) - 20 (base capacity) = 21 (additional guests)

The fee for the additional guests is $6 per person, so the total cost for the additional guests is:
21 (additional guests) * $6 (per guest) = $126

Now, we add the base fee and the cost for the additional guests:
$125 (base fee) + $126 (additional guests) = $251

The final answer is: $251"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money Maggie and Riza spent. 

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which is 1/4 of $60. To find this, we multiply 60 by 1/4, which is the same as dividing 60 by 4. 

60 / 4 = 15

So Maggie spent $15. 

Riza spent one-third of her money, which is 1/3 of $60. To find this, we multiply 60 by 1/3, which is the same as dividing 60 by 3.

60 / 3 = 20

So Riza spent $20.

Now, we need to find out how much money they had initially. Since they each had $60, together they had 2 * 60 = $120.

Maggie spent $15 and Riza spent $20, so together they spent $15 + $20 = $35.

To find out how much money they have left, we subtract the amount they spent from the amount they initially had: $120 - $35 = $85.

"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to first determine how many bananas the first and second monkeys eat each day. 

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day.

Since there are three monkeys in total, the total number of bananas they eat each day is 10 + 14 + x, where x is the number of bananas the third monkey eats. However, we know that the total number of bananas is 315, and they eat this amount for a week, which is 7 days. 

So, the total number of bananas eaten in a week is 315 * 7 = 2205. 

Since they eat this amount in 7 days, the total number of bananas they eat each day is 2205 / 7 = 315. 

Now, we know that the first and second monkeys eat 10 + 14 = 24 bananas each day. So, the third monkey eats 315 - 24 = 291 bananas each day.

Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, which is 500 / 2 = 250 pieces. 

Then, he finished another 500 piece puzzle. 

So, in total, he placed 250 + 500 = 750 pieces. 

Since he had already placed 250 pieces before the hour, we subtract that from the total to find out how many pieces he placed during the hour: 750 - 250 = 500.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the roses and then find out how much change Jenny will get.

First, let's calculate the cost of 15 roses. Since roses cost $2 each, the total cost will be 15 * $2 = $30.

However, the florist offers a discount for a dozen roses, which is 12 roses. Since Jenny bought 15 roses, she gets the discount for 3 dozen roses (12 * 3 = 36 roses) and 3 roses without the discount. The cost for 36 roses is 3 * $15 = $45. The cost for the remaining 3 roses is 3 * $2 = $6. The total cost is $45 + $6 = $51.

Jenny arrived with five $5 bills, which is a total of 5 * $5 = $25. She needs to pay $51 for the roses. To find out how much change she will get, we subtract the amount she paid from the amount she had: $25 - $51 = -$26. However, this is not possible since Jenny cannot have a negative amount of money. This means she doesn't have enough money to buy the roses.

However, let's assume she has enough money to buy the roses. The change she will get is $25 - $51 = -$26. Since this is not possible, let's recalculate the change. Jenny needs to pay $51 for the roses. She has $25, so she needs to pay the remaining $26. Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to find out how many quarters make up $26.

"To find the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to calculate the revenue from each item and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the revenue from milkshakes: 
6 milkshakes * $5.50 each = 6 * 5.50 = $33

Next, let's calculate the revenue from burger platters: 
9 burger platters * $11 each = 9 * 11 = $99

Now, let's calculate the revenue from sodas: 
20 sodas * $1.50 each = 20 * 1.50 = $30

Finally, let's add the revenue from all items together: 
$33 + $99 + $30 = $162

"To find the time Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the time from the moment he arrives at the station to the moment the fourth train arrives.

The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the first train leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. The third train leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it also leaves at 125 minutes.

The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes. This is the time Paul will board his train.

Since Paul is waiting for the fourth train, we need to find the time from the moment he arrives at the station to the moment the fourth train arrives. We don't know the exact time Paul arrives at the station, but we can assume it's 0 minutes for simplicity. 

The time Paul will wait for his train is 145 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many toothpicks Melanie has saved so far and then determine how many more weeks it will take her to reach 200 toothpicks.

Melanie saved 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. To find the total number of toothpicks she has saved, we multiply the number of toothpicks saved per week by the number of weeks:

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Since Melanie needs 200 toothpicks for the sculpture, we subtract the number of toothpicks she has saved from the total required:

200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Now, we need to find out how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 80 toothpicks at a rate of 10 toothpicks per week:

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

Therefore, Melanie will need 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we first need to determine the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch and the price at which he sold it to his friend.

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price, so the price he paid is 75% of $2000, which is 0.75 * $2000 = $1500.

Then, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, which is 1.2 * $1500 = $1800.

To find the discount percentage, we need to find the difference between the original price and the price at which Mr. Rogers' friend bought the watch, and then divide it by the original price and multiply by 100.

The discount is ($2000 - $1800) = $200.

The percentage discount is ($200 / $2000) * 100 = 10%.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours and then multiply it by the rate at which the springs create jellyfish.

There are 60 minutes in an hour and 60 seconds in a minute. So, the total number of seconds in 4 hours is:

60 minutes/hour * 60 seconds/minute * 4 hours = 14400 seconds

Since each spring creates a new jellyfish every second, the total number of jellyfish created by one spring in 14400 seconds is 14400.

Now, if we have 5 springs working at the same rate, the total number of jellyfish created in 14400 seconds is:

14400 * 5 = 72000

So, 5 springs working at the same rate would create 72000 jellyfish in 4 hours.

The final answer is: 72000"
"To find Frankie's score, we need to first calculate twice Binkie's score and then add 15 to it. 

Binkie's score is 90. Twice Binkie's score is 2 * 90 = 180. 

Now, we add 15 to this result: 180 + 15 = 195.

Frankie's score is 195."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance James walked and then divide it by his speed.

First, James walked to the store, which is 4 miles. Then, he walked back home, which is another 4 miles. So, the total distance he walked is 4 + 4 = 8 miles.

Since James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour, we can calculate the time it took him to walk the total distance by dividing the total distance by his speed: 8 miles / 4 miles per hour = 2 hours.

However, this is the total time it took him to walk to the store and back home. Since he only asked how long it took him to reach the store, we need to subtract the time it took him to walk back home from the total time. Since he walked back home at the same speed, it took him 2 hours to walk back home. So, the time it took him to reach the store is 2 hours - 2 hours = 0 hours to walk to the store, then 2 hours to walk back home.  But he only walked to the store once, so we need to calculate the time it took him to walk to the store.  The time it took him to walk to the store is 2 hours / 2 = 1 hour to walk to the store, then 1 hour to walk back home.  So the time it took him to walk to the store is 1 hour.

The final answer is: 1"
"To find out how much money Jenny saved, we first need to calculate the total cost of buying the bananas individually and then compare it to the cost of buying them in bunches.

If Jenny buys 10 bunches with 4 bananas per bunch, she buys a total of 10 * 4 = 40 bananas.

The cost of buying 40 bananas individually would be 40 * $0.80 = $32.00.

The cost of buying 10 bunches is $3.00 per bunch, so the total cost is 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

To find the savings, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

So, Jenny saved $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Sam gets x feet of fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets x + 60 feet.

We know that the total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence. To find out how much is left over, we need to subtract the total amount of fence Sam and Harry have from the total length of the fence:

100 - (20 + (20 + 60)) = 100 - 100 = 0

However, this is not the correct interpretation of the question. The question asks how much is left over for Sam, implying that the leftover is the amount of fence that is not assigned to either Sam or Harry. Since Sam and Harry together have 100 feet, and they have 100 feet in total, there is no leftover fence."
"To find the rate of growth per year, we need to divide the growth in inches by the number of years. 

Growth per year = 8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches per year.

Now, we can multiply the growth per year by the total number of years to find the total growth in 13 years.

Total growth = 2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches.

The final answer is: 26"
"To find out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles, we need to calculate the total number of each type of bike sold and then multiply it by its price.

First, let's find the number of Trekking bikes sold. We know that half of the 300 bikes sold were Trekking bikes, so the number of Trekking bikes sold is 300 / 2 = 150.

Next, let's find the number of BMX bikes sold. We know that 15% of the 300 bikes sold were BMX bikes, so the number of BMX bikes sold is 300 * 0.15 = 45.

Now, let's find the number of MTB bikes sold. We know that the rest of the bikes sold were MTB type, so the number of MTB bikes sold is 300 - 150 - 45 = 105.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings from each type of bike:

- Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500
- BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250 (since BMX is half the price of an MTB, which is $500, so BMX is $500 / 2 = $250)
- MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500

Now, let's add up the total earnings from all types of bikes: $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250.

The final answer is: $131,250"
"To find out how many bales of hay are left in the field, we need to calculate the total number of bales made by the farmer and the total number of bales picked up by the truck, and then subtract the latter from the former.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the farmer will make 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck will pick up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

Now, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the total number of bales made by the farmer: 30 - 18 = 12.

So, there are 12 bales of hay left in the field.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total time John spends learning, we need to calculate the time spent in classes, and the extra time spent on Saturday and Sunday.

First, let's find the total time spent in classes. John takes 2 extra classes, each 40 minutes long, 5 days a week. 

Time spent in classes per day = 2 * 40 minutes = 80 minutes
Time spent in classes per week = 80 minutes * 5 days = 400 minutes

Now, let's find the extra time spent on Saturday and Sunday. John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on extra learning time. 

There are 7 days in a week, so the total minutes in a week = 7 * 24 * 60 = 16800 minutes

Extra time spent on Saturday and Sunday = 1/16 * 16800 minutes = 1050 minutes

Now, let's add the time spent in classes and the extra time spent on Saturday and Sunday to find the total time spent learning.

Total time spent learning = 400 minutes + 1050 minutes = 1450 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60.

Total time spent learning in hours = 1450 minutes / 60 = 24.17 hours

"To find the height of the ball on its second bounce, we need to calculate the height of the ball after the first bounce and then multiply it by 2/3.

The initial height of the ball is the height of the third floor, which is 24 feet. 

On the first bounce, the ball reaches 2/3 of its initial height, so the height after the first bounce is 24 * (2/3) = 16 feet.

On the second bounce, the ball reaches 2/3 of the height it had after the first bounce, so the height after the second bounce is 16 * (2/3) = 10.67 feet.

The final answer is: 10.67"
"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the height of each child in inches. 

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 6 feet to inches by multiplying 6 by 12. 
6 feet * 12 inches/foot = 72 inches

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so we add 2 inches to the height of the first child.
72 inches + 2 inches = 74 inches

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so we subtract 5 inches from the height of the second child.
74 inches - 5 inches = 69 inches

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so we add 3 inches to the height of the third child.
69 inches + 3 inches = 72 inches

The final answer is: 72"
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to determine the number of bags sold and then multiply that by the price per bag.

Since the orchard sold a total of 2000 apples and each bag contains 10 apples, we can divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag to find the number of bags sold:

2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags

Now, we can multiply the number of bags sold by the price per bag to find the total earnings:

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The final answer is: $1000"
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the amount of meat left after the Allosaurus ate. 

The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat. Before that, the velociraptors scavenged half of what was left. So, the amount of meat left after the velociraptors ate was twice the amount the Allosaurus ate, which is 2 * 270 = 540 kilograms.

Now, the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, and the velociraptors scavenged half of what was left. This means the velociraptors ate half of the remaining half, which is 1/4 of the original amount. So, the amount of meat left after the T-Rex ate was 4 times the amount the velociraptors ate, which is 4 * 540 = 2160 kilograms.

Since the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, the original amount of meat on the triceratops was twice the amount the T-Rex ate, which is 2 * 2160 = 4320 kilograms.

The final answer is: 4320"
"To calculate the total cost of painting the room, we need to find the total area of the walls that need to be painted and then divide it by the coverage of a gallon of paint to find out how many gallons are needed. After that, we can multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon to get the total cost.

First, let's calculate the area of each wall:
- North wall: 10 x 8 = 80 square feet
- South wall: 10 x 8 = 80 square feet
- East wall: 5 x 8 = 40 square feet
- West wall: 5 x 8 = 40 square feet

Now, let's add up the areas of all the walls:
80 + 80 + 40 + 40 = 240 square feet

Since a gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, we need to divide the total area by 20 to find out how many gallons are needed:
240 / 20 = 12 gallons

Now, let's multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon to get the total cost:
12 gallons * $12 per gallon = $144

"To find the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to determine the probability of her choosing a shaken can out of the remaining cans.

Initially, there were 12 sodas. Ellen shook 3 of them, so 9 were unshaken. She took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 8 unshaken and 3 shaken sodas. Ellen's brother took 1 shaken and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 2 shaken and 6 unshaken sodas.

The total number of sodas left is 2 (shaken) + 6 (unshaken) = 8.

The probability of Ellen's friend choosing a shaken can is the number of shaken cans divided by the total number of cans: 2/8 = 0.25.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.25 * 100 = 25%.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. To find the distance it travels in 3 hours, we multiply its speed by the time:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour x 3 hours
Distance = 180 miles

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. To find the distance it travels in 3 hours, we multiply its speed by the time:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour x 3 hours
Distance = 90 miles

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, we add the distances they traveled to find the total distance between them:

Total Distance = Distance of first train + Distance of second train
Total Distance = 180 miles + 90 miles
Total Distance = 270 miles

The final answer is: 270"
"To find the total number of people Billy can help, we first need to determine the number of days he works. 

March has 31 days, and April has 19 days (since April 19th is the last day). So, the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th is 31 + 19 = 50 days.

Billy takes 20% of these days off, which is 0.2 * 50 = 10 days. Therefore, he works 50 - 10 = 40 days.

Since Billy can help 2 people per hour and works 3 hours a day, he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

To find the total number of people he can help, we multiply the number of days he works by the number of people he can help per day: 40 * 6 = 240.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the total number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people who were transported by the buses and the cars, and then subtract that from the total number of people who attended the wedding.

First, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the buses: 
12 buses * 35 people per bus = 420 people

Next, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the cars: 
20 cars * 3 people per car = 60 people

Now, let's add the number of people transported by the buses and the cars: 
420 people + 60 people = 480 people

Since the total number of people who attended the wedding is the sum of the people inside the church and the people outside, we can assume that the number of people outside the church is the sum of the number of private cars and buses, which is 20 + 12 = 32 people.

Now, let's calculate the total number of people who attended the wedding: 
32 people (outside the church) + 480 people (transported) = 512 people

To find the number of people inside the church, we subtract the number of people outside the church from the total number of people who attended the wedding: 
512 people - 32 people = 480 people

The final answer is: 480"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. We know that Mike is 24 years old, and Martha is 4 years younger than Mike. 

To find Martha's age, we subtract 4 from Mike's age: 
Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
Martha's age = 24 - 4
Martha's age = 20

We also know that Jeff is 10 years older than Martha. To find Jeff's age, we add 10 to Martha's age:
Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
Jeff's age = 20 + 10
Jeff's age = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the time it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of each slide by the speed at which people slide down.

For the biggest slide: 
Time = Length / Speed
Time = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute
Time = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide:
Time = Length / Speed
Time = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute
Time = 3 minutes

To find the difference in time, we subtract the time it takes to ride the second biggest slide from the time it takes to ride the biggest slide:
Difference = Time for biggest slide - Time for second biggest slide
Difference = 5 minutes - 3 minutes
Difference = 2 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks, we need to calculate the total time spent per day and then multiply it by 5.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 x 15-minute breaks per day. 
Total time spent per day = 30 minutes (lunch) + 2 x 15 minutes (breaks) = 30 + 30 = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60. 
60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Bobby spends 1 hour per day on lunch and breaks. 
Total time spent in 5 days = 1 hour/day x 5 days = 5 hours

The total time spent on lunch and breaks after 5 days is 5 hours."
"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we first need to determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can multiply 8 by 3.5 to find out how many miles Micah ran.

8 * 3.5 = 28 miles

Now that we know Micah ran 28 miles, we can subtract the total miles run by Amber and Micah from the total miles run by all three to find out how many miles Ahito ran.

Total miles run by all three = 52 miles
Miles run by Amber = 8 miles
Miles run by Micah = 28 miles
Miles run by Ahito = Total miles - (Miles run by Amber + Miles run by Micah)
Miles run by Ahito = 52 - (8 + 28)
Miles run by Ahito = 52 - 36
Miles run by Ahito = 16 miles

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total amount she spent after returning the item and then add it to the initial charge.

1. Initial charge: $85.00
2. Return: -$15.00 (since she returned an item)
   New balance after return: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

3. Frying pan purchase: 20% off $20.00
   Discount: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
   Price after discount: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00
   New balance: $70.00 + $16.00 = $86.00

4. Towel purchase: 10% off $30.00
   Discount: 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
   Price after discount: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00
   New balance: $86.00 + $27.00 = $113.00

The new balance on her credit card is $113.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. 

A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is x/5.

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (x/5) * (1/3) = x/15.

The problem states that 6 jellyfish changed color, so we can set up the equation x/15 = 6.

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 15, which gives us x = 6 * 15 = 90.

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find Caroline's age, we need to determine Ben's age first, and then multiply it by 3.

Since Chris is 4 years old, and Ben is two times older than Chris, we can calculate Ben's age as follows:
Ben's age = 2 * Chris's age
Ben's age = 2 * 4
Ben's age = 8

Now that we know Ben's age, we can find Caroline's age by multiplying Ben's age by 3:
Caroline's age = 3 * Ben's age
Caroline's age = 3 * 8
Caroline's age = 24

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate Lauren's total savings needed for retirement and then determine how many years she needs to work to achieve this goal.

First, let's calculate Lauren's annual expenses in retirement. Since she plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary, her annual expenses will be 0.4 * $100,000 = $40,000.

Next, we need to calculate the total amount Lauren needs to save for retirement. This will be her annual expenses multiplied by the number of years she plans to live in retirement: $40,000 * 20 = $800,000.

Since Lauren saves 20% of her salary each year, we need to calculate her annual savings: 0.2 * $100,000 = $20,000.

Now, we can calculate the number of years Lauren needs to work to save $800,000: $800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years.

However, this is the total number of years she needs to work to save for retirement, but we are asked for the number of years she needs to work after she has already started saving. Since she plans to live for 20 years after retirement, we need to subtract this from the total number of years: 40 - 20 = 20 years.

"To find the total population of the school, we can use the information given about the boys. Since 40% of the school population is 240 boys, we can set up the equation:

0.4x = 240

where x is the total population of the school.

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.4:

x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

Now that we know the total population of the school is 600, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total population:

Number of girls = Total population - Number of boys
= 600 - 240
= 360

The final answer is: 360"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items before applying the coupon. 

The cost of the set of pots is $19, and the cost of the sack of garden soil is $26. 

Total cost = cost of pots + cost of soil = $19 + $26 = $45

Now, we need to subtract the coupon value from the total cost to find the final amount spent.

Final amount spent = Total cost - coupon value = $45 - $7 = $38

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad needs to hike, we first need to calculate the total number of days in June. June has 30 days.

Since Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in 30 days, we can calculate her daily target by dividing the total miles by the number of days:

9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

Soledad is planning to hike 125 miles twice a day, which is a total of 250 miles per day. To find out how many more miles per day she needs to hike, we subtract her planned daily miles from her target daily miles:

310 miles per day - 250 miles per day = 60 miles per day

So, Soledad needs to hike 60 more miles per day to complete her journey on time.

First, let's calculate the total revenue from each color of ball:

- Red balls: 3 balls * $9 per ball = $27
- Blue balls: 11 balls * $5 per ball = $55
- Green balls: 25 balls * $3 per ball = $75

Now, let's add the revenue from each color together to find the total revenue:

$27 (red) + $55 (blue) + $75 (green) = $157

The store will have received a total of $157 after all the balls are sold.

"To find out how much James will have left, we first need to determine how much Pierre and Paul will take. 

Pierre wants a quarter of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/4 = 3 kg. 

Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/3 = 4 kg.

So, Pierre and Paul will take 3 + 4 = 7 kg in total.

Since they started with 12 kg, James will have 12 - 7 = 5 kg left.

"To find out how much money Raymond has left, we need to calculate the total amount of money he spent and subtract that from the initial amount he had.

First, let's calculate the total amount spent: $5 (comic book) + $19 (puzzle) = $24.

Now, let's subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount Raymond had: $21 (initial amount) - $24 (total spent) = -$3.

However, since we can't have a negative amount of money, this means that Raymond doesn't have enough money to buy the puzzle. He is short $3.

But if we consider the puzzle purchase as an impossible transaction, we can calculate the amount of money he has left after buying the comic book: $21 (initial amount) - $5 (comic book) = $16.

So, Raymond has $16 left if he bought the comic book but not the puzzle.

Final answer: $16"
"To find out how much each book cost, we need to first determine how much Anna spent in total. We know she had a budget of $16 and has $2 left, so she spent $16 - $2 = $14.

Since she spent $14 in total and bought 2 books that cost the same amount, we can divide the total amount spent by 2 to find the cost of each book. 

Cost of each book = Total amount spent / Number of books
Cost of each book = $14 / 2
Cost of each book = $7

Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia, so Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours to walk the dog.

Dior took over 4 hours longer than Amalia, so Dior took 4 + 4 = 8 hours to do laundry.

Now, let's add the time each person took to do their chores: 4 (Amalia) + 6 (Megan) + 8 (Dior) = 18 hours.

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 18 hours."
"To find the total distance John drives in a round trip, we need to calculate the distance of a single trip and then multiply it by 2.

The distance of a single trip is calculated using the formula: distance = speed * time. 

Given that the speed is 70 mph and the time is 2 hours, we can plug in the values: distance = 70 * 2 = 140 miles.

Since John makes two trips a month, we need to multiply the distance of a single trip by 2: 140 * 2 = 280 miles.

However, this is the distance for two trips in a month. To find the total distance for a month, we need to consider that there are approximately 4 weeks in a month. Since John visits his parents twice a week, we can multiply the distance for two trips by 2: 280 * 2 = 560 miles.

The final answer is: 560"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how far Sofie will walk in 7 days. Since Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, we can multiply the number of miles she walks per day by the number of days:

10 miles/day * 7 days = 70 miles

Since Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship:

Sofie's distance = 2 * Brian's distance

We know that Sofie's distance is 70 miles, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

70 miles = 2 * Brian's distance

To find Brian's distance, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

Brian's distance = 70 miles / 2
Brian's distance = 35 miles

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

The final answer is: 35"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers and then find out how many toys the fifth worker must produce to meet the remaining demand.

First, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the 2 workers who produce 6 toys an hour. Since they work for 10 hours, they produce a total of 2 * 6 * 10 = 120 toys.

Next, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the other 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour. Since they work for 10 hours, they produce a total of 2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys.

The total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to meet the order, the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers must be 400 - 20 = 380 toys.

Now, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers. Since the first 4 workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced 380 - 200 = 180 toys.

Since the fifth worker works for 10 hours, the number of toys the fifth worker produces per hour is 180 / 10 = 18 toys per hour.

"To find the total weight of Elijah's dogs, we first need to find the weight of each of his dogs. 

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so we multiply 60 by 1/4 to find the weight of Elijah's first dog: 60 * (1/4) = 15 pounds.

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so we multiply 60 by 1/2 to find the weight of Elijah's second dog: 60 * (1/2) = 30 pounds.

Now, we add the weights of Elijah's two dogs to find the total weight of his dogs: 15 + 30 = 45 pounds.

To find the total weight of all three dogs, we add the weight of Kory's dog to the total weight of Elijah's dogs: 60 + 45 = 105 pounds.

The final answer is: 105"
"To solve this problem, let's work backwards from the information given.

Kris had 7 stickers left after giving some to Rob. Kris had 9 stickers and gave 7 to Rob, so Kris had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers before giving any to Rob.

Luis gave the rest of the stickers to Kris, and Kris had 16 stickers. This means Luis had 16 + 7 = 23 stickers before giving any to Kris.

Luis used half of the stickers and gave the rest to Kris. This means Luis had 23 stickers and gave half of them to Kris. Half of 23 is 11.5, but since you can't give half a sticker, we'll assume Luis had an even number of stickers. Let's try 24 stickers. Half of 24 is 12, which is a whole number.

So, Luis had 24 stickers and gave 12 to Kris. 

Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. Luis had 24 stickers, so Seth must have had 24 * 2 = 48 stickers in the beginning.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the total number of M&M's John has, we need to calculate the total weight of the M&M's and then multiply it by the number of M&M's per ounce. 

First, let's find the total weight of the M&M's: 3 large bags * 10 ounces per bag = 30 ounces.

Since an ounce of M&M's has 30 M&M's, the total number of M&M's is 30 ounces * 30 M&M's per ounce = 900 M&M's.

Now, we need to find out how many small bags John can make. Each small bag contains 10 M&M's, so we divide the total number of M&M's by 10: 900 M&M's / 10 M&M's per small bag = 90 small bags.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we need to first calculate half of the earth's circumference. 

The earth's circumference is 40,000 kilometers. Half of that would be 40,000 / 2 = 20,000 kilometers.

Since Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day, we can find the number of days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers by dividing 20,000 by 400.

20,000 / 400 = 50

So, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the speed of the 2nd fastest car first, and then use that to find the speed of the fastest car.

Given that the average car can go 120 miles per hour, and the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, we can calculate the speed of the 2nd fastest car as follows:

Speed of 2nd fastest car = 5 * Speed of average car
= 5 * 120
= 600 miles per hour

Now, we know that the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. We can calculate the speed of the fastest car as follows:

Speed of fastest car = 1.25 * Speed of 2nd fastest car
= 1.25 * 600
= 750 miles per hour

"To solve this problem, we need to first find Liam's age two years ago and then use that information to find Vince's age at that time. 

Liam's current age is 16 years. Two years ago, Liam's age would be 16 - 2 = 14 years.

Two years ago, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince. So, Vince's age two years ago would be 14 / 2 = 7 years.

To find Vince's current age, we need to add 2 years to his age two years ago. Vince's current age is 7 + 2 = 9 years.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so let's call this number A.
- Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. Let's call the number of eggs Sarah painted S. Then, Camden painted S + 12 eggs.
- Since Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, we can write the equation: S + (S + 12) = 30.
- Simplifying the equation, we get 2S + 12 = 30.
- Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get 2S = 18.
- Dividing both sides by 2, we get S = 9.
- Since Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.
- We know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and the total number of eggs painted by all four is 56. So, the total number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline is 56 - 30 = 26.
- Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, each of them painted 26 / 2 = 13 eggs.
- Camden painted 21 eggs, and Arnold painted 13 eggs, so Camden painted 21 - 13 = 8 more eggs than Arnold.

"To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we first need to find the total weight of the crayons and the total weight of the boxes separately.

Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce and Nik has 200 crayons, the total weight of the crayons is 200 ounces.

Since each box weighs 8 ounces and Nik has 200 crayons, he will need 200 / 8 = 25 boxes. The total weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 200 (crayons) + 200 (boxes) = 400 ounces.

Since there are 16 ounces to a pound, we can convert the total weight from ounces to pounds by dividing by 16: 400 / 16 = 25 pounds.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how much John makes, we first need to determine how many logs he can make from the tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, we calculate 80% of 80 feet.

80% of 80 feet = 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet

Since each log is 4 feet long, we divide the total length of the usable tree by the length of each log to find the number of logs.

64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs

From each log, he cuts 5 planks. So, we multiply the number of logs by the number of planks per log.

16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks

He sells each plank for $1.2. To find the total amount he makes, we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank.

80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96

"To solve this problem, we need to find the combined salary of Valerie and her brother, and then add her mother's salary to it.

Valerie earns $5000 per month, and her brother earns twice as much as her, so he earns 2 * $5000 = $10,000 per month.

The combined salary of Valerie and her brother is $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000 per month.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so she earns 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

The total amount of money they all have together is $15,000 + $30,000 = $45,000.

The final answer is: $45,000."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Grandma's speed on the beach and on the sidewalk. 

Let's denote Grandma's speed on the beach as 'x' miles per minute. Since she walks at twice the rate on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.

We know that she walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. The time taken to walk 2 miles on the beach is 40 minutes. We can use the formula: time = distance / speed to find her speed on the beach.

Time taken to walk 2 miles on the beach = 40 minutes
Speed on the beach = distance / time = 2 miles / 40 minutes = 0.05 miles per minute

Now that we know her speed on the beach, we can find her speed on the sidewalk. 
Speed on the sidewalk = 2 * speed on the beach = 2 * 0.05 miles per minute = 0.1 miles per minute

Now, we can find the time taken to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk.
Time taken to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk = distance / speed = 1 mile / 0.1 miles per minute = 10 minutes

The total time taken to walk 3 miles is the sum of the time taken to walk on the beach and the time taken to walk on the sidewalk.
Total time = time taken on the beach + time taken on the sidewalk = 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how many more weeks it will take Jane to save a total of $60, we first need to calculate how much she has saved so far. 

She has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so the total amount saved is 4 * 8 = $32.

To find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract the amount she has saved from the target amount: 60 - 32 = $28.

Since she saves $4 per week, we can find out how many weeks it will take to save the remaining amount by dividing the remaining amount by the weekly savings: 28 / 4 = 7.

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total number of blue birds, we need to calculate the number of blue birds in each group of trees and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of blue birds in the 3 trees with 7 blue birds each:
3 trees * 7 blue birds/tree = 21 blue birds

Next, let's find the number of blue birds in the 2 trees with 4 blue birds each:
2 trees * 4 blue birds/tree = 8 blue birds

Then, we have 1 tree with 3 blue birds.

Now, let's add the number of blue birds in each group together:
21 blue birds + 8 blue birds + 3 blue birds = 32 blue birds

The final answer is: 32"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many marbles Bob originally had. We know that if he receives 2 dozen (24) more marbles, he will have 60. 

Let's denote the original number of marbles as 'x'. Then, the equation can be set up as follows:

x + 24 = 60

To find 'x', we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 24 from both sides:

x = 60 - 24
x = 36

So, Bob originally had 36 marbles. Now, if he loses 10 marbles, we need to subtract 10 from 36 to find the new number of marbles he has:

36 - 10 = 26

The final answer is: 26"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum temperature of the second bottle of water. 

Let's denote the temperature of the second bottle as x degrees. 

When Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle into his water bottle, the total volume of water in the bottle is 5 ounces. 

Since the temperature of the mixture is at least 40 degrees, we can set up the following equation:

(33 * 4 + x * 1) / 5 >= 40

Simplifying the equation:

132 + x >= 200

Subtracting 132 from both sides:

x >= 68

So, the second bottle must be at least 68 degrees.

The final answer is: 68"
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of cows. Melanie's father starts with 50 cows. Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, there are 21 days in three weeks. 

Number of cows added in three weeks = 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
Total number of cows = Initial number of cows + Number of cows added
Total number of cows = 50 + 420
Total number of cows = 470

Next, let's calculate the number of chickens. Melanie's father starts with 20 chickens. Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. 

Number of chickens added in three weeks = 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens
Total number of chickens = Initial number of chickens + Number of chickens added
Total number of chickens = 20 + 210
Total number of chickens = 230

Now, let's add the total number of cows and chickens to find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks.

Total number of animals = Total number of cows + Total number of chickens
Total number of animals = 470 + 230
Total number of animals = 700

The final answer is: 700"
"To find the cost of each single bagel, we first need to calculate the total cost of the 4 packs of bagels with the 10% discount. 

The original cost of 4 packs of bagels is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00. 

Since Russell receives a 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of $40.00. 
10% of $40.00 = 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00

Now, we subtract the discount from the original cost to get the discounted cost: 
$40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

Since each pack has 9 bagels, the total number of bagels is 4 * 9 = 36 bagels.

To find the cost of each single bagel, we divide the discounted cost by the total number of bagels: 
$36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00 per bagel.

The final answer is: $1.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. We know that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops, so we can write this as an equation:

Gomer's scoops = 23 - 5
Gomer's scoops = 18

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes it takes to make one scoop of mashed potatoes. We know that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops, so we can write this as an equation:

Potatoes per scoop = 6 - 3
Potatoes per scoop = 3

However, the previous equation is actually referring to the number of scoops that can be made with 3 less than 6 potatoes. To find the number of scoops that can be made with 3 potatoes, we need to add 1 to the number of scoops, so the correct equation is:

Potatoes per scoop = 3 potatoes / (3 - 1) scoops
Potatoes per scoop = 3 potatoes / 2 scoops
Potatoes per scoop = 1.5 potatoes per scoop

Now that we know it takes 1.5 potatoes to make one scoop of mashed potatoes, we can find out how many potatoes Gomer ate by multiplying the number of scoops by the number of potatoes per scoop:

Potatoes eaten = Gomer's scoops * Potatoes per scoop
Potatoes eaten = 18 * 1.5
Potatoes eaten = 27

The final answer is: 27"
"To find the total number of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we need to calculate the number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately, and then add them together.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days is 3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs.

In the next 30 days, Chester increases his egg consumption to 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in the next 30 days is 5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs.

Now, we add the total number of eggs from both periods: 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens: 240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozen eggs.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we first need to determine the total number of red jellybeans. We know that there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans, and there are 17 green jellybeans. 

So, the number of red jellybeans = 2 * 17 = 34.

We also know that the total number of jellybeans is 60. We can use this information to find the number of blue jellybeans.

Total jellybeans = green jellybeans + red jellybeans + blue jellybeans
60 = 17 + 34 + blue jellybeans

Now, we can solve for the number of blue jellybeans:
blue jellybeans = 60 - 17 - 34
blue jellybeans = 9

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade, we need to calculate the total number of lemons he collects in one year and then multiply it by 10.

First, let's find the total number of lemons he collects in one year. He has 5 trees and each tree gives him 6 lemons per year. 

Total lemons per year = Number of trees * Lemons per tree per year
Total lemons per year = 5 * 6
Total lemons per year = 30

Now, we multiply the total lemons per year by 10 to find the total lemons in a decade.

Total lemons in a decade = Total lemons per year * 10
Total lemons in a decade = 30 * 10
Total lemons in a decade = 300

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the number of women who remained on the bus, we first need to find the total number of women on the bus initially. 

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, we can let the number of men be 5x and the number of women be 9x. 

The total number of passengers is 84, so 5x + 9x = 84. 
Combine like terms: 14x = 84. 
Divide both sides by 14: x = 6. 

Now that we know x, we can find the number of women on the bus initially: 9x = 9 * 6 = 54. 

After 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining is 54 - 20 = 34.

The final answer is: 34"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many bouquets and sunflowers Faraday sold in a day. 

Let's start by finding out how many bouquets Faraday sold in a day. We know that each bouquet costs $8 and he earned $56 from the bouquet per day. 

Number of bouquets sold per day = Total earnings from bouquets per day / Cost of each bouquet
= $56 / $8
= 7

Now, we know that each bouquet has 12 sunflowers. So, the total number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold per day is:
= Number of bouquets sold per day * Number of sunflowers per bouquet
= 7 * 12
= 84

We also know that Faraday earned $26 from the sunflowers per day. Since each sunflower costs $2, the number of sunflowers sold per day is:
= Total earnings from sunflowers per day / Cost of each sunflower
= $26 / $2
= 13

Now, we need to find the total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days. 
= Number of sunflowers sold per day * Number of days
= 13 * 3
= 39

However, we also need to add the sunflowers from the bouquets sold in 3 days. 
= Total sunflowers in bouquets sold per day * Number of days
= 84 * 3
= 252

Now, we add the sunflowers sold individually and the sunflowers in the bouquets to get the total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days.
= 39 + 252
= 291

The final answer is: 291"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks, the total revenue from selling 60% of the inventory, and then find the difference between the revenue and the cost.

First, let's find out how many rocks Adam can buy with $100. Since each rock costs $5, we divide the total amount by the cost per rock:

100 / 5 = 20 rocks

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling 60% of the inventory. Since Adam sells 60% of 20 rocks, we multiply 20 by 0.6:

20 * 0.6 = 12 rocks sold

Since each rock is sold for $7, we multiply the number of rocks sold by the selling price:

12 * 7 = $84

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the rocks. Since Adam bought 20 rocks at $5 each, we multiply the number of rocks by the cost per rock:

20 * 5 = $100

However, Adam only sells 60% of the inventory, so he still has 40% of the rocks left. To find the cost of the unsold rocks, we multiply the number of unsold rocks by the cost per rock:

40% of 20 rocks = 0.4 * 20 = 8 rocks
8 * 5 = $40

The total cost of the rocks is the sum of the cost of the sold rocks and the unsold rocks:

$100 (total cost) - $40 (unsold rocks) = $60 (cost of sold rocks)

Now, let's find the loss. The loss is the difference between the total cost and the revenue:

Loss = Total cost - Revenue
Loss = $100 - $84
Loss = $16

The final answer is: $16"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of days it takes Lauren to complete each type of picture scene. 

First, let's find the number of days it takes Lauren to complete each type of picture scene:

- Large-sized picture scenes: 45 / 5 = 9 days
- Medium-sized picture scenes: 36 / 6 = 6 days
- Small-sized picture scenes: 49 / 7 = 7 days

Now, we need to find the LCM of 9, 6, and 7. 

The prime factorization of 6 is 2 * 3.
The prime factorization of 7 is 7.
The prime factorization of 9 is 3^2.

To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the numbers:
- The highest power of 2 is 2^1 (from 6).
- The highest power of 3 is 3^2 (from 9).
- The highest power of 7 is 7^1 (from 7).

The LCM is 2^1 * 3^2 * 7^1 = 2 * 9 * 7 = 126.

Therefore, it will take Lauren 126 days to complete all the picture scenes.

"To find out how much Jen spends on food for her fish in May, we need to calculate the total cost of food for a month. 

First, we need to determine the number of days in May. May has 31 days. 

Since each fish needs $1 worth of food a day, and Jen has 3 fish, the daily cost of food for all her fish is 3 * $1 = $3.

To find the total cost for the month, we multiply the daily cost by the number of days in May: $3 * 31 = $93.

So, Jen spends $93 on food for her fish in May.

The final answer is: $93"
"To find out how many roses Patricia has now, we need to first determine how many roses she had after giving some to her mother. 

Initially, Patricia had 30 roses. She gave 24 roses to her mother, so we subtract 24 from 30 to find out how many roses she had left: 30 - 24 = 6.

Then, Patricia bought 15 more roses. To find out how many roses she has now, we add the 15 new roses to the 6 she already had: 6 + 15 = 21.

So, Patricia now has 21 roses.

"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken. 

The total distance traveled is the sum of the two distances: 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles.

The total time taken is the sum of the two times: 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours.

Now, we can calculate the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time: 

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
Average speed = 250 miles / 5 hours
Average speed = 50 miles per hour

"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning. 

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which is 0.2 in decimal form. 

The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability is 3 times 0.2, which is 0.6.

To find the probability of both tickets winning, we multiply the probabilities: 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many seashells Carrey collected. Let's denote the number of seashells Carrey collected as 'x'. Since Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, Carlos collected 2x seashells. We are given that Jim collected 5 more than Carlos, so Jim collected 2x + 5 seashells.

We know that the total number of seashells collected is the sum of the seashells collected by each person, which is x + 2x + (2x + 5) = 5x + 5.

Since they divided the seashells equally among themselves, the total number of seashells is also equal to 3 times the number of seashells each person got. So, we can set up the equation: 5x + 5 = 3y, where y is the number of seashells each person got.

To find the value of x, we need to know that the total number of seashells is 27 + 5 = 32. So, 5x + 5 = 32. Subtracting 5 from both sides, we get 5x = 27. Dividing both sides by 5, we get x = 5.4. However, since we can't have a fraction of a seashell, we'll round down to the nearest whole number, which is 5.

Now that we know x, we can find the number of seashells each person got. Carlos collected 2x = 2 * 5 = 10 seashells. Jim collected 2x + 5 = 2 * 5 + 5 = 15 seashells. Carrey collected x = 5 seashells.

Since they divided the seashells equally, each person got 10 + 15 + 5 / 3 = 30 / 3 = 10 seashells.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday). So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is 4 * 5 = 20.

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is 5 + 5 = 10.

Now, we add the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend to find the total number of carrots he eats in a week. 20 (weekdays) + 10 (weekend) = 30.

"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song first. Since the second song is 60% longer than the first song, we can calculate its length by adding 60% of the first song's length to the first song's length.

First, we need to convert 60% to a decimal by dividing by 100: 60 / 100 = 0.6.

Then, we multiply the first song's length by 0.6 to find the additional length: 5 minutes * 0.6 = 3 minutes.

Now, we add the additional length to the first song's length to find the second song's length: 5 minutes + 3 minutes = 8 minutes.

Finally, we add the lengths of both songs to find the total length of the cassette: 5 minutes + 8 minutes = 13 minutes.

"To find the length of Carl's cane, we need to determine Carl's height first. We know that Isabel is 7 feet tall and Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel. 

Isabel's height = 7 feet
Ned's height = Isabel's height - 2 feet
Ned's height = 7 - 2
Ned's height = 5 feet

Since Carl is one foot taller than Ned, we can calculate Carl's height as follows:
Carl's height = Ned's height + 1 foot
Carl's height = 5 + 1
Carl's height = 6 feet

We are given that Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. Therefore, we can calculate the length of Carl's cane as follows:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of bottles required to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, and then subtract the number of bottles Hortex can produce in a day.

First, let's find out how many bottles are needed to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people. Since each bottle covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand, we need to find out how many bottles are needed for 2300 people.

2300 people * 100% = 2300 people * 1 = 2300 people
Since each bottle covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand, we need to divide 2300 people by 20% (or 0.2) to find out how many bottles are needed for 2300 people.
2300 / 0.2 = 11500 bottles

Now, let's find out how many bottles Hortex can produce in a day, which is given as 4200 bottles.

To find out how many more bottles Hortex needs to produce, we subtract the number of bottles it can produce from the total number of bottles needed:

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how many babies are wearing purple and blue. Since Carla has 8 babies and 3/4 of them are wearing purple, we can calculate the number of purple babies as follows:

Number of purple babies = 8 * (3/4) = 6

Similarly, the number of blue babies is:

Number of blue babies = 8 * (1/4) = 2

Now, let's find out how many babies are wearing bows. We know that all the blue babies and 1/3 of the purple babies are wearing bows. So, the number of purple babies wearing bows is:

Number of purple babies wearing bows = 6 * (1/3) = 2

The total number of babies wearing bows is the sum of blue babies and purple babies wearing bows:

Total number of babies wearing bows = 2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4

Now, we need to find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. This can be calculated as:

Percentage chance = (Number of purple babies wearing bows / Total number of babies wearing bows) * 100

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how much land Abraham sold in the first two transactions. He initially had 80 square meters of land. He sold half of it for $50, which means he sold 80 / 2 = 40 square meters for $50.

Then, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. Since he had 80 square meters initially, 1/4 of it is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters. So, he sold 20 square meters for $30.

Now, let's find out how much land is left. He initially had 80 square meters, sold 40 + 20 = 60 square meters, so he has 80 - 60 = 20 square meters left.

He sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, the total amount he earned from the remaining land is 20 * 3 = $60.

Now, let's calculate the total amount he earned from the first two transactions. He sold 40 square meters for $50 and 20 square meters for $30, so the total amount he earned from the first two transactions is $50 + $30 = $80.

The total amount he earned from all the land is the sum of the amount he earned from the first two transactions and the amount he earned from the remaining land, which is $80 + $60 = $140.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many eggs each person found and then subtract that from the total number of eggs hidden.

Lamar finds 5 eggs. 
Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 2 * 5 = 10 eggs.
Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up the number of eggs found by each person: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

Since there were 3 dozen eggs hidden initially, we need to convert that to a numerical value. 1 dozen is equal to 12, so 3 dozen is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

"To find the total amount John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of apartments and the total number of collections.

First, let's find the total number of apartments in the first two complexes: 200 + 200 = 400 apartments.

The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, so we need to find 60% of 400 and add it to 400. 

60% of 400 is 0.6 * 400 = 240. 
So, the last complex has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, we add the number of apartments in all three complexes: 400 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so the total number of collections per week is 3 * 1040 = 3120 collections.

In the 7th year, it produces 7 times the initial amount, which is 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
In the 8th year, it produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree, but we don't know the production of a 10-year-old tree yet. We'll come back to this later.
In the 9th year, the tree doesn't produce any fruits.
In the 10th year, a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now, let's find out how many fruits a 10-year-old tree produces in the 8th year. Since a 10-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree in the 8th year, a 10-year-old tree in the 8th year produces 1000 + 200 = 1200 fruits. 

So, in the 8th year, the tree produces 1200 fruits.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits produced by the tree in its 10 years of life:
Year 5: 50 fruits
Year 6: 150 fruits
Year 7: 350 fruits
Year 8: 1200 fruits
Year 9: 0 fruits
Year 10: 1000 fruits

Total fruits = 50 + 150 + 350 + 1200 + 0 + 1000 = 2650

The final answer is: 2650"
"To find out how much money Jack has now, we need to calculate the amount Sophia gave him and add it to his initial amount.

Sophia gave Jack 1/5 of her $100. To find 1/5 of $100, we multiply $100 by 1/5, which is the same as dividing $100 by 5.

$100 / 5 = $20

So, Sophia gave Jack $20. Now, we add this to Jack's initial $100.

$100 + $20 = $120

Jack now has $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as B, the yellow rope as Y, and the red rope as R. We are given that R = 4B and B = Y - 7.

We can express Y in terms of B: Y = B + 7.

We are also given that R + B + Y = 37. Substituting R = 4B and Y = B + 7 into this equation, we get:

4B + B + B + 7 = 37

Combine like terms: 6B + 7 = 37

Subtract 7 from both sides: 6B = 30

Divide both sides by 6: B = 5

Now that we know B, we can find R: R = 4B = 4 * 5 = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's assume Ronnie was given $5. Since Rissa was given thrice as much, Rissa was given 3 * $5 = $15.

After each of them gave an equal amount of money to their little sister, let's call the amount they gave 'x'. So, Ronnie is left with $5 - x and Rissa is left with $15 - x.

We are given that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, which means (15 - x) = (4/5) * 15. 

To find the value of x, we can solve the equation: 
(15 - x) = (4/5) * 15
15 - x = 12
x = 3

Now that we know x, we can find out how much money Ronnie is left with:
Ronnie's money left = $5 - x
= $5 - 3
= $2

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the amount of red, white, and purple paint as 'r'. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, the total amount of these three colors is 3r.

We know that half the mural is yellow, so the amount of yellow paint is 12 / 2 = 6 pints.

The total amount of paint used in the mural is 12 pints, which is the sum of the red, white, purple, and yellow paint. We can write this as an equation:

3r + 6 = 12

To solve for 'r', we need to isolate 'r' on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 6 from both sides:

3r = 12 - 6
3r = 6

Now, we can divide both sides by 3 to find the value of 'r':

r = 6 / 3
r = 2

Since 'r' represents the amount of red, white, and purple paint, and we know that there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple, the amount of red paint is also 2 pints.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house, then add them together.

First, let's find the area of one bedroom: 
Area of one bedroom = length * width = 20 * 12 = 240 square feet.

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms = 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area = 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is given as 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas together: 
Total area = area of bedrooms + area of living room + area of the rest of the house
Total area = 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.

The final answer is: 3160"
"To find the total number of clouds Alice counted, we need to calculate the number of clouds she saw each day and add them up.

On Monday, Alice saw 3 clouds.
On Tuesday, she saw double the number of clouds as Monday, which is 3 * 2 = 6 clouds.
On Wednesday, she saw double the number of clouds as Tuesday, which is 6 * 2 = 12 clouds.
On Thursday, she saw double the number of clouds as Wednesday, which is 12 * 2 = 24 clouds.
On Friday, she saw double the number of clouds as Thursday, which is 24 * 2 = 48 clouds.

Now, let's add up the number of clouds she saw each day: 
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93

"To find the number of pods in the new box, we need to calculate 20% of 100 and add it to 100. 

20% of 100 = 0.2 * 100 = 20
Number of pods in the new box = 100 + 20 = 120

Since the price remains the same, we can calculate the number of cycles we can run for $1 with the new box.

Cost per pod = $12 / 120 pods = $0.1 per pod

Number of cycles for $1 = $1 / $0.1 per pod = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. This means he has 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he has 50 - 10 = 40 bills left.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill, which means he uses 40 / 2 = 20 bills. This leaves him with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

4. Thomas then triples his money. Since each bill is worth $20, tripling his money means each bill is now worth $60. So, he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills, but each is worth $60.

5. To find the total amount of money he has, we multiply the number of bills by the value of each bill: 60 * $60 = $3600.

6. He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. To find the number of 5 dollar bills, we divide the total amount of money by the value of each 5 dollar bill: $3600 / $5 = 720.

The final answer is: 720"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals in the first half.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals.

Now, we know that in the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B. Since team B scored 8 goals in the second half, team A scores 8 / 4 = 2 goals in the second half.

Now, let's calculate the total number of goals scored by each team in the match. Team A scored 4 goals in the first half and 2 goals in the second half, for a total of 4 + 2 = 6 goals. Team B scored 2 goals in the first half and 8 goals in the second half, for a total of 2 + 8 = 10 goals.

The total number of goals scored in the match is the sum of the goals scored by both teams, which is 6 + 10 = 16.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much chalk the teacher has left after Monday and then determine how many days it will last.

The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk. He uses 45% of it on Monday, so we need to find 45% of 5 inches.

45% of 5 inches = 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches

This means the teacher has 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches of chalk left after Monday.

Now, we need to find out how many days the remaining 2.75 inches of chalk will last when the teacher uses 20% of it each day.

Let's assume the number of days the chalk will last is 'x'. Then, 20% of 2.75 inches will be used each day.

0.20 * 2.75 = 0.55 inches per day

Since the teacher has 2.75 inches of chalk left, we can set up the equation:

2.75 = 0.55x

To solve for 'x', we divide both sides by 0.55:

x = 2.75 / 0.55
x = 5

"To find the number of students not on varsity, we first need to determine the number of students on varsity. 

One-third of the girls are on varsity, so the number of girls on varsity is 12 * (1/3) = 4. 

One-fourth of the boys are on varsity, so the number of boys on varsity is 12 * (1/4) = 3.

The total number of students on varsity is 4 (girls) + 3 (boys) = 7.

Since there are 24 students in total (12 boys and 12 girls), the number of students not on varsity is 24 - 7 = 17.

"To find out how many face masks Johnny bought, we need to first determine how many face masks Mike bought, and then calculate three times that amount and add 2.

Mike bought 5 face masks. 

Three times the number of face masks Mike bought is 3 * 5 = 15.

Johnny bought 2 more than three times as many as Mike, so we add 2 to 15: 15 + 2 = 17.

Therefore, Johnny bought 17 face masks.

"To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we first need to determine the total number of teeth the dentist works on. The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more teeth than he drills, so the number of teeth capped is 4 + 7 = 11.

The total number of teeth the dentist works on is 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15.

To find the percentage, we divide the number of teeth the dentist works on by the total number of teeth James has and multiply by 100.

(15 / 30) * 100 = 50%

"To find the total cost of the milk that Mr. Marcellus purchased, we need to multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon. 

Total gallons = 4000
Cost per gallon = $3.5

Total cost = Total gallons * Cost per gallon
Total cost = 4000 * 3.5
Total cost = $14,000

Since 2/5 of the milk was expired, we need to find 2/5 of the total gallons to determine the amount that was returned.

Expired gallons = 2/5 * Total gallons
Expired gallons = 2/5 * 4000
Expired gallons = 1600

The refund amount will be the cost of the expired gallons.

Refund amount = Expired gallons * Cost per gallon
Refund amount = 1600 * 3.5
Refund amount = $5600

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Colin's current age as C and Wendy's current age as W.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:
W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:
C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now, we can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:
C + 25 = (5/3)(C + 7)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:
75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:
40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2:
20 = C

"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we first need to determine the total number of books he can buy with $27000. 

Since he can buy 100 books for $500, we can find the total number of books by dividing the total amount spent ($27000) by the cost per 100 books ($500).

Total number of books = Total amount spent / Cost per 100 books
Total number of books = $27000 / $500
Total number of books = 54

Now, we need to find out how many books he can buy per school. Since he is distributing the money to 3 schools, we divide the total number of books by 3.

Books per school = Total number of books / Number of schools
Books per school = 54 / 3
Books per school = 18

First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten by Kate's friends: 
6 friends * 6 slices per friend = 36 slices

Next, let's calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten by Kate's friends: 
6 friends * 4 slices per friend = 24 slices

Since the cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices and the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, we need to find out how many whole pizzas are needed for each type. 

For the cheese pizza: 
36 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas

For the pepperoni pizza: 
24 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas

Since Kate needs to buy whole pizzas, she needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas. 

To find the total number of pizzas Kate needs to buy, we add the number of cheese pizzas and pepperoni pizzas: 
3 cheese pizzas + 3 pepperoni pizzas = 6 pizzas

"To solve this problem, we need to find the net rate at which Jay is building snowballs. He builds 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 melt every 15 minutes. 

First, let's convert the melting rate to an hourly rate. Since there are 4 15-minute intervals in an hour, the melting rate is 2 * 4 = 8 snowballs per hour.

Now, let's find the net rate at which Jay is building snowballs. This is the rate at which he builds snowballs minus the rate at which they melt: 20 - 8 = 12 snowballs per hour.

To find the time it takes for Jay to have 60 snowballs, we can divide the target number of snowballs by the net rate: 60 / 12 = 5 hours.

However, this is the time it takes to build 60 snowballs, but it doesn't account for the initial 0 snowballs Jay has. Since he starts with 0 snowballs, he needs to build 60 snowballs, which takes 5 hours.

On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50. So, the remaining bandages after the first day are x - 38.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. The remaining bandages after the second day are (x - 38) - 28.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, which is 2 * 50 = 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages. The remaining bandages after the third day are ((x - 38) - 28) - 25 + 100.

We are given that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. So, we can set up the equation:

"To solve this problem, we need to find the cost of the scotch and the cognac separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the scotch. We know that John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600. To find the cost per bottle, we can divide the total cost by the number of bottles:

Cost per bottle of scotch = Total cost / Number of bottles
= $600 / 10
= $60 per bottle

Next, we need to find the number of bottles of cognac. We know that John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so:

Number of bottles of cognac = 2 * Number of bottles of scotch
= 2 * 10
= 20 bottles

We also know that the cognac costs 50% more per bottle than the scotch. To find the cost per bottle of cognac, we can multiply the cost per bottle of scotch by 1.5 (since 50% more is the same as multiplying by 1.5):

Cost per bottle of cognac = Cost per bottle of scotch * 1.5
= $60 * 1.5
= $90 per bottle

Now, we can find the total cost of the cognac by multiplying the number of bottles by the cost per bottle:

Total cost of cognac = Number of bottles of cognac * Cost per bottle of cognac
= 20 * $90
= $1800

Finally, we can find the total amount John spent by adding the cost of the scotch and the cognac:

Total amount spent = Total cost of scotch + Total cost of cognac
= $600 + $1800
= $2400

The final answer is: $2400"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees. He also planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which means he planted 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, making it a total of 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than he planted on the first day. Since he planted 40 Lodgepole Pine trees on the first day, 1/4 of that is 40 * 1/4 = 10. So, he planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day.

To find the total number of trees planted in the two days, we need to add the number of White Oak and Lodgepole Pine trees planted on both days. 

Total White Oak trees = 20 (first day) + 10 (second day) = 30
Total Lodgepole Pine trees = 40 (first day) + 50 (second day) = 90

Total number of trees = Total White Oak trees + Total Lodgepole Pine trees = 30 + 90 = 120

"To find the number of fish with red stripes, we need to calculate one-third of the total number of fish. 

One-third of 66 is 66 / 3 = 22.

Now, we need to find the number of fish that do not have red stripes. Since 22 fish have red stripes, the remaining fish are 66 - 22 = 44.

Now, we need to find 5/11 of the remaining fish that have blue stripes. 

5/11 of 44 is (5/11) * 44 = 20.

So, the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes is 22 + 20 = 42.

The final answer is: 42"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Amy had 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each, so she had 2 * 4 = 8 eyeshadow colors from the palettes.

She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 eyeshadow colors each, so she had 3 * 6 = 18 eyeshadow colors from the makeup sets.

In total, Amy had 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors.

Her sister stole one of the palettes, which means Amy lost 4 eyeshadow colors (since each palette has 4 colors).

Now, Amy has 26 - 4 = 22 eyeshadow colors left.

Amy then uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. Since each makeup set has 6 eyeshadow colors, half of that is 6 / 2 = 3 eyeshadow colors.

So, Amy uses up 3 eyeshadow colors from the makeup set.

Now, Amy has 22 - 3 = 19 eyeshadow colors left.

The final answer is: 19"
"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we first need to determine the height of the two-story house and the first floor.

Mattison's height is 60 inches. The house is 7 times as high as he is, so the total height of the house is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.

The first floor's floor to ceiling height is thrice as high as Mattison, so it is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

Since the house is two stories high, the height of the second floor is the total height of the house minus the height of the first floor: 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

The height of the roof from the second floor's floor is the same as the height of the first floor, which is 180 inches.

The height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 180 inches."
"To find the number of shells found by team Alphas, we need to calculate 40% of 700. 

40% of 700 = 0.4 * 700 = 280 shells.

Now, we need to find the number of shells remaining after team Alphas found their share. 

Remaining shells = Total shells - Shells found by Alphas
= 700 - 280
= 420 shells.

Next, we need to find the number of shells found by team The finders, which is 60% of the remaining shells.

60% of 420 = 0.6 * 420 = 252 shells.

Now, we need to find the number of shells found by team Gogetters. This is the remaining shells after team The finders found their share.

Shells found by Gogetters = Remaining shells - Shells found by The finders
= 420 - 252
= 168 shells.

The final answer is: 168"
"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we first need to calculate the total miles all the dogs need to walk in a day. Since there are 4 dogs and they need to walk an average of 3 miles per day, the total miles they need to walk is 4 * 3 = 12 miles.

Now, let's add up the miles the first three dogs need to walk: 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles.

To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the miles the first three dogs need to walk from the total miles: 12 - 8 = 4 miles.

The last dog needs to walk 4 miles."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount John borrowed and then subtract the amount he used to pay off his debts.

First, let's calculate the amount John borrowed. He borrowed 40% of the value of his house, which is $250,000. 

40% of $250,000 = 0.4 * $250,000 = $100,000

Next, let's calculate the amount he used to pay off his debts. He used 60% of the loan amount, which is $100,000.

60% of $100,000 = 0.6 * $100,000 = $60,000

Now, let's calculate the amount he had leftover after paying off his debts. This is the amount he borrowed minus the amount he used to pay off his debts.

Amount leftover = Amount borrowed - Amount used to pay off debts
= $100,000 - $60,000
= $40,000

The final answer is: $40,000"
"To find the total earnings, we need to calculate the total weight of the tunas first. 

The total weight of the tunas is the sum of the weights of the three tunas: 
56 kg + 46 kg + 26 kg = 128 kg

Since a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, the total earnings can be calculated by multiplying the total weight by the cost per kilogram:
128 kg * $0.50/kg = $64

The final answer is: $64"
"To find Trinity's profit, we need to first find the selling price of the magazines. 

The cost price of the magazines is $72. Trinity sells the magazines at 11/8 of the cost price. 

To find the selling price, we multiply the cost price by 11/8:
Selling price = (11/8) * 72
Selling price = (11 * 72) / 8
Selling price = 792 / 8
Selling price = 99

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the cost price from the selling price:
Profit = Selling price - Cost price
Profit = 99 - 72
Profit = 27

The final answer is: $27"
"To find the total amount of water removed, we need to calculate the amount of water removed by each setting and then add them together.

The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed by the low setting is 1 * 3 = 3 liters.

The medium setting removes twice as much water as the low setting, which is 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed by the medium setting is 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

The high setting removes twice as much water as the medium setting, which is 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 5 days, the total amount of water removed by the high setting is 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

Now, we add the total amount of water removed by each setting: 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

The final answer is: 29"
"To find out how many balloons were thrown, we need to first calculate the total number of balloons Jolene and her friends had initially. Since they filled up 10 packs of balloons with 30 balloons per pack, the total number of balloons is 10 * 30 = 300.

Since 12 balloons were left by the end of the afternoon, we subtract this from the total number of balloons to find out how many were thrown. So, 300 - 12 = 288.

The final answer is: 288"
"To find the total amount of the second medicine, we need to calculate 3 times the amount of the first medicine. 

The first medicine is 14 mL, so 3 times that amount is 3 * 14 = 42 mL.

Now, we need to find the total amount of both medicines in one dose. The first medicine is 14 mL, and the second medicine is 42 mL, so the total amount in one dose is 14 + 42 = 56 mL.

To find the total amount in 8 doses, we multiply the amount in one dose by 8. 

56 mL * 8 = 448 mL.

The final answer is: 448"
"To find the combined capacity of both schools, we first need to determine the capacity of John's school. 

Since each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, we can find the capacity of one of John's classes by multiplying Ali's class capacity by 1/8.

Capacity of one of John's classes = 120 * (1/8) = 15

Since John has two classes, we multiply the capacity of one class by 2 to find the total capacity of John's school.

Capacity of John's school = 15 * 2 = 30

Now, we add the capacity of Ali's school (which is 120) to the capacity of John's school to find the combined capacity of both schools.

Combined capacity = 120 + 30 = 150

The final answer is: 150"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total interest Stephen owes his sister. 

First, let's find the total interest he owes. The interest is 2% of $300, which is 0.02 * 300 = $6.

Now, Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, so the total amount he pays in the first 11 months is 25 * 11 = $275.

The remaining amount, including the interest, will be paid in the twelfth month. This remaining amount is the initial loan plus the interest minus the total paid in the first 11 months: 300 + 6 - 275 = $31.

However, this is not the total amount he will pay in the twelfth month. He still owes the $31, but he will also pay the $25 that he was paying each month. So, the total amount he will pay in the twelfth month is 31 + 25 = $56.

The final answer is: $56"
"To find out how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we need to first calculate the total number of diaper changes required for both children. Since each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, the total number of diaper changes for both children is 2 * 5 = 10.

Since Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, she changes 10 / 2 = 5 diapers per day. 

To find out how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we subtract the number of diapers his wife changes from the total number of diaper changes required. So, Jordan changes 10 - 5 = 5 diapers per day.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total number of jelly beans in the jar, we first need to calculate the volume of the jar. The jar has a square base with a side length of 6 inches and a height of 15 inches. The volume of a rectangular prism (such as the jar) is given by the formula V = lwh, where l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height.

Given that the base is square, the length and width are the same, so we can use the formula V = s^2h, where s is the side length of the square base.

V = s^2h
V = 6^2 * 15
V = 36 * 15
V = 540 cubic inches

Since the jelly beans have an efficiency of 80%, we need to divide the volume of the jar by 0.8 to get the effective volume.

Effective volume = 540 / 0.8
Effective volume = 675 cubic inches

Since each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, we can divide the effective volume by the volume of a single jelly bean to get the total number of jelly beans.

Total jelly beans = Effective volume / Volume of a single jelly bean
Total jelly beans = 675 / 0.15
Total jelly beans = 4500

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we can multiply the total number of jelly beans by 0.3 to get the number of red jelly beans.

Number of red jelly beans = Total jelly beans * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 4500 * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 1350

However, we are given that the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find out how far off Tim's guess was, we need to know what his guess was. Since we don't have that information, we can't calculate the exact difference."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, the bus had 20 people. 

At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus became 20 + 40 = 60.

At the second stop, 3/4 of the people who entered at the first stop entered the bus. Since 40 people entered at the first stop, 3/4 * 40 = 30 people entered at the second stop. So, the total number of people on the bus became 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus became 2 * 90 = 180.

The bus has a capacity of 200 people. To find the remaining spaces, we subtract the current number of people from the capacity: 200 - 180 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of Pauline's visits over the 8 years. 

First, let's calculate the cost of the visits for the first 5 years. Since the cost of one visit is $2, the total cost for 5 years is 5 * 2 = $10.

Now, the cost of one visit has increased by 150%. This means the new cost of one visit is 2 + (2 * 1.5) = $5.

For the next 3 years, Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year, so the total number of visits is 3 * 3 = 9. The total cost for these 9 visits is 9 * 5 = $45.

The total cost for all 8 years is the sum of the cost for the first 5 years and the cost for the next 3 years: 10 + 45 = $55.

The final numerical answer is: $55"
"To find out how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to determine the total number of groups required and then multiply that by the time it takes for each group to try the escape room.

There are 4 grades (4-7) with 10 students in each grade, so the total number of students is 4 * 10 = 40.

Since only the top 10 students in each grade get to try the escape room, we need to find the total number of students who will try the escape room. Since there are 4 grades, we need to find the total number of students who will try the escape room in each grade, which is 10 students per grade. So, the total number of students who will try the escape room is 4 * 10 = 40.

However, since only 8 students can try the escape room at a time, we need to divide the total number of students who will try the escape room by 8 to find the total number of groups required. 

40 / 8 = 5

Since each group takes 45 minutes to try the escape room, we multiply the number of groups by the time it takes for each group to try the escape room.

5 * 45 = 225

The final answer is: 225"
"To find out how much Ali has to pay John, we need to calculate the total cost of the wooden tables and the roof frames separately and then add them together.

The cost of the wooden tables is 4 tables * $20 per table = $80.
The cost of the roof frames is 2 frames * $10 per frame = $20.

Now, we add the cost of the tables and the roof frames together: $80 + $20 = $100.

The final numerical answer is: $100"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as 'x'. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length can be represented as 4x.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, and it is divided into two pieces. Therefore, the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is equal to 40 feet. We can write this as an equation:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Now, divide both sides by 5 to solve for x:

x = 8

Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length is 4x:

Longer piece = 4x = 4(8) = 32 feet

The final answer is: 32"
"To determine how much seasoning Aiden will need, we first need to find out how many pounds of ground beef he will use. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat and he wants to make 80 meatballs, we can divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound to find the total pounds of meat needed.

Total meatballs = 80
Meatballs per pound = 16

Total pounds of meat = Total meatballs / Meatballs per pound
Total pounds of meat = 80 / 16
Total pounds of meat = 5

Since Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat, we can multiply the total pounds of meat by the amount of seasoning per pound to find the total amount of seasoning needed.

Total pounds of meat = 5
Seasoning per pound = 2 tablespoons

Total seasoning needed = Total pounds of meat * Seasoning per pound
Total seasoning needed = 5 * 2
Total seasoning needed = 10

"To find the total width of the windows, we need to multiply the width of one window by the total number of windows. 

Width of one window: 35 inches
Number of windows: 5

Total width of windows = 35 inches/window * 5 windows = 175 inches

Since Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, we multiply the total width by 2.

Fabric needed = 2 * 175 inches = 350 inches

"To find the total inches of rain on Tuesday, we first need to calculate the amount of rain that fell on Monday, which is given as 2 inches. 

Next, we need to find twice the total amount of rain that fell on Monday. Twice of 2 inches is 2 * 2 = 4 inches.

It is expected to rain 1 more inch than twice of Monday's total, so we add 1 inch to the result from the previous step. 4 + 1 = 5 inches.

Therefore, the total amount of rain expected on Tuesday is 5 inches.

"Let's break down the information given. Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. If we let the number of cupcakes be 'c', then the number of brownies is 3c - 2.

We know that each person gets 2 treats, and there are 5 people in the class. So, the total number of treats is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, which is c + (3c - 2). We can set up the equation: c + (3c - 2) = 10.

Combine like terms: 4c - 2 = 10.

Add 2 to both sides: 4c = 12.

Divide by 4: c = 3.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the 20% discount. 

The original cost of both manicure and pedicure is $35 + $40 = $75. 

The 20% discount on $75 is 0.20 * $75 = $15. 

So, the discounted cost of both manicure and pedicure is $75 - $15 = $60.

Since Karen wants to add nail art on each of her fingers, and there are 10 fingers in total (5 on each hand), the cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost for Karen would be the discounted cost of manicure and pedicure plus the cost of nail art, which is $60 + $30 = $90.

"To find the total number of magazines Susan receives each year, we need to calculate the number of issues from each magazine and add them up.

The first 3 magazines send 12 issues a year, so that's 3 * 12 = 36 issues.

The second magazine sends 6 issues a year.

The third magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, which is 4 * 6 = 24 issues.

Now, let's add up the total number of issues: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

So, Susan receives 66 magazines every year.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given. We know that Samantha has 27 paintings and that she has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley. 

Let's represent the number of paintings Shelley has as 'x'. Since Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, we can write an equation: x - 12 = 27. 

To solve for x, we add 12 to both sides of the equation: x = 27 + 12. 

x = 39

Now that we know Shelley has 39 paintings, we can find out how many paintings Kim has. We know that Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, so we can write another equation: x - 8 = y, where y is the number of paintings Kim has. 

Substituting the value of x, we get 39 - 8 = y.

y = 31

"To find the price of the toy after the discount in January, we need to follow the given changes in price.

Initially, the price of the toy was $40.

In December, the price increased by 80%. To find the new price, we multiply the initial price by 1.8 (100% + 80% = 180%, or 1 + 0.8 = 1.8).

New price in December = $40 * 1.8 = $72

In January, the price decreased by 50%. To find the new price, we multiply the price in December by 0.5 (100% - 50% = 50%, or 1 - 0.5 = 0.5).

New price in January = $72 * 0.5 = $36

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"To find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to calculate the amount he earns from the standard rate lessons and the reduced rate lessons separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the amount he earns from the standard rate lessons. He has 4 lessons at the standard rate of $80 per hour. So, the total amount from standard rate lessons is 4 * $80 = $320.

Next, let's calculate the amount he earns from the reduced rate lessons. He has 2 lessons at the reduced rate, which is 25% less than the standard rate. To find the reduced rate, we need to calculate 25% of $80 and subtract it from $80. 25% of $80 is 0.25 * $80 = $20. So, the reduced rate is $80 - $20 = $60 per hour. The total amount from reduced rate lessons is 2 * $60 = $120.

Now, let's add the amounts from the standard rate lessons and the reduced rate lessons to find the total amount Charlie will make for the day. $320 + $120 = $440.

The final answer is: $440"
"To find the mean score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the total number of scores.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many pomelos Eve gave away. Let's start by identifying the information given:

- Eve originally had 20 pieces of pomelos.
- After giving some away, she is left with 1/4 of the pomelos she originally had.

Since Eve is left with 1/4 of the original amount, we can set up an equation to find out how many pomelos she gave away. Let's denote the number of pomelos she gave away as 'x'. 

The equation can be set up as follows:

Original amount - Given away = Remaining amount
20 - x = (1/4) * 20

Simplifying the equation:
20 - x = 5

To find the value of 'x', we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Subtract 20 from both sides:
-x = 5 - 20
-x = -15

Multiply both sides by -1 to solve for 'x':
x = 15

So, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

"To find the total amount of money Walter received, we need to calculate the number of apples he had left after eating and giving some to his sister, and then multiply that by the price per apple.

First, Walter ate 2/5 of the 60 apples. To find 2/5 of 60, we multiply 60 by 2 and divide by 5:

60 * 2 = 120
120 / 5 = 24

So, Walter ate 24 apples. Now, we subtract 24 from the total number of apples to find the remaining number:

60 - 24 = 36

Walter then gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples. To find 25% of 36, we multiply 36 by 0.25:

36 * 0.25 = 9

So, Walter gave his sister 9 apples. Now, we subtract 9 from the remaining number to find the number of apples he had left:

36 - 9 = 27

Walter sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. To find the total amount of money he received, we multiply the number of apples by the price per apple:

27 * 3 = 81

"To find the total number of novels Regina wrote this year, we need to determine the total number of novels she wrote last year and then multiply it by 4 (since 3 quarters is equivalent to 3/4, and to find the whole, we multiply by 4/3).

Let's start by using the information given: Regina wrote 9 novels last year, which is 3 quarters of the number of novels she wrote this year. 

Let x be the total number of novels Regina wrote this year. 

We can set up the equation: 9 = (3/4)x

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 4/3 to isolate x:

x = 9 * (4/3)
x = 12

So, Regina wrote 12 novels this year.

"To find the distance covered by Michael in 3 days, we need to calculate the total distance he travels in that time. 

First, we need to find the total hours in 3 days. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3 days is 3 * 24 = 72 hours.

Now, we can multiply the average speed by the total hours to find the total distance traveled. 

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 50 km/hr * 72 hr
Distance = 3600 km

Now, we can find the percentage of the distance covered by dividing the distance traveled by the total distance between Alaska and Texas and multiplying by 100.

Percentage = (Distance Traveled / Total Distance) * 100
Percentage = (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100
Percentage = 0.6 * 100
Percentage = 60%

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many grapes were used by Madeline's brother and her mother, and then subtract that from the total number of grapes Madeline ate.

Madeline ate 6 grapes. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, so he used 6 * 5 = 30 grapes.

The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie requires 12 grapes. So, the total number of grapes used by her mother is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.

The total number of grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and her mother is 36 + 48 = 84 grapes.

To find the initial number of grapes, we need to add the grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and her mother to the grapes used by her mother to make the pies. However, since the grapes used by her mother are already included in the total, we only need to add the grapes used by Madeline and her brother. The initial number of grapes is 84 + 36 = 120 grapes.

The custodian has 5 days to clean the classrooms. We need to find out how many minutes they have to clean in total. Since they work 8 hours a day, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, they work 8 * 60 = 480 minutes per day.

In 5 days, they work a total of 5 * 480 = 2400 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how many minutes they spend cleaning per classroom. It takes them 15 minutes per classroom.

To find the total time spent cleaning, we multiply the number of classrooms by the time spent per classroom: 80 * 15 = 1200 minutes.

Now, we need to find the percentage of their day spent cleaning. To do this, we divide the total time spent cleaning by the total time available and multiply by 100: (1200 / 2400) * 100 = 50%.

"To solve this problem, let's first determine the capacity of each shelf. 

Let's denote the capacity of a middle shelf as 'x'. Since the bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, its capacity is 2x. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so its capacity is 2x - 5.

We know that each of the middle shelves can hold 10 books. Therefore, x = 10.

Now, we can calculate the capacity of the bottom and top shelves:
- Bottom shelf: 2x = 2 * 10 = 20 books
- Top shelf: 2x - 5 = 2 * 10 - 5 = 15 books

The total capacity of the three shelves is 10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55 books.

Since Elly has 110 books, she will need more than one bookcase to hold all of them. Let's calculate how many bookcases she needs.

Each bookcase has three shelves, so its total capacity is 55 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase: 110 / 55 = 2.

However, since 2 * 55 = 110, Elly can hold all her books in two bookcases.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find Rose's profit, we first need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

The cost of 5 dozens of eggs is 5 * $2.40 = $12.

Since 1 dozen has 12 eggs, 5 dozens will have 5 * 12 = 60 eggs.

Rose will sell each egg for $1, so the total revenue will be 60 * $1 = $60.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $60 - $12 = $48.

The final answer is: $48"
"To find the number of white hats, we first need to determine the number of red and blue hats. 

Half of the hats are red, so the number of red hats is 100 * 0.5 = 50.

The remaining hats are 100 - 50 = 50. 

3/5 of the remaining hats are blue, so the number of blue hats is 50 * (3/5) = 30.

The rest of the hats are white, so the number of white hats is 50 - 30 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the cost of each stick of jerky, we need to first calculate the total cost of the bag after the discount. 

The original price of the bag is $18.00, and there's a $3.00 discount. 

$18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

Since the bag contains 30 sticks of jerky, we need to divide the discounted price by the number of sticks to find the cost per stick.

$15.00 ÷ 30 = $0.50

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100.

$0.50 * 100 = 50 cents

The final answer is: 50"
"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to find out how many questions she needs to get right in total to pass. 

Since she needs to get 70% of the total questions correct, and the total number of questions is the sum of the questions in both tests, we need to calculate the total number of questions first. The first test has 70 questions and the second test has 40 questions, so the total number of questions is 70 + 40 = 110.

Now, we can find out how many questions she needs to get right in total. 70% of 110 is 0.7 * 110 = 77 questions.

We already know that she got 60% of the first test correct, which is 0.6 * 70 = 42 questions. 

To find out how many questions she needs to get right on the second test, we subtract the number of questions she got right on the first test from the total number of questions she needs to get right. So, 77 - 42 = 35.

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as 's' and the number of blueberry cubes as 'b'. We know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so we can write the equation:

s + b = 116

We also know that the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, so we can write another equation:

b = 5s - 4

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for 's':

s + (5s - 4) = 116

Combine like terms:

6s - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides:

6s = 120

Divide both sides by 6:

s = 20

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting 's' into the second equation:

b = 5(20) - 4
b = 100 - 4
b = 96

The final answer is: 96"
"To find the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years, we need to calculate the total number of games she has played and then multiply it by her score per game.

Ara has been playing 40 games every year for 4 years. So, the total number of games she has played is:
40 games/year * 4 years = 160 games

Since her score for every game is 21 points, we can multiply the total number of games by her score per game to find the total points:
160 games * 21 points/game = 3360 points

The final answer is: 3360"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Brendan had 10 marbles.

He dropped half of them, so he lost 10 / 2 = 5 marbles.

He found 3 marbles, but one of them was a bead, so he got rid of it. This means he was left with 3 - 1 = 2 marbles from the ones he found.

Now, let's add the marbles he found to the marbles he didn't lose. He had 5 marbles left after dropping some, and he found 2 more. So, he had 5 + 2 = 7 marbles.

However, we also need to consider the marbles he didn't drop. He had 10 marbles initially and dropped half of them, which is 5. So, he still has 10 - 5 = 5 marbles that he didn't drop.

Now, let's add the marbles he didn't drop to the marbles he found. He had 5 marbles that he didn't drop and 2 marbles he found, so he had 5 + 2 = 7 marbles.

Therefore, Brendan ended up with 7 marbles.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of flashlights and the number of candles separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of flashlights. There are 4 people in the family, and each person has a flashlight. So, the total number of flashlights is 4.

Next, let's calculate the number of candles. There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. 

Half of 8 rooms is 4 rooms. So, 4 rooms have 4 small candles each, which is 4 * 4 = 16 small candles. The other 4 rooms have 5 medium candles each, which is 4 * 5 = 20 medium candles. 

The total number of candles is 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles.

Now, let's add the number of flashlights and candles together. The total number of candles and flashlights is 4 (flashlights) + 36 (candles) = 40.

"To find the total time it takes to solve the Rubik's cube, we need to calculate the time taken for each side and add them up.

The first side takes 5 minutes. 
The second and third sides each take twice that long, so 2 * 5 = 10 minutes each. 
The last two sides each take half as long as the first, so 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes each.

Now, let's add up the time for all sides: 
5 (first side) + 10 (second side) + 10 (third side) + 2.5 (fourth side) + 2.5 (fifth side) = 30 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time it takes for Phineas to cover the distance on land and in water separately, and then add them together.

Since Phineas needs to cover 200 yards, and half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, we can calculate the distance for each as follows:

Distance on land = 200 yards / 2 = 100 yards
Distance in water = 200 yards / 2 = 100 yards

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for Phineas to cover each distance:

Time on land = Distance on land / Speed on land = 100 yards / 20 yards/minute = 5 minutes
Time in water = Distance in water / Speed in water = 100 yards / 10 yards/minute = 10 minutes

Total time = Time on land + Time in water = 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes

"To find the total cost of the phone plan, we need to determine the cost of the additional phones and add it to the cost of the main phone.

Let's assume the cost of each additional phone is x. Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of the main phone is 2x.

We know that the main phone costs $20, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 20

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 20 / 2
x = 10

Now that we know the cost of each additional phone is $10, we can find the total cost of the additional phones. There are 4 additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is:

4x = 4 * 10
4x = 40

The total cost of the phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones:

Total cost = 20 + 40
Total cost = 60

"To find out how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to calculate the total number of doughnuts he sells in a day and then multiply it by the number of days in June.

Since Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day, and 1 dozen is equal to 12, we can calculate the total number of doughnuts he makes in a day as follows:

10 dozen * 12 doughnuts/dozen = 120 doughnuts/day

Since Derrick sells all the doughnuts, we can assume he sells 120 doughnuts every day.

Now, let's calculate the total number of days in June. June has 30 days.

To find the total number of doughnuts Derrick sells in June, we multiply the number of doughnuts he sells in a day by the number of days in June:

"To find the total cost of dry-cleaning, we need to calculate the cost for each item and then multiply it by the number of weeks.

The cost for blouses is $5.00 per blouse, and Alicia has 5 blouses. So, the weekly cost for blouses is 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

The cost for the skirt is $6.00, and Alicia has 1 skirt. So, the weekly cost for the skirt is $6.00.

The cost for pants is $8.00 per pair, and Alicia has 2 pants. So, the weekly cost for pants is 2 * $8.00 = $16.00.

Now, let's add up the weekly cost for all items: $25.00 (blouses) + $6.00 (skirt) + $16.00 (pants) = $47.00 per week.

To find the total cost for 5 weeks, we multiply the weekly cost by 5: $47.00 * 5 = $235.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find John's new speaking speed after training. 

His original speed is 150 WPM (words per minute). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster, so we multiply his original speed by 2.5:

New speed = 150 WPM * 2.5 = 375 WPM

Now, we need to find the total number of words in 10 pages, each with 450 words per page:

Total words = 10 pages * 450 words/page = 4500 words

To find the time it takes to speak 4500 words at 375 WPM, we divide the total number of words by the new speed:

"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the total number of people he saw on the first three days and add it to the total number of people he saw on the remaining days.

On the first day, Conor saw 50 people.

On the second day, there were 20 more people than on the first day, so the number of people on the second day is 50 + 20 = 70.

On the third day, the number of people was twice the number on the second day, so the number of people on the third day is 2 * 70 = 140.

The total number of people on the first three days is 50 + 70 + 140 = 260.

Since there are 7 days in a week, and Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the remaining 4 days, the total number of people he saw on the remaining days is 60 * 4 = 240.

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 260 + 240 = 500.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop. 

In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount pop, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.

In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increases to four times the initial rate, which is 4 * 20 = 80 kernels.

In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slows down to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, which is 0.5 * 80 = 40 kernels.

So, the total number of kernels popped in the first 120 seconds is 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 kernels.

After Garrett takes the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat. This is 0.25 * 40 = 10 kernels.

The total number of kernels that popped is 200 + 10 = 210 kernels.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of lemonade Tim needs to make, including the extra gallon for Allen. Since Tim needs to make 4 gallons of regular lemonade and 1 extra gallon that is twice as tart, we can consider the extra gallon as 2 gallons of regular lemonade. 

So, in total, Tim needs to make 4 + 2 = 6 gallons of lemonade. 

Since each gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice, and 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we need to calculate the total amount of juice required for 6 gallons of lemonade. 

6 gallons * 1 cup/gallon = 6 cups of lemon juice

Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we need to find out how many lemons are required to yield 6 cups of juice. 

6 cups / 1 cup/6 lemons = 6 * 6 = 36 lemons

Therefore, Tim will need 36 lemons.

"To find the total amount of dog food needed in a week, we need to calculate the daily consumption of both breeds and then multiply it by 7.

The German Shepherds consume 5 kilograms each per day, and there are 3 of them. So, their daily consumption is 5 * 3 = 15 kilograms.

The Bulldogs consume 3 kilograms each per day, and there are 2 of them. So, their daily consumption is 3 * 2 = 6 kilograms.

The total daily consumption is the sum of the consumption of both breeds: 15 + 6 = 21 kilograms.

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7: 21 * 7 = 147 kilograms.

Therefore, the Kennel house will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by Elvis in both directions and then find the remaining distance from his house.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled in the west direction. Distance = Speed * Time. Since Elvis traveled for 5 hours at 18mph, the distance traveled in the west direction is:

Distance = 18mph * 5 hours = 90 miles

Now, Elvis turns around and travels east for 8 hours at the same speed of 18mph. The distance traveled in the east direction is:

Distance = 18mph * 8 hours = 144 miles

Since Elvis traveled 90 miles in the west direction and 144 miles in the east direction, the net distance from his house is the difference between the two distances:

Net distance = Distance traveled east - Distance traveled west
Net distance = 144 miles - 90 miles
Net distance = 54 miles

Avery needs 12 dinner plates, and each costs $6.00, so the total cost of dinner plates is 12 x $6.00 = $72.00.

She also needs 12 bowls, and each costs $5.00, so the total cost of bowls is 12 x $5.00 = $60.00.

For the salad plates, she needs 12 as well, and each costs $4.00, so the total cost of salad plates is 12 x $4.00 = $48.00.

To find the total cost of the place settings, we add the costs of the dinner plates, bowls, and salad plates together: $72.00 + $60.00 + $48.00 = $180.00.

"To find out how much feed is left after a week, we first need to calculate how much feed the pigs eat in a day and then multiply it by 7 to get the weekly consumption.

Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, so the total feed consumed by one pig in a day is 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.

Since Dexter has 5 pigs, the total feed consumed by all pigs in a day is 8 * 5 = 40 pounds.

Now, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 to get the weekly consumption: 40 * 7 = 280 pounds.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, so to find out how much is left, we subtract the weekly consumption from the total ordered: 300 - 280 = 20 pounds.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how many hot dogs John needs to buy, we first need to determine the total number of hot dogs required for the party. Since each guest will eat 2 hot dogs and there are 20 guests, the total number of hot dogs needed is 20 * 2 = 40.

However, John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party. So, the total number of hot dogs he needs to buy is 40 - 4 = 36.

Since a pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs and costs $2, we need to find out how many packs John needs to buy. To do this, we divide the total number of hot dogs he needs to buy (36) by the number of hot dogs in a pack (6). 

36 / 6 = 6

Since John needs to buy 6 packs of hot dogs, and each pack costs $2, the total amount he needs to spend is 6 * 2 = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To find out how much money Frances has left, we need to calculate her total earnings and subtract her total expenses.

First, let's calculate her total earnings from selling cupcakes and cookies. She sells 20 cupcakes at $2 each, so her earnings from cupcakes are 20 x $2 = $40. She sells 40 cookies at $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are 40 x $1 = $40. Her total earnings are $40 + $40 = $80.

Next, let's calculate her total expenses. She buys 5 trays at $4 each, so her total expenses are 5 x $4 = $20.

Now, let's subtract her total expenses from her total earnings to find out how much money she has left. $80 - $20 = $60.

The final answer is: $60"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there are 5 children following the truck.

On the second street, each of the 5 children is joined by another child, so the total number of children becomes 5 + 5 = 10.

On the third street, each of the 10 children is joined by another 2 children, so the total number of children becomes 10 + (10 * 2) = 10 + 20 = 30.

The original 5 children then give up and leave the group, so we subtract 5 from the total number of children: 30 - 5 = 25.

Therefore, there are 25 children now following the truck.

"To find the total time spent on meditation and yoga, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity separately and then add them together.

Meditation time per day: 15 minutes (morning) + 15 minutes (night) = 30 minutes
Since Charisma practices meditation every day, we multiply the daily meditation time by 7 (days in a week) and then by 4 (weeks):
30 minutes/day * 7 days/week = 210 minutes/week
210 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 840 minutes

Yoga time per week: 1 hour (60 minutes) * 5 days/week = 300 minutes/week
Since we want to know the total time spent in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly yoga time by 4:
300 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 1200 minutes

Total time spent on meditation and yoga in 4 weeks: 840 minutes (meditation) + 1200 minutes (yoga) = 2040 minutes

"To find the total number of seeds, we first need to determine the number of seeds in a large sunflower. Since a small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds, we need to convert the dozen to a numerical value. 

1 dozen is equal to 12. Therefore, 3 dozen is equal to 3 * 12 = 36 seeds.

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36, we multiply 36 by 0.5, which equals 18. 

Now, we add the 50% more seeds to the original 36 seeds: 36 + 18 = 54 seeds in a large sunflower.

To find the total number of seeds, we add the seeds from the small sunflower (36) and the large sunflower (54): 36 + 54 = 90 seeds.

Timothy's pens = 3 * George's pens
Timothy's pens = 3 * 18
Timothy's pens = 54

Next, we need to find out how many pens Sarah has. Since Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, we can calculate Sarah's pens as follows:

Sarah's pens = 0.5 * Timothy's pens
Sarah's pens = 0.5 * 54
Sarah's pens = 27

"To find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. The original price of each T-shirt is $8. Since Jake buys 2 T-shirts, the total cost of the T-shirts without the discount is 2 * $8 = $16. However, Jake gets a buy one get one 50% off deal, which means one of the T-shirts is 50% off. So, the cost of the first T-shirt is $8, and the cost of the second T-shirt is $8 * 0.5 = $4. The total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and Jake gets a 40% discount. The discount amount is $40 * 0.4 = $16. So, the cost of the shoes is $40 - $16 = $24.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. We know that Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, but Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron. This means that if Aaron runs a certain distance in a certain time, Vanessa will run twice that distance in the same time.

Let's denote the time it takes Aaron to run 1 mile as 't'. Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, the time it takes Vanessa to run 1 mile is 2t.

We are given that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, and since he runs twice as fast as Vanessa, the distance he ran is half of the distance Vanessa ran. Vanessa ran 4 miles, so Aaron ran 4/2 = 2 miles.

Since Aaron runs 2 miles in 16 minutes, the time it takes him to run 1 mile is 16/2 = 8 minutes. This means that t = 8 minutes.

Now, we know that Vanessa runs 2t miles in the same time it takes Aaron to run 1 mile. Since t = 8 minutes, Vanessa runs 2t = 2(8) = 16 minutes to run 1 mile.

However, Vanessa ran 4 miles, so the total time it took her to complete her part of the race is 4 * 16 = 64 minutes.

First, let's calculate the daily revenue. They get 6 reservations a night, and each reservation includes 2 meals that cost $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine. 

Daily revenue = (6 reservations * 2 meals * $5) + (6 reservations * $5)
Daily revenue = (6 * 2 * $5) + (6 * $5)
Daily revenue = $60 + $30
Daily revenue = $90

Since they are open 2 days a week, we multiply the daily revenue by 2.

"To find the cost price of each watermelon, we first need to find the total cost of the watermelons. The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80, so the cost price of each watermelon can be found by dividing the total cost by the number of watermelons.

Cost price of 50 watermelons = $80
Cost price of 1 watermelon = $80 / 50
Cost price of 1 watermelon = $1.60

Now, we need to find the selling price of each watermelon. The vendor sold the watermelons at a profit of 25%. To find the selling price, we need to add 25% of the cost price to the cost price.

Profit percentage = 25%
Profit = 25% of $1.60
Profit = 0.25 * $1.60

"To solve this problem, we need to find the current age of James and then determine the age of John's youngest son.

First, let's find James' current age. We know that James is twice as old as Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years. This means that James is twice as old as 12 - 3 = 9 years old. So, James is 9 * 2 = 18 years old.

Since James is 18 years old and John had him when he was 19, John is currently 19 + 18 = 37 years old.

Now, we need to find the age of John's youngest son. We know that John's youngest son was born when John was 32. Since John is currently 37, his youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years old.

"To find the total cost Mark paid, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator and the labor cost.

First, let's find the cost of the radiator. The original price is $400, but Mark gets it for 80% off. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by 0.8 (which is the same as 80%).
 
$400 * 0.8 = $320

So, Mark pays $320 for the radiator.

Next, we need to find the labor cost. The mechanic works for 3 hours at $50 an hour. To find the total labor cost, we multiply the number of hours by the hourly rate.

3 hours * $50/hour = $150

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the labor cost to find the total amount Mark paid.

$320 (radiator) + $150 (labor) = $470

The final answer is: $470"
"Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as W. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write the equation:

C + W = 20

We also know that the total number of legs is 70. Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, so we can write the equation:

2C + 4W = 70

We can solve this system of equations by multiplying the first equation by 2 to get:

2C + 2W = 40

Now, we can subtract this equation from the second equation to get:

2C + 4W - (2C + 2W) = 70 - 40
2W = 30

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

W = 15

Now that we know the number of cows, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find the number of chickens:

C + 15 = 20
C = 5

So, there are 5 chickens on Farmer Brown's farm.
