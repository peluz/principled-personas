"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to determine the number of eggs she sells and multiply it by the price per egg.

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast and bakes 4 for muffins, so she uses a total of 3 + 4 = 7 eggs.

To find the number of eggs she sells, we subtract the number of eggs used from the total number of eggs laid: 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.

Janet sells each egg for $2, so the total amount she makes at the farmers' market is 9 eggs * $2/egg = $18.

The final answer is: $18"
"To find the total number of bolts required for the robe, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber first. Since it's half the amount of blue fiber, and there are 2 bolts of blue fiber, we can calculate the white fiber as follows:

White fiber = 2 bolts (blue fiber) / 2 = 1 bolt

Now, we add the blue fiber and white fiber to get the total number of bolts:

Total bolts = 2 bolts (blue fiber) + 1 bolt (white fiber) = 3 bolts

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the profit Josh made, we first need to determine the total value of the house after the repairs. 

The original value of the house was $80,000. Josh put in $50,000 in repairs, which increased the value of the house by 150%. 

Let's denote the increased value as x. We can set up the equation: 80,000 + 50,000 = 1.5x, where 1.5 is the multiplier for a 150% increase.

Simplifying the equation, we get 130,000 = 1.5x.

To find x, we divide both sides by 1.5: x = 130,000 / 1.5 = 86,667.

So, the total value of the house after the repairs is $86,667.

To find the profit, we subtract the initial cost of the house and the repairs from the total value: 86,667 - 80,000 - 50,000 = -43,333.

However, since Josh spent $50,000 on repairs, we need to consider the initial cost of the house as the only initial investment. Therefore, the profit is the difference between the total value and the initial cost of the house: 86,667 - 80,000 = 6,667.

The final answer is: $6,667."
"To find the total number of meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total meters he runs in one sprint session and then multiply it by the number of sessions he has in a week.

Since James runs 3 sprints in one session, and each sprint is 60 meters, the total meters he runs in one session is 3 * 60 = 180 meters.

Since James runs 3 times a week, the total meters he runs in a week is 180 * 3 = 540 meters.

The final answer is: 540"
"To determine the total amount of feed needed for the final meal, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed given to the chickens throughout the day. 

In the morning, Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups of feed. In the afternoon, she gives them another 25 cups of feed. The total amount of feed given so far is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

Since Wendi feeds each chicken 3 cups of feed per day, and she has 20 chickens, the total amount of feed needed per day is 3 * 20 = 60 cups.

To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we subtract the total amount of feed given so far from the total amount of feed needed per day: 60 - 40 = 20 cups.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining glasses. The first glass costs $5. 

The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3. 

The third glass costs 60% of $3, which is 0.6 * $3 = $1.8.

We can see that the cost of each subsequent glass is 60% of the previous glass's cost. This forms a geometric sequence with the first term a = $5 and the common ratio r = 0.6.

The total number of glasses Kylar wants to buy is 16. The first glass is the first term, and the remaining 15 glasses form an arithmetic sequence with a common ratio of 0.6.

To find the total cost, we can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series: S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.

However, since the first glass is not part of the geometric sequence, we need to add it separately. The sum of the geometric sequence is S = $5 * (1 - 0.6^15) / (1 - 0.6). 

First, let's calculate 0.6^15:
0.6^15 ≈ 0.00006103515625

Now, let's calculate the sum of the geometric sequence:
S ≈ $5 * (1 - 0.00006103515625) / (1 - 0.6)
S ≈ $5 * (0.99993896484375) / 0.4
S ≈ $5 * 2.49964246171875
S ≈ $12.49761230859375

Now, let's add the cost of the first glass to the sum of the geometric sequence:
Total cost ≈ $5 + $12.49761230859375
Total cost ≈ $17.49761230859375

Rounding to two decimal places, the total cost is approximately $17.50.

The final answer is: $17.50"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of sheep in Toulouse and Charleston first, and then add them to the number of sheep in Seattle.

Given that Seattle has 20 sheep, and Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, we can calculate the number of sheep in Charleston as follows:

Charleston = 4 * Seattle
Charleston = 4 * 20
Charleston = 80

Since Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, we can calculate the number of sheep in Toulouse as follows:

Toulouse = 2 * Charleston
Toulouse = 2 * 80
Toulouse = 160

Now, we can add the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle to find the total number of sheep:

Total = Toulouse + Charleston + Seattle
Total = 160 + 80 + 20
Total = 260

The final answer is: 260"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, let's calculate the time it takes to download the file without any interruptions. Carla can download 2 GB/minute, and the file is 200 GB. 

Time = Total size / Download speed
Time = 200 GB / 2 GB/minute
Time = 100 minutes

However, 40% of the way through the download is 0.4 * 200 GB = 80 GB. Carla downloads this portion in 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes. 

After the restart, Carla has to download the remaining 120 GB (200 GB - 80 GB). 

Time to download the remaining portion = 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes

The total time is the sum of the time it took to download the first 80 GB and the time it took to download the remaining 120 GB, plus the 20 minutes it took to install the updates.

Total time = 40 minutes + 60 minutes + 20 minutes
Total time = 120 minutes

The final answer is: 120"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance John travels to the point where he turns around, and the distance he travels back home.

First, let's calculate the distance John travels to the point where he turns around. He drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph. 

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 mph * 3 hours
Distance = 180 miles

Now, let's calculate the distance John travels back home. He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance during this time. Then, he drives for half an hour at a speed of 30 mph.

Distance covered in the last half hour = Speed * Time
Distance covered in the last half hour = 30 mph * 0.5 hours
Distance covered in the last half hour = 15 miles

The remaining time to cover the distance back home is 4 hours - 2 hours (standstill traffic) - 0.5 hours (driving at 30 mph) = 1.5 hours. During this time, he drives at a speed of 80 mph.

Distance covered in the remaining 1.5 hours = Speed * Time
Distance covered in the remaining 1.5 hours = 80 mph * 1.5 hours
Distance covered in the remaining 1.5 hours = 120 miles

Now, let's calculate the total distance John travels back home. He was 180 miles away from home when he turned around, and he covered 15 miles in the last half hour. The remaining distance to cover is 180 - 15 = 165 miles. He covers 120 miles in the remaining 1.5 hours, so the remaining distance to cover is 165 - 120 = 45 miles. 

However, he has 1 hour left to cover this remaining distance. 

Distance covered in the last hour = Speed * Time
Distance covered in the last hour = 80 mph * 1 hour
Distance covered in the last hour = 80 miles

Since he covered 80 miles in the last hour, he still has 45 - 80 = -35 miles left to cover. However, since distance cannot be negative, this means he has covered more distance than the remaining distance to home. 

The correct approach is to calculate the distance he covers in the last hour as 45 miles, since he has 45 miles left to cover and he drives at 80 mph for 1 hour.

Distance covered in the last hour = 45 miles

Now, let's calculate the total distance John travels back home. He covered 15 miles in the last half hour and 120 miles in the remaining 1.5 hours, and 45 miles in the last hour. 

Total distance traveled back home = 15 + 120 + 45
Total distance traveled back home = 180 miles

The total distance John is from home at the end of those 4 hours is the sum of the distance he traveled to the point where he turns around and the distance he traveled back home.

Total distance from home = Distance to the point where he turns around + Distance traveled back home
Total distance from home = 180 miles + 180 miles
Total distance from home = 360 miles

The final answer is: 360"
"To find Eliza's total earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately, then add them together.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings are:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours, she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours. Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, so her overtime rate is $10 * 1.2 = $12/hour. Her overtime earnings are:
5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Her total earnings for the week are:
$400 + $60 = $460

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and then sum them up.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, which is 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the downloads were reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which is 54. Then, we subtract this from the second month's downloads: 180 - 54 = 126 downloads.

Now, we add up the downloads for all three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The final answer is: 366"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts: 3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen will be 3 x $68 = $204.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes: 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen will be 2 x $80 = $160.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes: 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen will be 6 x $55 = $330.

Finally, we add the costs of all the pastries together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost is $694."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost for each year and find the break-even point.

Let's denote the number of years as 'n'. The total revenue for 'n' years is the number of lemons grown per year multiplied by the price per lemon, multiplied by the number of years. Since the tree grows 7 lemons per year, the total revenue is 7 * 1.5 * n = 10.5n.

The total cost for 'n' years is the cost of planting the tree plus the annual cost of watering and feeding the tree, multiplied by the number of years. The total cost is 90 + 3n.

To find the break-even point, we set the total revenue equal to the total cost and solve for 'n':

10.5n = 90 + 3n

Subtract 3n from both sides:

7.5n = 90

Divide both sides by 7.5:

n = 90 / 7.5
n = 12

So, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

n = 12"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume Melanie started with x vacuum cleaners.

At the green house, she sold a third of her vacuum cleaners, which is x/3.

At the red house, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners.

At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, which is (x - x/3 - 2)/2.

We know that after selling at all three houses, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the equation:

x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

To simplify the equation, let's first simplify the fraction (x - x/3 - 2)/2:

(x - x/3 - 2)/2 = (2x/3 - 6)/2 = x/3 - 3

Now, let's rewrite the equation:

x - x/3 - 2 - (x/3 - 3) = 5

Combine like terms:

x - 2x/3 - 2 + x/3 - 3 = 5

Combine like terms:

x - 2x/3 + x/3 - 5 = 5

Combine like terms:

x - x/3 - 5 = 5

Combine like terms:

2x/3 - 5 = 5

Add 5 to both sides:

2x/3 = 10

Multiply both sides by 3/2:

x = 15

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to find the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance, and then subtract that from the total number of students.

20% of 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance:
20 * 0.2 = 4 students

The remaining students are 20 - 4 = 16 students.

25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:
16 * 0.25 = 4 students

The number of students enrolled in jazz dance is 4, and the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance is 4. So, the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance is 16 - 4 - 4 = 8 students.

To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100:
(8 / 20) * 100 = 40%

The final answer is: 40"
"To determine the maximum profit, we need to calculate the potential future value of both options and compare them.

Let's assume the merchant buys the jewelry worth $5,000. With a 2.5% increase, the future value of the jewelry will be:
$5,000 + ($5,000 * 0.025) = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125

Now, let's calculate the potential future value of the electronic gadgets worth $8,000 with a 1.2% increase:
$8,000 + ($8,000 * 0.012) = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096

Since the merchant wants to maximize profit, we need to compare the future values of both options. The higher the future value, the higher the potential profit.

The future value of the jewelry is $5,125, and the future value of the electronic gadgets is $8,096. Therefore, the merchant should choose the electronic gadgets to maximize profit.

To calculate the profit, we subtract the initial cost from the future value:
Profit = Future Value - Initial Cost
Profit = $8,096 - $8,000
Profit = $96

The final answer is: $96"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance covered on the first day and the distance covered on the second day.

On the first day, both trains travel 80 miles westward. Since they are traveling in the same direction, they cover the same distance. Therefore, each train covers 80 miles on the first day.

On the second day, they travel northward, covering 150 miles. Again, since they are traveling in the same direction, they cover the same distance. Therefore, each train covers 150 miles on the second day.

To find the total distance covered by each train over the two days, we add the distances covered on each day:

Total distance = Distance on day 1 + Distance on day 2
Total distance = 80 miles + 150 miles
Total distance = 230 miles

The final answer is: 230"
"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:

- Hourly wage: $20
- Hours worked per week: 35
- Weeks worked per year: 50
- Annual hours worked: 35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year
- Annual earnings from teaching: 1750 hours/year * $20/hour = $35,000/year

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:

- Hourly wage: $30
- Hours worked per week: 15
- Weeks worked per year: 50
- Annual hours worked: 15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year
- Annual earnings from coaching: 750 hours/year * $30/hour = $22,500/year

Now, let's add her earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary:

Annual earnings from teaching: $35,000
Annual earnings from coaching: $22,500
Total annual salary: $35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500

The final answer is: $57,500"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks and then convert that to dozens.

First, let's calculate the number of days in 4 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 4 weeks is 4 * 7 = 28 days.

Since Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning, she eats 3 eggs per day. To find the total number of eggs she eats in 28 days, we multiply 3 eggs/day by 28 days: 3 * 28 = 84 eggs.

Now, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide the total number of eggs by 12: 84 / 12 = 7.

Therefore, Claire will eat 7 dozen eggs in 4 weeks.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total time Marissa has taken to walk the first 6 miles. She took 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles and another hour to walk the next 2 miles, so the total time taken for the first 6 miles is 1 + 1 = 2 hours.

The total distance of the trail is 12 miles, and she has already walked 6 miles. Therefore, the remaining distance is 12 - 6 = 6 miles.

Since Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail, and she has already walked 6 miles in 2 hours, her average speed for the entire trail is 12 miles / 3 hours = 4 miles per hour.

However, we are interested in finding the speed she needs to walk the remaining 6 miles. Let's denote the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance as 'x' miles per hour. The time she will take to walk the remaining 6 miles is 6 / x hours.

The total time she will take to walk the entire 12-mile trail is 2 hours (for the first 6 miles) + 6 / x hours (for the remaining 6 miles). Since her average speed for the entire trail is 4 miles per hour, the total time she will take to walk the entire trail is 12 / 4 = 3 hours.

Equating the two expressions for the total time, we get:

2 + 6 / x = 3

Subtracting 2 from both sides gives us:

6 / x = 1

Multiplying both sides by x gives us:

6 = x

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining 6 miles at a speed of 6 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink, we first need to calculate two-thirds of 10. Two-thirds of 10 is (2/3) * 10 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters. 

Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the remaining one-third is the non-water portion, which is 10 - 6.67 = 3.33 liters. 

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Three-fifths of 15 is (3/5) * 15 = 45/5 = 9 liters. 

The non-water portion of the pineapple drink is 15 - 9 = 6 liters.

Now, we have 10 liters of orange drink and 15 liters of pineapple drink, but we spilled 1 liter of the orange drink. So, the remaining amount of orange drink is 10 - 1 = 9 liters. 

The total amount of water in the remaining orange drink is 9 * (2/3) = 6 liters.

The total amount of water in the pineapple drink remains the same, which is 9 liters.

The total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 6 + 9 = 15 liters.

The final answer is: 15"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the age of Raymond when Samantha is 31 years old. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, we can calculate his age as follows:

Samantha's age = 31
Raymond's age = Samantha's age - 6
Raymond's age = 31 - 6
Raymond's age = 25

Now, we know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago his son was born, we need to subtract 23 from Raymond's current age:

Years ago son was born = Raymond's current age - Age at son's birth
Years ago son was born = 25 - 23
Years ago son was born = 2

Therefore, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total number of DVDs sold by Billy on Tuesday, we need to calculate the number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers separately and then add them together.

The first 3 customers buy one DVD each, so the total number of DVDs sold to them is 3 * 1 = 3.

The next 2 customers buy 2 DVDs each, so the total number of DVDs sold to them is 2 * 2 = 4.

Since the last 3 customers don't buy any DVDs, we don't need to consider them in our calculation.

Now, we add the number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers: 3 + 4 = 7.

Therefore, Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday.

"To find the total number of centimeters the candle will be shorter, we need to calculate the total time it burns and multiply it by the rate at which it melts.

The candle burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, which is a total of 4 hours.

The rate at which the candle melts is 2 centimeters per hour.

So, the total number of centimeters the candle will be shorter is 4 hours * 2 centimeters/hour = 8 centimeters.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the original price of the book, we need to determine the amount of the discount and add it to the discounted price. 

Let's denote the original price as 'x'. Since Kyle bought the book with a 25% discount, the amount of the discount is 25% of the original price, which is 0.25x.

The discounted price is the original price minus the discount, so we can set up the equation:

x - 0.25x = 19.50

Combine like terms:

0.75x = 19.50

Now, divide both sides by 0.75 to solve for x:

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book was $26.

The final answer is: $26"
"To find the total cost of the items Marie ordered excluding the pizza, we need to calculate the cost of the chicken meal, the packs of milk, and the apples.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3 = $15.
The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6.

The total cost of the items excluding the pizza is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the cost of the pizza boxes is $50 - $33 = $17.

To find the number of boxes of pizza, we need to divide the cost of the pizza by the cost of each box. 

Number of boxes of pizza = $17 / $8.50 = 2.

"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to calculate the total number of cartons she buys and then multiply it by the cost per carton.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she will go through 60 servings in 60 days. Each carton has 15 servings, so we need to divide 60 by 15 to find out how many cartons she buys:

60 servings / 15 servings per carton = 4 cartons

Now, we multiply the number of cartons by the cost per carton:

4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00

Therefore, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream after 60 days.

The final answer is: $16.00"
"To find the distance traveled between Henry's first and second stops, we need to determine the distance between the two stops. 

Henry's first stop was after 20 miles, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total distance of the trip is 60 miles, we can find the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip by subtracting 15 miles from 60 miles. 

60 miles - 15 miles = 45 miles

Now, we know that the distance from the first stop to the second stop is the difference between the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip and the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip.

Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip = 60 miles
Distance from the second stop to the end of the trip = 45 miles

Distance between the first and second stops = 60 miles - 45 miles
Distance between the first and second stops = 15 miles

However, this is the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip, not the distance between the two stops. To find the distance between the two stops, we need to subtract the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip from the distance from the first stop to the second stop.

Distance from the first stop to the second stop = 20 miles
Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip = 60 miles
Distance from the second stop to the end of the trip = 45 miles

Distance between the first and second stops = Distance from the first stop to the second stop - Distance from the second stop to the end of the trip
Distance between the first and second stops = 20 miles - 45 miles is incorrect, we need to find the distance from the first stop to the second stop, which is 20 miles + 15 miles = 35 miles.

Distance between the first and second stops = 35 miles - 20 miles
Distance between the first and second stops = 15 miles

However, this is still incorrect. We need to find the distance between the first and second stops, which is 20 miles + 15 miles. 

Distance between the first and second stops = 20 miles + 15 miles
Distance between the first and second stops = 35 miles

The correct answer is 35 miles.

The final answer is: 35"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the cost of the boots as B and the cost of the more expensive pair of heels as H. We are given that the cost of the less expensive pair of heels is $33. It is also stated that the less expensive pair of heels costs $33 and the more expensive pair costs twice as much, so the more expensive pair of heels costs 2 * 33 = $66.

We are also given that the two pairs of heels together cost $5 less than the boots. This can be expressed as an equation: B = H1 + H2 - 5, where H1 is the cost of the less expensive pair of heels ($33) and H2 is the cost of the more expensive pair of heels ($66).

Substituting the values of H1 and H2 into the equation, we get B = 33 + 66 - 5.

Simplifying the equation, we get B = 94.

"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given ratio and total age. Let's assume Darrell's age is 7x and Allen's age is 11x, where x is a common multiplier.

We know that the total age of Darrell and Allen is 162, so we can write the equation:

7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms:

18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18:

x = 9

Now that we have the value of x, we can find Darrell's and Allen's current ages:

Darrell's age = 7x = 7(9) = 63
Allen's age = 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

The final answer is: 109"
"To find the average guess, we need to calculate the total number of guesses and divide it by the number of people who made the guesses.

The first person guesses 80 jelly beans.
The second person guesses 20 more than half of the first person's guess, which is (80 / 2) + 20 = 60.
The third person guesses 25% more than the first person's guess, which is 80 + (0.25 * 80) = 80 + 20 = 100.

Now, let's add up all the guesses: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

There are 3 people who made the guesses. To find the average, we divide the total by 3: 240 / 3 = 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the total hours John spends taking care of dogs per week, we need to calculate the total hours spent per day and then multiply it by 7 (the number of days in a week).

First, let's calculate the total hours spent per day: 
10 dogs * 0.5 hours per dog = 5 hours per day

Now, let's multiply the total hours per day by 7 to get the total hours per week:
5 hours per day * 7 days per week = 35 hours per week

The final answer is: 35"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations. Let's denote the number of silver coins as 's' and the number of gold coins as 'g'. We are given that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, so we can write an equation:

g = s + 30

We are also given that Gretchen has a total of 110 coins, which is the sum of the number of silver and gold coins:

s + g = 110

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

s + (s + 30) = 110

Combine like terms:

2s + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:

2s = 80

Divide both sides by 2:

s = 40

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins by substituting s into the first equation:

g = s + 30
g = 40 + 30
g = 70

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

The final answer is: 70"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Raymond has 40 jewels.
2. Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. 
   First, we find half of Raymond's jewels: 40 / 2 = 20.
   Then, we add 5 to this result to find Aaron's jewels: 20 + 5 = 25.
3. Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. 
   We subtract 2 from Aaron's jewels to find Siobhan's jewels: 25 - 2 = 23.

"To find the total points scored by Mike, we need to calculate the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes separately, and then add them together.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% of 4, we multiply 4 by 0.25, which is 1. Then, we add this to the original 4 points to get the total points scored in the second 20 minutes: 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Now, we add the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes to get the total points: 4 + 5 = 9 points.

"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to first determine how many yogurts he eats in 30 days and then calculate the cost.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. In 30 days, he will eat 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

The sale is 4 yogurts for $5.00. To find the cost of one yogurt, we divide the total cost by the number of yogurts: $5.00 / 4 = $1.25 per yogurt.

Now, we multiply the number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days by the cost per yogurt: 60 * $1.25 = $75.00.

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days.

The final answer is: $75.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total amount of money John made from selling his Lego sets. 

Number of Lego sets sold = 13
Price per Lego set = $15
Total money made = Number of Lego sets sold * Price per Lego set
Total money made = 13 * 15
Total money made = $195

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of money John spent on video games.

Number of video games bought = 8
Price per video game = $20
Total money spent on video games = Number of video games bought * Price per video game
Total money spent on video games = 8 * 20
Total money spent on video games = $160

Now, we need to find out how much money John had left after buying the video games.

Total money made = $195
Total money spent on video games = $160
Money left = Total money made - Total money spent on video games
Money left = $195 - $160
Money left = $35

However, the problem states that John had $5 left after buying the video games. This means that the $35 is the total money he had after buying the video games, and the $5 is the remaining money after he spent some of it. 

Let's calculate the amount of money John spent on video games after buying them.

Money left = $5
Money left before buying video games = $35
Money spent after buying video games = Money left before buying video games - Money left
Money spent after buying video games = $35 - $5
Money spent after buying video games = $30

Since John bought 8 video games for $20 each, the total money spent on video games is $160. However, he spent $30 more after buying the video games. This means that the $30 is the money he spent on something else.

Now, let's calculate the number of Lego sets John sold to get the $30.

Money spent on something else = $30
Price per Lego set = $15
Number of Lego sets sold = Money spent on something else / Price per Lego set
Number of Lego sets sold = $30 / $15
Number of Lego sets sold = 2

Initially, John had 13 Lego sets. He sold 2 Lego sets to get the $30. To find out how many Lego sets he still has, we need to subtract the number of Lego sets sold from the initial number of Lego sets.

Initial number of Lego sets = 13
Number of Lego sets sold = 2
Number of Lego sets left = Initial number of Lego sets - Number of Lego sets sold
Number of Lego sets left = 13 - 2
Number of Lego sets left = 11

The final answer is: 11"
"To find John's running speed, we first need to calculate the total time he spends running per week. 

John runs 3 hours on the first day. The other two days, he runs half as much as the first day, which is 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours per day. 

So, the total time spent running per week is 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours.

Since John runs 60 miles a week, we can find his speed by dividing the total distance by the total time spent running: 

Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
Speed = 10 miles per hour

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine Dana's walking speed. Since she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run, and she can skip at 3 miles per hour, we can calculate her running speed as follows:

Running speed = 2 * Skipping speed
Running speed = 2 * 3 miles/hour
Running speed = 6 miles/hour

Since Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, we can calculate her walking speed as follows:

Walking speed = Running speed / 4
Walking speed = 6 miles/hour / 4
Walking speed = 1.5 miles/hour

Now, we know that Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Therefore, the time spent running is 2 hours and the time spent walking is 4 hours.

Distance traveled while running = Speed * Time
Distance traveled while running = 6 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance traveled while running = 12 miles

Distance traveled while walking = Speed * Time
Distance traveled while walking = 1.5 miles/hour * 4 hours
Distance traveled while walking = 6 miles

Total distance traveled = Distance traveled while running + Distance traveled while walking
Total distance traveled = 12 miles + 6 miles
Total distance traveled = 18 miles

The final answer is: 18"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the age of Ben's iPhone first, and then use that information to find the age of Brandon's iPhone.

Since Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old, and Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, we can calculate Ben's iPhone age as follows:

Ben's iPhone age = 2 * Suzy's iPhone age
Ben's iPhone age = 2 * 1
Ben's iPhone age = 2 years

Now that we know Ben's iPhone is 2 years old, and Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, we can calculate Brandon's iPhone age as follows:

Brandon's iPhone age = 4 * Ben's iPhone age
Brandon's iPhone age = 4 * 2
Brandon's iPhone age = 8 years

"To solve this problem, we need to find the distance Polly can throw the javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone and then subtract the dragon's reach from that distance.

When Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone. Since she can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone, she can throw it 3 * 400 = 1200 feet with the gemstone.

The dragon's reach is 1000 feet, so Polly can stand 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet outside of the dragon's reach and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

The final answer is: 200"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of pie pieces initially available and subtract the number of pieces remaining to determine the number of pieces taken by the guests.

First, we calculate the total number of pie pieces initially available. Since Grandma Jones baked 5 pies and cut each pie into 8 pieces, the total number of pieces is:

5 pies * 8 pieces/pie = 40 pieces

Next, we subtract the number of pieces remaining from the total number of pieces to find the number of pieces taken by the guests:

40 pieces (initial) - 14 pieces (remaining) = 26 pieces

Therefore, the number of pieces taken by the guests is 26.

The final answer is: 26"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many calories are left in the daily calorie target. 

Daily calorie target: 2000 calories
Calories already consumed: 1800 calories
Remaining calories: 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories

Since each serving of the bag of chips has 250 calories, we need to find out how many servings can be consumed within the remaining calorie limit.

Remaining calories: 200 calories
Calories per serving: 250 calories
Number of servings: 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings

Since the bag has 5 servings, we can calculate the total weight of the chips that can be consumed by multiplying the number of servings by the weight of one serving. However, we need to know the weight of one serving first.

Weight of the bag: 300g
Number of servings: 5
Weight per serving: 300 / 5 = 60g per serving

Now, we can calculate the total weight of the chips that can be consumed.

Number of servings: 0.8
Weight per serving: 60g
Total weight: 0.8 * 60 = 48g

The final answer is: 48"
"To find Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost.

First, let's calculate the total cost. Since one pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10.00, and Charlie makes 10 candles per pound, the cost per candle is $1.00 ($10.00 / 10 candles). 

For 20 candles, the total cost is 20 * $1.00 = $20.00.

Next, let's calculate the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, so for 20 candles, the total revenue is 20 * $2.00 = $40.00.

Now, we can calculate the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.

The final answer is: $20.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of articles Meredith wrote each day and then multiply it by the time it takes to write an article (4 hours).

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. To find this, we multiply the number of articles she wrote on Monday by 2/5 and add it to the original number of articles.

2/5 * 5 = 2
5 + 2 = 7

So, on Tuesday, Meredith wrote 7 articles.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday.

2 * 7 = 14

So, on Wednesday, Meredith wrote 14 articles.

Now, we need to find the total number of articles she wrote in the three days.

5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26

Since each article takes 4 hours to write, we multiply the total number of articles by 4.

26 * 4 = 104

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of Post-it notes Candice had at the beginning and the end, and then subtract the initial number from the final number to find out how many she purchased.

Initially, Candice had 80 Post-it notes in her purse.

At the end, she had 23 Post-it notes remaining.

The total number of Post-it notes she used at work is 220 (one for each cup of coffee).

To find the total number of Post-it notes she had at the end of her trip (before returning to work), we need to add the remaining Post-it notes to the ones she used at work: 23 (remaining) + 220 (used at work) = 243.

Now, we can find the total number of Post-it notes she had at the beginning of her trip by adding the initial number to the ones she purchased: 243 (total at the end) - 80 (initial) = 163.

Since we know she purchased a package of Post-it notes, we can find the number of Post-it notes in the package by subtracting the initial number from the total number she had at the beginning of her trip: 163 (total at the beginning) - 80 (initial) = 83.

The final answer is: 83"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of blue ties John bought and the cost of the red ties.

Since John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

Number of blue ties = Total cost of blue ties / Cost per blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is:

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
= 2 * 5
= 10

The cost of the red ties is 50% more than the cost of the blue ties. Since the blue ties cost $40 each, the cost of the red ties is:

Cost of red ties = Cost of blue ties + (50% of cost of blue ties)
= $40 + (0.5 * $40)
= $40 + $20
= $60

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the red ties:

Total cost of red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of red ties
= 10 * $60
= $600

The total amount John spent on ties is the sum of the cost of the blue ties and the cost of the red ties:

Total cost = Cost of blue ties + Total cost of red ties
= $200 + $600
= $800

The final answer is: $800"

"To find the total number of units in the building, we need to multiply the number of floors by the number of units per floor. 

Number of floors = 15
Number of units per floor = 8

Total number of units = Number of floors * Number of units per floor
Total number of units = 15 * 8
Total number of units = 120

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we need to find 1/4 of the total number of units to determine the number of unoccupied units.

Number of unoccupied units = Total number of units * (1 - 3/4)
Number of unoccupied units = Total number of units * 1/4
Number of unoccupied units = 120 * 1/4
Number of unoccupied units = 30

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Tom spends traveling from 1 to 4 PM and then the time he spends traveling back.

First, let's calculate the distance Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM. Since he travels at 10 miles per hour, we can use the formula:

Distance = Speed * Time

However, we are given the time in hours (1 to 4 PM), so we can directly use the time as the time taken to travel. The distance traveled from 1 to 4 PM is:

Distance = 10 miles/hour * 3 hours = 30 miles

Now, let's calculate the time it takes for Tom to travel back. We know the distance is 30 miles and his speed is 6 miles per hour. We can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 30 miles / 6 miles/hour = 5 hours

Therefore, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back.

Since Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds, the remaining weight that needs to be removed from toys is:

15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, the number of toys that need to be removed is:

7.5 / (1/2) = 7.5 * 2 = 15

"To find the revenue earned by the mechanic on each day, we need to calculate the total revenue from truck tire repairs and car tire repairs separately for both days.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. The revenue from truck tire repairs is 6 * $60 = $360. The revenue from car tire repairs is 4 * $40 = $160. The total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires. The revenue from car tire repairs is 12 * $40 = $480. Since there were no truck tire repairs, the total revenue on Friday is $480.

To find the day with higher revenue, we compare the revenues: $520 (Thursday) and $480 (Friday). Thursday has higher revenue.

The difference in revenue between the two days is $520 - $480 = $40.

Patchy, the first cat, has had thrice the number of adopted kittens. Since the Doubtfire sisters adopted 7 kittens, Patchy has had 3 * 7 = 21 kittens.

Trixie, the other cat, has had 12 kittens.

Now, we add the number of adopted kittens (7) to the number of kittens each cat has had: 7 (adopted) + 21 (Patchy's kittens) + 12 (Trixie's kittens) = 40.

The Doubtfire family now has 40 kittens.

"To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck, we need to first determine the remaining weight capacity of the bridge after the truck and driver are on it. 

The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. The weight limit of the bridge is 5000 pounds. 

Remaining weight capacity = Weight limit - Combined weight of driver and empty truck
Remaining weight capacity = 5000 - 3755
Remaining weight capacity = 1245 pounds

Since each box weighs 15 pounds, we can find the maximum number of boxes by dividing the remaining weight capacity by the weight of each box.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the value of the pension after 30 years and then determine the annual pension Marcy will receive.

First, let's calculate the value of the pension after 30 years. Since Marcy works for 40 years and becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year after 20 years, she will have worked for 10 years with the full pension and 10 years with the increased pension.

The value of the pension after 10 years is $50,000/year * 10 years = $500,000.

The value of the pension after 20 years is $500,000 + ($500,000 * 0.05 * 10) = $500,000 + $250,000 = $750,000.

The value of the pension after 30 years is $750,000 + ($750,000 * 0.05 * 10) = $750,000 + $375,000 = $1,125,000.

Now, let's calculate the annual pension Marcy will receive after 30 years. She will receive 5% of the value of the pension, which is $1,125,000 * 0.05 = $56,250.

"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to find the amount she paid for the first half of the year and the second half of the year separately and then add them together.

The streaming service charges $140 per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the first half of the year consists of 6 months. 

The amount paid for the first half of the year is 6 * $140 = $840.

For the second half of the year, the company charges 10% less than the initial amount. To find the amount charged for the second half, we need to calculate 10% of $140 and subtract it from the initial amount.

10% of $140 = 0.1 * $140 = $14.

The amount charged for the second half of the year is $140 - $14 = $126.

The amount paid for the second half of the year is 6 * $126 = $756.

The total amount paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $840 + $756 = $1596.

"To determine how far Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to calculate the car's miles per gallon (mpg) rating. We can do this by dividing the distance traveled since the last fill-up (100 miles) by the amount of gas used (4 gallons).

mpg = distance / gas used
mpg = 100 miles / 4 gallons
mpg = 25 miles per gallon

Now that we have the car's mpg rating, we can calculate the total distance Sophia can drive on a full tank by multiplying the tank capacity (12 gallons) by the mpg rating.

total distance = tank capacity * mpg
total distance = 12 gallons * 25 miles/gallon
total distance = 300 miles

"To find the total number of people sent by the schools, we need to calculate the number of students and coaches for both girls' and boys' teams.

Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys'), and each team has 5 players. So, the total number of students from each school is 2 teams * 5 players/team = 10 players.

Each school also has a coach for each team, so there are 2 coaches per school.

Therefore, the total number of people sent by each school is 10 players + 2 coaches = 12 people.

Since there are 4 schools, the total number of people sent by all schools is 12 people/school * 4 schools = 48 people.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the total number of gems, we need to calculate the number of rubies and emeralds first.

The number of rubies is 35 fewer than the number of diamonds, which is 175. So, the number of rubies is 175 - 35 = 140.

The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies, which is 140. So, the number of emeralds is 2 * 140 = 280.

Now, we can find the total number of gems by adding the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds: 175 (diamonds) + 140 (rubies) + 280 (emeralds) = 595.

The final answer is: 595"
"To find the number of teachers, we first need to determine the total number of students. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, the number of boys is 2 * 60 = 120. 

The total number of students is the sum of boys and girls, which is 60 + 120 = 180. 

Given that there are 5 students to every teacher, we can find the number of teachers by dividing the total number of students by 5. 

Number of teachers = Total number of students / 5
= 180 / 5
= 36

The final answer is: 36"
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic equation. Let's denote the initial amount of money Bailey had as 'x'. 

Bailey receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks, so the total amount she receives from her allowance is 5 * 8 = $40.

At the end of the 8 weeks, Bailey has a total of $100, which is the sum of her initial amount and the allowance she received. We can write this as an equation:

x + 40 = 100

To find the initial amount Bailey had, we need to isolate 'x' by subtracting 40 from both sides of the equation:

x = 100 - 40
x = 60

So, Bailey started with $60.

The final answer is: $60"
"To find out how much Judy makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of classes she teaches in a week and then multiply it by the number of students per class and the charge per student.

Judy teaches 5 classes per day on weekdays, which is 5 classes/day * 5 days = 25 classes. 
On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes. 
So, the total number of classes in a week is 25 classes + 8 classes = 33 classes.

Each class has 15 students, so the total number of students per week is 33 classes * 15 students/class = 495 students.

Judy charges $15.00 per student, so the total amount she makes in a week is 495 students * $15/student = $7,425.

The final answer is: $7425"
"To find the total number of instructions Kelian has to read, we need to calculate the number of instructions in each recipe and then add them together.

The first recipe has 20 instructions. The second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one, so it has 2 * 20 = 40 instructions.

Now, we add the number of instructions in both recipes: 20 + 40 = 60.

The final numerical answer is: 60"
"To find the total amount of money Tommy raises, we need to calculate the revenue from selling brownies and cheesecakes separately and then add them together.

The revenue from selling brownies is the number of brownies sold multiplied by the price per brownie: 43 * $3 = $129.

The revenue from selling cheesecakes is the number of cheesecakes sold multiplied by the price per cheesecake: 23 * $4 = $92.

Now, we add the revenue from brownies and cheesecakes to find the total amount of money Tommy raises: $129 + $92 = $221.

The final answer is: $221"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the cell phones and then divide it by the number of months. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the cell phones with the 2% interest. 

The cost of each cell phone is $150. The interest charged for each cell phone is 2% of $150, which is 0.02 * $150 = $3. 

So, the total cost of each cell phone with interest is $150 + $3 = $153.

Since Shiela bought 5 cell phones, the total cost is 5 * $153 = $765.

Now, we need to divide the total cost by the number of months, which is 3. 

The monthly payment will be $765 / 3 = $255.

The final answer is: $255"

- Begonias: $2.12 ≈ $2

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from each type of flower:
- Marigolds: 12 pots * $3/pot = $36
- Petunias: 9 pots * $2/pot = $18
- Begonias: 17 pots * $2/pot = $34

Now, let's add the total revenue from each type of flower:
$36 + $18 + $34 = $88

"To find the average square footage of a level, we need to first find the total square footage of the sandcastle and then divide it by the number of levels.

Since each level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can start with the top level and work our way down. 

The top level has a square footage of 16. 
The second level will have half of 16, which is 8. 
The third level will have half of 8, which is 4. 
The fourth level will have half of 4, which is 2.

Now, we add up the square footage of all levels: 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30.

There are 4 levels in total. To find the average square footage, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels: 30 / 4 = 7.5.

The final answer is: 7.5"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year. 

First, let's find out how many days are in a year. There are 365 days in a year.

The puppy will eat 1 cup of dog food for the first 180 days. So, the amount of dog food used in the first 180 days is 180 cups.

The puppy will eat 2 cups of dog food for the rest of its life, which is 365 - 180 = 185 days. So, the amount of dog food used in the rest of the year is 2 * 185 = 370 cups.

The total amount of dog food used in the first year is 180 + 370 = 550 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the total number of bags of dog food used in the first year is 550 / 110 = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the amount of laundry done by Raymond and David.

Let's denote the amount of laundry done by David as D. Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, the amount of laundry done by Sarah is 4D.

Given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, we can set up the equation:

4D = 400

To find the value of D, we divide both sides of the equation by 4:

D = 400 / 4
D = 100

Now that we know David does 100 pounds of laundry, we can find the amount of laundry done by Raymond. Since Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, and Sarah does 400 pounds, the amount of laundry done by Raymond is:

Raymond's laundry = (1/2) * 400
Raymond's laundry = 200

The difference in the amount of laundry done by Raymond and David is:

Difference = Raymond's laundry - David's laundry
Difference = 200 - 100
Difference = 100

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the better price, we need to calculate the cost per flower for each package option. 

For the package of 3 flowers for $2.50, the cost per flower is $2.50 / 3 = $0.8333 per flower.

For the package of 2 flowers for $1, the cost per flower is $1 / 2 = $0.5 per flower.

Since $0.5 per flower is less than $0.8333 per flower, the package of 2 flowers for $1 is the better option.

Now, we need to calculate the total cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price. Since 18 is divisible by 2, we can buy 18 flowers in 9 packages of 2 flowers each. The total cost is 9 * $1 = $9.

To find the cost of buying 18 flowers at the worse price, we can calculate the total cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3. Since 18 is not divisible by 3, we need to buy 6 packages of 3 flowers each and 0 packages of 1 flower. The total number of flowers in 6 packages of 3 flowers is 6 * 3 = 18. The total cost is 6 * $2.50 = $15.

The amount of money saved is $15 - $9 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To find the cost of the grooming after the discount, we need to calculate 30% of the original price and subtract it from the original price.

The original price is $100.

Initially, Charlie had 10 stickers.

He bought 21 stickers from a store, so now he has 10 + 21 = 31 stickers.

He got 23 stickers for his birthday, so now he has 31 + 23 = 54 stickers.

Then, he gave 9 stickers to his sister, so now he has 54 - 9 = 45 stickers.

Finally, he used 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card, so now he has 45 - 28 = 17 stickers.

Therefore, Charlie has 17 stickers left.

"To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let's denote the number of games the team lost as 'x'. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games they won is 'x + 8'.

We know that the total number of games played is 22, which is the sum of the games won and lost. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:

2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 7

Since x represents the number of games lost, the number of games won is x + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15.

"To find Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate her salary after the 5th year and then calculate the increase for the next three years.

Initially, Sylvie's salary is $600. 

After 5 years, her salary is increased by 10% of the initial salary for each year she has stayed in the company. Since she has stayed for 5 years, she gets a 5% increase (10% of 5 years) on her initial salary. 

5% of $600 = 0.05 * $600 = $30
So, her salary after 5 years is $600 + $30 = $630.

Now, for the next three years, she will get a 10% increase each year on her current salary, not the initial salary. 

Year 6: 10% of $630 = 0.10 * $630 = $63
Year 7: 10% of $693 = 0.10 * $693 = $69.30
Year 8: 10% of $762.30 = 0.10 * $762.30 = $76.23

Her salary after 8 years is $762.30. 

The final answer is: $762.30"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation. Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as 'H' and the number of copies Marilyn sold as 'M'. We know that Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so we can write this relationship as M = 10H.

We also know that the total number of copies sold by both of them is 88,000, so we can write the equation: H + M = 88,000.

Substituting the expression for M from the first equation into the second equation, we get H + 10H = 88,000, which simplifies to 11H = 88,000.

To find the value of H, we divide both sides of the equation by 11: H = 88,000 / 11.

H = 8000

The final answer is: 8000"
"To find the total number of gift bags needed, we first need to calculate the number of guests who will actually attend the party. Since 1/4 of the invited guests don't show up, we can find the number of guests who will attend by subtracting 1/4 from the total number of invited guests.

Number of invited guests = 16
Number of guests who don't show up = 1/4 * 16 = 4
Number of guests who will attend = 16 - 4 = 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we can multiply the number of guests who will attend by 0.75 to find the total number of gift bags needed.

Number of gift bags needed = 12 * 0.75 = 9

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of gift bags needed by the cost per gift bag.

Cost per gift bag = $2
Total cost = 9 * $2 = $18

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationships between the ages of the children. 

Let's denote the age of Jackson as J, Amy as A, Corey as C, and James as M. We know that M = 10.

From the given information, we have the following equations:
1. A = J + 5 (Amy is 5 years older than Jackson)
2. A = C - 2 (Amy is 2 years younger than Corey)
3. C = M + 1 (James is 1 year younger than Corey)

We can substitute equation 3 into equation 2 to get:
A = (M + 1) - 2
A = 10 + 1 - 2
A = 9

Now that we know Amy's age, we can substitute A into equation 1 to find Jackson's age:
9 = J + 5
J = 9 - 5
J = 4

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it takes Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles before his diet change. Since Lee runs 2 seconds faster than Gerald, we can set up an equation:

Time taken by Gerald = Time taken by Lee + 2 seconds
Time taken by Gerald = 38 + 2
Time taken by Gerald = 40 seconds

Now, we know that Gerald's speed improved by 10% after his diet change. To find his new time, we need to calculate 10% of his original time and subtract it from his original time.

10% of 40 seconds = 0.1 * 40 = 4 seconds
New time taken by Gerald = Original time - (10% of original time)
New time taken by Gerald = 40 - 4
New time taken by Gerald = 36 seconds

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of cats, then the number of rabbits, and finally add them up with the number of dogs to get the total number of pets.

Given that there are two cats for every dog, and the number of dogs is 60, we can find the number of cats by multiplying the number of dogs by 2.

Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
= 2 * 60
= 120

Now, we know that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. We can find the combined number of dogs and cats by adding the number of dogs and cats.

Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
= 60 + 120
= 180

Now, we can find the number of rabbits by subtracting 12 from the combined number of dogs and cats.

Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
= 180 - 12
= 168

Finally, we can find the total number of pets in the neighborhood by adding the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits.

Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
= 60 + 120 + 168
= 348

"To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we first need to find the total number of girls and then subtract the number of girls in the girl scout.

First, let's find the number of boys and girls. We know that 2/5 of the students are boys. 

Number of boys = (2/5) * 200 = 80

Since the total number of students is 200, the number of girls can be found by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students.

Number of girls = Total number of students - Number of boys
= 200 - 80
= 120

Now, we know that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. 

Number of girls in the girl scout = (2/3) * Number of girls
= (2/3) * 120
= 80

Now, to find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls.

Number of girls not in the girl scout = Total number of girls - Number of girls in the girl scout

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many 16-ounce cans of tomatoes Freda used to make 32 ounces of sauce. Since the sauce is made from the tomatoes in the cans, and each can contains 16 ounces of tomatoes, we can set up a proportion to find the number of cans used.

Let's denote the number of cans used as 'x'. Since each can contains 16 ounces of tomatoes and the sauce made is 32 ounces, we can set up the following proportion:

16x = 32

To find 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 16:

x = 32 / 16
x = 2

So, Freda used 2 cans of tomatoes.

Now, we know that each can contains 3 tomatoes, so to find the total number of tomatoes used, we multiply the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can:

Total tomatoes = 2 cans * 3 tomatoes/can
Total tomatoes = 6

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as x. Since 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is x + 20.

We know that 5 cars took the exit, so the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the original number of cars minus the number of cars that took the exit: 30 - 5 = 25.

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the situation: x + 20 = 25. Solving for x, we get x = 5.

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5.

The dimensions of the box are given as 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches, but the walls are 1 inch thick. This means that the inner dimensions of the box will be (5-2) inches by (6-2) inches by (4-2) inches, since 1 inch is subtracted from each dimension to account for the walls.

So, the inner dimensions of the box are 3 inches by 4 inches by 2 inches.

The formula to calculate the volume of a rectangular prism is length x width x height. 

Inner volume of one box = 3 x 4 x 2 = 24 cubic inches.

Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes = 24 x 3 = 72 cubic inches.

The final answer is: 72"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 2 episodes of a 1-hour show, which is a total of 2 * 1 = 2 hours.

On Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. Let's denote the number of episodes as 'x'. The total time he watched on Wednesday is 30x minutes, which is equal to 0.5x hours (since 30 minutes is half an hour).

On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, which is a total of 1.5 hours.

On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, which is a total of 2 hours.

The total time Frankie watched TV is 7 hours. We can set up an equation to represent this:

2 (Monday and Tuesday) + 0.5x (Wednesday) + 1.5 (Thursday) + 2 (Friday) = 7

Combine like terms:

2 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 = 7

Combine the constants:

5.5 + 0.5x = 7

Subtract 5.5 from both sides:

0.5x = 1.5

Divide both sides by 0.5:

x = 3

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as 'x'. Since Henry wants to make twice as many cookies this year, he plans to bake 2x cookies.

However, he actually baked 15 more cookies than he intended, so the total number of cookies he baked is 2x + 15.

After dropping 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies left. This can be represented by the equation: 2x + 15 - 5 = 110.

Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 10 = 110.

Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation, we get 2x = 100.

Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get x = 50.

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total cost of gas after the cashback rewards, we need to first calculate the total cost of gas without the rewards, and then subtract the cashback amount.

The cost of gas per gallon is $3.00, and the person is buying 10 gallons. 

Total cost of gas = cost per gallon * number of gallons
Total cost of gas = $3.00 * 10
Total cost of gas = $30.00

The cashback reward is $0.20 per gallon, and the person is buying 10 gallons.

Total cashback = cashback per gallon * number of gallons
Total cashback = $0.20 * 10
Total cashback = $2.00

Now, we subtract the total cashback from the total cost of gas to find the final cost.

Final cost = Total cost of gas - Total cashback
Final cost = $30.00 - $2.00
Final cost = $28.00

The final answer is: $28.00"
"To find the total number of fruit roll-ups eaten by each person, we need to calculate the area of the roll-ups they ate. 

Beatrice's roll-ups are 2 roll-ups wide and 24 rolls up long, so the total number of roll-ups she ate is 2 * 24 = 48.

Marcell's roll-ups are 3 roll-ups wide and 14 rolls up long, so the total number of roll-ups he ate is 3 * 14 = 42.

To find the average number of roll-ups eaten, we need to add the total number of roll-ups eaten by both Marcell and Beatrice and divide by 2.

Total roll-ups eaten = 48 + 42 = 90

Average roll-ups eaten = Total roll-ups eaten / 2 = 90 / 2 = 45

The final answer is: 45"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the rate at which the boat is taking on water and then multiply it by the total time it takes to reach the shore.

First, let's find the rate at which the boat is taking on water. We know that for every 10 feet Julia rows, the boat takes on 2 liters of water. Since it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can find the rate of water intake per second.

The distance rowed in 16 seconds is 20 feet, and the time taken to row 10 feet is half of 16 seconds, which is 8 seconds. 

So, the rate of water intake per 10 feet is 2 liters, and the time taken to row 10 feet is 8 seconds. 

Now, we can find the rate of water intake per second by dividing the water intake by the time taken to row 10 feet: 2 liters / 8 seconds = 0.25 liters per second.

Since the shore is 64 seconds away, we can multiply the rate of water intake per second by the total time to find the total water taken on: 0.25 liters/second * 64 seconds = 16 liters.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we need to calculate the total number of lessons and then multiply it by the number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per lesson.

Each teacher has 2 lessons per day, and there are 4 teachers. So, the total number of lessons per day is 2 * 4 = 8 lessons.

The whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson. Therefore, the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day is 8 lessons * 3 cleanings per lesson = 24 cleanings.

The final numerical answer is: 24"
"To find the total number of flowers Ryan has after 15 days, we need to calculate the total number of flowers he planted and subtract the ones that did not grow.

Ryan plants 2 flowers a day. After 15 days, he would have planted 2 * 15 = 30 flowers.

However, 5 of these flowers did not grow. To find the total number of flowers that grew, we subtract the number of flowers that did not grow from the total number of flowers planted: 30 - 5 = 25.

Therefore, Ryan has 25 flowers in his garden after 15 days.

The final answer is: 25"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's denote the number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold as B, and the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as D.

We are given that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. This can be expressed as:
Jamal's phone = 6 * Brittany's phone
1800 = 6 * B

To find the number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold, we divide both sides by 6:
B = 1800 / 6
B = 300

We are also given that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. This can be expressed as:
B = 50 * D

Now we can substitute the value of B we found earlier:
300 = 50 * D

To find the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph, we divide both sides by 50:
D = 300 / 50
D = 6

The final answer is: 6"
"To calculate Sasha's profit, we need to first calculate the total cost of the lumber she bought and the total selling price of the lumber she sells.

The total cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $10 = $100.
The total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $16 = $80.
The total cost of all the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since prices for lumber have gone up by 50%, the new price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each.
The new price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 each.

The total selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $15 = $150.
The total selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $24 = $120.
The total selling price of all the lumber is $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit is the total selling price minus the total cost, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of ratios and proportions. The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, and the total number of parts in the ratio is 7 + 13 = 20. 

We know that the total amount of sugar and water used is 120 teaspoons. To find the number of teaspoons of sugar used, we can set up a proportion:

7/20 = x/120

where x is the number of teaspoons of sugar used.

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

7 * 120 = 20x
840 = 20x

Now, we can divide both sides by 20 to find x:

x = 840 / 20
x = 42

The final answer is: 42"
"To find the total amount John paid, we need to calculate the cost of the shoes for all 3 children. 

First, we find the cost of shoes for one child: 2 pairs * $60 per pair = $120.

Therefore, John paid $360.

The final answer is: $360"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of vehicles that were already present at the port on the first day. We know that there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles on the first day is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of vehicles on the second day is 30, and we want to find the number of containers that were imported on the second day. Let's denote the number of containers imported on the second day as x. Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the total number of vehicles imported on the second day is 5x.

We know that the total number of vehicles on the second day is the sum of the vehicles present on the first day and the vehicles imported on the second day. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

10 + 5x = 30

To solve for x, we subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

5x = 20

Then, we divide both sides by 5:

x = 20 / 5
x = 4

So, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Lylah's salary four years ago and then find their salaries four years later.

Let's assume Lylah's salary four years ago was 'x'. Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can express Adrien's salary as 1.3x.

We are given that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000. So, we can set up the equation:

1.3x = 40000

To find 'x', we can divide both sides by 1.3:

x = 40000 / 1.3
x = 30769.23

So, Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30769.23.

Now, we need to find their salaries four years later. We are given that Adrien's salary increased by 40% of his original salary. 

Adrien's salary four years later = 40000 + (40% of 40000)
= 40000 + 0.4 * 40000
= 40000 + 16000
= 56000

Since their salaries increased simultaneously, Lylah's salary also increased by 40% of her original salary.

Lylah's salary four years later = 30769.23 + (40% of 30769.23)
= 30769.23 + 0.4 * 30769.23
= 30769.23 + 12307.69
= 43076.92

Now, we can find the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later:

Total salary = Adrien's salary + Lylah's salary
= 56000 + 43076.92
= 99076.92

The final answer is: $99077"
"To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we need to first calculate how many sheets he uses in a week and then multiply that by the number of weeks in a month.

Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad has 30 sheets. So, the total number of sheets he uses in a week is:

2 pads/week * 30 sheets/pad = 60 sheets/week

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we can multiply the number of sheets used in a week by 4 to get the total number of sheets used in a month:

60 sheets/week * 4 weeks/month = 240 sheets/month

Therefore, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month.

"To find the total number of fruits, we first need to determine the number of fruits each person brought. 

Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges. 

Kael brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette, so Kael brought 2 * 5 = 10 apples. 
Kael brought half the number of oranges as Morisette, so Kael brought 8 / 2 = 4 oranges.

Now, we can find the total number of fruits each person brought: 
Morisette brought 5 + 8 = 13 fruits.
Kael brought 10 + 4 = 14 fruits.

To find the total number of fruits, we add the number of fruits each person brought: 
13 (Morisette's fruits) + 14 (Kael's fruits) = 27.

"To find the total number of hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we need to calculate the hours she slept on each day and add them up.

On Monday, Sadie slept 8 hours.

For the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday), she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours each day.

The rest of the week (Thursday to Sunday) she slept 1 hour more than those two days, so she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours each day.

Now, let's calculate the total hours for each period:

- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday and Wednesday: 2 days * 6 hours = 12 hours
- Thursday to Sunday: 5 days * 7 hours = 35 hours

Adding up the hours: 8 + 12 + 35 = 55

"To find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to calculate the distance she covers in the first 3 hours and the distance she covers in the remaining 4 hours.

In the first 3 hours, Rosie runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour. So, the distance covered in the first 3 hours is:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour x 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

In the remaining 4 hours, Rosie runs at a speed of 5 miles per hour. So, the distance covered in the remaining 4 hours is:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour x 4 hours
Distance = 20 miles

Total distance covered in 7 hours = Distance in first 3 hours + Distance in remaining 4 hours
Total distance = 30 miles + 20 miles
Total distance = 50 miles

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the initial number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. Let's denote the initial number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters as 'x'. 

Since Jennie puts stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, the number of letters needing stamps that are now stamped is 60 * (1/3) = 20. 

The total number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters is now 30, which is the sum of the initial number of letters in the pile and the number of letters that were stamped. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x + 20 = 30.

Solving for x, we get x = 30 - 20 = 10.

So, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Julia initially bought a package of spoons, but we don't know the quantity yet. Let's call this quantity 'x'.
2. Her husband bought a package of 5 new spoons and gave them to Julia.
3. Julia used 3 spoons while making the stew.
4. When she went to set the table, she had a total of 12 spoons.

Now, let's set up an equation to represent the situation:

Initial spoons (x) + spoons from her husband (5) - spoons used (3) = total spoons (12)

x + 5 - 3 = 12

Simplifying the equation:

x + 2 = 12

Subtract 2 from both sides:

x = 10

So, Julia bought a package of 10 spoons.

"To find the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together, we first need to determine the number of friends Amy has. Since Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, and Lily has 50 friends, we can calculate Amy's friends by adding 20 to Lily's total.

Amy's friends = Lily's friends + 20
Amy's friends = 50 + 20
Amy's friends = 70

Now, to find the total number of friends they have together, we add the number of friends Lily and Amy have.

Total friends = Lily's friends + Amy's friends
Total friends = 50 + 70
Total friends = 120

"To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to determine the cost of each item and then calculate the total cost.

First, we know that each pepper costs $15. Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, the cost of a watermelon is 3 * $15 = $45.

Next, we are told that an orange costs 5 dollars less than what a watermelon costs. Therefore, the cost of an orange is $45 - $5 = $40.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of each item:

- 4 watermelons: 4 * $45 = $180
- 20 peppers: 20 * $15 = $300
- 10 oranges: 10 * $40 = $400

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is the sum of the costs of all the items: $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

"To calculate the hospital's profit, we need to determine the total time spent by doctors and the total amount charged to patients, then subtract the cost from the revenue.

First, let's calculate the total time spent by doctors. The hospital sees 500 people a day, and each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes. 

Total time spent by doctors = 500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we need to convert the total time from minutes to hours.

Total time spent by doctors (in hours) = 12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

The doctors charge $150 an hour, so the total cost to the hospital is:

Total cost to the hospital = 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000

Now, let's calculate the total amount charged to patients. The hospital charges $200 an hour, and the total time spent by doctors is 200 hours.

Total amount charged to patients = 200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000

The hospital's profit is the difference between the total amount charged to patients and the total cost to the hospital.

Profit = Total amount charged to patients - Total cost to the hospital
= $40,000 - $30,000
= $10,000

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many miles Walt walked on Tuesday. Since he walked 6 times as many miles on Tuesday as he did on Monday, we can multiply the miles walked on Monday by 6.

Miles walked on Monday = 4
Miles walked on Tuesday = 6 * Miles walked on Monday = 6 * 4 = 24

Now, we know that the total mileage from Monday through Wednesday is 41 miles. We can set up an equation to find the miles walked on Wednesday:

Miles walked on Monday + Miles walked on Tuesday + Miles walked on Wednesday = Total mileage
4 + 24 + Miles walked on Wednesday = 41

Now, we can solve for the miles walked on Wednesday:

Miles walked on Wednesday = Total mileage - (Miles walked on Monday + Miles walked on Tuesday)

"To find out how many questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate the total number of questions he was able to complete in each test and then subtract that from the total number of questions in each test.

For the first test, Mark had 8 hours to complete 75 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour. 

First, let's calculate the total number of questions Mark could have completed in 8 hours:
Total questions completed in 8 hours = 5 questions/hour * 8 hours = 40 questions

Since Mark had 75 questions in the first test, the number of questions he left incomplete is:
75 - 40 = 35 questions

For the second test, Mark had 6 hours to complete 100 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour.

Total questions completed in 6 hours = 5 questions/hour * 6 hours = 30 questions

Since Mark had 100 questions in the second test, the number of questions he left incomplete is:

"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine the total number of semi-automatic cars. We know that there are 20 cars in total, with 12 being automatic and 4 being manual. 

Total number of automatic and manual cars = 12 + 4 = 16

Now, we can find the number of semi-automatic cars by subtracting the total number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars.

Number of semi-automatic cars = Total number of cars - Total number of automatic and manual cars
= 20 - 16
= 4

Now, we can find the percentage of semi-automatic cars by dividing the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100

"Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W. We are given that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so W = 2B. We are also given that there are twice as many babies as queens, so B = 2Q.

We know that the total number of bees in the hive is 700, so Q + B + W = 700. Substituting the expressions for W and B in terms of Q, we get Q + 2Q + 2(2Q) = 700.

Simplifying the equation, we get Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700, which is equivalent to 7Q = 700.

Dividing both sides by 7, we get Q = 100.

Now that we know Q = 100, we can find B by substituting Q into the equation B = 2Q, which gives B = 2(100) = 200.

Finally, we can find W by substituting B into the equation W = 2B, which gives W = 2(200) = 400.

2 hours/day * 7 days/week = 14 hours/week

Now, we multiply the total hours spent playing video games by his hourly wage to find out how much he would earn:

14 hours/week * $10/hour = $140/week

Therefore, Jordan would earn $140 in one week if he spent his video game time working.

The final answer is: $140"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of food items and non-food items separately and then add them together, considering the 10% tax on non-food items.

Food items: milk and eggs
Cost of milk = 2 dollars
Cost of eggs = 3 dollars
Total cost of food items = 2 + 3 = 5 dollars

Non-food items: light bulbs, cups, and roach traps
Cost of light bulbs = 3 dollars
Cost of cups = 3 dollars
Cost of roach traps = 4 dollars
Total cost of non-food items = 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars

Since there is a 10% tax on non-food items, we need to calculate the tax amount:
Tax amount = 10% of 10 dollars = 0.1 * 10 = 1 dollar

Now, we add the tax amount to the total cost of non-food items:
Total cost of non-food items with tax = 10 + 1 = 11 dollars

Finally, we add the total cost of food items and non-food items with tax to find the overall cost:
Total cost = Total cost of food items + Total cost of non-food items with tax = 5 + 11 = 16 dollars

The final answer is: $16"
"To calculate the total profit, we first need to determine the total income and total expenses. 

Kim has 3 current clients and 5 potential clients, making a total of 8 clients. Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. 

Total bottles of bleach needed per week = 8 clients * 2 bottles/client = 16 bottles
Total packs of cloths needed per week = 8 clients * 1 pack/client = 8 packs

The cost of bleach per week = 16 bottles * $2/bottle = $32
The cost of cloths per week = 8 packs * $5/pack = $40

Total expenses per week = $32 (bleach) + $40 (cloths) = $72

Since Kim's total income per week is $92, we can calculate the profit as follows:

Profit per week = Total income - Total expenses
Profit per week = $92 - $72
Profit per week = $20

The final answer is: $20"
"To find the total number of pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to calculate the total number of pineapples per harvest and then multiply it by the number of harvests in a year.

First, let's find the total number of pineapples per hectare: 
100 pineapples/hectare * 10 hectares = 1000 pineapples

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, there are 4 harvests in a year (12 months / 3 months per harvest = 4 harvests).

Now, let's multiply the total number of pineapples per hectare by the number of harvests in a year:
1000 pineapples/hectare * 4 harvests/year = 4000 pineapples/year

Therefore, John can harvest 4000 pineapples within a year.

The final answer is: 4000"
"To find the total number of Lego pieces Johnny picks up, we need to calculate the number of pieces in each set and then add them together.

The first set has 500 pieces. 
The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first set, so it has 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces.
The third set has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first set, so it has (1/4) * 500 = 125 pieces.

Now, we add the number of pieces in each set together: 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125.

The final answer is: 2125"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of the bees that left in the first 6 hours return. So, 1/2 * 30 = 15 bees return.
3. The number of bees that have left but not returned so far is 30 - 15 = 15 bees.
4. In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees as the initial 30 leave the hive. So, 2 * 30 = 60 bees leave.
5. The total number of bees that left but not returned before this point is 15 (from step 3) + 60 (from step 4) = 75 bees.
6. In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left but not returned (75) come back to the hive.

Therefore, the number of bees Debra sees return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is 75.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total cost of the tickets and then add the change received to find the initial amount given to the cashier.

The cost of the child ticket is $10, and the cost of the adult ticket is $12. 

Total cost = cost of child ticket + cost of adult ticket
Total cost = $10 + $12
Total cost = $22

Since Brittany's mom received $8 in change, we can set up an equation to find the initial amount given to the cashier:

Initial amount = Total cost + Change
Initial amount = $22 + $8
Initial amount = $30

The final answer is: $30"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of friends Dorothy has on Facebook. Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends, we can set up the equation:

Charlie's friends = 3 * Dorothy's friends
12 = 3 * Dorothy's friends

To find Dorothy's friends, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

Dorothy's friends = 12 / 3
Dorothy's friends = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find James' friends by multiplying Dorothy's friends by 4, since James has four times as many friends as Dorothy:

James' friends = 4 * Dorothy's friends
James' friends = 4 * 4
James' friends = 16

The final answer is: 16"
"To determine the time it takes for each person to get home, we need to calculate the time it takes for Steve and Tim to cover their respective distances.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet, as the speeds are given in feet per minute. 

1 mile = 5280 feet
Steve's distance = 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15,840 feet
Tim's distance = 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10,560 feet

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for each person to get home.

Steve's time = distance / speed = 15,840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time = distance / speed = 10,560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 36 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve will be the winner. To find out how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to subtract the winner's time from the loser's time.

Waiting time = Tim's time - Steve's time = 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total amount of money Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total cost of inflating all the tires. 

First, let's calculate the cost of inflating the bicycle tires. Each bicycle has 2 tires, and there were 5 bicycles. So, the total number of bicycle tires is 5 * 2 = 10. The cost of inflating these tires is 10 * 25 cents = $2.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of inflating the tricycle tires. Each tricycle has 3 tires, and there were 3 tricycles. So, the total number of tricycle tires is 3 * 3 = 9. The cost of inflating these tires is 9 * 25 cents = $2.25.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of inflating the unicycle tire. A unicycle has 1 tire, and there was 1 unicycle. So, the total number of unicycle tires is 1 * 1 = 1. The cost of inflating this tire is 1 * 25 cents = $0.25.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the tires: $2.50 + $2.25 + $0.25 = $5.00.

The final answer is: $5.00"
"To find the total cost of the cookies, we need to calculate the total number of cookies and multiply it by the cost per cookie. 

Carl buys 10 packs of cookies, and each pack has 6 cookies. So, the total number of cookies is 10 * 6 = 60 cookies.

The cost per cookie is $0.10. Therefore, the total cost of the cookies is 60 * $0.10 = $6.

Since Carl pays with a $10 bill, the change he receives is $10 - $6 = $4.

The final answer is: $4"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of french fries as x.

1. Dave ate 14 fries, so the remaining fries are x - 14.
2. The seagull ate half of the 14 fries Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries. So, the seagull ate a total of 7 fries. Now, the remaining fries are (x - 14) - 7 = x - 21.
3. Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate a total of 3 * 3 = 9 fries. Now, the remaining fries are (x - 21) - 9 = x - 30.
4. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries, which is (2/3) * (x - 30). The remaining fries are (x - 30) - (2/3) * (x - 30) = (1/3) * (x - 30).
5. Ants carried off a final french fry, leaving 5 behind. So, the remaining fries are (1/3) * (x - 30) - 1 = 5.

Now, we can solve for x:

(1/3) * (x - 30) - 1 = 5
(1/3) * (x - 30) = 6
x - 30 = 18
x = 48

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in a semester, we need to calculate the total hours he spends in a week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a semester.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes, each lasting 1 hour. So, the total hours he spends on these days in a week is 3 * 1 = 3 hours.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes, each lasting 2 hours. So, the total hours he spends on these days in a week is 2 * 2 = 4 hours.

The total hours Kimo spends in a week is 3 + 4 = 7 hours.

Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, the total hours Kimo spends attending classes in a semester is 7 * 16 = 112 hours.

The final answer is: 112"
"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the length of each type of baked good in feet and then add them together.

First, let's convert the length of each type of baked good to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

- Each roll is 4 inches long, which is 4/12 = 1/3 feet long.
- Each croissant is 6 inches long, which is 6/12 = 0.5 feet long.
- Each baguette is 2 feet long.

Now, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good:

- Total length of rolls: 300 rolls * 1/3 feet per roll = 100 feet
- Total length of croissants: 120 croissants * 0.5 feet per croissant = 60 feet
- Total length of baguettes: 60 baguettes * 2 feet per baguette = 120 feet

Now, let's add the total length of each type of baked good together:

100 feet (rolls) + 60 feet (croissants) + 120 feet (baguettes) = 280 feet

"To determine the total number of bananas needed for 2 months, we need to calculate the monthly consumption of all the apes and then multiply it by 2.

The monkeys need 200 bananas per month, the gorillas need 400 bananas per month, and the baboons need 100 bananas per month. 

Total monthly consumption = 200 (monkeys) + 400 (gorillas) + 100 (baboons) = 700 bananas per month.

Since the zookeeper needs to order bananas for 2 months, we multiply the total monthly consumption by 2.

Total bananas needed for 2 months = 700 bananas/month * 2 months = 1400 bananas.

The final answer is: 1400"
"To determine the distance each person runs, we need to calculate the total distance for both Blake and Kelly.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Since he runs back and forth, the total distance he covers is 2 times the length of the field for each run. So, the total distance for Blake is 15 * 2 * 100 = 3000 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, covering 200 yards (2 * 100). Then, she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards (100 - 40) each way. So, the total distance for each of her runs to the 40-yard line and back is 160 yards (80 + 80). She does this 34 times, so the total distance for Kelly is 200 + (34 * 160) = 200 + 5440 = 5640 yards.

To find the difference in the distance run by the winner and the loser, we subtract the distance run by the loser from the distance run by the winner. Since Blake is the winner, the difference is 3000 - 5640 = -2640 yards. However, since distance cannot be negative, we can take the absolute value of the difference, which is 2640 yards.

The final answer is: 2640"

"To find the depth of the water in the tank on Wednesday, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. The initial depth of the water on Monday is 17 feet.
2. On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water, so the depth of the water on Tuesday is 17 + 7 = 24 feet.
3. On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday. To find two-thirds of 24, we multiply 24 by 2/3.

To multiply a number by a fraction, we multiply the number by the numerator (2) and then divide by the denominator (3). 

24 * 2 = 48
48 / 3 = 16

So, the depth of the water in the tank on Wednesday is 16 feet.

"To find the total number of fish caught by Anakin, we need to add the number of starfish, sea horses, and clownfish he caught. 

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. 

Total fish caught by Anakin = 10 + 6 + 3 = 19

Now, let's find the number of fish caught by Locsin. Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so he caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish. Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so he caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses. Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so he caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Total fish caught by Locsin = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

Now, we need to find the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin. 

Total fish caught = Total fish caught by Anakin + Total fish caught by Locsin
Total fish caught = 19 + 13
Total fish caught = 32

The final answer is: 32"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of exponential growth. The price of the bag of marbles increases by 20% every two months, which means that the price at the end of each two-month period is 120% of the price at the beginning of that period.

Let's break down the problem into 18 two-month periods (since 36 months is 18 periods of 2 months each). We'll calculate the price at the end of each period and then find the final price after 36 months.

Initial price = $20

Period 1: $20 * 1.20 = $24
Period 2: $24 * 1.20 = $28.80
Period 3: $28.80 * 1.20 = $34.56
Period 4: $34.56 * 1.20 = $41.47
Period 5: $41.47 * 1.20 = $49.76
Period 6: $49.76 * 1.20 = $59.72
Period 7: $59.72 * 1.20 = $71.66
Period 8: $71.66 * 1.20 = $86.00
Period 9: $86.00 * 1.20 = $103.20
Period 10: $103.20 * 1.20 = $123.84
Period 11: $123.84 * 1.20 = $148.80
Period 12: $148.80 * 1.20 = $178.56
Period 13: $178.56 * 1.20 = $214.27
Period 14: $214.27 * 1.20 = $256.73
Period 15: $256.73 * 1.20 = $307.67

"To find the total worth of all the toys, we need to calculate the cost of each type of toy and then add them together.

The cost of one action figure is $5. Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, the cost of the doll is 3 * $5 = $15.

One red car costs $4. Since there are 5 red cars, the total cost of the red cars is 5 * $4 = $20.

The total cost of the action figures is 3 * $5 = $15.

Now, we can add the cost of the doll, the red cars, and the action figures to find the total worth of all the toys: $15 (doll) + $20 (red cars) + $15 (action figures) = $50.

The total worth of all the toys is $50.

"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the difference in income between the two options.

If Jackie does her taxes herself, she'll lose $35/hour in missed income for 3 hours of freelance work. So, the total income lost is $35/hour * 3 hours = $105.

The cost of hiring the accountant is $90.

Now, let's calculate the difference in income between the two options. If Jackie hires the accountant, she won't lose any income from missed freelance work, so her income will be $0. If she does her taxes herself, she'll lose $105 in income.

The difference in income is $105 (lost income) - $90 (accountant's fee) = $15.

Therefore, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we need to calculate the total number of eggs required for 15 Spanish flans and divide it by the number of eggs she receives per babysitting session.

Each Spanish flan requires 3 eggs, so for 15 flans, the total number of eggs needed is:
15 flans * 3 eggs/flan = 45 eggs

Since Sandra receives 9 eggs per babysitting session, we can divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs received per session:
45 eggs / 9 eggs/session = 5 sessions

Therefore, Sandra needs to babysit 5 times to have enough eggs for 15 Spanish flans.

"Let's denote Brooke's current age as B and Seth's current age as S. We are given that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can express this as S = 2B.

In 2 years, their ages will be B + 2 and S + 2. The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write the equation: (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28.

Substituting S = 2B into the equation, we get (B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28.

Combine like terms: 3B + 4 = 28.

Subtract 4 from both sides: 3B = 24.

Divide both sides by 3: B = 8.

Since S = 2B, we can find Seth's age by substituting B = 8 into the equation: S = 2(8) = 16.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. We know Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
2. Since Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.
4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we have the ages of three birds: Sally Four (8), Granny Red (16), and Sally Two (19). The only bird left is the one at the Caboose, which is Sally Two's counterpart, Sally Two is not at the Caboose, Sally Two is one of the birds, Sally Four is not at the Caboose, Sally Four is one of the birds, and Sally Thirtytwo is not at the Caboose, Sally Thirtytwo is one of the birds.

"To find out how much Jessica pays in a year, we first need to calculate the increased minimum payments for each debt. 

The minimum payment for the student loans is $300, so 50% more than the minimum would be $300 + (0.5 * $300) = $300 + $150 = $450.

The minimum payment for the credit card is $200, so 50% more than the minimum would be $200 + (0.5 * $200) = $200 + $100 = $300.

The minimum payment for the mortgage is $500, so 50% more than the minimum would be $500 + (0.5 * $500) = $500 + $250 = $750.

Now, we need to add up the increased minimum payments for each debt to find the total monthly payment. 

$450 (student loans) + $300 (credit card) + $750 (mortgage) = $1500.

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the total monthly payment by 12 to find the total yearly payment.

$1500 * 12 = $18,000.

The final answer is: $18,000."

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total revenue and the total cost. 

Let's denote the number of gallons as 'g'. The total revenue is the number of glasses sold multiplied by the price per glass, which is 20g * $0.50 = $10g. 

The total cost consists of the cost of lemons and sugar. The cost of lemons is $3g and the cost of sugar is $2g. Therefore, the total cost is $3g + $2g = $5g.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $10g - $5g = $5g. We are given that the profit is $25, so we can set up the equation $5g = $25.

To find the number of gallons, we divide both sides of the equation by $5, which gives us g = $25 / $5 = 5 gallons.

Now that we know the number of gallons, we can find the cost of lemons by multiplying the number of gallons by the cost per gallon, which is 5 * $3 = $15.

Number of girls on the Chinese team = 160 - 60
Number of girls on the Chinese team = 100

The final answer is: 100"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations and calculate the remaining amount after each expense.

1. Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent: 
   1/4 of 6000 = 6000 * 1/4 = 1500

   Remaining amount after rent = 6000 - 1500 = 4500

2. Zaid spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel:
   1/3 of 6000 = 6000 * 1/3 = 2000

   Remaining amount after rent and fuel = 4500 - 2000 = 2500

3. Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity:
   Half of 2500 = 2500 * 1/2 = 1250

   Remaining amount after donation = 2500 - 1250 = 1250

4. Zaid gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$:
   Total amount given away = 200 + 700 = 900

   Remaining amount after giving money to his daughter and wife = 1250 - 900 = 350

Therefore, Zaid will still have 350 dollars after all these expenses and donations.

The final answer is: $350"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of crabs each person has. 

We are given that Bo has 40 crabs. Since Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, we can calculate Monic's crabs as follows:
Monic's crabs = Bo's crabs - 4
Monic's crabs = 40 - 4
Monic's crabs = 36

Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so we can calculate Rani's crabs as follows:
Rani's crabs = Monic's crabs + 10
Rani's crabs = 36 + 10
Rani's crabs = 46

Now, we can calculate the total number of crabs the three have together by adding the number of crabs each person has:
Total crabs = Bo's crabs + Monic's crabs + Rani's crabs
Total crabs = 40 + 36 + 46
Total crabs = 122

The final answer is: 122"
"To find the total amount Lloyd earned for the first two weeks, we need to calculate his earnings for each week and then add them together.

For the first week, Lloyd tutored 5 hours at $10 per hour, so his earnings for the first week are:
5 hours * $10/hour = $50

For the second week, Lloyd tutored 8 hours at $10 per hour, so his earnings for the second week are:
8 hours * $10/hour = $80

Now, we add the earnings for both weeks to find the total:
$50 (first week) + $80 (second week) = $130

The final answer is: $130"
"To find the number of votes the loser got, we first need to find the total number of votes the winner got. Since the winner got 3/4 of the votes, we can calculate this as follows:

Total votes = 80
Winner's votes = 3/4 * Total votes
Winner's votes = 3/4 * 80
Winner's votes = 60

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser got can be found by subtracting the winner's votes from the total votes:

Loser's votes = Total votes - Winner's votes
Loser's votes = 80 - 60
Loser's votes = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of white carnations and then calculate the number of red roses.

Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. According to the problem, Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations. This can be represented as:

200 = 5x

To find the value of 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 5:

x = 200 / 5
x = 40

So, the number of white carnations is 40.

Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, the number of red roses can be calculated as:

Number of red roses = 4 * x
= 4 * 40
= 160

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem.

Let's denote Mark's current age as M and Jean's current age as J. We know that J = M + 2.

Two years ago, Mark was M - 2 years old, and Jan was 30 - 2 = 28 years old. We are also given that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. This can be expressed as:

M - 2 = (1/2) * 28 + 5

Simplifying the equation:

M - 2 = 14 + 5
M - 2 = 19
M = 21

Now that we know Mark's age, we can find Jean's age by adding 2 to Mark's age:

J = M + 2
J = 21 + 2
J = 23

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total time for each team, we need to calculate the time for each runner and then sum them up.

The well-rounded team has each member running 400 meters in 55 seconds. Since there are four members, the total time for this team is 4 * 55 = 220 seconds.

The less well-rounded team's first runner runs 400 meters in 60 seconds. The subsequent runners are 3 seconds faster than the previous one, so the second runner runs 60 - 3 = 57 seconds, the third runner runs 57 - 3 = 54 seconds, and the fourth runner runs 54 - 3 = 51 seconds. The total time for this team is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 162 seconds.

The difference in time between the two teams is 220 - 162 = 58 seconds.

The faster team will win by 58 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, and then find the difference between these two probabilities.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die is the probability of rolling a 4, 5, or 6. There are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, 6) out of 6 possible outcomes, so the probability is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5 or 50%.

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5, since there are 3 even numbers (2, 4, 6) out of 6 possible outcomes. Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 = 0.25 or 25%.

Now, we need to find the difference between the two probabilities. The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 50% and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 25%. The difference is 50% - 25% = 25%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To find the total number of apples picked by Jenna and her mother, we need to determine the number of apples Jenna picked and add it to the number of apples her mother picked.

Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mother, and her mother picked 20 apples, we can calculate the number of apples Jenna picked by dividing the number of apples her mother picked by 2.

Jenna's apples = Mother's apples / 2
Jenna's apples = 20 / 2
Jenna's apples = 10

Now, we can find the total number of apples picked by adding the number of apples Jenna picked to the number of apples her mother picked.

Total apples = Jenna's apples + Mother's apples
Total apples = 10 + 20
Total apples = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of small rodents (rats and hamsters) and the total number of straw pieces distributed among them. We know that 160 pieces of straw are distributed among the small rodents.

Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as 'r'. Since there are 3 cages of rats, the total number of rats is 3r. The number of hamsters is given as 10.

The total number of straw pieces distributed among the rats is 3r * 6 = 18r (since each rat is given 6 pieces of straw). The total number of straw pieces distributed among the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50 (since each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw).

We know that the total number of straw pieces distributed among the small rodents is 160. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

18r + 50 = 160

Subtracting 50 from both sides of the equation gives us:

18r = 110

Dividing both sides of the equation by 18 gives us:

r = 110 / 18
r = 6.11 (approximately)

However, since the number of rats must be a whole number, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. 

The final answer is: 6"
"To calculate the total amount Mandy should pay, we need to calculate the interest accrued over 3 months and add it to the principal amount.

The formula for simple interest is: Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

Given:
- Principal (P) = $100
- Rate (R) = 2% or 0.02 (as a decimal)
- Time (T) = 3 months

Interest = P * R * T
= $100 * 0.02 * 3
= $6

Now, we add the interest to the principal amount to get the total amount Mandy should pay:
Total Amount = Principal + Interest
= $100 + $6
= $106

The final answer is: $106"
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total cost incurred by the trader and then find the total revenue generated from selling the bags. 

Let's denote the number of bags as 'x'. The total cost incurred by the trader can be broken down into two parts: the cost of buying the bags and the cost of transportation.

The cost of buying the bags is $20x, as each bag costs $20.

The cost of transportation is $2x, as each bag costs $2 to transport.

The total cost is therefore $20x + $2x = $22x.

The total revenue generated from selling the bags is $30x, as each bag is sold at $30.

The profit made by the trader is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost, which is given as $400. So, we can set up the equation:

Total Revenue - Total Cost = Profit
$30x - $22x = $400

Simplifying the equation, we get:
$8x = $400

To find the number of bags, we divide both sides by $8:
x = $400 / $8
x = 50

Therefore, the trader sold 50 bags.

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets, food, and rides, and then divide it by 3 to find out how much each friend paid.

First, let's calculate the cost of the tickets: 
3 tickets * $20.25 = $60.75

The cost of food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets:
$20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the rides:
2 rides * $33 = $66

The total cost is the sum of the cost of tickets, food, and rides:
$60.75 + $15.75 + $66 = $142.50

Since they agreed to split the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3:
$142.50 / 3 = $47.50

The final answer is: $47.50"
"To find the total number of peaches John collects, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends collecting peaches and then multiply it by the number of peaches he collects per minute.

John collects peaches for 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can find the total minutes by multiplying 3 hours by 60 minutes per hour:

3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Now, we know John collects 2 peaches per minute. To find the total number of peaches, we multiply the total minutes by the number of peaches per minute:

180 minutes * 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches

"To find the total amount of insects needed per day for the flock of ducks, we first need to calculate the total amount of insects needed per week for the flock. 

Since each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week, and there are ten ducks, the total amount of insects needed per week is 3.5 pounds/duck * 10 ducks = 35 pounds/week.

To find the amount of insects needed per day, we divide the total weekly amount by 7 days. 

35 pounds/week / 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net change in the number of trees Tom has each year and then account for the trees that die after 10 years.

Initially, Tom has 50 trees. 

Each year, he plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees, resulting in a net gain of 10 - 2 = 8 trees per year.

Over 10 years, the net gain would be 8 * 10 = 80 trees.

So, after 10 years, Tom would have 50 (initial trees) + 80 (net gain) = 130 trees.

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find the number of trees that die, we multiply 130 by 0.3: 130 * 0.3 = 39 trees.

Now, we subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees: 130 - 39 = 91 trees.

Therefore, Tom has 91 trees left.

The final answer is: 91"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos on Sue's front yard.

On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. They painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back out on Sue's front yard. This means there are now 6 white flamingos and 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos.

On Sunday morning, the neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection. Now, there are 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos.

The total number of flamingos on Sue's front yard is 30 pink + 6 white = 36 flamingos.

To find out how many more pink plastic flamingos were out than white plastic flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

"To find out how much change Violetta will get, we first need to determine the total cost of the crayons. Since she wants 5 crayons and each crayon costs $2, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of crayons by the cost per crayon.

Total cost = Number of crayons * Cost per crayon
Total cost = 5 * $2
Total cost = $10

Since Violetta prepared $20 for the purchase, we can find the change by subtracting the total cost from the amount she prepared.

Change = Amount prepared - Total cost
Change = $20 - $10
Change = $10

Total pounds of carrots distributed = 40 * 2
Total pounds of carrots distributed = 80 pounds

Now, we need to subtract the total pounds of carrots distributed from the initial amount of carrots to find out how many pounds will not be used.

Pounds of carrots not used = Initial amount of carrots - Total pounds of carrots distributed
Pounds of carrots not used = 200 - 80
Pounds of carrots not used = 120

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote the number of sentences Mark edits for each publisher as x. Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, we can say that x = 1000 / 2 = 500 sentences for each publisher.

Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence, so the total amount Mark earns from Publisher A is 5x = 5 * 500 = 2500 cents.

Since Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, the rate per sentence for Publisher B is 2 * 5 cents = 10 cents. The total amount Mark earns from Publisher B is 10x = 10 * 500 = 5000 cents.

To find the total amount Mark makes in a week, we add the earnings from both publishers: 2500 + 5000 = 7500 cents.

First, let's calculate the total amount John earns from his weekly salary for the year. Since he earns $2000 per week and works every week of the year (52 weeks), his total earnings from his salary would be:

2000 * 52 = 104,000

Next, let's calculate the 5% raise in salary. A 5% raise on his current salary of $2000 would be:

2000 * 0.05 = 100

So, his new weekly salary would be:

2000 + 100 = 2100

Now, let's calculate his total earnings from his new salary for the year:

2100 * 52 = 109,200

Now, let's add the one-time monetary reward of $5000 to his total earnings:

"To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the slices used for sandwiches, omelets, and the macaroni and cheese dish separately and then add them together.

For sandwiches, Carl ate 7 days' worth of sandwiches (since he ate one every day for a week) with 2 slices per sandwich. So, the total slices used for sandwiches = 7 * 2 = 14.

For omelets, Carl ate 3 days' worth of omelets with one more slice per omelet than per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 3 slices per omelet. So, the total slices used for omelets = 3 * 3 = 9.

For the macaroni and cheese dish, Carl used 8 slices.

Now, let's add the slices used for sandwiches, omelets, and the macaroni and cheese dish together: 14 (sandwiches) + 9 (omelets) + 8 (macaroni and cheese) = 31.

"To find the total number of pens Janet has now, we need to calculate the number of blue and red pens she bought and add them to her initial number of pens.

Janet initially had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, so she had a total of 22 + 10 = 32 pens.

She bought 6 bags of blue pens, with 9 pens in each bag, so she bought 6 * 9 = 54 blue pens.

She also bought 2 bags of red pens, with 6 pens in each bag, so she bought 2 * 6 = 12 red pens.

Now, we add the number of blue and red pens she bought to her initial number of pens: 54 (blue) + 12 (red) = 66.

Adding the blue and red pens to her initial number of pens, we get: 32 (initial pens) + 66 (new pens) = 98.

25 * 40g = 1000g

Next, let's find the weight of the candied apples. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, the weight of each candied apple is:

40g / 2 = 20g

Now, we can find the total weight of the candied apples:

80 * 20g = 1600g

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy and the total amount of money she has earned from babysitting. 

The total cost of the items is the cost of the jacket plus the cost of 2 pairs of shoes: 
$30 (jacket) + 2 * $20 (shoes) = $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved before she started babysitting. She earns $5 each time she babysits the kids, so the total amount she earns from babysitting is:
$5 * number of times she babysits.

Let's denote the number of times she babysits as 'x'. Then, the total amount she earns from babysitting is $5x.

The total amount she earns from mowing the lawn is $4 * number of times she mows the lawn. Let's denote the number of times she mows the lawn as 'y'. Then, the total amount she earns from mowing the lawn is $4y.

The total amount of money she has is the sum of the money she already had, the money she earned from babysitting, and the money she earned from mowing the lawn:
$10 (initial savings) + $5x (babysitting) + $4y (mowing the lawn).

Since Sara wants to buy the jacket and shoes, the total amount of money she has must be greater than or equal to the total cost of the items:
$10 + $5x + $4y ≥ $70.

We want to find the minimum number of times she must mow the lawn, so we want to find the smallest value of 'y' that satisfies the inequality. To do this, we can first subtract $10 from both sides of the inequality:
$5x + $4y ≥ $60.

Since we want to find the minimum value of 'y', we can try to find the smallest value of 'x' that satisfies the inequality. We know that 'x' must be an integer (since it represents the number of times Sara babysits), so we can try different values of 'x' to find the smallest one that satisfies the inequality.

If x = 10, then $5x = $50, and $50 + $4y ≥ $60. Subtracting $50 from both sides gives $4y ≥ $10. Dividing both sides by $4 gives y ≥ 2.5. Since 'y' must be an integer, this means that if x = 10, y must be at least 3.

If x = 11, then $5x = $55, and $55 + $4y ≥ $60. Subtracting $55 from both sides gives $4y ≥ $5. Dividing both sides by $4 gives y ≥ 1.25. Since 'y' must be an integer, this means that if x = 11, y must be at least 2.

If x = 12, then $5x = $60, and $60 + $4y ≥ $60. Subtracting $60 from both sides gives $4y ≥ $0. Dividing both sides by $4 gives y ≥ 0. Since 'y' must be an integer, this means that if x = 12, y can be 0.

However, if x = 12, then the total amount of money Sara has is $10 + $60 + $0 = $70, which is exactly the total cost of the items. This means that if Sara babysits 12 times and mows the lawn 0 times, she can afford the jacket and shoes.

Therefore, the minimum number of times Sara must mow the lawn is 0.

We also know that each red chicken produces 3 eggs per day and each white chicken produces 5 eggs per day. The total number of eggs collected per day is 42. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

3R + 5W = 42

Substituting W = R + 2 into the equation, we get:

3R + 5(R + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3R + 5R + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8R + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8R = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

R = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the time Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park, as he walks around the edge. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the dimensions of the park, l = 6 miles and w = 1.5 miles, we can substitute these values into the formula:

P = 2(6 + 1.5)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles/hour, the time he spends walking is the total distance divided by his speed:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we can start by defining the number of customers Sloane counted on the first day as 'x'. 

On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so the number of customers on the second day is x + 50.

The total number of customers by the third day was 500, which is the sum of the customers from the first two days plus the customers on the third day. We can write this as an equation:

x + (x + 50) + y = 500

However, we are not given the number of customers on the third day, but we are given the total for the first two days. So, we can rewrite the equation as:

x + (x + 50) = 500 - y

Combine like terms:

2x + 50 = 500 - y

We know that the total number of customers for the first two days is 100 + 50 = 150. So, we can rewrite the equation as:

2x + 50 = 500 - y
2x + 50 = 150 + y

Subtract 50 from both sides:

2x = 100 + y

Subtract y from both sides:

2x - y = 100

We know that the total number of customers for the first two days is 150, and we are looking for the number of customers on the third day. We can write an equation for the total number of customers for the first two days:

x + (x + 50) = 150

Combine like terms:

2x + 50 = 150

Subtract 50 from both sides:

2x = 100

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 50

Now that we know the number of customers on the first day, we can find the number of customers on the second day:

x + 50 = 50 + 50 = 100

Now that we know the number of customers on the first two days, we can find the number of customers on the third day:

Total customers = 500
Customers on the first two days = 150
Customers on the third day = 500 - 150 = 350

The final answer is: 350"
"Let's denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as 'x' gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the initial amount of water in the big pool is 2x gallons.

Since both pools leak at 4 gallons/minute, the rate of water loss for both pools is 8 gallons/minute. 

In 4 minutes, the total water lost from both pools is 8 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 32 gallons.

The big pool initially had 2x gallons of water. After losing 32 gallons, it has 2x - 32 gallons of water. 

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as 'y'. Then, the current amount of water in the big pool is 4y.

We can set up the equation: 2x - 32 = 4y.

We also know that the small pool initially had x gallons of water and lost 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons of water. So, the current amount of water in the small pool is x - 16 gallons.

Since the current amount of water in the small pool is y, we can set up the equation: x - 16 = y.

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can substitute the expression for y from the second equation into the first equation:

2x - 32 = 4(x - 16)

Expanding the equation, we get:
2x - 32 = 4x - 64

Subtracting 2x from both sides, we get:
-32 = 2x - 64

Adding 64 to both sides, we get:
32 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
x = 16

Now that we know x, we can find y:
y = x - 16
y = 16 - 16
y = 0

However, this is the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago. To find the current amount of water in the small pool, we need to add the water lost in the last 4 minutes:
Current water in the small pool = y + 16
Current water in the small pool = 0 + 16
Current water in the small pool = 16

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy and then divide that by her hourly wage.

The total cost of the items is the sum of the cost of the shoes and the belt: $320.00 + $32.00 = $352.00.

Now, we divide the total cost by Lori's hourly wage: $352.00 ÷ $8.00 = 44 hours.

The final answer is: 44"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Janeth will pay back, including the interest, and then subtract the total amount paid from the initial amount borrowed.

First, let's calculate the total interest Janeth will pay. The interest is 10% of the initial amount borrowed, which is $2000. 

Interest = 10% of $2000 = 0.1 * $2000 = $200

The total amount Janeth will pay back is the initial amount borrowed plus the interest: 
Total amount = $2000 + $200 = $2200

Since Janeth will pay $165 a month for 12 months, the total amount she will pay is:
Total amount paid = $165 * 12 = $1980

Now, let's calculate the remaining balance by subtracting the total amount paid from the total amount Janeth will pay back:
Remaining balance = Total amount - Total amount paid
= $2200 - $1980
= $220

The final answer is: $220"
"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to determine the number of dahlias and add it to the number of roses. 

First, we know there are 4 roses in the vase. Then, we are told there are 7 more dahlias than roses. This means the number of dahlias is 4 (number of roses) + 7 (additional dahlias) = 11 dahlias.

Now, to find the total number of flowers, we add the number of roses to the number of dahlias: 4 (roses) + 11 (dahlias) = 15.

The final numerical answer is: 15"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the current ages of Adrian and Zack. 

Given that Harriet is 21 years old, and she is half the age of Zack, we can find Zack's age by multiplying Harriet's age by 2. 

Zack's age = 2 * Harriet's age = 2 * 21 = 42 years.

Since Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, we can find Adrian's age by multiplying Harriet's age by 3.

Adrian's age = 3 * Harriet's age = 3 * 21 = 63 years.

Now, we need to find the average age of the three in three years. To do this, we first need to find their ages in three years.

Harriet's age in three years = 21 + 3 = 24 years.
Zack's age in three years = 42 + 3 = 45 years.
Adrian's age in three years = 63 + 3 = 66 years.

Now, we can find the average age of the three in three years by adding their ages and dividing by 3.

Average age = (24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45 years.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the number of points Jojo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Yuri and Brianna. 

We know that Naomi scored 68 points. 

Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. 10 more than that is 34 + 10 = 44 points for Yuri.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

The total points scored by the four students is 251. We already know that Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna scored 68, 44, and 85 points respectively. 

So, the total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna is 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points.

To find the points scored by Jojo, we subtract the total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points scored by all four students. 

Jojo's points = Total points - (Naomi's points + Yuri's points + Brianna's points)
Jojo's points = 251 - 197
Jojo's points = 54

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Calculate the amount of water left in the tank after Celine used 90 liters: 
   Initial water in the tank = 120 liters
   Water used by Celine = 90 liters
   Water left in the tank = Initial water in the tank - Water used by Celine
   Water left in the tank = 120 - 90 = 30 liters

2. Calculate the amount of rainwater collected:
   The amount of rainwater collected is twice as much as the water left in the tank.
   Rainwater collected = 2 * Water left in the tank
   Rainwater collected = 2 * 30 = 60 liters

3. Calculate the total amount of water in the tank now:
   Total water in the tank now = Water left in the tank + Rainwater collected
   Total water in the tank now = 30 + 60 = 90 liters

"To find the total number of flowers Andy plants, we need to calculate the number of petunias and add it to the number of geraniums.

First, let's find the number of petunias. Since Andy plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, we subtract 40 from the number of geraniums:

Number of petunias = Number of geraniums - 40
= 90 - 40
= 50

Now, we add the number of geraniums and petunias to find the total number of flowers:

Total flowers = Number of geraniums + Number of petunias
= 90 + 50
= 140

The final answer is: 140"
"To find the total amount spent on advertising for the two years, we first need to calculate the amount spent in the second year. 

The company spends a third of $15000 on advertising for the second year. To find a third of $15000, we divide $15000 by 3.

$15000 / 3 = $5000

Now, we add the amount spent in the first year to the amount spent in the second year to find the total amount spent on advertising for the two years.

$15000 + $5000 = $20000

The total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is $20000."

"To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we need to first calculate the total number of cards James has after losing 8 water type and buying 14 grass type. 

Initially, James has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type. 

After losing 8 water type, he has 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards.

After buying 14 grass type, he has 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards.

The total number of cards James has now is 30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96 cards.

The probability of picking a water type card is the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards, which is 32/96.

To find the percentage, we multiply by 100: (32/96) * 100 = 33.333...

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type is 33."
"To find out how much Chad still owes, we need to calculate the total cost of his meal and then subtract the gift card amount.

The base burrito costs $6.50. 
He adds extra meat for $2.00, extra cheese for $1.00, avocado for $1.00, and 2 sauces for $0.25 each, which is 2 * $0.25 = $0.50. 
So, the total cost of the add-ons is $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $4.50.
The total cost of the meal before the upgrade is $6.50 + $4.50 = $11.00.
He upgrades his meal for an extra $3.00, so the new total is $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00.
He has a gift card for $5.00, so we subtract this from the total: $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the combined rate at which Kalinda and her mom can complete the puzzle. 

Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute. Her mom can add half as many pieces per minute, which is 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute.

The combined rate is the sum of their individual rates: 4 pieces/minute (Kalinda) + 2 pieces/minute (her mom) = 6 pieces/minute.

Since the puzzle has 360 pieces, we need to divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate to find the time it will take to complete the puzzle in minutes: 360 pieces / 6 pieces/minute = 60 minutes.

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour.

Therefore, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, the farm had 120 baby watermelons.

After two months, 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest. To find 30% of 120, we multiply 120 by 0.3.

120 * 0.3 = 36

So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest after two months. This means 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons were not ready for harvest after two months.

When Ashlyn came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready for harvest. To find 3/4 of 84, we multiply 84 by 3/4.

84 * (3/4) = 63

So, 63 watermelons were ready for harvest after two weeks. This means 84 - 63 = 21 watermelons were not ready for harvest after the two weeks.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total cost of the cars, the tax on the cars, and the registration fees.

The total cost of the cars is the price of one car multiplied by the number of cars: 12 * $20,000 = $240,000.

The tax on the cars is 10% of the total cost of the cars: 0.10 * $240,000 = $24,000.

The registration fees are $1000 per car, so the total registration fees are: 12 * $1000 = $12,000.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees: $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of shells Kylie collected on Monday. We are given that Robert collected 20 shells on Monday, and Kylie collected 5 more shells than Robert. 

Let's denote the number of shells Robert collected on Monday as R. Then, the number of shells Kylie collected on Monday is R + 5. We are given that R = 20, so Kylie collected 20 + 5 = 25 shells on Monday.

On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. To find the number of shells Kylie collected on Tuesday, we multiply the number of shells she collected on Monday by 2. 

Kylie collected 25 shells on Monday, so she collected 25 * 2 = 50 shells on Tuesday.

"To find the number of penguins left sunbathing, we first need to determine how many penguins are involved in each activity. 

One-third of the penguins jump in and swim in the ocean. Since there are 36 penguins, one-third of them would be 36 / 3 = 12 penguins. 

Another one-third of the penguins go inside the cave to eat their dinner. Again, one-third of 36 penguins would be 12 penguins.

Now, we need to find the total number of penguins that are not sunbathing. We have 12 penguins in the ocean and 12 penguins in the cave, which makes a total of 12 + 12 = 24 penguins not sunbathing.

To find the number of penguins left sunbathing, we subtract the number of penguins not sunbathing from the total number of penguins. So, 36 - 24 = 12 penguins are left sunbathing.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of tomatoes Steve eats per week and then divide that by the number of tomatoes a vine can produce per week.

First, we know Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate the total number of tomatoes he eats per week:

6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, we can assume his girlfriend eats half as much as Steve. Therefore, his girlfriend eats:

6 tomatoes/day / 2 = 3 tomatoes/day

The total number of tomatoes his girlfriend eats per week is:

3 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 21 tomatoes/week

The total number of tomatoes they both eat per week is:

42 tomatoes/week (Steve) + 21 tomatoes/week (girlfriend) = 63 tomatoes/week

Since a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week, we can divide the total number of tomatoes they eat per week by the number of tomatoes a vine can produce per week to find the number of vines needed:

63 tomatoes/week / 3 tomatoes/week/vine = 21 vines

Therefore, Steve needs 21 vines to produce enough tomatoes for himself and his girlfriend.

"To determine the number of pizzas John needs to order, we need to calculate the total number of slices required and then divide that by the number of slices per pizza.

First, let's calculate the total number of slices required: 
Total friends = 20
Slices per friend = 4
Total slices required = Total friends * Slices per friend
Total slices required = 20 * 4
Total slices required = 80

Since pizzas are sold in 8 slices, we need to divide the total slices required by 8 to find the number of pizzas needed:
Total slices required = 80
Slices per pizza = 8
Number of pizzas = Total slices required / Slices per pizza
Number of pizzas = 80 / 8
Number of pizzas = 10

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas to ensure each of his 20 friends gets 4 slices.

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the process of mixing the ink from empty pens to make new ones. 

Initially, Ram buys 25 pens. 

When the ink runs low, he mixes the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 full pen. This means that for every 5 empty pens, he gets 1 new pen. 

So, the number of new pens he gets from the first 5 empty pens is 1. 

From the next 5 empty pens, he gets 1 new pen, and so on. 

This process continues until all 25 pens are used up. 

To find the total number of new pens he gets, we can divide 25 by 5, which gives us 5. This means he gets 5 new pens from the 25 empty pens. 

However, we also need to include the initial 25 pens that he bought. 

Therefore, the total number of pens he gets is 25 (initial pens) + 5 (new pens) = 30.

"To find the final amount of money Johnny had after a year, we need to follow the steps of the problem.

1. Johnny started with an allowance of $20 and added an extra $10 to it. So, the initial amount of money he had is $20 + $10 = $30.

2. He then invested this sum of money, which tripled in a year. This means that the amount of money he had after a year is three times the initial amount. 

3. To find the final amount, we multiply the initial amount by 3: $30 * 3 = $90.

Therefore, the final amount of money Johnny had after a year is $90.

"To find the sum of the ages of the three girls, we need to determine the ages of Mary and Joan first.

Given that Jessa is 20 years old, and Joan is five years older than Jessa, we can calculate Joan's age as follows:
Joan's age = Jessa's age + 5
Joan's age = 20 + 5
Joan's age = 25

Since Mary is two years younger than Joan, we can calculate Mary's age as follows:
Mary's age = Joan's age - 2
Mary's age = 25 - 2
Mary's age = 23

Now that we have the ages of all three girls, we can find the sum of their ages:
Sum of ages = Jessa's age + Joan's age + Mary's age
Sum of ages = 20 + 25 + 23
Sum of ages = 68

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Initially, there are 1000 students in the hall.

First, 30% of the students went out through exit A. To find the number of students who went out through exit A, we calculate 30% of 1000:

30% of 1000 = 0.3 * 1000 = 300 students

So, 300 students went out through exit A, leaving 1000 - 300 = 700 students in the hall.

Next, 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B. To find the number of students who went out through exit B, we calculate 3/5 of 700:

3/5 * 700 = (3 * 700) / 5 = 2100 / 5 = 420 students

So, 420 students went out through exit B, leaving 700 - 420 = 280 students in the hall.

The rest of the students went out through exit C. Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many candies Robert has. Since John has twice as many candies as Robert and John has 54 candies, we can set up the equation:

2x = 54, where x is the number of candies Robert has.

Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get:

x = 54 / 2
x = 27

So, Robert has 27 candies. Since James has 6 more candies than Robert, we can find the number of candies James has by adding 6 to Robert's total:

James' candies = 27 + 6
James' candies = 33

Now, we can find the difference between the number of candies John and James have:

Difference = John's candies - James' candies
Difference = 54 - 33
Difference = 21

Therefore, John has 21 more candies than James.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Dolly has 2 books and Pandora has 1 book. 

Dolly will read her own 2 books and Pandora's 1 book, so Dolly will read a total of 3 books.

Pandora will read her own 1 book and Dolly's 2 books, so Pandora will read a total of 3 books.

In total, they will read 3 (Dolly's total) + 3 (Pandora's total) = 6 books.

However, we need to consider that they also read each other's books. This means that Dolly will read Pandora's book and Pandora will read Dolly's book, but this is already accounted for in the previous count.

Therefore, the total number of books they will collectively read by the end is 6.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of letters Mike receives and responds to, and then calculate the total time spent writing.

First, let's find the total number of letters Mike receives from his remaining 3 pen pals. Since each of them sends 2 letters a week, the total number of letters received is 3 * 2 = 6 letters per week.

Since Mike responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters per week.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pages written. Each letter is 5 pages long, so the total number of pages written per week is 6 (letters received) + 6 (letters sent) = 12 pages per week.

Since Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time spent writing per week is 12 pages * 6 minutes/page = 72 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). So, the total time spent writing per week is 72 minutes / 60 = 1.2 hours.

The final numerical answer is: 1.2"
"To find out how many minutes Jason has left, we need to calculate the total minutes used for the calls with his boss and the extra minutes, and then subtract that from the total minutes available in the plan.

First, let's calculate the total minutes used for the calls with his boss. Since Jason has a 15-minute call with his boss every day and there are 30 days in the month, the total minutes used for these calls is:

15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes

Next, we add the extra 300 minutes used for calls with other people:

450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from the total minutes available in the plan:

1000 minutes - 750 minutes = 250 minutes

So, Jason has 250 minutes left in his plan.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Griffin had 24 fries.

Kyle took 5 fries from Griffin. So, Griffin was left with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.

Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, which means Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Now, Griffin is left with 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

Ginger gave Griffin a certain number of fries, let's call it 'x'. After this, Griffin had 9 + x fries.

Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had taken, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. So, after Colby took 2 fries, Griffin was left with 9 + x - 2 = 7 + x fries.

We are given that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. Therefore, we can set up the equation 7 + x = 27.

To find the value of 'x', we subtract 7 from both sides of the equation: x = 27 - 7 = 20.

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as x. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28.

According to the problem, this difference is twice the total number of fish, so we can set up the equation:

28 = 2(2x)

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

14 = 2x

Now, divide both sides by 2:

7 = x

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the total hours worked by the makeup artist. Since it takes 6 hours a day and she works 4 times a week for 5 weeks, the total hours worked is:

6 hours/day * 4 days/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours

The makeup artist charges $250 per hour, so the total cost before the discount is:

120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000

After the movie is done, the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount. To find the discount amount, we multiply the total cost by 0.10:

$30,000 * 0.10 = $3,000

The discount amount is subtracted from the total cost to find the final amount Jean paid:

$30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000

The final answer is: $27,000"
"To find out how much each person paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the party supplies and then divide it by 3.

The total cost of the party supplies is the sum of the individual costs:
$12 (cake) + $43 (presents) + $15 (decorations) + $4 (invitations) + $22 (goodie bags) = $96

Since Isabelle and her two parents split the cost evenly, we divide the total cost by 3:
$96 ÷ 3 = $32

Each person paid $32."
"To find the total amount spent by the chef, we need to calculate the total weight of onions and then multiply it by the cost per pound.

The chef bought 4 bags of onions, each weighing 50 pounds. So, the total weight of onions is:
4 bags * 50 pounds/bag = 200 pounds

The cost per pound of onions is $1.50. Therefore, the total amount spent by the chef is:
200 pounds * $1.50/pound = $300

The final answer is: $300"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cookies Sue ate on both days and then calculate the total calories she consumed. 

On Monday, Sue's sister ate 5 cookies. Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate 5 * 4 = 20 cookies on Monday.

On Tuesday, Sue's sister ate 13 cookies. Since Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate 13 * 2 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.

The total number of cookies Sue ate is 20 + 26 = 46 cookies.

Sue's sister ate a total of 5 + 13 = 18 cookies.

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, Sue consumed 46 * 200 = 9200 calories, and her sister consumed 18 * 200 = 3600 calories.

The difference in calories consumed is 9200 - 3600 = 5600.

The final answer is: 5600"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of girls in the school and then determine the number of boys. 

Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, the total number of students in the school is 3 classes * 20 students per class = 60 students. 

The total number of girls in the school is 50% of 60, which is 0.5 * 60 = 30 girls.

We are given that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. The total number of girls in these two classes is 15 + 12 = 27 girls.

Since the total number of girls in the school is 30, the number of girls in the third class is 30 - 27 = 3 girls.

Since the school is 50% girls, the number of boys in the school is also 30. 

The total number of boys in the first two classes is 20 - 15 = 5 boys in the first class and 20 - 12 = 8 boys in the second class. The total number of boys in the first two classes is 5 + 8 = 13 boys.

The number of boys in the third class is 30 - 13 = 17 boys.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the current number of apps on Travis's tablet, we need to subtract the number of apps he deleted and add the number of apps he downloaded.

Initially, Travis had 61 apps. He deleted 9 apps, so we subtract 9 from 61: 61 - 9 = 52.

Then, he downloaded 18 more apps, so we add 18 to 52: 52 + 18 = 70.

Therefore, the current number of apps on Travis's tablet is 70.

The final answer is: 70"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars. 

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's denote the number of cougars killed today as 'x'. Then, the number of wolves killed today is 3x.

We also know that Rick killed three fewer cougars today than the previous night. So, the number of cougars killed today is 15 - 3 = 12.

Since we know the number of cougars killed today is 12, we can set up the equation 3x = 12 to find the number of wolves killed today. Solving for x, we get x = 4.

Now that we know x, we can find the number of wolves killed today by multiplying 3 and x, which is 3 * 4 = 12.

To find the total number of animals killed, we add the number of animals killed last night and today. The total number of wolves killed is 10 + 12 = 22. The total number of cougars killed is 15 + 12 = 27.

The total number of animals killed is 22 + 27 = 49.

The final answer is: 49"
"To find the floor Bill is on, we need to calculate the floor he rides the elevator to. 

First, we need to find 4 times his starting floor, which is 4 * 3 = 12.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many times Anne went down the slide and then multiply that by 4 to find out how many times Robert went down the slide.

First, we know that Mitchel went down the slide 30 times. Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. To find 30% of 30, we multiply 30 by 0.3, which is 9. So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Now, we know that Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. To find out how many times Robert went down the slide, we multiply 21 by 4, which is 84.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we first need to determine the total number of cows Mr. Sylas has after buying 40 cows. Initially, there were 10 stalls with 20 cows each, so the total number of cows was 10 * 20 = 200. After buying 40 more cows, the total number of cows becomes 200 + 40 = 240.

Since Mr. Sylas divides the 40 new cows equally among the 10 stalls, each stall gets 40 / 10 = 4 additional cows. 

Now, each stall has 20 (initial cows) + 4 (new cows) = 24 cows. To find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows in one stall by 8: 24 * 8 = 192.

The final answer is: 192"
"To find the total amount of money in Brady's piggy bank, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and bill, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the value of the pennies:
100 pennies * $0.01 = $1.00

Next, let's calculate the value of the nickels:
40 nickels * $0.05 = $2.00

Now, let's calculate the value of the dimes:
20 dimes * $0.10 = $2.00

Finally, let's calculate the value of the dollar bills:
40 dollar bills * $1.00 = $40.00

Now, let's add up the values:
$1.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $40.00 = $45.00

The total amount of money in Brady's piggy bank is $45.00

$45.00"
"To find the total weight of the redwood tree, we first need to calculate the total number of 10-foot sections. 

The redwood tree is 200 feet tall, so we divide 200 by 10 to get the number of sections: 200 / 10 = 20 sections.

Each section weighs 400 pounds, so we multiply the number of sections by the weight per section: 20 * 400 = 8000 pounds.

Next, we need to find 30% of the total weight, which is the weight of the wood eaten by termites. To do this, we multiply the total weight by 0.3 (which is the decimal equivalent of 30%): 8000 * 0.3 = 2400 pounds.

Now, we subtract the weight eaten by termites from the total weight to find the remaining weight: 8000 - 2400 = 5600 pounds.

The final answer is: 5600"
"To find the total amount Nancy has to pay, we need to calculate the total cost of the overdue books and add the flat fee.

The cost of the overdue books is $0.50 per book, and she has 8 books. So, the total cost of the overdue books is 8 * $0.50 = $4.00.

In addition to the cost of the overdue books, there is a flat fee of $2.00 for having at least one book that's over a week overdue. This fee is not dependent on the number of books, so it remains $2.00.

To find the total amount Nancy has to pay, we add the cost of the overdue books and the flat fee: $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

The final numerical answer is: $6.00"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, and Andrea has 52 apples. So, Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.
2. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.
3. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits. 
Andrea has 52 apples and 24 bananas, so she has 52 + 24 = 76 fruits.
Jamal has 44 apples and 48 bananas, so he has 44 + 48 = 92 fruits.

The total number of fruits is 76 (Andrea's fruits) + 92 (Jamal's fruits) = 168.

The final answer is: 168"
"To determine the total amount of flour needed, we need to calculate the amount required for each day and then add them together.

For today, Carla is making 36 cookies. Since two cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many cups are needed for 36 cookies. 

First, let's find out how many dozens are in 36 cookies: 36 / 12 = 3. This means Carla needs 3 dozen cookies' worth of flour for today. Since 2 cups are needed for a dozen, Carla will need 3 * 2 = 6 cups of flour for today.

For tomorrow, Carla is making 30 cookies. Again, we need to find out how many dozens are in 30 cookies: 30 / 12 = 2.5. Since 2 cups are needed for a dozen, Carla will need 2.5 * 2 = 5 cups of flour for tomorrow.

Now, we add the flour needed for both days: 6 cups (for today) + 5 cups (for tomorrow) = 11 cups.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two-thirds of the pennies in the cup, we need to first calculate two-thirds of the total number of pennies and then convert that to dollars.

The total number of pennies in the cup is 9,300. 

Two-thirds of 9,300 can be calculated as (2/3) * 9,300 = 6,200.

Since each penny is worth $0.01, the total dollar amount in a stack that contains 6,200 pennies is 6,200 * $0.01 = $62.

The final answer is: $62"
"To find the total number of marbles Maddison has now, we need to calculate the initial number of marbles and then add the marbles she received from her friend.

Maddison initially has 5 boxes with 50 marbles in each box. So, the initial number of marbles is 5 * 50 = 250.

She then receives 20 marbles from her friend. To find the total number of marbles now, we add the initial number of marbles to the marbles she received: 250 + 20 = 270.

Therefore, Maddison now has 270 marbles."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of trees in each yard and then subtract the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard from the number of trees in Harry's yard.

First, we know that Chris has 6 trees. Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, so Ferdinand has 6 / 2 = 3 trees.

Next, Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. Twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has is 2 * 3 = 6. 5 more than that is 6 + 5 = 11.

So, Harry has 11 trees and Ferdinand has 3 trees. The difference between the number of trees in Harry's yard and Ferdinand's yard is 11 - 3 = 8.

"To find the total price of the house, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and the transfer fee, and then add them to the selling price.

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, which is 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500.

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price, which is 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000.

The total price of the house is the sum of the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee: $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

To find out how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we subtract her budget from the total price: $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know it takes 20 minutes for the oil to heat up to 300 degrees. Then, it takes 40% longer to heat up to 400 degrees. To find the additional time, we need to calculate 40% of 20 minutes.

40% of 20 minutes = 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes

So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat up the oil to 400 degrees.

After warming the oil, it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil. Since it took 28 minutes to warm up the oil, it will take 28 - 5 = 23 minutes to cook.

Therefore, the total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is the sum of the time it took to warm up the oil and the time it took to cook: 28 + 23 = 51 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, let's find the number of stitches in the collar. The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches in the body, which is 900. So, the number of stitches in the collar is 900 / 10 = 90.

Next, we know that the rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar. Therefore, the number of stitches in the rosette is 2 * 90 = 180.

Now, we know that the total number of stitches in the sweater is 1800. We have already accounted for 900 (body) + 90 (collar) + 180 (rosette) = 1170 stitches. To find the number of stitches in each sleeve, we subtract the total number of stitches accounted for from the total number of stitches in the sweater: 1800 - 1170 = 630.

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the remaining stitches by 2 to find the number of stitches in each sleeve: 630 / 2 = 315.

"To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the lines for each scene and the song, and then add them together.

The solo song has 54 lines.

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. However, only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has (4/5) * 60 = 48 lines from the second scene.

To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time it takes to dig the small holes and the total time it takes to dig the large holes, and then add these two times together.

First, let's calculate the total time to dig the small holes. Matthew takes 3 minutes to dig a small hole, and he needs to dig 30 small holes. 

Total time for small holes = Number of small holes * Time per small hole
Total time for small holes = 30 * 3 minutes
Total time for small holes = 90 minutes

Next, let's calculate the total time to dig the large holes. Matthew takes 10 minutes to dig a large hole, and he needs to dig 15 large holes.

Total time for large holes = Number of large holes * Time per large hole
Total time for large holes = 15 * 10 minutes
Total time for large holes = 150 minutes

Now, we add the total time for small holes and the total time for large holes to get the total time.

Total time = Total time for small holes + Total time for large holes
Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes
Total time = 240 minutes

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

Total time in hours = Total time / 60
Total time in hours = 240 minutes / 60
Total time in hours = 4 hours

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the current ages of Mico and Marco. Let's denote Mico's age as 'x' and Marco's age as 'y'. We know that their sum of ages is 20, so we can write the equation:

x + y = 20

We are asked to find the sum of their ages in 10 years. In 10 years, Mico's age will be x + 10 and Marco's age will be y + 10. The sum of their ages in 10 years will be (x + 10) + (y + 10).

We can rewrite the equation as (x + y) + 20. Since we know that x + y = 20, we can substitute this into the equation:

(x + y) + 20 = 20 + 20
= 40

So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40.

"Let's denote Ruby's current age as R and Sam's current age as S. According to the problem, we have two equations:

1. R = 6S (Ruby is 6 times older than Sam)
2. R + 9 = 3(S + 9) (In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam)

We can substitute the first equation into the second one to solve for S:

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the equation:

6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtracting 3S from both sides:

3S + 9 = 27

Subtracting 9 from both sides:

3S = 18

Dividing both sides by 3:

S = 6

So, Sam is 6 years old now.

Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week.
Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week.

Total stories in the first week = 20 + 40 + 60 = 120

In the second week, each of them doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week. 

Alani doubled her stories from 20 to 20 * 2 = 40.
Braylen doubled his stories from 40 to 40 * 2 = 80.
Margot doubled her stories from 60 to 60 * 2 = 120.

Total stories in the second week = 40 + 80 + 120 = 240

To find the total number of stories written altogether, we need to add the total number of stories written in the first week and the second week.

Total stories = Total stories in the first week + Total stories in the second week
Total stories = 120 + 240
Total stories = 360

The final answer is: 360"
"To find the current age of Ann's brother, we need to multiply Ann's age by 2. 

Ann's age is 9 years, so her brother's current age is 9 * 2 = 18 years.

In 3 years, Ann's brother will be 18 + 3 = 21 years old.

The final answer is: 21"
"To find out how many cents Kelly has left, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has and subtract the cost of the can of pop.

Kelly has 5 quarters, which is equivalent to 5 x 25 cents = 125 cents. She also has 2 dimes, which is equivalent to 2 x 10 cents = 20 cents. 

The total amount of money Kelly has is 125 cents + 20 cents = 145 cents.

Now, we subtract the cost of the can of pop, which is 55 cents, from the total amount of money Kelly has: 145 cents - 55 cents = 90 cents.

Therefore, Kelly will have 90 cents left.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the number of rows of 5-star, we first need to determine the total number of stars and the number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows.

The total number of stars in the 8-star rows is 3 * 8 = 24.
The total number of stars in the 6-star rows is 2 * 6 = 12.
The total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows is 24 + 12 = 36.
The total number of stars in the flag is 76.
The number of stars in the 5-star rows is 76 - 36 = 40.
Since each row has 5 stars, the number of rows of 5-star is 40 / 5 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the number of trucks needed, we need to calculate the total weight of the flagstones and divide it by the weight capacity of each truck.

First, let's calculate the total weight of the flagstones:

80 flagstones * 75 pounds/flagstone = 6000 pounds

Next, we'll divide the total weight by the weight capacity of each truck:

6000 pounds / 2000 pounds/truck = 3

So, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

The final answer is: 3"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the speed of the car in the slow lane. Since it's traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, we can calculate it as follows:

Speed of the car in the fast lane = 60 miles/hour
Speed of the car in the slow lane = 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour

Now, we know that both cars travel the same distance, which is 480 miles. We can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

For the car in the fast lane:
Time = 480 miles / 60 miles/hour = 8 hours

Since the car in the slow lane travels at half the speed, it will take twice as long to cover the same distance. Therefore, the time taken by the car in the slow lane is:

Time = 2 * 8 hours = 16 hours

The final answer is: 16"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem.

Ali has 22 medals. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.

Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

It's given that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. This means that the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have. Let's represent the total number of medals given out as 'x'. Then, we can write the equation:

39 = x / 10

To solve for 'x', we multiply both sides of the equation by 10:

x = 39 * 10
x = 390

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is 390.

The final answer is: 390"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of chocolate bars available. Since each packet contains 5 chocolate bars and there are 8 packets, the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

We know that each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, and there are 4 adults. So, the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 * 6 = 24.

Now, we need to find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children. This can be calculated by subtracting the number of chocolate bars given to adults from the total number of chocolate bars: 40 - 24 = 16.

Since there are 8 children, and the remaining chocolate bars are to be shared equally among them, we can find out how many chocolate bars each child will get by dividing the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children: 16 / 8 = 2.

Therefore, each child will get 2 chocolate bars.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total amount of money Susan earns, we need to calculate the total time she works and then multiply it by her hourly wage.

First, let's find the total time she works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total time.

Total time worked = 3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to convert the total time to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Now, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes:

150 minutes / 10 minutes/interval = 15 intervals

Since she earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by her earnings per interval:

15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

Therefore, Susan earns $75 for the online task.

The final answer is: $75"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the points each player has after the third round and then calculate the extra points they receive in the fourth round.

After the third round, Mike has 21 points. Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points. Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 2 * 21 = 42 points.

In the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. Mike has 21 points, which is not over 20, so he does not get an extra point. Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so he does not get an extra point. Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point.

The points after the fourth round are: Mike - 21, Jim - 18, Tony - 43.

To find the total points, we add the points of all three players: 21 + 18 + 43 = 82.

The final answer is: 82"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many oranges the sons will wash and then subtract that from the total number of oranges Will bought.

The oldest son is 8 years old, and the youngest son is half as old as the oldest, so the youngest son is 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

The sons will wash as many oranges as they are years old, so the oldest son will wash 8 oranges and the youngest son will wash 4 oranges. In total, they will wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

Since Will bought 15 oranges, the number of oranges left unwashed is 15 - 12 = 3.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the total count of activities, we need to calculate the number of exercises done on each day and then add them together.

On the first day, Darren does:
- 100 pushups
- 50 squats
- 20 dumbbell presses

Total exercises on the first day = 100 + 50 + 20 = 170

On the second day, Darren does:
- 20 more pushups than on the first day: 100 + 20 = 120 pushups
- Ten fewer squats than on the first day: 50 - 10 = 40 squats
- Doubles the number of dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses

Total exercises on the second day = 120 + 40 + 40 = 200

Total count of activities in the two days = 170 + 200 = 370

The final answer is: 370"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day and then divide the total amount of rice available by this daily consumption.

First, let's calculate the daily consumption of rice per person. Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 3 meals per day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner). 

Daily consumption per person = 0.2 kg/meal * 3 meals/day = 0.6 kg/day

Since there are 5 members in the household who eat rice every lunch and dinner, we can assume they also eat rice for breakfast. Therefore, the total daily consumption for these 5 members is:

Total daily consumption = 5 people * 0.6 kg/day/person = 3 kg/day

Now, we need to calculate how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last. 

Number of days = Total amount of rice / Daily consumption
= 42 kg / 3 kg/day
= 14 days

Since we want to find out how many weeks the rice will last, we need to convert the number of days to weeks. There are 7 days in a week.

Number of weeks = Number of days / 7
= 14 days / 7
= 2 weeks

Therefore, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 2 weeks. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we first need to calculate the total number of crates he sold in the week. 

Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he sold bread for 5 days (Tuesday to Thursday and the weekend). 

He sold 20 crates over the weekend, 15 crates on Tuesday, 12 crates on Wednesday, and 18 crates on Thursday. 

Total crates sold = 20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65 crates.

Since Sam's target was 120 crates, we subtract the total crates sold from the target to find the difference.

Difference = Target - Total crates sold
Difference = 120 - 65
Difference = 55

So, Sam was 55 crates off from his target for the week.

55"
"To find the total cost of the desk, we need to determine the last bid made by Carmen. 

Since there are 3 other people who bid once, and Carmen bids after each of them, the total number of bids made by the other 3 people and Carmen is 3 + 3 = 6. 

The initial bid is $200, and each subsequent bid increases by $50. To find the last bid, we can use the formula for an arithmetic sequence: 

Last bid = Initial bid + (Number of bids - 1) * Increment
Last bid = 200 + (6 - 1) * 50
Last bid = 200 + 5 * 50
Last bid = 200 + 250
Last bid = 450

However, this is the last bid made by one of the other people. Since Carmen bids after each of them, she makes 4 bids (one after each of the other 3 people and one after the last person). 

The last bid made by Carmen is the last bid made by one of the other people plus the increment, which is $50. 

Last bid made by Carmen = 450 + 50
Last bid made by Carmen = 500

The total cost of the desk is the last bid made by Carmen.

The final answer is: $500"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to calculate the total miles driven, the total cost of driving, and the total bonus paid.

1. Total miles driven: Since John goes to work and back each day, the total miles driven per day is 2 * 30 = 60 miles. He goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year, so the total miles driven per year is 60 * 5 * 50 = 15,000 miles.

2. Total cost of driving: John is charged $2 per mile driven, so the total cost of driving per year is 15,000 * $2 = $30,000.

3. Total bonus paid: John gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus paid per year is $150 * 12 = $1,800.

4. Total cost: The total cost is the sum of the total cost of driving and the total bonus paid, which is $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

The final answer is: $31,800"
"To find the total amount of time Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday, we need to add the time he exercised on both days. 

Time exercised on Sunday = 23 minutes
Time exercised on Monday = 16 minutes

Total time exercised on Monday and Sunday = 23 + 16 = 39 minutes

Since Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to multiply the total time by 2.

Total time Peter wants to exercise on Tuesday = 2 * 39 = 78 minutes

The final answer is: 78"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the folding process and how the pages are arranged. 

When a piece of paper is folded vertically, it creates two layers: the front and the back. 

For a 32-page tabloid, we can think of it as a stack of 32 pages. When folded, the first 16 pages (pages 1-16) will be on the left side, and the remaining 16 pages (pages 17-32) will be on the right side.

Since the paper is folded, the left and right sides will have the same number of pages, but they will be mirrored. 

To create the tabloid, we need to print the pages in the following order: 

- Left back: pages 1-16
- Left front: pages 2-16 (in reverse order, since the first page is on the back)
- Right back: pages 17-32
- Right front: pages 16-32 (in reverse order, since the last page is on the back)

However, we need to consider that the first page is on the left back, and the last page is on the right back. This means that the first page (page 1) is on the left back, and the last page (page 32) is on the right back. 

So, the correct order is:
- Left back: pages 1-16
- Left front: pages 2-16
- Right back: pages 17-32
- Right front: pages 16-1 (in reverse order)

Since we are printing the pages in this order, we can see that we need 2 pieces of paper to create the tabloid: one for the left side and one for the right side.

"To find out how much money Annika has left, we need to calculate the amount she spent on food and snacks, and then subtract that from the initial amount she brought.

Annika spent half of $50 on food and snacks, which is 50 / 2 = $25.

She also spent an additional $10 on rides.

So, the total amount she spent is $25 (food and snacks) + $10 (rides) = $35.

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount she brought: $50 - $35 = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many books Elise sold in the first year. We know that she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, and this year she sold 45 books. 

Let's denote the number of books sold in the current year as x. Then, the number of books sold in the first year is 2x. 

We also know that there are 50 unsold books, and the total number of books is 250. So, the total number of books sold in three years is 250 - 50 = 200.

We can write the equation: x + 2x + y = 200, where y is the number of books sold in the third year. However, we are not given the number of books sold in the third year, but we are given the sales number this year, which is 45. 

Since the sales number this year is the number of books sold in the current year, we can say that x = 45. 

Now we can find the number of books sold in the first year: 2x = 2 * 45 = 90.

Now we can find the number of books sold in the second year: 200 - 45 - 90 = 65.

The price of each book is $20, so the total amount of money earned in the second year is 65 * 20 = $1300.

The final answer is: $1300"
"To calculate Watson's total earnings for April, we need to calculate his earnings from his hourly wage and the weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate his total hours worked in a week: 
10 hours/day * 5 days/week = 50 hours/week

Since Watson earns $10 per hour, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:
50 hours/week * $10/hour = $500/week

Since Watson gets a $300 bonus each week, his total weekly earnings are:
$500/week + $300/week = $800/week

Now, let's calculate his total earnings for April, which has 4 weeks:
$800/week * 4 weeks = $3200

Therefore, Watson made $3200 in April if the company performed very well for the whole month.

The final answer is: $3200"

So, John lost to 4 people."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day.
2. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. 
   To find the number of loaves sold in the morning, we need to calculate two-thirds of 60.
   Two-thirds of 60 = (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves.

3. Half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening. 
   First, we need to find out how many loaves are left after selling 40 in the morning.
   Total loaves - loaves sold in the morning = 60 - 40 = 20 loaves.
   Half of the remaining loaves = 20 / 2 = 10 loaves.

Since the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is half of the remaining loaves.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which Joey loses weight and then use that rate to calculate how long it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight.

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. To find the rate at which Joey loses weight, we divide the weight lost by the number of weeks:

Weight loss rate = Weight lost / Number of weeks
Weight loss rate = 8 pounds / 4 weeks
Weight loss rate = 2 pounds per week

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, we can multiply the number of weeks it takes Joey to lose the weight by 4:

Time for Sandy = 4 weeks * 4
Time for Sandy = 16 weeks

"To find the total savings, we need to calculate the savings on the tubs of ice cream and the packets of milk separately and then add them together.

The original price of a tub of ice cream is $13, and it's now sold at $11. The discount on each tub of ice cream is $13 - $11 = $2.

If you buy 2 tubs of ice cream, the total discount will be 2 * $2 = $4.

The original price of a packet of milk is not given, but we know that it was sold at a discount of $0.5. Let's assume the original price of a packet of milk is x. The selling price of a packet of milk is x - $0.5.

Since we don't know the original price of a packet of milk, we can't calculate the discount on each packet. However, we can express the total discount on 4 packets of milk as 4 * ($x - (x - $0.5)) = 4 * $0.5 = $2.

Now, we can add the total discount on the tubs of ice cream and the packets of milk to find the overall savings: $4 + $2 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of new arms and legs grown by the person after 15 days.

The person grows an extra arm every 3 days. To find out how many arms they will grow in 15 days, we divide 15 by 3. 

15 / 3 = 5

So, the person will grow 5 extra arms.

The person grows an extra leg every 5 days. To find out how many legs they will grow in 15 days, we divide 15 by 5.

15 / 5 = 3

So, the person will grow 3 extra legs.

In total, the person will grow 5 extra arms and 3 extra legs. To find the total number of new limbs, we add the number of arms and legs.

5 (arms) + 3 (legs) = 8

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. Calculate the total cost of the business suits:
   Number of suits = 6
   Cost per suit = $100
   Total cost of suits = 6 * $100 = $600

2. Calculate the total cost of the suitcases:
   Number of suitcases = 3
   Cost per suitcase = $50
   Total cost of suitcases = 3 * $50 = $150

3. Calculate the cost of the flight ticket:
   Let's denote the cost of a business suit as 'x'. 
   The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit, so the cost of the flight ticket is 5x + $700.

4. Calculate the total amount spent so far:
   Total spent so far = Total cost of suits + Total cost of suitcases + Cost of flight ticket
   Total spent so far = $600 + $150 + (5x + $700)

5. Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip, so the total amount he can spend on gifts is the total amount he has minus the total amount he wants to save and the total amount he has spent so far:
   Total amount he has = $6000
   Total amount he wants to save = $2000
   Total amount spent so far = $600 + $150 + (5x + $700)
   Total amount he can spend on gifts = Total amount he has - Total amount he wants to save - Total amount spent so far
   Total amount he can spend on gifts = $6000 - $2000 - ($600 + $150 + (5x + $700))

6. Simplify the equation:
   Total amount he can spend on gifts = $6000 - $2000 - $750 - 5x - $700
   Total amount he can spend on gifts = $4150 - 5x

7. Now, we need to find the value of 'x' to calculate the total amount he can spend on gifts. We know that the flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit, so we can set up an equation:
   Cost of flight ticket = 5x + $700
   Since we don't know the cost of the flight ticket, we can't find 'x' directly. However, we can express the cost of the flight ticket in terms of 'x' and substitute it into the equation for the total amount spent so far:
   Total amount spent so far = $600 + $150 + (5x + $700)
   Total amount spent so far = $750 + 5x + $700
   Total amount spent so far = 5x + $1450

8. Now we can substitute the expression for the total amount spent so far into the equation for the total amount he can spend on gifts:
   Total amount he can spend on gifts = $4150 - 5x
   Total amount he can spend on gifts = $4150 - (5x + $1450 - $750)
   Total amount he can spend on gifts = $4150 - 5x - $1450 + $750
   Total amount he can spend on gifts = $4150 - 5x - $700

9. We know that the total amount he has is $6000, and he wants to save $2000, so the total amount he can spend is $6000 - $2000 = $4000. We can set up an equation:
   Total amount he can spend on gifts = $4000
   $4150 - 5x - $700 = $4000

10. Solve for 'x':
   $4150 - 5x - $700 = $4000
   $4150 - $700 = $4000 + 5x
   $3450 = $4000 + 5x
   $3450 - $4000 = 5x
   -$550 = 5x
   x = -$550 / 5
   x = -$110

11. Now that we have the value of 'x', we can find the cost of the flight ticket:
   Cost of flight ticket = 5x + $700
   Cost of flight ticket = 5 * (-$110) + $700
   Cost of flight ticket = -$550 + $700
   Cost of flight ticket = $150

12. Now we can find the total amount he spent so far:
   Total amount spent so far = $600 + $150 + $150
   Total amount spent so far = $900 + $150
   Total amount spent so far = $1050

13. Finally, we can find the total amount he can spend on gifts:
   Total amount he can spend on gifts = $4150 - 5x - $700
   Total amount he can spend on gifts = $4150 - 5 * (-$110) - $700
   Total amount he can spend on gifts = $4150 + $550 - $700
   Total amount he can spend on gifts = $4000

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a day and then multiply it by 7 to get the total number of eggs consumed in a week.

First, let's find out how many people eat 3 eggs each day and how many people eat 2 eggs each day. 

There are 5 people in the family, and 3 people eat 3 eggs each day. So, the number of people eating 3 eggs each day is 3. The remaining people eat 2 eggs each day, which is 5 - 3 = 2 people.

Now, let's calculate the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a day:

- 3 people eat 3 eggs each, so they consume 3 * 3 = 9 eggs.
- 2 people eat 2 eggs each, so they consume 2 * 2 = 4 eggs.
- Total eggs consumed in a day = 9 + 4 = 13 eggs.

Now, we multiply the total number of eggs consumed in a day by 7 to get the total number of eggs consumed in a week:

Total eggs consumed in a week = 13 * 7 = 91 eggs.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find Noah's current age. Since Cera is 46 years old now, and six years ago, Cera was 40 years old. At that time, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah's age six years ago was 40 / 2 = 20 years old.

Now, we know that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 * 20 = 60,000.

We are also given that the population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now. Let's denote the current population of Chile as P. Then, the population six years ago was P / 2 = 60,000.

To find the current population of Chile, we can set up the equation: P / 2 = 60,000. Multiplying both sides by 2, we get P = 120,000.

We are also given that there is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, so we can write another equation:

S = D/2

We know that the total number of players on the team is 105, so we can write the equation:

O + D + S = 105

Substituting the expressions for O and S from the first two equations into the third equation, we get:

2D + D + D/2 = 105

Combine like terms:

4.5D = 105

Divide both sides by 4.5:

D = 105 / 4.5
D = 23.33

Since the number of players must be a whole number, we round down to the nearest whole number, as you cannot have a fraction of a player.

D = 23

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total number of people invited, we first need to calculate the number of people from the 2 families with 6 people and the 3 families with 4 people.

For the 2 families with 6 people, the total number of people is 2 * 6 = 12.

For the 3 families with 4 people, the total number of people is 3 * 4 = 12.

The total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.

However, 8 people couldn't come due to illness. So, we subtract 8 from the total number of people invited: 24 - 8 = 16.

Then, 1/4 of the people who couldn't come due to illness had previous commitments. 1/4 of 8 is 2. So, we subtract 2 from the number of people who couldn't come due to illness: 8 - 2 = 6.

Now, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come due to illness and previous commitments from the total number of people invited: 16 - 6 = 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store, we need to calculate the total number of marbles first.

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and added them to a store that had 50. So, the total number of marbles in the store after buying from Johanna is 20 + 50 = 70.

His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna, his father gave him 2/5 * 20 = 8 marbles.

Now, the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store is 70 (initial marbles) + 20 (marbles bought from Johanna) + 8 (marbles given by his father) = 98.

Each marble weighs 2kgs, so the total weight of marbles is 98 * 2 = 196 kgs.

The final answer is: 196"
"To find the cost of filling the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (such as the pool) is V = length * width * height.

Given dimensions: 
- Length (L) = 6 feet
- Width (W) = 4 feet
- Height (H) = 5 feet

Volume (V) = L * W * H = 6 * 4 * 5 = 120 cubic feet

Now, we need to find the cost of filling the pool. The cost is given as $0.1 per cubic foot. 

Cost = Volume * Cost per cubic foot = 120 * 0.1 = $12

The final answer is: $12"
"To find the total number of children in the classroom, we need to calculate the number of girls, nongendered children, and then add them to the number of boys.

Given that there are 30 boys, and the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

Number of girls = 3 * Number of boys
= 3 * 30
= 90

Next, we are given that there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys. To find the number of nongendered children, we can multiply the number of boys by 1/10:

Number of nongendered children = (1/10) * Number of boys
= (1/10) * 30
= 3

Now, we can find the total number of children by adding the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:

Total number of children = Number of boys + Number of girls + Number of nongendered children
= 30 + 90 + 3
= 123

The final answer is: 123"
"To solve this problem, we can use the given ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This means that for every 1 electric pole, 3 electric wires are needed.

Let's denote the number of electric poles as 'x'. According to the given ratio, the number of electric wires will be 3x.

We are given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45. So, we can set up the equation:

3x = 45

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 45 / 3
x = 15

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required by the electric company to supply the electricity in the neighborhood is 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of people who left the party. We know that 1/4 of the total number of people left, and 22 men stayed. 

Let's denote the total number of people at the beginning as T. Since 1/4 of the people left, 3/4 of the people stayed. We can set up the equation:

3/4 * T = 22 + x, where x is the number of women who stayed.

We also know that the total number of people at the beginning is 25 + 15 = 40. So, T = 40.

Now, we can substitute T = 40 into the equation:

3/4 * 40 = 22 + x
30 = 22 + x
x = 8

However, this is the number of women who stayed. To find the number of women who left, we need to subtract x from the initial number of women:

Number of women who left = 15 - 8 = 7

Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, the total number of people who left is 1/4 * 40 = 10.

Now, we can find the number of men who left by subtracting the number of men who stayed from the initial number of men:

Number of men who left = 25 - 22 = 3

Since 3 men left, the number of women who left is 10 - 3 = 7.

The number of women who left is 7, but the question asks for the number of women who are left. We know that 8 women stayed, so the number of women who are left is 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the cost of the magazine, and then use that information to find the cost of the pen.

Since the magazine costs half as much as the book, and the book costs $4, we can calculate the cost of the magazine as follows:

Magazine cost = Book cost / 2
Magazine cost = $4 / 2
Magazine cost = $2

Now that we know the cost of the magazine, we can find the cost of the pen, which is $1 less than the magazine:

Pen cost = Magazine cost - $1
Pen cost = $2 - $1
Pen cost = $1

The final answer is: $1"
"To find the total number of pencils Jam has, we know she has 3 boxes and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils. We can set up an equation to represent this: 3x + 2 = 26, where x is the number of pencils in each box.

To solve for x, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: 3x = 26 - 2, 3x = 24.

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 3 to find the value of x: x = 24 / 3, x = 8.

Now that we know each box contains 8 pencils, we can find the total number of pencils Jam has: 3 boxes * 8 pencils per box = 24 pencils.

Since Jam has 24 pencils and her sister Meg has 46 pencils, the total number of pencils they have together is 24 + 46 = 70 pencils.

To find the number of boxes needed to store all the pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils per box: 70 pencils / 8 pencils per box = 8.75 boxes.

Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we round up to the nearest whole number to ensure all pencils are stored. Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

The final answer is: 9"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, let's determine how many ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, we can divide 65 by 13 to find the number of ice cubes needed:

65 / 13 = 5

So, 5 ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees.

Next, we need to find out how much the coffee is weakened by the ice cubes. Since each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, 5 ice cubes will make it 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters weaker.

Now, let's consider the effect of adding 15 milliliters of cream. Since any added liquid weakens the coffee, the total weakening effect of the cream is 15 milliliters.

To find the total weakening effect, we add the weakening effect of the ice cubes and the cream:

60 + 15 = 75 milliliters

Therefore, Shannon's iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.

The final answer is: 75"
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple ratio-based approach. Since 2 old records are traded for 1 new record, the ratio of old records to new records is 2:1.

Let's denote the number of old records brought in by the 5 people as 'x'. Since 5 people come in and leave with 7 new records, the total number of new records is 7. 

Given the ratio of old to new records is 2:1, for every 2 old records, 1 new record is obtained. Therefore, the total number of old records required to get 7 new records is 7 * 2 = 14.

However, this is the total number of old records required for 5 people to get 7 new records. Since there are 5 people, we need to divide the total number of old records by 5 to find out how many old records each person brought in.

So, the number of old records each person brought in is 14 / 5 = 2.8. However, since we cannot have a fraction of a record, we need to find the total number of old records brought in by the 5 people.

To find the total number of old records, we multiply the number of old records each person brought in by the number of people: 2.8 * 5 = 14.

However, this is not the correct answer because we are looking for the total number of old records brought in by the 5 people, not the number of old records each person brought in. Since the ratio of old to new records is 2:1, for 7 new records, the total number of old records is 7 * 2 = 14."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of junior programmers and the number of senior programmers. 

Given that the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, we can calculate it as follows:

Number of junior programmers = (2/5) * Total number of employees
= (2/5) * 100
= 40

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers can be calculated as follows:

Number of senior programmers = Total number of employees - Number of junior programmers
= 100 - 40
= 60

We are given that senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers. Let's denote the monthly salary of junior programmers as J and the monthly salary of senior programmers as S. We know that S = J + $400.

Given that the monthly salary of junior programmers is $2000, we can calculate the monthly salary of senior programmers as follows:

S = J + $400
= $2000 + $400
= $2400

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month by adding the total salary of junior programmers and senior programmers.

Total salary of junior programmers = Number of junior programmers * Monthly salary of junior programmers
= 40 * $2000
= $80000

Total salary of senior programmers = Number of senior programmers * Monthly salary of senior programmers
= 60 * $2400
= $144000

Total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month = Total salary of junior programmers + Total salary of senior programmers
= $80000 + $144000
= $208000

The final answer is: $208000"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as 'x'.

Initially, there were x people on the bus.

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the total number of people became x + 5.

At the second bus stop, 7 people got down, so the total number of people became (x + 5) - 7 = x - 2.

Then, 8 more people got in, so the total number of people became (x - 2) + 8 = x + 6.

We are given that the total number of people heading to the third stop is 20, so we can set up the equation:

x + 6 = 20

To solve for x, we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:

x = 20 - 6
x = 14

Therefore, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 14.

The final answer is: 14"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops and eats 2 on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left.

2. He passes 14 out to his friends, so he has 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops left.

3. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now, he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.

4. He eats 3 more lollipops that night, so he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops left.

5. He eats 2 more lollipops in the morning, so he has 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops left.

"To find the time it takes to fully charge the phone, we need to first determine the total number of percentage points the phone needs to charge. Since the phone is currently at 60% charged, it needs to reach 100% to be fully charged. 

The difference between 100% and 60% is 40 percentage points. 

Given that the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time it takes to charge 40 percentage points as follows:

Time = Total percentage points / Rate per minute
Time = 40 / (1/3)
Time = 40 * 3
Time = 120 minutes

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

Time = 120 / 60
Time = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we need to follow the sequence of events. Initially, Erin has 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her 10 more, so she now has 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops. Then, Erin gives 3 lollipops to Ella, leaving her with 17 - 3 = 14 lollipops.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's determine the rewards earned from the last shopping trip. The customer spent $80 and earns $1 off for every $20 spent. So, the rewards earned are $80 / $20 = 4. 

Now, let's calculate the rewards available for this shopping trip. The customer earned 4 rewards from the last shopping trip, and they used 1 reward on this shopping trip. So, the remaining rewards are 4 - 1 = 3.

The customer spent $43 on this shopping trip and applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. Since the customer had 3 rewards, the coupon took 2 * 3 = 6 dollars off the price.

Now, let's calculate the final amount the customer paid. The customer spent $43 and the coupon took $6 off, so the final amount paid is $43 - $6 = $37.

"To determine which job pays more, we need to calculate the net income for each job.

For Job A, the total income is $15/hour * 2000 hours/year = $30,000/year. The state tax rate is 20%, so the tax amount is $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000. The net income for Job A is $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

For Job B, the total income is given as $42,000. The property tax is $6,000, so the net income before taxes is $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000. The state tax rate is 10%, so the tax amount is $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600. The net income for Job B is $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

To find the difference in net pay, we subtract the net income of Job A from the net income of Job B: $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

"To find the final value of Maria's shares, we need to calculate the stock price after the first year and then after the second year.

Initially, Maria buys 8 shares for $8 each, so the total cost is 8 * 8 = $64.

The stock price increases by 50% in the first year. To find the new price, we multiply the initial price by 1.5 (100% + 50% increase).
New price after the first year = 8 * 1.5 = $12.

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. To find the new price, we multiply the price after the first year by 0.75 (100% - 25% decrease).
New price after the second year = 12 * 0.75 = $9.

Now, we multiply the new price after the second year by the number of shares to find the final value of Maria's shares.
Final value = 9 * 8 = $72.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of students in the two equal groups as 'x'. Since the last group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the last group is 'x - 10'.

We know that the total number of students in the class is 200, and the sum of the students in all three groups is equal to 200. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

2x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms again:

3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides of the equation:

3x = 210

Divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 70

Since the last group has 10 fewer students than each of the other groups, the number of students in the last group is:

x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60

"Let's denote the number of cows as C and the number of chickens as CH. We are given that the total number of animals is 60, so we can write the equation:

C + CH = 60

We are also given that Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, so we can write the equation:

CH = 2C

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first equation:

C + 2C = 60

Combine like terms:

Divide both sides by 3:

C = 20

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:

CH = 2C
CH = 2(20)
CH = 40

Now that we know the number of cows and chickens, we can find the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs and chickens have 2 legs, so the total number of legs is:

"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up equations based on the given information. Let's denote the weight of the blue beetle as B, the green toad as T, the yellow snake as S, and the red bird as R.

We know that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, and it weighs the same as the blue beetle and the green toad. So, we can set up the following equations:

B = 50
T = 50

We are also given that the pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake. Since the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can set up the following equation:

S = 50 + 10
S = 60

The yellow snake weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird. So, we can set up the following equation:

S = R + 20
60 = R + 20
R = 40

Now that we have the weights of all the animals, we can calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal. The total weight will be the sum of the weights of the animals and the weight of the container.

Total weight = B + T + S + R + container weight
Total weight = 50 + 50 + 60 + 40 + 20
Total weight = 220

"To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we need to calculate the total number of cookies consumed by her son and her husband, and then subtract that from the total number of cookies in a bag.

Jenny's son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, so the total number of cookies he eats in a week is 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

Jenny's husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so the total number of cookies he eats in a week is 1 * 7 = 7 cookies.

The total number of cookies consumed by Jenny's son and husband is 20 + 7 = 27 cookies.

Since each bag has 36 cookies, and Jenny's son and husband eat 27 cookies, the number of cookies left for Jenny is 36 - 27 = 9 cookies.

"To find the total amount Davos paid for the 2 shirts, we first need to calculate the discount amount. 

The original price of each shirt is $30. The discount is 40% of the original price. 

Discount = 40% of $30 = 0.4 * $30 = $12

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the discounted price of each shirt.

Discounted price of each shirt = Original price - Discount
= $30 - $12
= $18

Since Davos bought 2 shirts, we multiply the discounted price of each shirt by 2 to get the total amount he paid.

Total amount paid = Discounted price of each shirt * 2

"To find the percentage increase in the amount of money the factory is making per day, we need to first calculate the difference in the amount of money they are making per day now and the amount they used to make per day.

The factory used to make $100 per tractor and sold 10 tractors a day, so they made $100 * 10 = $1000 per day.

Now, they make $220 per silo and sell 5 silos a day, so they make $220 * 5 = $1100 per day.

The difference in the amount of money they are making per day now and the amount they used to make per day is $1100 - $1000 = $100.

To find the percentage increase, we divide the difference by the original amount and multiply by 100:

Medicine costs $100 per month.

The total monthly expenses are:
$100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine) = $220/month

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total annual expenses are:
$220/month * 12 months/year = $2640/year

The final numerical answer is: $2640"
"To find the total time spent on after-work activities, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and add them up.

1. Yoga class on Monday: 1 hour
2. Cooking class on Tuesday: 3 times the yoga class, so 3 * 1 = 3 hours
3. Cheese-tasting event on Wednesday: 0.5 hours (half of 1 hour)
4. Museum tour on Thursday: half the time of the cooking class, so 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours
5. Errands on Friday: 2 hours

Now, let's add up the time spent on each activity:
1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 7.5

The final answer is: 7.5"
"To find out how many plant pots April has left over, we first need to determine the total number of plant pots she needs for the school garden. 

The school needs 30 plant pots for the daisies. Since they need twice as many for the roses, we can calculate the number of plant pots needed for the roses by multiplying 30 by 2. 

30 * 2 = 60

So, the total number of plant pots needed for both daisies and roses is 30 + 60 = 90.

Since April had already bought 100 plant pots from the garden center, we can find out how many she has left over by subtracting the total number of plant pots needed from the number she bought.

100 - 90 = 10

Therefore, April has 10 plant pots left over. 

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how much Andrea saved, we need to subtract the amount she spent from the initial amount she had. 

First, let's calculate the total amount she spent. She spent $11 on a sweater and gave her brother $4, so the total amount spent is $11 + $4 = $15.

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount she had: $36 - $15 = $21.

Andrea saved $21."
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total time John spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows. 

John spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours swimming. 

He watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so the total time spent watching shows is 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

The total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows is 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours.

We are given that this is 70% of the total time (since 30% was spent sightseeing). Let's denote the total time as 'T'. We can set up the equation:

15 = 0.7T

To find the total time 'T', we can divide both sides by 0.7:

T = 15 / 0.7
T = 21.43 hours

Now, we need to find the time spent sightseeing, which is 40% of the total time. 

Time spent sightseeing = 0.4 * T
= 0.4 * 21.43
= 8.57 hours

The final answer is: 8.57"
"To find out how much money Annabelle still needs to save, we need to calculate her total earnings from both jobs and subtract the amount she already has in her savings.

First, let's calculate her earnings from the first job:
Earnings from first job = Hourly wage * Number of hours worked
Earnings from first job = $10/hour * 20 hours
Earnings from first job = $200

Next, let's calculate her earnings from the second job:
Earnings from second job = Hourly wage * Number of hours worked
Earnings from second job = $5/hour * 15 hours
Earnings from second job = $75

Now, let's find her total earnings from both jobs:
Total earnings = Earnings from first job + Earnings from second job
Total earnings = $200 + $75
Total earnings = $275

Finally, let's subtract the amount she already has in her savings from her total earnings to find out how much more she needs to save:
Amount still needed to save = Total earnings - Amount already saved
Amount still needed to save = $275 - $80
Amount still needed to save = $195

The final answer is: $195"
"To find the height of the tallest tree, we first need to determine the height of the second tree. The second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, which is 6 feet. 

So, the height of the second tree is 6 + 5 = 11 feet.

Next, we need to find the combined height of the two shorter trees. The shortest tree is 6 feet, and the second tree is 11 feet. 

The combined height of the two shorter trees is 6 + 11 = 17 feet.

The height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two shorter trees combined. 

So, the height of the tallest tree is 2 * 17 = 34 feet.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find out how much money Dean has left, we need to calculate the total amount of money he spent and then add the extra $10 his mother gave him.

First, let's calculate the total amount Dean spent on toy cars: 6 toy cars * $2 per toy car = $12.

Next, let's calculate the total amount Dean spent on teddy bears: 5 teddy bears * $1 per teddy bear = $5.

Now, let's add the cost of the toy cars and teddy bears to find the total amount Dean spent: $12 + $5 = $17.

Dean initially had $28. After spending $17, he had $28 - $17 = $11 left.

His mother then gave him an extra $10, so we add that to the $11 he had left: $11 + $10 = $21.

Therefore, Dean has $21 left.

The final answer is: $21"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the activities and then subtract that from Morgan's budget to find out how much money is left for her friends. 

The cost of mini-golf for Morgan and her friends is $5 per round, and they want to play one round. Since there are 'x' friends, the total cost for mini-golf will be $5 + $5x.

The cost of the go-karts is $10 per ride, and they want to ride twice. The total cost for the go-karts will be $10 * 2 = $20.

The cost of arcade tokens is $5.

The total cost for all activities is the sum of the costs for mini-golf, go-karts, and arcade tokens: $5 + $5x + $20 + $5 = $30 + $5x.

Morgan's budget is $90. To find out how much money is left for her friends, we subtract the total cost of the activities from her budget: $90 - ($30 + $5x) = $60 - $5x.

Since the money left for her friends is $60 - $5x, and this amount should be greater than or equal to 0 (because she can't invite a negative number of friends), we can set up the inequality: $60 - $5x ≥ 0.

To solve for x, we add $5x to both sides of the inequality: $60 ≥ $5x.

Then, we divide both sides by $5: $60 / $5 ≥ x.

x ≥ 12.

So, Morgan can invite 12 or more friends. 

12"
"To find out how much money Marisa saves in her piggy bank, we need to calculate the total amount she spends on lollipops and subtract that from the total amount she receives as pocket money over 5 days.

First, let's calculate the total amount she receives as pocket money over 5 days:
5 dollars/day * 5 days = 25 dollars

Next, let's calculate the total amount she spends on lollipops over 5 days:
4 lollipops/day * 25 cents/lollipop = 100 cents/day
Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we can convert this to dollars:
100 cents/day = 1 dollar/day
Over 5 days, she spends:
1 dollar/day * 5 days = 5 dollars

Now, let's subtract the amount she spends from the amount she receives:
25 dollars - 5 dollars = 20 dollars

So, Marisa puts 20 dollars in her piggy bank if she saves for 5 days.

The final answer is: $20"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how much change Billy has after buying the candy. Since the candy costs $1.5 a pound, we need to know how many pounds of candy he bought. However, we are trying to find that out, so let's call the number of pounds of candy 'x'. 

The total amount of money Billy has is $10. After buying the candy, he has $10 - $1.5x left. 

Now, let's consider the gumballs. Billy takes half of his change and spends it on gumballs. Half of his change is (10 - 1.5x)/2. Since each gumball costs $0.05, the total amount spent on gumballs is (10 - 1.5x)/2 * 0.05. We are given that he bought 40 gumballs, so we can set up the equation:

(10 - 1.5x)/2 * 0.05 = 40

Now, let's solve for x:

(10 - 1.5x)/2 * 0.05 = 40
(10 - 1.5x) * 0.05 = 80
0.5 - 0.075x = 80
-0.075x = 80 - 0.5
-0.075x = 79.5
x = -79.5 / -0.075
x = 1060

However, this is not possible since x represents the number of pounds of candy, and it cannot be negative. Let's re-examine the equation:

(10 - 1.5x)/2 * 0.05 = 40
(10 - 1.5x) * 0.05 = 80
0.5 - 0.075x = 80
-0.075x = 80 - 0.5
-0.075x = 79.5
-0.075x = 79.5
x = -79.5 / -0.075
x = 1060

This result is incorrect, so let's re-examine the equation again. The issue is likely due to the fact that we are trying to find the number of pounds of candy, but we are using the wrong equation. Let's try a different approach.

We know that Billy spent half of his change on gumballs. Since he bought 40 gumballs, the total amount spent on gumballs is 40 * 0.05 = 2. 

The amount of change Billy has after buying the candy is 10 - 1.5x. Half of this amount is (10 - 1.5x)/2. We know that this amount is equal to 2, so we can set up the equation:

(10 - 1.5x)/2 = 2

Now, let's solve for x:

(10 - 1.5x)/2 = 2
10 - 1.5x = 4
-1.5x = 4 - 10
-1.5x = -6
x = -6 / -1.5
x = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote Carver's age as C and his son's age as S.

We know that Carver is 45 years old, so C = 45.

We also know that Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son, which can be written as C = 2S - 5.

Substituting the value of C into the second equation, we get 45 = 2S - 5.

To solve for S, we need to isolate S on one side of the equation. We can do this by adding 5 to both sides of the equation, which gives us 45 + 5 = 2S.

This simplifies to 50 = 2S.

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for S, which gives us S = 50 / 2.

S = 25.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the total distance the train travels in one trip, we need to add the distances between the three cities. The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles, and the distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles. The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than the sum of the first two distances, which is 75 + 100 = 175 miles. So, the distance from the third city to the first city is 175 - 50 = 125 miles.

The total distance for one trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train travels this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles.

To find out how many days the train goes between services, we need to divide the total distance the train can travel before needing service (18,000 miles) by the total distance it travels in a day (900 miles).

18,000 / 900 = 20 days.

"To find the amount of stuffing needed for the collie beds, we first need to calculate the average amount of stuffing between the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds. 

The average amount of stuffing for a collie bed is (8 + 2) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for the chihuahua beds: 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.

Next, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for the collie beds: 3 * 5 = 15 pounds.

Finally, we add the total amount of stuffing needed for the chihuahua beds and the collie beds: 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total time taken for the trip, we need to calculate the time taken for each leg of the trip and then add them together.

For the first leg of the trip, John drives 200 miles at a speed of 70 mph. We can use the formula time = distance / speed to find the time taken for this leg:

Time = 200 miles / 70 mph = 2.86 hours (approximately)

However, he had to take a detour that added 10 miles to his trip. So, the actual distance for the first leg is 200 + 10 = 210 miles. We need to recalculate the time taken for this leg:

Time = 210 miles / 70 mph = 3 hours

For the second leg of the trip, John drives 240 miles at a speed of 80 mph. We can use the same formula to find the time taken for this leg:

Time = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours

Now, we add the time taken for both legs of the trip to find the total time taken:

Total time = 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours

The total time taken for the trip is 6 hours.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we first need to find the total number of students present on Friday. 

The total number of fourth-graders is 96, and 5 girls and 4 boys were absent, so the total number of absent students is 5 + 4 = 9. 

The number of students present on Friday is 96 - 9 = 87.

We know that 43 girls were at the school, and 5 girls were absent, so the number of girls present on Friday is 43 - 5 = 38.

To find the number of boys present on Friday, we subtract the number of girls present from the total number of students present: 87 - 38 = 49.

Therefore, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is 49.

The final answer is: 49"
"To find the total number of kids in the park, we need to determine the number of boys and then add it to the number of girls. 

Since there are twice the number of boys as girls, and there are 6 girls, we can calculate the number of boys by multiplying the number of girls by 2. 

Number of boys = 2 * 6 = 12

Now, we can find the total number of kids by adding the number of boys and girls.

Total number of kids = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total number of kids = 12 + 6
Total number of kids = 18

"Let's break down the information given:

1. 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.
2. A number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. 
   Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting as S. 
   We can write the equation: S = 4 * 3 - 5
   S = 12 - 5
   S = 7
3. Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. 
   Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for physical violence as V. 
   We can write the equation: V = 3 * S
   V = 3 * 7
   V = 21
4. If a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart, we can write the equation: 
   Total = 3 (refusing to wear masks) + 7 (shoplifting) + 21 (physical violence) + X (other reasons)
   50 = 3 + 7 + 21 + X
   50 = 31 + X
   X = 50 - 31
   X = 19

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of points Erin had before scoring 14 points. Let's denote the number of points Erin had before scoring 14 points as 'x'. 

Since Erin now has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8, we can express Erin's current points as 3 * 8 = 24. 

However, Erin's current points are the sum of the points she had before scoring 14 points and the 14 points she scored. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x + 14 = 24.

To find the value of 'x', we need to isolate it by subtracting 14 from both sides of the equation: x = 24 - 14.

x = 10

So, Erin had 10 points before scoring 14 points.

"To calculate the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to break down the costs into several components.

First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames. Each picture frame costs $20, and the etching costs an additional 20% of the frame's cost. 

20% of $20 is 0.20 * $20 = $4. 
So, the total cost of each picture frame is $20 + $4 = $24.

Since there are 44 seniors, the total cost of the picture frames is 44 * $24 = $1056.

Next, 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each. The total cost of the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the cords for the officers. 1/4 of the seniors are officers, which is 44 / 4 = 11 officers.

The cost of the cords for the officers is 11 * $12 = $132.

The total cost of the senior gifts is the sum of the costs of the picture frames, pins, and cords: $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

The final numerical answer is: $1198"
"To find the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we first need to calculate the materials cost. Since Ethan saves 20% by making it himself, we can assume that the materials cost is 80% of the market price.

The market price of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400. 

To find 80% of $400, we multiply $400 by 0.8 (since 100% - 20% = 80%).

Materials cost = $400 * 0.8 = $320

This is the cost of the materials. However, the question asks for the total cost, which includes the cost of the materials and any other expenses. Since the question does not provide any additional expenses, we can assume that the total cost is equal to the materials cost.

Total cost = $320

The final answer is: $320"
"To find the total number of tennis shoes sold, we need to calculate the number of shoes sold on each day and then add them together, subtracting the number of returns.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes sold on Friday, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the amount that they did the day before, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

The total number of shoes sold is the sum of the shoes sold on each day: 14 + 28 + 14 = 56 pairs.

However, six people returned their pairs because they didn't fit, so we need to subtract 6 * 2 = 12 shoes from the total.

The total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale is 56 - 12 = 44.

"To find the total amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we first need to calculate the value of the faulty equipment. 

The total value of the equipment is $400,000. The faulty pieces are 40% of the total, so we can calculate the value of the faulty equipment as follows:

Value of faulty equipment = 40% of $400,000
= 0.4 * $400,000
= $160,000

Since the company returned the faulty pieces, we need to subtract the value of the faulty equipment from the total value to find the value of the functioning equipment:

Value of functioning equipment = Total value - Value of faulty equipment
= $400,000 - $160,000
= $240,000

The total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is $240,000.

First, let's find the number of sheep in each group. Mary has 30 sheep, and she gets milk from half of them and the other half. So, the number of sheep in each group is:

30 / 2 = 15 sheep in each group

Now, let's calculate the milk from each group:

- From the first group (15 sheep), she gets 1 kg of milk per sheep, so the total milk from this group is:
15 * 1 = 15 kg

- From the second group (15 sheep), she gets 2 kg of milk per sheep, so the total milk from this group is:
15 * 2 = 30 kg

"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of apples picked over the three days. 

First, let's find the number of apples picked on Monday. Since Lucy sold all the apples picked on Monday and she got $56 from selling them at $4 per piece, we can find the number of apples picked on Monday by dividing the total amount earned by the price per apple.

Number of apples picked on Monday = Total amount earned / Price per apple
= $56 / $4
= 14 apples

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she did the previous day, which is 2 * 12 = 24 apples.

Now, we can find the total number of apples picked over the three days by adding the number of apples picked each day.

Total number of apples = Number of apples picked on Monday + Number of apples picked on Tuesday + Number of apples picked on Wednesday
= 14 + 12 + 24

"To find the total number of socks that Lindsay has washed, we need to calculate the total number of socks in the pairs and the loose socks. 

Since each pair of socks contains 2 socks, washing 10 pairs of socks would be equivalent to washing 10 * 2 = 20 socks. 

Adding the 15 loose socks to this, we get a total of 20 + 15 = 35 socks that Lindsay has washed.

Since there are 50 socks that need washing in total, the number of socks Lindsay has missed can be found by subtracting the number of socks she has washed from the total number of socks.

"To find the monthly payment, we can use the formula for monthly payments on a loan:

M = P [ i(1 + i)^n ] / [ (1 + i)^n - 1]

Where:
M = monthly payment
P = principal amount (initial loan amount) = $3,650
i = monthly interest rate = 10%/year / 12 months/year = 0.008333 (or 10%/12)
n = number of payments = 5 months

However, since the interest rate is relatively low and the loan period is short, we can use a simpler approach. We can calculate the interest for the entire period and then divide it by the number of payments.

Interest for 5 months = $3,650 * 0.10 * (5/12) = $152.08
Total amount to be paid = $3,650 + $152.08 = $3,802.08
Monthly payment = $3,802.08 / 5 = $760.416

So, Karan has to pay approximately $760.42 per month.

Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue is 36 * $1 = $36.

The total cost is $18, which is the amount she spent on supplies.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $36 - $18 = $18.

Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, we need to find the profit per hour. To do this, we can divide the profit by the number of cups sold per hour. However, since the profit is already calculated for the total number of cups, we can simply divide the profit by the number of hours it takes to sell all the cups. 

The total number of cups is 36, and she sells 4 cups per hour. To find the number of hours, we can divide the total number of cups by the number of cups sold per hour: 36 / 4 = 9 hours.

Now, we can divide the profit by the number of hours to find the profit per hour: $18 / 9 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the initial amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we can use the concept of proportions. If he sold 3/5 of his land, that means he has 2/5 of his land left. We are given that the remaining land is 12.8 hectares.

Let's set up a proportion to find the initial amount of land:

2/5 = 12.8 / x

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

2x = 12.8 * 5
2x = 64
x = 64 / 2
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land initially.

"To find the number of female members in the choir, we first need to calculate 50% of the total members. Since 50% of the choir members are girls, we can calculate this as 0.5 * 52 = 26.

Now, we know that half the people performing can't make it to the show. This means that 50% of the female members are unable to perform. We can calculate this as 0.5 * 26 = 13.

So, the number of female members who can perform is 26 - 13 = 13.

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is 13 + 3 = 16.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find Wilson's current math grade, we need to calculate the average of his 5 test scores. 

First, we add up all the scores: 
65 + 94 = 159
159 + 81 = 240
240 + 86 = 326
326 + 74 = 400

Next, we divide the sum by the number of tests to find the average:
400 / 5 = 80

Wilson's current math grade is 80, which meets the requirement for him to have the car for the weekend.

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils separately and then add them together.

The cost of 6 erasers is 6 * $2 = $12.

The cost of 8 pencils is 8 * $3 = $24.

Now, we add the cost of erasers and pencils together: $12 + $24 = $36.

The final numerical answer is: $36"
"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to calculate the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu and add it to the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson.

First, let's find the number of messages James delivers to Mr. Yu. Since he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can multiply the number of messages to Ms. Thompson by 1/3.

Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * Messages to Ms. Thompson
Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * 66
Messages to Mr. Yu = 22

Now, we can add the number of messages to Mr. Yu and Ms. Thompson to find the total number of messages James delivers.

Total messages = Messages to Ms. Thompson + Messages to Mr. Yu
Total messages = 66 + 22
Total messages = 88

The final answer is: 88"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of the rides for Dasha and compare it to the cost of the ride bracelet for David.

First, let's calculate the cost of the rides for Dasha. Since each ride costs 2 tickets at $2 per ticket, the cost of one ride is 2 * $2 = $4. Since they ride all 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha is 9 * $4 = $36.

Now, let's calculate the cost for David. He buys a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides. Since the ride bracelet is the same as buying 9 rides, David doesn't need to buy any additional tickets.

To find out how much money David saves, we need to compare the cost of the rides for Dasha ($36) to the cost of the ride bracelet for David ($30). The difference is $36 - $30 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To find out how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we need to first determine the total number of gifts she needs to wrap and then divide the total amount of ribbon by the total number of gifts.

Total gifts = 6 (family) + 4 (friends) + 2 (teachers) = 12 gifts

Since Monica wants to make a bow for each gift, she will need to make 12 bows in total.

Now, we divide the total amount of ribbon by the total number of gifts to find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each bow:

Total ribbon = 144 inches
Total gifts = 12

Ribbon per bow = Total ribbon / Total gifts
= 144 / 12
= 12 inches

The final answer is: 12"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given ratio. Let's assume the number of popsicles Betty has is 5x and the number of popsicles Sam has is 6x. 

Since the total number of popsicles they have together is 165, we can write the equation: 5x + 6x = 165.

Combine like terms: 11x = 165.

Divide both sides by 11: x = 15.

Now that we know x, we can find the number of popsicles Betty and Sam have. Betty has 5x = 5(15) = 75 popsicles, and Sam has 6x = 6(15) = 90 popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has: 90 - 75 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total cost of the streaming services, we need to calculate the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus. 

The normal cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 each, so together they cost $20. However, Tim saves 20% by bundling, which means he pays 80% of the total cost. 

To find 80% of $20, we multiply $20 by 0.8: 
$20 * 0.8 = $16

So, the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $16. 

Now, we add the cost of Netflix to find the total cost of the streaming services: 
$16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) + $10 (Netflix) = $26

Since Tim was paying $60 for the cable package, we subtract the cost of the streaming services to find the amount he saves: 
$60 (cable package) - $26 (streaming services) = $34

The final answer is: $34"
"To find the total time spent on the song, we need to add up the time spent writing, recording, and editing. 

Time spent writing: 4 hours
Time spent recording: 4 hours / 2 = 2 hours
Time spent editing: 90 minutes = 1.5 hours

Total time spent = 4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5 hours

Now, to find the percentage of time spent editing, we need to divide the time spent editing by the total time and multiply by 100.

Percentage of time spent editing = (1.5 / 7.5) * 100 = 20%

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total number of books Wendy needs to carry, we first need to determine the number of books in the shelving system and then add 20 more than double that number.

The shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns, so the total number of books it can hold is the product of the number of rows and columns: 6 * 6 = 36.

Now, we need to find double the number of books in the shelving system, which is 2 * 36 = 72.

Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books in the shelving system, so we add 20 to the double of the number of books: 72 + 20 = 92.

Therefore, Wendy will need to carry 92 books to complete her task.

The final answer is: 92"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

Initially, Erica made 20 Valentine's cards. Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made cards, each containing 15 cards. So, the total number of pre-made cards is 2 * 15 = 30. 

Now, Erica has 20 (initial cards) + 30 (pre-made cards) = 50 cards in total.

She then passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 to her family, which is a total of 24 + 5 = 29 cards. 

After passing out these cards, Erica is left with 50 - 29 = 21 cards.

However, she received 17 cards from family and friends. So, the final number of cards Erica has is 21 (cards left) + 17 (cards received) = 38.

The final numerical answer is: 38"
"To find out how many slices are left, we first need to determine how many slices Jenny gave away. 

Jenny gave 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices, we can calculate the number of slices Bill received as follows:

1/3 * 12 = 4 slices

Jenny gave 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. We can calculate the number of slices Mark received as follows:

1/4 * 12 = 3 slices

In total, Jenny gave away 4 + 3 = 7 slices.

Jenny ate 2 slices, so the total number of slices she gave away or ate is 7 + 2 = 9 slices.

To find out how many slices are left, we subtract the total number of slices given away or eaten from the total number of slices:

12 - 9 = 3 slices

"To determine the number of days Mark needs to save his money, we need to calculate the total amount he needs to save and then divide it by his daily earnings.

The total amount Mark needs to save is the cost of the bike, which is $300. 

Mark's daily earnings are $10. 

To find the number of days Mark needs to save, we can divide the total amount he needs to save ($300) by his daily earnings ($10).

Number of days = Total amount / Daily earnings
= $300 / $10
= 30

Therefore, Mark needs to save for 30 days to have enough money to buy the bike.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total number of bugs, we need to calculate the number of millipedes and stink bugs first.

The number of millipedes is 1/3rd as many as the spiders, so it is (1/3) * 90 = 30 millipedes.

The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12, so it is 2 * 30 - 12 = 48 stink bugs.

Now, we add the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs to find the total number of bugs: 90 + 30 + 48 = 168.

The final answer is: 168"
"To find the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica, we first need to determine Alice's age. 

Since Erica is 30 years old, and Beth is 5 years older than Erica, we can calculate Beth's age as follows:
Beth's age = Erica's age + 5
Beth's age = 30 + 5
Beth's age = 35

Now, we know that Alice is 7 years older than Beth, so we can calculate Alice's age as follows:
Alice's age = Beth's age + 7
Alice's age = 35 + 7
Alice's age = 42

The difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is:
Difference = Alice's age - Erica's age
Difference = 42 - 30
Difference = 12

"To calculate the builder's annual earnings, we need to first determine the total number of days he works in a year. 

Since he works 4 weeks every month and there are 12 months in a year, the total number of weeks he works in a year is 4 weeks/month * 12 months = 48 weeks.

Since he works 6 days every week, the total number of days he works in a year is 48 weeks * 6 days/week = 288 days.

Now, we can calculate his annual earnings by multiplying the total number of days he works in a year by his daily wage: 288 days * $50/day = $14,400.

The final answer is: $14,400."
"To determine the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of flour and milk required for the quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. Since Mark is making a quadruple batch, he needs 4 times the amount of each ingredient. 

For flour: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups
For milk: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark needs to buy:
12 cups / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags of flour

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so Mark needs to buy:
4 cups / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles of milk

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour:
6 bags of flour - 2 bottles of milk = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the energy saved, we first need to calculate the energy used by the air conditioner in a day and then subtract the energy used after reducing the usage time.

The air conditioner uses 900 watts of energy per hour. Since there are 8 hours of usage, the total energy used in a day is:

Energy used per day = Power (watts) * Time (hours) = 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 Wh (watt-hours or watt-hours)

Since 1 kilowatt-hour (kWh) is equal to 1000 watt-hours (Wh), we can convert the energy used per day to kWh:

Energy used per day = 7200 Wh / 1000 = 7.2 kWh

If Mel reduces the usage time by 5 hours, the new usage time is:

New usage time = 8 hours - 5 hours = 3 hours

The new energy used per day is:

New energy used per day = Power (watts) * New time (hours) = 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 Wh

Converting this to kWh:

New energy used per day = 2700 Wh / 1000 = 2.7 kWh

The energy saved per day is the difference between the original energy used and the new energy used:

Energy saved per day = Energy used per day - New energy used per day = 7.2 kWh - 2.7 kWh = 4.5 kWh

To find the total energy saved in 30 days, we multiply the energy saved per day by 30:

Total energy saved in 30 days = Energy saved per day * 30 = 4.5 kWh * 30 = 135 kWh

"To find the average number of stripes, we first need to calculate the total number of stripes and then divide it by the total number of zebras.

There are two zebras with 17 stripes each, so their total number of stripes is 2 * 17 = 34. 

There is one zebra with 36 stripes.

There is another zebra with half the number of stripes as the third zebra, which is 36 / 2 = 18.

The total number of stripes is 34 + 36 + 18 = 88.

There are 3 zebras in total.

The average number of stripes is the total number of stripes divided by the total number of zebras, which is 88 / 3 = 29.33.

"To determine the total cost of the meat and cheese, we first need to calculate the total number of sandwiches required to serve 20 people. Since each sandwich serves 4 people, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each sandwich serves:

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, we need a total of 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

The cost of the meat is $7.00 per pound, so the total cost of the meat is:

5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00

The cost of the cheese is $3.00 per pound, so the total cost of the cheese is:

5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

The total cost of the meat and cheese is the sum of the cost of the meat and the cost of the cheese:

$35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

The final answer is: $50.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the initial number of corns and cannolis Allan has in his house. 

Let's denote the initial number of cannolis as C. Since there are twice as many corns as cannolis, the initial number of corns is 2C. We are given that the total number of cannolis is 40, so C = 40.

The initial number of corns is 2C = 2 * 40 = 80.

Allan bought 60 more cannolis and 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. So, the new number of cannolis is 40 + 60 = 100, and the new number of corns is 40 - 40 = 0 (since he bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis, and the number of cannolis is now 100).

However, this would mean Allan has 0 corns, which is not possible. This indicates that the problem statement is inconsistent. But if we assume that Allan bought 40 fewer corns than the new number of cannolis (100), then the new number of corns would be 100 - 40 = 60.

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 100 (cannolis) + 60 (corns) = 160.

The final answer is: 160"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Elliott wants to walk 10,000 steps a day. He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. Since half of 10,000 is 5,000, he completed 5,000 steps on his walks to and from school.

He then did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So, the total steps he has taken so far are 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000.

After that, he went for a short jog and realized that he only had 2,000 steps left to take to reach his goal of 10,000 steps. This means that the total steps he has taken so far (6,000) plus the steps he took during his jog is equal to 10,000. 

Let's represent the steps he took during his jog as 'x'. Then, the equation becomes 6,000 + x = 10,000.

To find the value of 'x', we need to isolate 'x' on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 6,000 from both sides of the equation:

6,000 + x = 10,000
x = 10,000 - 6,000
x = 4,000

So, Elliott took 4,000 steps during his jog.

The final answer is: 4000"
"To determine how many minutes early Toby will be, we need to calculate the total time it takes for him to read the book and travel to the airport.

First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book: 
45 pages * 200 words per page = 9000 words

Next, we'll calculate the time it takes for Toby to read the book:
9000 words / 300 words per minute = 30 minutes

Now, we'll add the time it takes to get to the airport:
30 minutes (reading time) + 10 minutes (travel time) = 40 minutes

Since Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to leave, we'll subtract the total time from the available time:
60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes

Therefore, Toby will be 20 minutes early. 

The final answer is: 20"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to first determine the number of employees who remained employed in June and their total hours worked.

In May, the company hired 40 employees. In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 1/4 * 40 = 10 employees left. Therefore, the number of employees who remained employed in June is 40 - 10 = 30.

Since each employee worked 40 hours per week, the total hours worked by each employee in May and June is 40 hours/week * 4 weeks = 160 hours.

The total amount paid to the employees in May is 40 employees * $15/hour * 160 hours = $96,000.

In June, the company had 30 employees, so the total amount paid to the employees in June is 30 employees * $15/hour * 160 hours = $72,000.

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000.

The final answer is: $168,000."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Sally bought and subtract that from the initial amount of money she had.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The sale is ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means that the second pound is half off, so the cost of the second pound is $3 * 0.5 = $1.50. The total cost of 2 pounds of taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the magnets. Sally bought 4 magnets at $0.25 each, so the total cost of the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items: $4.50 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1 (magnets) = $7.

Sally initially had $10, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from the initial amount: $10 - $7 = $3.

"To find the total amount spent by Tim, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks packages and the finale firework, then apply the discount.

The first package of fireworks costs $400, and the second package costs twice that much, which is 2 * $400 = $800. The total cost of the fireworks packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

The total cost of the fireworks packages before the discount is $1200. To find the discount amount, we multiply the total cost by the discount percentage (20% or 0.20): $1200 * 0.20 = $240. 

The discount amount is $240, so the total cost after the discount is $1200 - $240 = $960.

The finale firework costs $150. To find the total amount spent, we add the cost of the fireworks packages after the discount and the cost of the finale firework: $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To determine the number of dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we need to calculate the total number of cookies she will consume in 30 days and then divide that by the number of cookies her recipe makes.

Shannon eats 2 cookies per night, so in 30 days, she will eat 2 * 30 = 60 cookies.

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies she will eat by 12 to find out how many dozens she needs to make. 

60 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 5 dozens.

Therefore, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. 

First, let's find the number of candles that smell like wet dog. Since 5% of the candles have this defect, we can calculate it as follows:

Number of candles that smell like wet dog = Total number of candles * (Percentage of candles with the defect / 100)
= 50000 * (5 / 100)
= 2500

Now, we need to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. Since Marcy guarantees that 99% of the candles will not explode, the percentage of candles that will explode is 1% (100% - 99%). However, this 1% is out of the total number of candles, not the number of candles that smell like wet dog. 

To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to find 1% of the number of candles that smell like wet dog:

Number of candles that smell like wet dog and explode = Number of candles that smell like wet dog * (Percentage of candles that will explode / 100)
= 2500 * (1 / 100)
= 25

Therefore, 25 candles will both smell like wet dog and explode.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we first need to calculate the discount amount for each blouse. Since the blouses are 30% off, the discount amount for each blouse is 30% of the regular price.

The regular price for each blouse is $20. To find 30% of $20, we multiply $20 by 0.30 (which is the decimal equivalent of 30%).

Discount per blouse = $20 * 0.30 = $6

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, we need to find the total discount amount for all 4 blouses.

Total discount = Discount per blouse * Number of blouses
Total discount = $6 * 4
Total discount = $24

Now, we need to find the total cost of the discounted blouses. To do this, we subtract the total discount from the total regular price of the blouses.

Total regular price = Number of blouses * Regular price per blouse
Total regular price = 4 * $20
Total regular price = $80

Total cost of discounted blouses = Total regular price - Total discount
Total cost of discounted blouses = $80 - $24
Total cost of discounted blouses = $56

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathered from the tallest trees as T, from the average trees as A, and from the shortest trees as S. 

Since Joanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees, we have T = 30.

From the shortest trees, she gathered half of 30, which is 15 apples. So, S = 15.

The total number of apples Joanne gathered is the sum of the apples from the three types of trees: T + A + S = 30 + A + 15.

Now, let's consider Joanne's sister. She gathered twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is 2T = 2 * 30 = 60 apples.

She gathered 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is 3S = 3 * 15 = 45 apples.

Since she didn't gather any apples from the average trees, her total is 60 + 45 = 105 apples.

The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. So, the total number of apples Joanne gathered is 500 - 105 = 395.

Now, we can set up the equation for Joanne's total: 30 + A + 15 = 395.

Simplifying the equation, we get A + 45 = 395.

Subtracting 45 from both sides, we get A = 350.

The final answer is: 350"
"Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D. We are given two pieces of information:

1. The total number of heads is 180, which means C + D = 180.
2. The total number of bumps is 304, which means 2C + D = 304 (since camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump).

We can solve this system of linear equations by subtracting the first equation from the second equation:

(2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can find the number of dromedaries by substituting C into the first equation:

D = 180 - C
D = 180 - 124
D = 56

Therefore, there are 56 dromedaries in the herd.

The final answer is: 56"
"To find the total distance traveled by Tom, we need to break down the information given and calculate the distance for each segment of the trip.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day. So, the total distance covered in the first 4 days is:
200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. 
30% of 800 km = 0.3 * 800 = 240 km
So, the total distance covered in the next two days is 240 km.

On the next day, he wasn't traveling at all, so the distance covered is 0 km.

During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total distance covered in the second week is:
300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Now, let's add up the distances covered in each segment of the trip:
800 km (first 4 days) + 240 km (next two days) + 0 km (next day) + 2100 km (second week) = 3140 km

The final answer is: 3140"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the relationship between the sizes of the lockers. Let's start by defining the size of Timothy's locker as T, Zack's locker as Z, and Peter's locker as P.

We are given that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, so P = 5.

We are also given that Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, so P = (1/4)Z. Since P = 5, we can write:

5 = (1/4)Z
Z = 5 * 4
Z = 20

We are also given that Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, so Z = (1/2)T. Since Z = 20, we can write:

20 = (1/2)T
T = 20 * 2
T = 40

Therefore, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the elevation where Stanley's comb fell, we need to subtract the distance it fell from Stanley's initial elevation. 

Stanley's initial elevation: 10,000 feet
Distance the comb fell: 4,000 feet
Elevation where the comb fell: 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet

Now, we need to find the difference between the elevation where the comb fell and Oliver's elevation to determine how much Oliver needs to climb.

Elevation where the comb fell: 6,000 feet
Oliver's elevation: 3,000 feet
Distance Oliver must climb: 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet

The final answer is: 3000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we know that the first bank gave Mr. Josue $4000. The second bank gave him twice as much, so the second bank gave him 2 * $4000 = $8000.

Now, we need to find the total amount of money Mr. Josue received from both banks. This is simply the sum of the money from the first bank and the second bank: $4000 + $8000 = $12000.

Mr. Josue initially had $5000 in capital. To find the total capital he has now, we need to add the money he received from the banks to his initial capital: $5000 + $12000 = $16000.

The final answer is: $16000"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps below:

Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock.

Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each. So, the total number of cats taken away by the boats is 4 * 5 = 20.

Now, we subtract the number of cats taken away from the initial number of cats: 50 - 20 = 30.

Later, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find 3/5 of the remaining cats, we multiply 30 by 3/5: 30 * (3/5) = 18.

Now, we subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats: 30 - 18 = 12.

Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into the different pricing periods and calculate the cost for each period.

1. The first 6 months were $8 a month, so the cost for this period is 6 * $8 = $48.
2. The next 8 months were $12 a month, so the cost for this period is 8 * $12 = $96.
3. After that, the price increased to $14 a month. Since 2 years is 24 months, and we've already accounted for 14 months, there are 24 - 14 = 10 months left. The cost for this period is 10 * $14 = $140.
4. Now, we add up the costs for each period to find the total cost: $48 + $96 + $140 = $284.

The total cost for 2 years of the service is $284.

$284"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the cost of the jogger jeans as J and the cost of the tattered jeans as T. We know that T = $28.

We are also given that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so we can write an equation:

J = T - 6
J = 28 - 6
J = 22

We are told that Cole saved a total of $6. Since he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, we can set up the following equation:

(1/3)(J - T) + (2/3)(T - T) = 6

Simplifying the equation, we get:

(1/3)(J - T) = 6

Substituting J = 22, we get:

(1/3)(22 - 28) = 6

(1/3)(-6) = 6

"To find the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and then sum them up.

The capacity of the 4 buses is 4 * 60 = 240 employees.
The capacity of the 6 minibusses is 6 * 30 = 180 employees.
The capacity of the 10 minivans is 10 * 15 = 150 employees.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder and then calculate the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden.

Let's denote the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders as x. Since the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is x + 10.

Lillian has 3 store-bought feeders and 3 homemade feeders. The total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3x, and the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3(x + 10).

The total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden is the sum of the birds attracted to the store-bought and homemade feeders: 3x + 3(x + 10).

We are given that each bird feeder attracts 20 birds throughout the day. Since Lillian has 6 feeders in total, the total number of birds attracted to all feeders is 6 * 20 = 120.

We can set up an equation to represent the situation: 3x + 3(x + 10) = 120.

Simplifying the equation, we get 3x + 3x + 30 = 120, which becomes 6x + 30 = 120.

Subtracting 30 from both sides of the equation, we get 6x = 90.

Dividing both sides of the equation by 6, we get x = 15.

Now that we know x = 15, we can find the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders: x + 10 = 15 + 10 = 25.

The total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden is 3x + 3(x + 10) = 3(15) + 3(25) = 45 + 75 = 120.

However, this is the number of birds attracted to the store-bought and homemade feeders separately. Since the total number of birds attracted to all feeders is 120, and we know that each feeder attracts 20 birds, we can simply multiply the number of feeders by 20 to get the total number of birds.

The total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden is 6 * 20 = 120.

However, this is the number of birds attracted to all feeders, not the number of birds attracted to the homemade and store-bought feeders separately. We know that the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, so we can find the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders by subtracting 10 from the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders.

"To find the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

The bagel costs $4. 
The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. To find 25% of $4, we multiply $4 by 0.25, which is $1. Then, we add this to the cost of the bagel: $4 + $1 = $5. 
The cake costs half the price of the bagel, which is $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, we add the costs of the bagel, soup, and cake together: $4 + $5 + $2 = $11.

The final numerical answer is: $11"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as 'x'. Since he keeps 1/3 of the cards, he sells 2/3 of them. 

The revenue from selling the cards is equal to the cost of the ticket and the amount of money he already has. The revenue from selling the cards is (2/3)x * $1.5. The total amount of money he has is $100 (ticket) + $50 (spending cash) = $150.

We can set up the equation as follows:
(2/3)x * $1.5 = $150

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3/2 to isolate x:
(2/3)x * (3/2) = $150 * (3/2)
x = $225

So, Kenny started with 225 cards. 

The final answer is: 225"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, the caterer prepared enough hot dogs for half of the guests to have two hot dogs. Since there are 36 guests, half of them would be 36 / 2 = 18 guests. Each of these 18 guests would get 2 hot dogs, so the total number of hot dogs prepared for these guests is 18 * 2 = 36 hot dogs.

However, the caterer prepared enough hot dogs for these 18 guests to have two hot dogs each, but the total number of guests who showed up is 40. This means that there are 40 - 36 = 4 extra guests who did not have a hot dog initially.

Now, since everyone who showed up wanted a second hot dog, the caterer had to give out 40 hot dogs in total. Since 36 hot dogs were already prepared for the initial 18 guests, the remaining 4 hot dogs were given to the 4 extra guests who showed up. 

However, the question asks how many guests did not get a second hot dog. Since the 4 extra guests who showed up got a second hot dog, the guests who did not get a second hot dog are the initial 18 guests who were already given two hot dogs.

Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hot dog is 18.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the number of letters in Indras' sister's name, we first need to calculate half of the letters in Indras' name. 

Indras has 6 letters in her name. Half of 6 is 3. 

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name, so it has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

The total number of letters in both names is 6 (Indras) + 7 (her sister) = 13.

The final numerical answer is: 13"
"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the total cost of the items before the discount and then apply the 20% discount.

1. The set of pot and pans costs $120.00.
2. The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
3. The 5 separate utensils cost $5.00 each, so the total cost of the utensils is 5 x $5.00 = $25.00.
4. The total cost of the items before the discount is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.
5. To apply the 20% discount, we need to find 20% of $165.00, which is 0.20 x $165.00 = $33.00.
6. The discount amount is $33.00, so we subtract this from the total cost before the discount: $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

The final numerical answer is: $132.00"
"To find out how much more money Dora needs, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy and subtract the amount of money she already has.

The total cost of the items is: $6 (skipping rope) + $11 (board game) + $2 (playground ball) = $19.

Dora has a total of $2 (her allowance) + $16 (from her mother) = $18.

To find out how much more money she needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost: $19 (total cost) - $18 (amount she has) = $1.

Therefore, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons. 
Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, which is 3/4 * 100 = 75 dragons.
Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, which is 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.
Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, which is 1/5 * 150 = 30 dragons.

"To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we first need to determine the amount of gas in each container. Since 15 gallons were equally divided into 5 containers, we can calculate the amount of gas in each container by dividing 15 gallons by 5.

15 gallons / 5 containers = 3 gallons per container

Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we can convert the amount of gas in each container from gallons to pints by multiplying the number of gallons by 8.

3 gallons/container * 8 pints/gallon = 24 pints/container

Josey needed 1/4 of a container to run her lawnmower, so we can calculate the amount of gas she needed by multiplying the amount of gas in each container by 1/4.

24 pints/container * 1/4 = 6 pints

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money George had initially. Since he had 1% of his money left after spending $5, we can set up an equation to represent this situation.

Let's denote the initial amount of money George had as 'x'. Since he spent $5 and had 1% of his money left, we can write the equation as:

0.01x = 5

To find the initial amount of money George had, we can solve for 'x':

x = 5 / 0.01
x = 500

So, George initially had $500.

Now, let's find out how much he spent on chips. We know that he bought 3 bags of chips for 40 cents each. The total cost of chips is:

3 * 0.40 = 1.20

Since he spent $5 in total, the amount he spent on candy bars is:

5 - 1.20 = 3.80

Now, we need to find out how many candy bars he bought. Each candy bar costs 75 cents, so we can divide the total amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar:

3.80 / 0.75 = 5.07

Since we can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can see that 5 candy bars would cost 3.75, which is less than 3.80, and 6 candy bars would cost 4.50, which is more than 3.80. Therefore, George must have bought 5 candy bars and spent 3.75 on them, and the remaining 0.05 must be the change from the last candy bar."
"To find out how many lollipops each of Ray's friends received, we need to first determine how many lollipops he shared with his friends. 

Ray had 25 lollipops initially and kept 5 for himself. So, the number of lollipops he shared is 25 - 5 = 20.

Since he shared the lollipops equally among his four friends, we need to divide the total number of lollipops shared (20) by the number of friends (4).

20 lollipops / 4 friends = 5 lollipops per friend.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the remaining weight of the cake, we first need to determine the total weight of the pieces that Rory and her mom each have. 

Since the cake is cut into 8 equal pieces, each piece weighs 20 ounces / 8 = 2.5 ounces. 

Rory and her mom each have a piece, so the total weight of their pieces is 2.5 ounces * 2 = 5 ounces.

Now, we subtract the weight of their pieces from the original weight of the cake to find the remaining weight: 20 ounces - 5 ounces = 15 ounces.

The remaining cake weighs 15 ounces."
"To find out how many oranges each person will get, we need to first determine the total number of oranges Sitti and Juris have. 

Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges. 

Total oranges = 34 + 22 = 56

Since they are sharing the oranges with 6 other friends, including themselves, the total number of people sharing the oranges is 8 (Sitti, Juris, and 6 friends).

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people.

Oranges per person = Total oranges / Total people = 56 / 8 = 7

Therefore, everyone will get 7 oranges.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the cost per serving, we need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients and divide it by the number of servings.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the onions. Antoine wants to double the amount of onions, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The cost of onions is $2.00 per pound, so the total cost of onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the beef stock. Antoine needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box costs $2.00, so the total cost of beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is the sum of the cost of onions and beef stock, which is $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

Since the soup serves 6 people, the cost per serving is the total cost divided by the number of servings: $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes Bernadette to get to the theater and then calculate how much earlier she needs to leave than Wayne.

Let's denote the time it takes Wayne to get to the theater as W. We are given that W = 4 minutes.

Since the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, the time it takes Bernadette to get to the theater is 4W. 

4W = 4 * 4 = 16 minutes

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, so she needs to leave 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, Bernadette needs to leave 4 + 5 = 9 minutes before Wayne.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 9 minutes earlier than Wayne to get to the theater first.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we first need to determine the width of the room. Since we are given the area and the length, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is Area = Length * Width.

Given that the area is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. There are 3 feet in a yard, so 3 yards is equal to 3 * 3 = 9 feet.

Now we can use the formula for the area to find the width:

Area = Length * Width
360 = 9 * Width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter of the room using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width).

Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98 feet

The final answer is: 98"
"To find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we need to calculate the total number of beads each sister has.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, Elizabeth has 1 * 20 + 2 * 20 = 20 + 40 = 60 red and clear beads.

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, Margareth has 3 * 20 + 4 * 20 = 60 + 80 = 140 blue and red beads.

Now, we need to find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth. To do this, we subtract the number of beads Elizabeth has from the number of beads Margareth has: 140 - 60 = 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the final temperature of the house, we need to calculate the temperature increase due to the oven and the temperature decrease due to the open window.

First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to the oven. The oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour, and Marcus bakes for 3 hours. So, the total temperature increase is 5 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 15 degrees.

Now, let's calculate the temperature decrease due to the open window. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Since the window is open for 30 minutes, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are there in 30 minutes. 30 minutes / 10 minutes = 3 intervals. So, the total temperature decrease is 2 degrees/interval * 3 intervals = 6 degrees.

Now, let's subtract the temperature decrease from the temperature increase: 15 degrees (increase) - 6 degrees (decrease) = 9 degrees.

The initial temperature of the house was 40 degrees. Adding the temperature increase to the initial temperature, we get: 40 degrees + 9 degrees = 49 degrees.

The final temperature of the house is 49 degrees.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total time it took Jon to complete the triathlon. 

Jon's total time = Swim time + Bike time + Run time
Jon's total time = 40 minutes + 80 minutes + 50 minutes
Jon's total time = 170 minutes

Since James finishes the swim 10% faster, we need to find 10% of Jon's swim time and subtract it from Jon's swim time to find James' swim time.

10% of Jon's swim time = 0.1 * 40 minutes = 4 minutes
James' swim time = Jon's swim time - 4 minutes
James' swim time = 40 minutes - 4 minutes
James' swim time = 36 minutes

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. So, James' bike time is 5 minutes more than Jon's bike time.

James' bike time = Jon's bike time + 5 minutes
James' bike time = 80 minutes + 5 minutes
James' bike time = 85 minutes

We know that Jon won by 10 minutes, which means James took 10 minutes longer than Jon to complete the triathlon. We can set up an equation to represent this:

James' total time = Jon's total time + 10 minutes
James' total time = 170 minutes + 10 minutes
James' total time = 180 minutes

Now, we can find James' run time by subtracting his swim time and bike time from his total time.

James' run time = James' total time - James' swim time - James' bike time
James' run time = 180 minutes - 36 minutes - 85 minutes
James' run time = 59 minutes

The final answer is: 59"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that Movie C is 1.25 hours long. We need to convert this to minutes because the other movies' lengths are given in minutes. 

1 hour = 60 minutes, so 1.25 hours = 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes.

Now, we know that Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. So, Movie B's length is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes.

We are also given that Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B. To find Movie A's length, we need to multiply Movie B's length by 1/4.

Movie A's length = (1/4) * 80 = 20 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance the horse runs, the amount of hay it consumes, and then the cost of the hay. 

First, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours since the speed is given in miles per hour (MPH). 

Time in hours = 30 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 0.5 hours

Now, we can calculate the distance the horse runs:

Distance = Speed * Time = 32 MPH * 0.5 hours = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile, the total hay consumed is:

Total hay = 16 miles * 1/2 bail/mile = 8 bails

The cost of the hay is:

Cost of hay = 8 bails * $3/bail = $24

Michael has six $5 bills, so the total amount of money he has is:

Total money = 6 * $5 = $30

To find the change, we subtract the cost of the hay from the total money:

Change = Total money - Cost of hay = $30 - $24 = $6

"To find out how many trays Rozanne can put out, we first need to determine the total number of eggs she has. 

Rozanne uses 4 dozen eggs from cases. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 4 dozen equals 4 * 12 = 48 eggs. 

In addition to the eggs from the cases, she uses 2 loose eggs. So, the total number of eggs is 48 + 2 = 50.

Each glass of eggnog requires 5 eggs. To find out how many glasses Rozanne can make, we divide the total number of eggs by 5: 50 / 5 = 10 glasses.

Each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog. To find out how many trays Rozanne can put out, we divide the total number of glasses by 5: 10 / 5 = 2.

"To find the salesman's profit, we first need to calculate the total revenue from the sale of sneakers. 

The salesman sold 17 sneakers for $20 each on Monday, so the revenue from the flash sale is 17 * $20 = $340.

The remaining sneakers are 48 - 17 = 31. These were sold to a department store for $25 each throughout the rest of the week. The revenue from the sale of these sneakers is 31 * $25 = $775.

The total revenue from the sale of all sneakers is $340 + $775 = $1115.

The cost of the case of 48 sneakers is $576. To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the total revenue: $1115 - $576 = $539.

The salesman's profit is $539.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. The super ticket costs $20 and includes a movie ticket, one popcorn, and one soda.
2. The super ticket also includes an extra popcorn and soda for $1.
3. The soda costs $3.
4. If you didn't buy the super ticket and ended up saving $2, it means the total cost without the super ticket is $20 - $2 = $18.
5. The cost of the movie ticket is $12.
6. The cost of the soda is $3.
7. Let's denote the cost of the popcorn as 'x'.
8. The total cost without the super ticket is the cost of the movie ticket plus the cost of the popcorn and the soda: 12 + x + 3 = 18.

Now, let's solve for 'x':

12 + x + 3 = 18
x + 15 = 18
x = 18 - 15
x = 3

The regular price of popcorn is $3.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the cost of filling one balloon before the price increase. 

Let's denote the original cost of filling one balloon as 'x'. Since the total cost of filling 20 balloons was $900, we can set up the equation:

20x = 900

To find the value of 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 20:

x = 900 / 20
x = 45

So, the original cost of filling one balloon was $45.

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost of filling one balloon is:

New cost = Original cost + Increase
New cost = 45 + 20
New cost = 65

Now, we need to find the total cost of filling 170 balloons at the new rate. 

Total cost = New cost per balloon * Number of balloons
Total cost = 65 * 170
Total cost = 11,050

The final answer is: $11050"
"To find the average speed of the car during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled at 60 mph for 2 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 60 mph x 2 hours
Distance = 120 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled at 30 mph for 1 hour:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 30 mph x 1 hour
Distance = 30 miles

Now, let's find the total distance traveled:
Total Distance = 120 miles + 30 miles
Total Distance = 150 miles

The total time taken is the sum of the time taken at 60 mph and 30 mph:
Total Time = 2 hours + 1 hour
Total Time = 3 hours

Finally, we can calculate the average speed:
Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
Average Speed = 150 miles / 3 hours
Average Speed = 50 mph

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the value of the sapphires and rubies Jenna has after the trade. 

Initially, Jenna has 8 sapphires. She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. This means she has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left. 

The value of the sapphires she traded is 3 * $800 = $2400. 

The value of the rubies she received is 2 * $1200 = $2400.

Now, we need to find the total value of her jewels. The value of the sapphires she has left is 5 * $800 = $4000. 

The total value of her jewels is the sum of the value of the sapphires she has left and the value of the rubies she received: $4000 + $2400 = $6400.

The final answer is: $6400"
"To find the total number of apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of apples they eat per day and then multiply it by 30.

Marin and Nancy each eat 4 apples a day. So, together they eat 4 + 4 = 8 apples per day.

Now, we multiply the total number of apples they eat per day by 30 to find the total number of apples they eat in 30 days: 8 apples/day * 30 days = 240 apples.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the total volume of soil needed, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed and then multiply it by the number of beds. The volume of a rectangular prism (such as a raised bed) is calculated as length * width * height.

Volume of one raised bed = length * width * height
= 8 feet * 2 feet * 2 feet
= 32 cubic feet

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:
Total volume = 32 cubic feet/bed * 10 beds
= 320 cubic feet

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. To find the number of bags needed, we divide the total volume by the volume of one bag:
Number of bags = Total volume / volume per bag
= 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet/bag
= 160 bags

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:
Total cost = Number of bags * cost per bag
= 160 bags * $12/bag
= $1920

The final answer is: $1920"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of green cards and yellow cards first. 

Given that there are 15 red cards and 60% more green cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:

Number of green cards = 15 + (60% of 15)
= 15 + (0.6 * 15)
= 15 + 9
= 24

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards:

Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
= 15 + 24
= 39

To find the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards:

Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
= 15 + 24 + 39
= 78

The final answer is: 78"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies.

After 20 minutes, one of her friends saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the fairies that were there. This means her friend saw 50 / 2 = 25 fairies. So, the total number of fairies now is 50 (initial fairies) + 25 (new fairies) = 75.

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. To find the remaining number of fairies, we subtract 30 from the total number of fairies: 75 - 30 = 45.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the total number of puppies with spots, we need to add the number of puppies with spots from Jennifer's and Brandon's dogs. Jennifer has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon has 4 puppies with spots. So, the total number of puppies with spots is 3 + 4 = 7.

Next, we need to find the total number of puppies. Jennifer has 8 puppies, and Brandon has 12 puppies. So, the total number of puppies is 8 + 12 = 20.

To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we need to divide the total number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiply by 100. 

(7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

The final answer is: 35"
"To determine the number of trips the farmer needs to transport the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of all the feed and divide it by the capacity of the farm truck.

First, let's calculate the total weight of each type of feed:

- Sugar cubes: 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
- Carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
- Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
- Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Now, let's add up the total weight of all the feed:
2 pounds (sugar cubes) + 48 pounds (carrots) + 3150 pounds (hay) + 1300 pounds (oats) = 3400 pounds

Since the farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, we need to divide the total weight of the feed by the truck's capacity to find the number of trips:
3400 pounds / 2250 pounds/trip = 1.51 trips

Since the farmer cannot make a fraction of a trip, we round up to the nearest whole number to ensure all the feed is transported. Therefore, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate the total earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the earnings from aluminum cans. Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans a week, and each can is worth 2 cents. So, her weekly earnings from aluminum cans are 3 cans/week * 2 cents/can = 6 cents/week. 

For a four-week month, her earnings from aluminum cans would be 6 cents/week * 4 weeks = 24 cents.

Next, let's calculate the earnings from plastic bottles. Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles a week, and each bottle is worth 3 cents. So, her weekly earnings from plastic bottles are 5 bottles/week * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents/week.

For a four-week month, her earnings from plastic bottles would be 15 cents/week * 4 weeks = 60 cents.

Now, let's add the earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles to find the total earnings. Total earnings = 24 cents (aluminum cans) + 60 cents (plastic bottles) = 84 cents.

The final answer is: 84"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of plants Toni has first, and then subtract 7 from that number to find the number of plants Shondra has.

First, we know that Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick. Since Frederick has 10 plants, we can calculate the number of plants Toni has as follows:

Toni's plants = Frederick's plants + (60% of Frederick's plants)
Toni's plants = 10 + (0.6 * 10)
Toni's plants = 10 + 6
Toni's plants = 16

Now that we know Toni has 16 plants, we can find the number of plants Shondra has by subtracting 7 from Toni's total:

Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
Shondra's plants = 16 - 7
Shondra's plants = 9

The final answer is: 9"
"To find out how much Ali has now, we need to calculate the amount Leila gave him and add it to his initial amount.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. Finley started in first place, but then fell back 5 spots. This means she moved to 6th place (1 + 5 = 6). 

Next, she moved ahead 2 spots, so she is now in 4th place (6 - 2 = 4). 

Then, she fell behind 3 spots, so she is now in 7th place (4 + 3 = 7). 

Lastly, she jumped ahead 1 spot to finish the race, so she finished in 6th place (7 - 1 = 6).

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how many students Miss Maria has, we first need to determine the total number of cards she has. 

She has six decks of basketball cards with 25 cards in each deck, so the total number of basketball cards is 6 * 25 = 150.

She has five boxes of baseball cards with 40 cards in each box, so the total number of baseball cards is 5 * 40 = 200.

The total number of cards is the sum of basketball and baseball cards, which is 150 + 200 = 350.

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so the remaining cards are 350 - 50 = 300.

If her students got ten cards each, the number of students can be found by dividing the remaining cards by the number of cards each student received: 300 / 10 = 30.

The final numerical answer is: 30"
"To find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples for both of them.

Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each and received a $1 discount. The total cost of the apples for Becky is 20 * 0.45 = $9. Since she received a $1 discount, she paid 9 - 1 = $8.

Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each and received a 10 percent discount. The total cost of the apples for Kelly is 20 * 0.50 = $10. The 10 percent discount is 10% of $10, which is 0.1 * 10 = $1. So, Kelly paid 10 - 1 = $9.

To find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we subtract the amount Becky paid from the amount Kelly paid: 9 - 8 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To find the total number of pieces of laundry, we need to calculate the number of each type of laundry and then sum them up.

Each room has 2 sheets. Since there are 80 rooms, the total number of sheets is 2 * 80 = 160.

Each room has 1 comforter, so the total number of comforters is 80.

Each room has twice as many pillow cases as sheets, which means each room has 2 * 2 = 4 pillow cases. Therefore, the total number of pillow cases is 4 * 80 = 320.

Each room has twice as many towels as pillow cases, which means each room has 2 * 4 = 8 towels. Therefore, the total number of towels is 8 * 80 = 640.

Now, we sum up the total number of each type of laundry: 160 (sheets) + 80 (comforters) + 320 (pillow cases) + 640 (towels) = 1200.

The final numerical answer is: 1200"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of shoes Fireman Frank has at the end of the week. 

First, let's calculate the number of shoes he gets during the week: 
- 5 pairs on Monday (5 * 2 = 10 shoes)
- 15 pairs on Wednesday (15 * 2 = 30 shoes)
- 30 pairs on Friday (30 * 2 = 60 shoes)

Total shoes gained = 10 + 30 + 60 = 100 shoes

Now, let's calculate the total number of shoes he has at the end of the week: 
Initial shoes = 200
Shoes gained = 100
Total shoes = 200 + 100 = 300 shoes

However, he gets rid of 180 shoes on Saturday. 
Total shoes after getting rid of 180 shoes = 300 - 180 = 120 shoes

Therefore, Fireman Frank will have 120 shoes on Sunday.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of pencils used and then find the remaining pencils at the end of the year.

Initially, each student had 10 pencils, and there are 30 students. So, the total number of pencils at the beginning of the year is 30 * 10 = 300.

After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used. To find the number of pencils used, we multiply the total pencils by 1/5: 300 * (1/5) = 60 pencils used.

The remaining pencils after two months are 300 - 60 = 240.

At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. To find the number of pencils left, we multiply the remaining pencils by 1/3: 240 * (1/3) = 80.

"Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as 'x'. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:

Number of cookies = (1/2)x + 2

Since Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, we can set up the equation:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate the variable. First, subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

Therefore, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks to get 5 cookies. 

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the combined length of the remoras, we need to convert their individual lengths to feet and then add them together. 

Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 12 inches in a foot. So, we can convert 6 inches to feet by dividing by 12: 6 / 12 = 0.5 feet. 

Since there are two remoras, we multiply the length of one remora by 2: 0.5 * 2 = 1 foot.

Now, we add the length of the remoras to the length of the shark: 10 + 1 = 11 feet.

To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy, we divide the combined length of the remoras by the length of the shark and multiply by 100: (1 / 10) * 100 = 10%.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the total number of students as 'x'. We know that three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer, which means one-fourth do not have a desktop computer. Since 20 students do not have a desktop computer, we can set up the equation:

(1/4)x = 20

To solve for 'x', we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4 to isolate 'x':

x = 20 * 4
x = 80

Therefore, there are 80 students at that grade level.

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of minutes Jason has available to walk in three weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so in three weeks, there are 3 * 7 = 21 days. Since Jason can walk 4 days a week, the total number of days he can walk in three weeks is 21 * 4 = 84 days.

However, the problem asks for the number of minutes, not days. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total number of days to minutes by multiplying by 60. But first, we need to multiply the number of days Jason can walk by the number of minutes he walks each day to get the total number of minutes. 

Let's denote the number of minutes Jason walks each day as x. Then, the total number of minutes he walks in 84 days is 84x. We know that this total is equal to 240 minutes, so we can set up the equation 84x = 240.

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 84, which gives us x = 240 / 84.

x = 240 / 84
x = 2.857

So, Jason needs to spend approximately 2.857 hours or 171.43 minutes per day walking to break in the new shoes in three weeks.

The final answer is: 2.857"
"To find out how many books each child got, we need to first determine the total number of books Sarah bought. Since each book costs $15 and she spent $300, we can divide the total amount spent by the cost of each book to find the total number of books.

Total number of books = Total amount spent / Cost per book
Total number of books = $300 / $15
Total number of books = 20

Since Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, we can divide the total number of books by 4 to find out how many books each child got.

Number of books per child = Total number of books / Number of children
Number of books per child = 20 / 4
Number of books per child = 5

"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. 

First, let's find the total number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts. This is the sum of kids allergic to dairy and kids allergic to peanuts, minus the kids allergic to both (to avoid double-counting).

Number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts = Number of kids allergic to dairy + Number of kids allergic to peanuts - Number of kids allergic to both
= 9 + 6 - 3
= 12

Now, we know that there are 32 kids in the class. To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts from the total number of kids.

Number of kids not allergic to anything = Total number of kids - Number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts

"To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we first need to determine the weight of the 2010 penny. 

Given that the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can express this relationship as a ratio: 2010 penny weight = (3/4) * 1959 penny weight.

We are given that the 1959 penny weighs 48 grains. Therefore, we can substitute this value into the equation to find the weight of the 2010 penny:

2010 penny weight = (3/4) * 48
2010 penny weight = 36

Now that we know the weight of the 2010 penny, we can find the combined weight of the two pennies by adding their individual weights:

Combined weight = 2010 penny weight + 1959 penny weight
Combined weight = 36 + 48
Combined weight = 84

The final answer is: 84"

"To determine the total amount of oats needed, we need to calculate the daily consumption of oats by the horses and then multiply it by the number of days.

Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and there are two meals per day. So, the daily consumption per horse is 5 pounds/meal * 2 meals = 10 pounds/day.

Since Uncle Ben has four horses, the total daily consumption is 10 pounds/day * 4 horses = 40 pounds/day.

For five days, the total consumption would be 40 pounds/day * 5 days = 200 pounds.

Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats. To find out how many bags are needed, we divide the total consumption by the weight of each bag: 200 pounds / 50 pounds/bag = 4 bags.

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days.

"To find the cost per individual razor after the discount, we need to calculate the total cost of 2 packs of razors with the sale and coupon applied.

First, let's calculate the cost of 2 packs of razors at the sale price. Since it's buy one get one free, Heather will only pay for 1 pack, which costs $4.00. So, the total cost for 2 packs is $4.00.

Now, let's apply the $2.00 coupon to the total cost. The new total cost is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since each pack contains 4 razors, 2 packs will contain 8 razors. To find the cost per individual razor, we divide the total cost by the number of razors: $2.00 / 8 = $0.25 per razor.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.25 * 100 = 25 cents.

The 4 girls on the bottom are 64"" tall each. 
4 * 64"" = 256""

The 3 girls on top of the 4 are also 64"" tall each. 
3 * 64"" = 192""

The 2 girls on top of the 3 are also 64"" tall each. 
2 * 64"" = 128""

The shortest girl at the top is 60"" tall.

Now, we add up the heights of each level, starting from the bottom:
256"" + 192"" = 448""
448"" + 128"" = 576""
576"" + 60"" = 636""

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches):
636"" / 12 = 53 feet

The final answer is: 53"
"To find the total number of minutes Charisma walked, we need to calculate the total number of 5-minute breaks she took in a day and then multiply it by the number of days she worked.

Charisma works 8 hours a day, and she takes a 5-minute break every hour. So, the total number of 5-minute breaks in a day is 8 hours * 1 break per hour = 8 breaks per day.

Since each break is 5 minutes long, the total number of minutes she walked in a day is 8 breaks * 5 minutes per break = 40 minutes per day.

Charisma worked for 5 days, so the total number of minutes she walked is 40 minutes per day * 5 days = 200 minutes.

The final answer is: 200"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine Brett's age in four years. Since Brett is currently 14 years old, in four years, he will be 14 + 4 = 18 years old.

According to the problem, in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. Since Brett is currently 14 years old, three times his current age is 3 * 14 = 42 years old.

Since Angela will be 42 years old in four years, we need to subtract 4 from 42 to find her current age. Angela's current age is 42 - 4 = 38 years old.

The final answer is: 38"
"To find the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car, we need to calculate the cost of the morning rides and the cost of the afternoon rides separately, and then add them together.

The cost of the morning rides is the cost per ride multiplied by the number of rides: $6/ride * 14 rides = $84.

The cost of the afternoon rides is the cost per ride multiplied by the number of rides: $2/ride * 14 rides = $28.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the morning rides and the cost of the afternoon rides: $84 + $28 = $112.

The final numerical answer is: $112"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of oranges that Brianne and Ashley have combined, and then divide that number by the number of oranges required to make one pie.

Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so she has a total of 5 * 10 = 50 oranges.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so she has 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

The total number of oranges they have combined is 50 + 70 = 120 oranges.

Since one Greek orange pie requires 3 oranges, the number of pies they can make is 120 / 3 = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation representing the total cost for each venue. Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'.

For the first venue, the total cost is the flat fee of $200 plus the cost of food for each guest, which is $5x. So, the total cost for the first venue is 200 + 5x.

For the second venue, the total cost is the cost per guest, which is $25x, since food is already included.

To find the number of guests for which the two venues are equal in cost, we set the two equations equal to each other:

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtracting 5x from both sides gives us:

200 = 20x

Dividing both sides by 20 gives us:

10 = x

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we can start by assigning variables to the unknown quantities. Let's say David found 'x' insects. Since Lily found 7 more than David, Lily found x + 7 insects. 

We are also given that David found half of what Bodhi found. This means Bodhi found 2x insects, as David's collection is half of Bodhi's. 

The total number of insects collected is 43, which is the sum of the insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi. We can write this as an equation:

x + (x + 7) + 2x = 43

Combine like terms to simplify the equation:

4x + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides of the equation:

4x = 36

Divide both sides of the equation by 4:

x = 9

Since x represents the number of insects David found, and Lily found 7 more than David, Lily found x + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 insects.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total amount of yarn used, we need to calculate the amount used by Mariah and her grandma separately and then add them together.

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, and there are 364 yards in a skein. To find 1/4 of 364, we multiply 364 by 1/4 (which is the same as dividing by 4).

364 yards / 4 = 91 yards

So, Mariah used 91 yards of yarn.

Mariah's grandma used 1/2 of a skein, which is the same as 2/4. To find 2/4 of 364, we multiply 364 by 2 and then divide by 4.

364 * 2 = 728
728 / 4 = 182 yards

So, Mariah's grandma used 182 yards of yarn.

Now, we add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma together:

91 yards (Mariah) + 182 yards (grandma) = 273 yards

The final answer is: 273"
"To find the total number of gifts Cherrie bought, we need to calculate the number of gifts for her friends and add the 10 random gifts.

First, let's calculate the number of gifts for her friends. 2 friends want 5 gifts each, so the total number of gifts for these friends is 2 * 5 = 10. The other 3 friends want 2 gifts each, so the total number of gifts for these friends is 3 * 2 = 6. 

Now, we add the number of gifts for the first group of friends (10) and the second group of friends (6) to get the total number of gifts for her friends: 10 + 6 = 16.

Finally, we add the 10 random gifts to the total number of gifts for her friends: 16 + 10 = 26.

The final answer is: 26"
"To find the length of the couch, we first need to determine the width of the rug. Since the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, and the chair is 3 feet wide, the rug's width is 3 + 5 = 8 feet.

Next, we need to find the length of the couch. The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Twice the width of the rug is 2 * 8 = 16 feet. Adding 2 feet to this gives us the length of the couch: 16 + 2 = 18 feet.

The final answer is: 18"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as 'x'. Since Suzie bought two packs of strawberry gum, the total cost for these packs is 2x.

The cost of the pack of grape gum is $2, and the cost of the small pack of green apple gum is half of this, which is $1.

The total cost of all four packs of gum is $7. We can set up the equation as follows:

2x + 2 + 1 = 7

Combine the constants on the left side of the equation:

2x + 3 = 7

Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with the variable:

2x = 4

Divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for x:

x = 2

The cost of each pack of strawberry gum is $2."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine which type of lumber Frederick should buy to maximize the number of popsicle sticks he can make while staying within his budget of $24.

Let's denote the number of 2 x 4 pieces of wood Frederick buys as x and the number of 2 x 8 pieces of wood as y.

The cost of the 2 x 4 pieces of wood is $4 each, so the total cost of x 2 x 4 pieces of wood is 4x.

The cost of the 2 x 8 pieces of wood is $6 each, so the total cost of y 2 x 8 pieces of wood is 6y.

Since Frederick has a budget of $24, we can set up the following equation:

4x + 6y ≤ 24

We also know that the total number of popsicle sticks is the sum of the number of sticks from the 2 x 4 pieces of wood and the number of sticks from the 2 x 8 pieces of wood. The number of sticks from the 2 x 4 pieces of wood is 200x, and the number of sticks from the 2 x 8 pieces of wood is 400y.

To maximize the number of popsicle sticks, we want to maximize the total number of sticks, which is 200x + 400y.

Since we have the constraint 4x + 6y ≤ 24, we can solve for y in terms of x:

6y ≤ 24 - 4x
y ≤ (24 - 4x) / 6

To maximize the number of popsicle sticks, we want to maximize x, since 200x is a larger coefficient than 400y. However, we also need to make sure that y is non-negative, since we can't buy a negative number of pieces of wood.

Let's try to find the maximum value of x such that y is non-negative:

y ≤ (24 - 4x) / 6
y ≥ 0

Since y is an integer (we can't buy a fraction of a piece of wood), we can round down to the nearest integer. To do this, we need to find the smallest value of x such that (24 - 4x) / 6 is an integer.

Let's try x = 3:

(24 - 4(3)) / 6 = (24 - 12) / 6 = 12 / 6 = 2

Since 2 is an integer, x = 3 is a valid solution.

Now we can find the value of y:

y ≤ (24 - 4(3)) / 6
y ≤ 2

y = 2

Now we can find the total number of popsicle sticks:

Total number of sticks = 200x + 400y
= 200(3) + 400(2)
= 600 + 800
= 1400

The final answer is: 1400"
"To find the total cost of snowshoes for Mario's dogs, we first need to determine the total number of snowshoes required. Since each dog has four legs and Mario has 6 dogs, the total number of legs is 6 * 4 = 24.

Since each dog needs a pair of snowshoes, and each pair covers two legs, the total number of snowshoes required is 24 / 2 = 12.

Given that each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, the total cost will be the number of snowshoes required multiplied by the cost per pair, which is 12 * $12.00 = $144.00.

The final numerical answer is: $144.00"
"To find out how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips for a week and then subtract the cost of the weekly pass.

Janet takes two bus trips per day, five days a week. So, the total number of bus trips per week is 2 * 5 = 10.

Each bus trip costs $2.20, so the total cost of her bus trips for a week is 10 * $2.20 = $22.

The weekly bus pass costs $20. To find out how much Janet would save, we subtract the cost of the weekly pass from the total cost of her bus trips: $22 - $20 = $2.

Therefore, Janet would save $2 by buying a weekly bus pass.

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of cows and sheep at each location. 

Since the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, and the farm has 30 cows, the zoo must have 2 * 30 = 60 cows.

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does. Since the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm must have 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, we can calculate the total number of animals at the farm and the zoo. The farm has 30 cows and 10 sheep, for a total of 30 + 10 = 40 animals. The zoo has 60 cows and 20 sheep, for a total of 60 + 20 = 80 animals.

The total number of animals at the farm and the zoo combined is 40 + 80 = 120.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought. Let's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as 'x' and the number of potatoes as 'y'. We are given that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought. Therefore, the number of onions Rose bought is 4x and the number of potatoes Rose bought is 4y.

We are also given that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. This can be represented as two equations:

4x = 12 (equation 1)
4y = 4 (equation 2)

Solving equation 1 for x, we get:
x = 12 / 4
x = 3

Solving equation 2 for y, we get:
y = 4 / 4
y = 1

Now that we have the values of x and y, we can find the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought by adding x and y:
Total = x + y
Total = 3 + 1
Total = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To determine the required calorie deficit, we first need to calculate the total number of days Andy has to achieve his goal. Since his birthday is on July 19th and today is December 31st, we can calculate the number of days as follows:

December has 31 days, January has 31 days, February has 28 days (assuming a non-leap year), March has 31 days, April has 30 days, May has 31 days, June has 30 days, and July has 19 days. 

Total days = 31 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 211 days

Now, we need to calculate the total number of calories Andy needs to burn to lose 30 pounds. Since he needs to burn 3500 calories to lose 1 pound, the total calories he needs to burn is:

Total calories = 30 pounds * 3500 calories/pound = 105,000 calories

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories by the number of days:

Daily calorie deficit = Total calories / Total days
= 105,000 calories / 211 days
= approximately 497 calories/day

So, Andy needs to create a calorie deficit of approximately 497 calories per day to reach his goal of losing 30 pounds by his birthday. 

497"
"To find out how much Gerald has left, we need to calculate his total earnings for the week and then subtract the amount he spent.

Since Gerald works for an entire week, which has 7 days, and he earns $30 per day, his total earnings for the week would be:

Total earnings = Daily earnings * Number of days worked
Total earnings = $30 * 7
Total earnings = $210

Now, we subtract the amount he spent from his total earnings to find out how much he has left:

Amount left = Total earnings - Amount spent
Amount left = $210 - $100
Amount left = $110

"To find the total distance Hannah needs to run, we need to multiply the number of laps by the distance per lap. 

Distance per lap = 0.25 km
Number of laps = 8

Total distance = Distance per lap * Number of laps
Total distance = 0.25 km * 8
Total distance = 2 km

Since Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs, we can multiply the total distance by the amount of water needed per kilometer.

Water needed per kilometer = 60 ml
Total distance = 2 km

Total water needed = Water needed per kilometer * Total distance
Total water needed = 60 ml * 2
Total water needed = 120 ml

"To find the amount of money Julie had left, we need to calculate the amount spent on clothes and CDs, and then subtract that from the initial amount.

First, Julie spent 20% of $500 on clothes. 
20% of $500 = 0.20 * $500 = $100

Now, we subtract the amount spent on clothes from the initial amount:
$500 - $100 = $400

Next, Julie spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs.
25% of $400 = 0.25 * $400 = $100

Now, we subtract the amount spent on CDs from the remaining amount:
$400 - $100 = $300

Therefore, Julie had $300 left.

The final answer is: $300"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations. Let's denote the cost of the lot as 'x'. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house can be represented as 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot together is $120,000, so we can write the equation:

x + 3x = 120,000

Combine like terms:

4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4 to solve for x:

x = 30,000

Since the cost of the house is 3x, we can now find the cost of the house by multiplying x by 3:

Cost of the house = 3x = 3 * 30,000 = $90,000

The final answer is: $90,000"
"To find the profit, we first need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

The total cost is the cost of the canvas bags, which is 8 packs * 5 bags per pack * $4 per bag = 8 * 5 * 4 = $160.

The total revenue is the selling price of the bags, which is 8 bags * $8 per bag = 8 * 8 = $64.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $64 - $160 = -$96.

However, since profit cannot be negative, it seems there is an error in the problem. The selling price of $8 per bag is less than the cost price of $4 per bag, which is not possible. 

Assuming the selling price is higher than the cost price, let's recalculate the profit. 

The total cost is still $160. 

The total revenue is 8 bags * $8 per bag = 8 * 8 = $64. However, this is not possible as the total revenue should be higher than the total cost. 

Let's assume the selling price is $12 per bag. The total revenue is 8 bags * $12 per bag = 8 * 12 = $96.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $96 - $160 = -$64. This is still not possible.

Let's assume the selling price is $16 per bag. The total revenue is 8 bags * $16 per bag = 8 * 16 = $128.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $128 - $160 = -$32. This is still not possible.

Let's assume the selling price is $20 per bag. The total revenue is 8 bags * $20 per bag = 8 * 20 = $160.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $160 - $160 = $0.

However, this is not a profit. Let's assume the selling price is $24 per bag. The total revenue is 8 bags * $24 per bag = 8 * 24 = $192.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $192 - $160 = $32.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cookies Josh made first, and then use that information to find out how many cookies Kelsie made.

Since Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, and Suzanne made 36 cookies, we can find Josh's total by dividing Suzanne's total by 4.

Josh's cookies = Suzanne's cookies / 4
Josh's cookies = 36 / 4
Josh's cookies = 9

Now that we know Josh made 9 cookies, we can find out how many Kelsie made. Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh, so we multiply Josh's total by 2.

Kelsie's cookies = 2 * Josh's cookies
Kelsie's cookies = 2 * 9
Kelsie's cookies = 18

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of quarts each person can pick per hour and then add them together.

Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour.

Bobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony, so Bobby can pick 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.

Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy can pick 2 * 5 = 10 quarts per hour.

Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy, so Ricky can pick 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

Now, we add the number of quarts each person can pick per hour: 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29.

"To find the number of rows of red tulips, we divide the total number of red tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row: 36 red tulips / 6 tulips per row = 6 rows of red tulips.

To find the number of rows of blue tulips, we divide the total number of blue tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row: 24 blue tulips / 8 tulips per row = 3 rows of blue tulips.

Since the rows of red and blue tulips are not necessarily the same, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of rows of red and blue tulips to determine the total number of rows. The LCM of 6 and 3 is 6.

Therefore, Jackson will plant a total of 6 rows of flowers.

"To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we first need to determine how many cups of raisins she will have available for the oatmeal cookies. 

Since she wants to divide the raisins equally among the oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix, we can divide the total number of cups of raisins (27) by 3 (the number of items she wants to make). 

27 cups / 3 = 9 cups per item

Now, we know that each batch of oatmeal cookies requires 3/4 of a cup of raisins. To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we can divide the number of cups of raisins available for oatmeal cookies (9) by the amount required per batch (3/4).

9 cups / (3/4 cup) = 9 / (3/4) = 9 * (4/3) = 12

So, Heather can make 12 batches of oatmeal cookies.

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we first need to calculate her daily and weekly electric consumption before and after adding the new device.

Before adding the new device, Ada's daily electric consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. Since there are 24 hours in a day, her daily consumption is 12 * 24 = 288 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per day. 

After adding the new device, her daily consumption will be 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour. So, her daily consumption will be 14 * 24 = 336 kWh per day.

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7. Before adding the new device, Ada's weekly consumption is 288 * 7 = 2016 kWh. After adding the new device, her weekly consumption is 336 * 7 = 2352 kWh.

The cost of electricity is $1.50 per kWh. So, the weekly cost before adding the new device is 2016 * $1.50 = $3024. The weekly cost after adding the new device is 2352 * $1.50 = $3540.

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is $3540 - $3024 = $516.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the rate at which one person can paint a house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then we can calculate the time it would take to paint a whole house.

Since one person can paint half a house in 5 days, it would take them 10 days to paint a whole house (doubling the time for the entire house).

Now, let's calculate the time it would take for one person to paint a whole house in hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so:

10 days * 24 hours/day = 240 hours

Since one person can paint a whole house in 240 hours, we can now calculate the time it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house. If one person can paint a whole house in 240 hours, then 5 people can paint a whole house in:

240 hours / 5 people = 48 hours

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of chairs Ophelia and Jenna have. 

Since Ophelia has 20 sofas and she has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, we can set up an equation to find the number of chairs Ophelia has. Let's denote the number of chairs Ophelia has as 'x'. Then, the number of sofas she has is x - 2. We know that the number of sofas Ophelia has is 20, so we can write the equation as x - 2 = 20.

Solving for x, we get x = 22. This means Ophelia has 22 chairs.

Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.

Now, we know that Ophelia has 20 sofas and Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. So, Jenna has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

To find the total number of sofas and chairs, we add the number of sofas and chairs Ophelia and Jenna have: 20 + 22 + 64 + 66 = 152.

The final answer is: 152"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money Tom spent on the headphone set. We can do this by subtracting the cost of the CD from the total amount he paid.

Total amount paid = $48
Cost of CD = $4
Cost of headphone set = Total amount paid - Cost of CD
= $48 - $4
= $44

Now that we know the cost of the headphone set, we can find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with that amount.

Cost of one CD = $4
Number of CDs Tom could have bought with the cost of the headphone set = Cost of headphone set / Cost of one CD
= $44 / $4
= 11

So, Tom could have bought 11 more CDs if he had decided not to buy the headphone set.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we need to consider the different scenarios where he spent more or less time than the usual 4 hours per week.

Let's break it down:

- For 6 weeks, Josh spent 4 hours per week, which is a total of 6 * 4 = 24 hours.
- For 2 weeks, Josh spent 5 hours per week, which is a total of 2 * 5 = 10 hours.
- For 1 week, Josh spent 6 hours.

To find the total number of hours, we add the hours from each scenario: 24 + 10 + 6 = 40 hours.

However, we need to consider that the 6 hours were spent in one of the weeks where he spent 5 hours for two consecutive weeks. So, we need to subtract 5 hours from the 6 hours to avoid double-counting. This leaves us with 6 - 5 = 1 hour.

Now, we add the 1 hour to the total: 40 + 1 = 41 hours.

The total number of hours Josh spent working out across the 8 weeks is 41."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off. So, the number of passengers left on the bus is:
48 - 8 = 40

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (which is 8) get into the bus. So, the number of new passengers is 5 * 8 = 40. Now, the total number of passengers on the bus is:
40 (remaining) + 40 (new) = 80

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off. So, the number of passengers left on the bus is:
80 - 21 = 59

Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on. Since 3 times fewer means 1/3 of the number of passengers who got off, we need to find 1/3 of 21:
1/3 * 21 = 7

Now, the total number of passengers on the bus is:
59 (remaining) + 7 (new) = 66

The final number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop is 66."

Let Jame's current age be x. 

In 5 years, Jame will be x + 5 years old.

In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be (x + 5 + 8) years old, which simplifies to (x + 13) years old.

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age in 8 years. So, we can set up the equation:

"To find the cost of one monitor, we first need to determine the cost of the printer. Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, and the computer cost $1,100, the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700.

The total cost of the computer and the printer is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800. 

Since Errol bought 2 monitors, the cost of the two monitors is $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.

To find the cost of one monitor, we divide the total cost of the two monitors by 2: $600 / 2 = $300.

The final answer is: $300"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of shells brought by the boys and then calculate the number of shells brought by the girls.

Since there are 10 boys (half of 20 kids) and each boy brought 60 shells, the total number of shells brought by the boys is 10 * 60 = 600.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 60 (number of shells brought by the boys) + 4 * 60 (four times the number of shells brought by the boys) = 60 + 240 = 300 shells.

Since there are 10 girls (half of 20 kids), the number of shells brought by each girl is 300 / 10 = 30.

Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, we can multiply the number of candies George had before eating 5 by 2 to find the number of candies Nick had. 

8 * 2 = 16

Therefore, Nick has 16 candies."
"To find Anne's age, we first need to determine Alyana's age. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, we can calculate Alyana's age by subtracting 4 from Chenny's age.

Alyana's age = Chenny's age - 4
Alyana's age = 10 - 4
Alyana's age = 6

Now that we know Alyana's age, we can find Anne's age by adding 2 to Alyana's age.

Anne's age = Alyana's age + 2
Anne's age = 6 + 2
Anne's age = 8

Since Emma's target is 72 vlogs per month, we subtract the total vlogs made from the target to find out how many more vlogs she needs to make.

Vlogs needed = 72 - 54 = 18

Therefore, Emma should make 18 vlogs to complete 72 vlogs per month.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, $18 is shared among 3 boys. This means each boy gets $18 / 3 = $6.

The eldest boy added $5 to his share, so he now has $6 + $5 = $11.

The following day, he added another $10, so his total is now $11 + $10 = $21.

He then spent $8, leaving him with $21 - $8 = $13.

After saving some more, he tripled the amount he had left after spending the $8. This means he now has 3 * $13 = $39.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much Elvis needs to save in the first half of the month. 

Let's assume the first half of the month has 15 days (April 1-15). 

Let x be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of the month. 

The total amount saved in the first half of the month is 15x.

Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half, the amount saved in the second half is 2 * 15x = 30x.

The total amount saved in the month is the sum of the amounts saved in the first and second halves, which is 15x + 30x = 45x.

We know that Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125. 

So, we can set up the equation: 45x = 1125.

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 45: x = 1125 / 45 = 25.

Now that we know Elvis saves $25 per day in the first half of the month, we can find out how much he needs to save in the second half. 

The amount saved in the second half is 2 * 25 = 50.

"To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let's represent the amount of money Brad gets as 'x'. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, the amount of money Jeff gets can be represented as 4x.

We know that the total amount of money they are dividing is $100. Therefore, the sum of the money Jeff and Brad get should equal $100. We can write this as an equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms:

5x = 100

Now, divide both sides by 5 to solve for x:

x = 20

Since x represents the amount of money Brad gets, and Jeff gets 4 times as much, we can multiply x by 4 to find the amount of money Jeff gets:

4x = 4(20)
= 80

The final answer is: $80"

Since Jeff works 5 times a week, the total distance he walks in a week is 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week.

The final numerical answer is: 30"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Elise writes the alphabet in full twice, which means she writes 26 letters each time. So, in total, she has written 26 + 26 = 52 letters.

2. Then, she writes half of the alphabet, which is 13 letters (since 26 / 2 = 13).

3. So, now she has written a total of 52 + 13 = 65 letters.

4. Finally, she re-writes everything she has already written, which means she re-writes 65 letters.

5. To find the total number of letters Elise has written, we add the number of letters she wrote initially (65) to the number of letters she re-wrote (65). 

Total letters written = 65 + 65 = 130

The final answer is: 130"
"This problem can be modeled as a geometric progression, where the number of families notified in each round is multiplied by 3. 

In the first round, 3 families are notified. 
In the second round, 3 * 3 = 9 families are notified.
In the third round, 9 * 3 = 27 families are notified.
In the fourth round, 27 * 3 = 81 families will be notified.

"To find Mark's initial weight, we need to calculate the total weight he lost during the 3 months and then add that to his final weight.

Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, so the total weight lost is:
10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds

Since Mark's final weight is 70 pounds, we can find his initial weight by adding the total weight lost to his final weight:
Initial weight = Final weight + Total weight lost
Initial weight = 70 pounds + 30 pounds
Initial weight = 100 pounds

The final answer is: 100"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of toys in the larger play set that Jonathan wants to have. Since James's play set has 80 toys and Jonathan wants a play set five times larger, we can calculate the total number of toys in Jonathan's desired play set as follows:

Total toys in Jonathan's desired play set = 5 * 80 = 400 toys

Since Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to reach this total, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

x + 2 = 400

where x is the number of toys Jonathan currently has.

To solve for x, we can subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

x = 400 - 2
x = 398

Therefore, Jonathan currently has 398 toys. 

The final answer is: 398"
"To find the total cost of the items Daniel wants to buy, we first need to calculate the cost of each item before the discount. 

The cost of 5 notebooks at $1.50 each is 5 * $1.50 = $7.50.
The cost of 2 pens at $0.25 each is 2 * $0.25 = $0.50.
The cost of 1 calculator at $12 is $12.
The cost of 1 geometry set at $10 is $10.

The total cost before the discount is $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30.

Since the shop gives a 10% discount on all the purchased items, we need to calculate 10% of $30, which is 0.1 * $30 = $3.

The total cost after the discount is $30 - $3 = $27.

Therefore, Daniel has to spend $27 on all the items he wants to buy.

The final answer is: $27"
"To find the total cost of the items, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of five hamburgers at $4 each is 5 x $4 = $20.
The cost of ten packs of potato fries at $0.30 each is 10 x $0.30 = $3.
The cost of five cans of fruit drinks at $2 each is 5 x $2 = $10.

Now, we add the costs together: $20 + $3 + $10 = $33.

Carly pays with a $50 bill, so the change she gets back is $50 - $33 = $17.

The final answer is: $17"
"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we need to break down her sales into two parts: the first $1000 and the sales above $1000.

For the first $1000, Antonella earns a 30% commission:
Commission on the first $1000 = 0.3 * $1000 = $300

For the sales above $1000, which is $2500 - $1000 = $1500, Antonella earns an additional 10% commission:
Commission on the sales above $1000 = 0.1 * $1500 = $150

Total commission earned by Antonella = Commission on the first $1000 + Commission on the sales above $1000
Total commission earned by Antonella = $300 + $150
Total commission earned by Antonella = $450

Therefore, Antonella earned $450.

The final answer is: $450"
"To determine the number of additional bottles Bill needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles he already has and the total number of bottles he needs.

Bill started with 2 cases of water, each containing 24 bottles. So, the total number of bottles he has is 2 * 24 = 48 bottles.

Since Bill wants to have 2 bottles of water for each of his 70 guests, the total number of bottles he needs is 70 * 2 = 140 bottles.

To find out how many additional bottles he needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles he needs: 140 - 48 = 92 bottles.

Therefore, Bill needs to buy 92 additional bottles of water.

The final answer is: 92"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the time it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. 

Let's denote the time it takes to swim a mile in cold water as C = 16 minutes. 

The time it takes to swim a mile in warm water is 2 minutes more than twice as long as in cold water. So, the time in warm water is 2C + 2 minutes. 

Substituting the value of C, we get the time in warm water as 2(16) + 2 = 32 + 2 = 34 minutes.

Now, we need to find the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in cold and warm water.

Time to swim 3 miles in cold water = 3C = 3(16) = 48 minutes.

Time to swim 3 miles in warm water = 3(34) = 102 minutes.

The difference in time is 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

The final answer is: 54"
"To determine the number of weeks it will take John to save $80, we need to calculate his weekly earnings and then divide the target savings by his weekly earnings.

First, let's calculate John's daily earnings: 
$2 per hour * 5 hours per day = $10 per day

Next, let's calculate his weekly earnings: 
$10 per day * 4 days per week = $40 per week

Now, let's divide the target savings by his weekly earnings to find out how many weeks it will take him to save $80:
$80 / $40 per week = 2 weeks

"To find the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub, we need to multiply the cost of the foot-long fish sub by 3. 

Cost of the foot-long fish sub = $40
Cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub = 3 * $40 = $120

Now, we need to find the total cost of both subs. 

Total cost = Cost of the foot-long fish sub + Cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub
Total cost = $40 + $120
Total cost = $160

The final answer is: $160"
"To find the total number of holes in the bag, we need to calculate the number of holes in the buttons with two holes and the number of holes in the buttons with four holes.

There are 7 buttons with two holes. Since each of these buttons has 2 holes, the total number of holes in these buttons is 7 * 2 = 14.

The total number of buttons in the bag is 21. Since 7 buttons have two holes, the number of buttons with four holes is 21 - 7 = 14.

There are 14 buttons with four holes. Since each of these buttons has 4 holes, the total number of holes in these buttons is 14 * 4 = 56.

The total number of holes in the bag is the sum of the holes in the buttons with two holes and the holes in the buttons with four holes. Therefore, the total number of holes is 14 + 56 = 70.

The final answer is: 70"
"To find the size of Peter's locker, we need to determine the size of Zack's locker first, and then calculate 1/4 of that size.

Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches. Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, so Zack's locker is 24 / 2 = 12 cubic inches.

Now, we need to find 1/4 of Zack's locker size to determine Peter's locker size. Peter's locker is 1/4 * 12 = 3 cubic inches.

The final answer is: 3"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the amount of coffee Juan currently drinks. Since Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks, and Octavia drinks half the daily recommended amount, we need to know the daily recommended amount of coffee.

Let's assume the daily recommended amount of coffee is x cups. Then, Octavia drinks x/2 cups of coffee. Since Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks, Juan drinks 10 * (x/2) = 5x cups of coffee.

The doctor has asked Juan to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. To find out how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we need to subtract the recommended amount from his current intake:

Current intake: 5x cups
Recommended intake: 4 cups

Reduction needed: 5x - 4 cups

However, we don't know the value of x, the daily recommended amount of coffee. To find the reduction, we need to know the value of x. 

Since the problem doesn't provide the value of x, we can express the reduction in terms of x:

Reduction needed: 5x - 4 cups

To provide a numerical answer, we need more information about the daily recommended amount of coffee. However, if we assume the daily recommended amount of coffee is 8 cups (a common recommendation), we can calculate the reduction:

Reduction needed: 5x - 4 cups
x = 8 cups (assuming daily recommended amount)
Reduction needed: 5(8) - 4 = 40 - 4 = 36 cups

However, this is an assumption. Without knowing the actual daily recommended amount of coffee, we cannot provide a definitive numerical answer.

If we assume the daily recommended amount of coffee is 8 cups, the answer is 36 cups."
"To find the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we need to calculate the number of hamsters and guinea pigs separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of hamsters: 
There are 3 cages with 10 hamsters each, so the total number of hamsters is 3 * 10 = 30.

Next, let's calculate the number of guinea pigs: 
There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each, so the total number of guinea pigs is 3 * 5 = 15.

Now, let's add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs to find the total number of rodents: 
Total rodents = 30 (hamsters) + 15 (guinea pigs) = 45.

"To find the average weight of the three friends, we first need to determine their individual weights. 

Mark's weight is given as 150 pounds. 
Susan's weight is 20 pounds less than Mark's, so Susan's weight is 150 - 20 = 130 pounds. 
Bob's weight is twice as much as Susan's, so Bob's weight is 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, we can find the average weight by adding the weights of all three friends and dividing by 3. 
Average weight = (Mark's weight + Susan's weight + Bob's weight) / 3 
= (150 + 130 + 260) / 3 
= 540 / 3 
= 180

"To solve this problem, we need to find the total angle the sun will be from the ground after 10 hours. 

The initial angle of the sun relative to the ground is 0 degrees (since it's at the tip of the pyramid). The sun moves 5 degrees per hour, so after 10 hours, it will move 5 * 10 = 50 degrees.

However, the pyramids are at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground. To find the total angle from the ground to the sun, we need to add the angle of the pyramid to the angle the sun has moved.

Total angle = Angle of the pyramid + Angle the sun has moved
Total angle = 32 degrees + 50 degrees
Total angle = 82 degrees

The final answer is: 82"
"To find out how many packs of candles James needs to buy, we first need to determine the total number of candles required. Since James has two sons, one 12 years old and the other 4 years younger, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Typically, birthday candles are used in the number equal to the age of the person. Therefore, James needs 12 candles for the older son and 8 candles for the younger son, totaling 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we need to find out how many packs James needs to buy. To do this, we divide the total number of candles needed (20) by the number of candles per pack (5). 

20 / 5 = 4

However, since 20 is not exactly divisible by 5, we need to consider the remainder. In this case, James will need 4 full packs of candles (4 * $3 = $12) and an additional 0 candles from a fifth pack (since 20 is exactly divisible by 5), but since he can't buy a fraction of a pack, he will need to buy 4 packs of candles.

The total cost will be 4 packs * $3 = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To find out how many pages Judy read in the first week, we need to calculate the total minutes she read in the first week and then convert that to pages. 

In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night. Assuming there are 7 nights in a week, she read for a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes in the first week.

Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we need to find out how many 1.5 minute intervals are in 105 minutes. To do this, we divide 105 by 1.5, which equals 70. 

Now, we multiply the number of 1.5 minute intervals (70) by the number of pages she can read in that time (2), which equals 140 pages.

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

To find the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we add the pages she read in the first week (140) to the pages she read in the second week (100), which equals 240 pages.

"To find out how many sandwiches are left, we need to determine how many Cody and Trevor ate in total and subtract that from the initial number of sandwiches.

Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, which is 1/3 * 12 = 4 sandwiches.

Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches, which is 1/4 * 12 = 3 sandwiches.

In total, they ate 4 + 3 = 7 sandwiches.

Now, we subtract the total number of sandwiches eaten from the initial number of sandwiches: 12 - 7 = 5.

"To solve this problem, we can start by representing Shiloh's age in 7 years as x + 7, where x is his current age. We are given that in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. Let's represent the nephew's age in 7 years as y + 7.

We can set up the equation based on the given information: x + 7 = 3(y + 7).

Now, we can substitute the given value of x, which is 44, into the equation: 44 + 7 = 3(y + 7).

Simplifying the equation, we get 51 = 3y + 21.

Subtracting 21 from both sides of the equation, we get 30 = 3y.

Dividing both sides of the equation by 3, we get y = 10.

Since y represents the nephew's age in 7 years, we need to subtract 7 from y to find the nephew's current age: 10 - 7 = 3.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. 

First, the tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth. 

Then, for the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 each, so the total amount for these three teeth is 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.

For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as Sharon had received for each of the previous three teeth. Since Sharon received $1.00 for each of the previous three teeth, half of that amount is $0.50. So, for the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon: $5.00 (for the first tooth) + $3.00 (for the next three teeth) + $1.00 (for the last two teeth) = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of goals scored by Mark and Anna. 

Let's denote the number of goals scored by Mark as M and the number of goals scored by Anna as A. 

We are given that Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, so we can write an equation: R = M + 20. 

We are also given that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, so we can write another equation: R = A + 45.

We are given that Richie scored 80 goals, so we can substitute R = 80 into both equations:

80 = M + 20
80 = A + 45

Now, we can solve for M and A:

M = 80 - 20
M = 60

A = 80 - 45
A = 35

Now that we have the number of goals scored by Mark and Anna, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers:

Total goals = R + M + A
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35
Total goals = 175

Liam made $63 in total. 

Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 apiece, so we multiply the number of lemonades by the price per lemonade: 21 * 4 = 84.

Now, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings: 84 - 63 = 21.

The final answer is: $21"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Peter spent on wooden action figures and the total amount of money he has left to spend on plastic action figures.

First, let's calculate the amount of money Peter spent on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday. Since he spent an equal amount each day, we can divide the total number of days (4) by 4 to find the amount spent each day. 

4 days * $5 per day = $20 spent on wooden action figures.

Now, let's calculate the amount of money Peter has left. He started with $70 and spent $20 on wooden action figures.

$70 - $20 = $50 left

Since Peter will spend an equal amount each day for the rest of the week, we need to calculate the number of days left in the week. There are 7 days in a week, and he has already spent 4 days, so there are 3 days left.

3 days * $50 / 3 = $16.67 per day

However, since Peter can't buy a fraction of an action figure, we'll round down to $16 per day.

Now, let's calculate the amount of money Peter will spend on plastic action figures. He will spend $16 per day for 3 days.

3 days * $16 per day = $48 spent on plastic action figures

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Peter has left after buying plastic action figures.

$50 - $48 = $2 left

Since Peter spent $2 on plastic action figures, he must have bought 1 plastic action figure.

Now, let's calculate the total number of wooden action figures he bought. He spent $20 on wooden action figures, and each action figure costs $5.

$20 / $5 = 4 wooden action figures

Finally, let's calculate the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week.

4 wooden action figures + 1 plastic action figure = 5 action figures

"To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we first need to calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week and then per month.

The total number of roses ordered per week is 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered per month is 65 * 4 = 260 roses.

Ford grows 40 roses every week, so the total number of roses he grows per month is 40 * 4 = 160 roses.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the total number of roses he grows per month from the total number of roses ordered per month: 260 - 160 = 100 roses.

"To calculate the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost.

The total revenue is the number of sandwiches sold multiplied by the price per sandwich. In this case, they sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each, so the total revenue is:

10 sandwiches * $7.00/sandwich = $70.00

The total cost consists of the cost of bread and the cost of cheese and condiments. The cost of bread is $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches. So, the cost of bread per sandwich is:

$3.00/loaf / 10 sandwiches/loaf = $0.30/sandwich

The cost of cheese and condiments per 10 sandwiches is $30.00, so the cost of cheese and condiments per sandwich is:

$30.00 / 10 sandwiches = $3.00/sandwich

The total cost per sandwich is the sum of the cost of bread and the cost of cheese and condiments:

$0.30/sandwich + $3.00/sandwich = $3.30/sandwich

Now, we can calculate the total cost for 10 sandwiches:

10 sandwiches * $3.30/sandwich = $33.00

The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
= $70.00 - $33.00
= $37.00

"To find out how much money Kate can make, we first need to determine the total number of muffin crayons she can make. Since Kate melts 8 small pieces of crayons together in each muffin tin, and there are 3 boxes of 64 crayons, we need to find the total number of small pieces of crayons.

First, we find the total number of small pieces of crayons: 3 boxes * 64 crayons per box = 192 crayons.

Since Kate melts 8 small pieces of crayons together in each muffin tin, we divide the total number of small pieces of crayons by 8 to find the total number of muffin crayons: 192 / 8 = 24 muffin crayons.

Now, we can find the total amount of money Kate can make by multiplying the number of muffin crayons by the price per muffin crayon: 24 muffin crayons * $1.50 per muffin crayon = $36.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the area of the bedroom, the cost of the new carpet, the cost of the padding, and the cost of removing the old carpet and installing the new one.

First, let's calculate the area of the bedroom:
Area = Length x Width
Area = 18 feet x 12 feet
Area = 216 square feet

Next, let's calculate the cost of the new carpet:
Cost of new carpet = Area x Cost per square foot
Cost of new carpet = 216 square feet x $12 per square foot
Cost of new carpet = $2592

Now, let's calculate the cost of the padding:
Cost of padding = Area x Cost per square foot
Cost of padding = 216 square feet x $2 per square foot
Cost of padding = $432

The cost of removing the old carpet is $4 per square foot, so:
Cost of removing old carpet = Area x Cost per square foot
Cost of removing old carpet = 216 square feet x $4 per square foot
Cost of removing old carpet = $864

The cost of installing the new carpet is $34 per square foot, so:
Cost of installing new carpet = Area x Cost per square foot
Cost of installing new carpet = 216 square feet x $34 per square foot
Cost of installing new carpet = $7344

Now, let's add up all the costs:
Total cost = Cost of new carpet + Cost of padding + Cost of removing old carpet + Cost of installing new carpet
Total cost = $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344
Total cost = $11332

"To solve this problem, we need to find the percentage by which the oven is off. We can do this by finding the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature, and then dividing by the set temperature.

Let's calculate the percentage difference:

Difference = Actual temperature - Set temperature
= 468 - 450
= 18

Percentage difference = (Difference / Set temperature) * 100
= (18 / 450) * 100
= 4%

Now that we know the oven is off by 4%, we can find the temperature Maggie should set it to for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees. Let's calculate the actual temperature the oven will reach:

Actual temperature = Set temperature + (Set temperature * Percentage difference)
= 520 + (520 * 0.04)
= 520 + 20.8
= 540.8

However, since we are looking for the temperature Maggie should set it at, we need to subtract the percentage difference from the actual temperature the recipe calls for:

Temperature to set = Actual temperature the recipe calls for - (Actual temperature the recipe calls for * Percentage difference)
= 520 - (520 * 0.04)
= 520 - 20.8
= 499.2

So, Maggie should set her oven to 499.2 degrees for the recipe that calls for 520 degrees.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time as follows:
1 hour = 60 minutes
Adding the 30 minutes, we get:
60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting the time to minutes:
2 hours = 2 * 60 minutes = 120 minutes
Adding the 5 minutes, we get:
120 minutes + 5 minutes = 125 minutes

Now, we add the time of both movies together:
90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes

The total time Max will spend watching the two movies is 215 minutes.

"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house price and subtract it from Herb's house price. 

Herb's house price = $76,000
30% of Herb's house price = 0.30 * $76,000 = $22,800
Juan's house price = Herb's house price - 30% of Herb's house price
= $76,000 - $22,800
= $53,200

Now, we need to find the combined value of the two houses.
Combined value = Herb's house price + Juan's house price
= $76,000 + $53,200
= $129,200

The final answer is: $129,200"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of cups Judy brought is 12, and the total number of cups her friend brought is 40. The total number of cups is 12 + 40 = 52.

The total number of dishes Judy brought is 24, and the total number of dishes her friend brought is 44. The total number of dishes is 24 + 44 = 68.

The total number of utensils (cups and dishes) brought by the two is 52 + 68 = 120.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the cost per pair of contacts, we first need to determine the total number of contacts in 2 boxes and the total cost of 2 boxes with the discount.

Since 90 contacts last Pete 45 days, we can calculate the number of contacts he uses per day. 

90 contacts / 45 days = 2 contacts per day

Since Pete buys 2 boxes, the total number of contacts will be 2 boxes * 90 contacts per box = 180 contacts.

The total number of days the contacts will last is 180 contacts / 2 contacts per day = 90 days.

The cost of 2 boxes with a 10% discount is 2 * $100.00 * (1 - 0.10) = 2 * $100.00 * 0.90 = $180.00.

Now, we can find the cost per pair of contacts by dividing the total cost by the total number of contacts.

Cost per pair of contacts = Total cost / Total number of contacts
= $180.00 / 180
= $1.00

The final answer is: $1.00"
"To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we need to calculate their individual earnings and then find the difference.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, for a total of 3 hours. Her hourly wage is $10, so her total earnings are 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 hours. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, which is 3 * 1 = 3 hours. So, John worked a total of 4 + 3 = 7 hours. His total earnings are 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find the total calories burned, we need to calculate the calories burned during aerobics and running separately and then add them together.

Aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories
Running: 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories

Total calories burned = 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we need to find out how many sets of 200 calories are in 1600 calories.

1600 calories / 200 calories = 8

Since she needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, she needs 8 * 100 ml = 800 ml of water.

The final answer is: 800"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G. 

From the given information, we have the following equations:

1. R = 0.99B (1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans)
2. G = 1.01B (1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans)
3. B + R + G = 4500 (total number of jelly beans)

Substituting equations 1 and 2 into equation 3, we get:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500
Combine like terms:
3B = 4500
Divide both sides by 3:
B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

R = 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
G = 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

To find the difference between the number of green and red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the average of the three measurements, we need to first find the third measurement, which is Jared's typing speed after increasing it by 5 words per minute from 52 WPM.

Jared's typing speed after the second measurement is 52 WPM. To find the third measurement, we add 5 to 52:

52 WPM + 5 WPM = 57 WPM

Now, we have the three measurements: 47 WPM, 52 WPM, and 57 WPM. To find the average, we add these three measurements and divide by 3:

(47 + 52 + 57) / 3 = 156 / 3 = 52

"To find the difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks, we need to calculate the total weight change for each breakfast option and then find the difference between the two.

For the first 5 weeks, if Martin eats Cheerios every day, he will lose 1.25 pounds/week. The total weight loss will be:
1.25 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 6.25 pounds

For the first 5 weeks, if Martin eats donuts every day, he will gain 1.75 pounds/week. The total weight gain will be:
1.75 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 8.75 pounds

The difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options will be the difference between the total weight gain and the total weight loss:
8.75 pounds (gain) - 6.25 pounds (loss) = 2.5 pounds

The final answer is: 2.5"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of people attending the event. 

First, let's consider the people invited via email. Each of the 100 people invited via email will bring 2 friends, so the total number of people invited via email is 100 + (100 * 2) = 300.

Next, let's consider the people invited by phone. Alex calls 10 friends and 8 of them will bring their spouses, so the total number of people invited by phone is 10 + 8 = 18.

Now, we need to add the number of people invited via email and phone to get the total number of people attending the event. However, we need to be careful not to double-count the people who were invited by both email and phone. Since Alex invited 10 friends via phone, and each of them was already invited via email, we need to subtract 10 from the total number of people invited via email to avoid double-counting.

So, the total number of people attending the event is 300 - 10 + 18 = 308.

Therefore, Alex will need 308 seats.

"To find the weight of the Mastiff, we need to start from the Papillon's weight and work our way back to the Mastiff's weight. 

The Papillon's weight is one-fourth of the Dachshund's weight. If the Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, then the Dachshund's weight is 2 * 10 pounds = 20 pounds. 

Since the Papillon weighs one-fourth of the Dachshund's weight, the Papillon's weight is 20 pounds / 4 = 5 pounds.

The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon. Therefore, the Mastiff's weight is 44 * 5 pounds = 220 pounds.

The final answer is: 220"
"To find the total cost of the boots on eBay, we need to calculate the shipping cost first. Since the shipping cost on eBay is twice as much as it is on Amazon, and the shipping cost on Amazon is $4, the shipping cost on eBay is 2 * $4 = $8.

The total cost of the boots on eBay is the cost of the boots plus the shipping cost, which is $13 + $8 = $21.

The total cost of the boots on Amazon is $16 + $4 = $20.

To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we subtract the total cost on Amazon from the total cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

"To solve this problem, we can use exponential growth principles. The initial height of the beanstalk is 4 feet, and it doubles every day. We want to find the number of days it takes for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, which is 20 feet off the ground.

Let's denote the number of days as 'n'. The height of the beanstalk after 'n' days can be represented as 4 * 2^n, since it doubles every day.

We want to find the smallest 'n' such that 4 * 2^n > 20. 

We can start by trying different values of 'n':

- For n = 1, 4 * 2^1 = 8 (less than 20)
- For n = 2, 4 * 2^2 = 16 (less than 20)
- For n = 3, 4 * 2^3 = 32 (greater than 20)

Therefore, it will take 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

"To find the amount of protein John gets per day, we need to calculate the ratio of protein to the total weight of mushrooms he eats. 

The ratio of protein to the total weight of mushrooms in one cup is 3 grams of protein / 100 grams of mushrooms. 

To find the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms, we can set up a proportion: 

(3 grams of protein / 100 grams of mushrooms) = x grams of protein / 200 grams of mushrooms

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 

3 * 200 = 100 * x
600 = 100x
x = 600 / 100
x = 6 grams of protein per 200 grams of mushrooms

Now that we know the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms, we can calculate the amount of protein John gets per day. 

Since John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, he gets 6 grams of protein per day.

To find the amount of protein John gets per week, we multiply the daily amount of protein by 7: 

6 grams of protein per day * 7 days per week = 42 grams of protein per week.

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's denote Jerry's current age as 'x'. According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, which can be expressed as:

x = 2(x - 5)

Simplifying the equation:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting 2x from both sides:

-x = -10

Dividing both sides by -1:

x = 10

So, Jerry's current age is 10 years. To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

x + 3 = 10 + 3
x + 3 = 13

"To find out how many hours George needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the dental work. 

The base price for two implants is 2 * $2000 = $4000. 
For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain, which costs an extra $500. So, the total cost for the implants with the crown is $4000 + $500 = $4500. 

However, George has already put down a deposit of $600. Therefore, the remaining amount he needs to pay is $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since George makes $15 per hour at work, we can find out how many hours he needs to work by dividing the remaining amount by his hourly wage: $3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

The final answer is: 260"
"Let's denote the smallest angle as x. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, which is 2x, and one angle is three times the smallest angle, which is 3x.

Since the three angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:

One angle is twice the smallest angle: 2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees
One angle is three times the smallest angle: 3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has in cents. 

First, let's convert the coins to cents:
- 8 quarters = 8 * 25 = 200 cents
- 6 dimes = 6 * 10 = 60 cents
- 14 nickels = 14 * 5 = 70 cents
- 15 pennies = 15 * 1 = 15 cents

Now, let's add up the total amount of money Colby has:
Total money = 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total money by the cost of one gumball to find out how many Colby can buy:
Number of gumballs = Total money / Cost per gumball = 345 / 5 = 69

"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of pet and then sum them up.

Dogs have 4 legs each, and there are 5 dogs. So, the total number of legs from dogs is 5 * 4 = 20.

Cats have 4 legs each, and there are 2 cats. So, the total number of legs from cats is 2 * 4 = 8.

Birds have 2 legs each, and there are 10 birds. So, the total number of legs from birds is 10 * 2 = 20.

Now, we add up the total number of legs from each type of pet: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48.

"To find the rate at which the plane is traveling, we can use the formula: rate = distance / time. 

Given that the plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, we can calculate the rate as follows:

rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours = 400 miles per hour.

Now, to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate, we can use the formula: time = distance / rate.

time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour = 5 hours.

Therefore, it would take the plane an additional 5 hours to travel 2000 miles at the same rate.

"To solve this problem, we first need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa makes in an hour. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, we can find Marissa's hourly rate by multiplying Ruiz's rate by 3/4.

Ruiz's rate = 120 pounds / 2 hours = 60 pounds per hour
Marissa's rate = 3/4 * 60 pounds per hour = 45 pounds per hour

Now, we need to find the total amount of chocolates they make in 12 hours. We can do this by adding their individual rates multiplied by the number of hours they worked.

Ruiz's total = 60 pounds per hour * 12 hours = 720 pounds
Marissa's total = 45 pounds per hour * 12 hours = 540 pounds

Total amount of chocolates made together = Ruiz's total + Marissa's total = 720 pounds + 540 pounds = 1260 pounds

"To find the number of rotations per mile, we divide the total rotations by the number of rotations per 2 miles. 

Rotations per mile = 725 rotations / 2 miles = 362.5 rotations per mile

Since Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, the total number of rotations per month is:

Total rotations per month = 400 miles/month * 362.5 rotations/mile = 145,000 rotations/month

The total number of rotations the tire can undergo is 10,440,000. To find the number of months the tire can last, we divide the total rotations by the rotations per month:

Months the tire can last = 10,440,000 rotations / 145,000 rotations/month = 72 months

There are 12 months in a year, so the number of years the tire can last is:

Years the tire can last = 72 months / 12 months/year = 6 years

"To find out how much money Joe will have left after the purchase, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he wants to buy and then subtract that from the initial amount of money he has.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount. The shirt costs $25 and the shorts cost $35, so the total cost is $25 + $35 = $60.

Since there is a 30% off sale, we need to calculate the discount amount. To do this, we multiply the total cost by the discount percentage (30% or 0.3). The discount amount is $60 * 0.3 = $18.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final cost of the items. $60 - $18 = $42.

Since sales tax is included in the prices, we don't need to add any additional tax to the final cost.

Finally, we subtract the final cost from the initial amount of money Joe has to find out how much he will have left. $50 - $42 = $8.

"To determine the amount of butter needed, we first need to calculate the total number of croissants Juan wants to make in a week. Since he wants to make 4 dozen croissants per day, and there are 7 days in a week, the total number of croissants is:

4 dozen/day * 7 days = 4 * 7 = 28 dozen

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, the total number of croissants is:

28 dozen * 12 = 336 croissants

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of butter required to make 336 croissants. It takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. To find the amount of butter needed for 336 croissants, we first need to convert the number of croissants to dozens:

336 croissants / 12 = 28 dozen

Now, we can multiply the number of dozens by the amount of butter needed per dozen:

28 dozen * (1/4 pound/dozen) = 28 * (1/4) = 7 pounds

Therefore, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 336 croissants.

"To find the cost of repaving Lewis' street, we need to multiply the cost per meter by the length of the street. 

Cost per meter: $194
Length of Lewis' street: 490 meters

Cost to repave Lewis' street = Cost per meter * Length of Lewis' street
Cost to repave Lewis' street = $194 * 490
Cost to repave Lewis' street = $95,060

To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's, we need to first calculate the cost of repaving Monica's street and then subtract it from the cost of repaving Lewis' street.

Cost to repave Monica's street = Cost per meter * Length of Monica's street
Cost to repave Monica's street = $194 * 150
Cost to repave Monica's street = $29,100

Now, we subtract the cost of repaving Monica's street from the cost of repaving Lewis' street to find the difference.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the research. 

First, let's break down the initial funding and the duration of the research. John initially received $100,000 for the first 5 months. However, his research ended up taking 10 times longer than expected, which is 10 * 5 = 50 months.

Since the research took 50 months, we need to calculate the additional funding required for the remaining 45 months (50 - 5 = 45 months). The funding for each of these months is 50% more than the initial funding. 

The initial funding for the first 5 months is $100,000. To find the additional funding for each month, we need to calculate 50% of $100,000, which is 0.5 * $100,000 = $50,000. 

So, the additional funding for each month is $100,000 + $50,000 = $150,000.

Now, we need to calculate the total additional funding required for the remaining 45 months. This is 45 * $150,000 = $6,750,000.

The total funding required for the research is the initial funding for the first 5 months plus the additional funding for the remaining 45 months. This is $100,000 + $6,750,000 = $6,850,000.

The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.

The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so the total amount of meat consumed by the second player is 8 ounces.

The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, the third player ate 16 ounces of meat.

Now, let's add up the total amount of meat consumed by the first, second, and third players: 6 + 8 + 16 = 30 ounces.

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Therefore, the total amount of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces.

"To find out how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we need to calculate the total amount of meat Prince sells in a day and then divide the total weight of the bull's meat by that amount.

Prince sells 15kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day, so the total amount of meat he sells in a day is:

15 kg/hour * 10 hours = 150 kg/day

Now, we need to divide the total weight of the bull's meat (750 kg) by the amount of meat Prince sells in a day (150 kg):

750 kg / 150 kg/day = 5 days

Therefore, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the number of students, we first need to determine the total number of seats in the auditorium. 

Total number of seats = Number of rows * Number of seats per row
Total number of seats = 4 * 18
Total number of seats = 72

Next, we find the number of seats occupied by the administrators. 

Number of seats occupied by administrators = (1/4) * Total number of seats
Number of seats occupied by administrators = (1/4) * 72
Number of seats occupied by administrators = 18

Now, we find the number of remaining seats after the administrators have occupied their seats.

Remaining seats = Total number of seats - Number of seats occupied by administrators
Remaining seats = 72 - 18
Remaining seats = 54

Next, we find the number of seats occupied by the parents. 

Number of seats occupied by parents = (1/3) * Remaining seats
Number of seats occupied by parents = (1/3) * 54
Number of seats occupied by parents = 18

Now, we find the number of seats occupied by the students. 

Number of seats occupied by students = Remaining seats - Number of seats occupied by parents
Number of seats occupied by students = 54 - 18
Number of seats occupied by students = 36

The final answer is: 36"
"To find the total number of functioning street lights, we first need to calculate the total number of street lights at all intersections. 

Each intersection has 6 poles, and each pole has 4 street lights. So, the total number of street lights at each intersection is 6 * 4 = 24.

Since there are 4 intersections, the total number of street lights is 24 * 4 = 96.

However, 20 street lights are not functioning. To find the total number of functioning street lights, we subtract the non-functioning lights from the total: 96 - 20 = 76.

The final answer is: 76"
"To find the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break, we need to add the number of times each DVD has already been played to the number of times each can be played before breaking, and then sum those two totals.

DVD 1 has been played 356 times and can be played 1000 times before breaking, so it can be played 1000 - 356 = 644 more times.

DVD 2 has been played 135 times and can be played 1000 times before breaking, so it can be played 1000 - 135 = 865 more times.

The total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break is 644 + 865 = 1509.

The final answer is: 1509"

John attended physical therapy for 6 weeks, and each week he went twice for 2 hours at a time. So, the total number of hours he attended physical therapy is:

6 weeks * 2 sessions per week * 2 hours per session = 24 hours

The cost per hour is $125. Therefore, the total cost of the physical therapy is:

24 hours * $125 per hour = $3000

The final answer is: $3000"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he will chew 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

2. He chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 stick after dinner, so that's 2 more pieces.

3. So far, Jim has chewed 4 + 2 = 6 pieces of gum.

4. He started with 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

5. He gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. Half of 14 is 14 / 2 = 7.

6. After giving his sister 7 pieces, Jim has 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum left.

"To find out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach, we need to calculate the total amount spent by each coach and then find the difference.

The baseball coach bought 9 new baseballs for $3 each, so the total amount spent by the baseball coach is:
9 * $3 = $27

The basketball coach bought 8 new basketballs for $14 each, so the total amount spent by the basketball coach is:
8 * $14 = $112

Now, let's find the difference in the amount spent by the two coaches:
$112 - $27 = $85

The final answer is: $85"
"To find the total number of flowers that have bloomed, we first need to calculate the total number of flowers in the garden. Since there are 10 rows with 20 flowers in each row, the total number of flowers is:

10 rows * 20 flowers/row = 200 flowers

Since only 4/5 of the flowers have bloomed, we can find the number of bloomed flowers by multiplying the total number of flowers by 4/5:

200 flowers * (4/5) = 200 * 4 / 5 = 160 flowers

Therefore, 160 flowers in Arianna's garden have bloomed.

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to first convert her speed from kb/s to Mb/s and then multiply it by the number of seconds in an hour.

1 Mb = 1000 kb
Ashley's speed in kb/s = 20 kb/s

To convert kb/s to Mb/s, we divide by 1000:
Ashley's speed in Mb/s = 20 kb/s / 1000 = 0.02 Mb/s

There are 3600 seconds in an hour. To find Ashley's speed in Mb/h, we multiply her speed in Mb/s by the number of seconds in an hour:
Ashley's speed in Mb/h = 0.02 Mb/s * 3600 s/h = 72 Mb/h

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of cars towed on the first three days and the remaining days separately, and then add them together.

The tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days, so the total number of cars towed on these days is:
10 * 3 = 30

For the remaining days, the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars than the first three days, so it pulled 10 - 4 = 6 cars per day. There are 4 remaining days in the week (since 7 - 3 = 4), so the total number of cars towed on these days is:
6 * 4 = 24

Now, we add the total number of cars towed on the first three days and the remaining days:
30 + 24 = 54

The final answer is: 54"
"To find out how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to calculate the difference between the required height (4 feet) and Adam's current height (40 inches), and then divide that by his annual growth rate (2 inches).

First, let's convert the required height from feet to inches: 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches.

Now, let's calculate the difference between the required height and Adam's current height: 48 inches - 40 inches = 8 inches.

Next, we'll divide the difference by Adam's annual growth rate: 8 inches / 2 inches/year = 4 years.

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find James' earnings, we first need to calculate the profit made on each car. 

The cost price of each car is $25,000. The company paid 30% of this price to acquire the cars, so the cost price for James is 70% of $25,000, which is 0.7 * $25,000 = $17,500.

The selling price of each car is $25,000. The profit made on each car is the selling price minus the cost price, which is $25,000 - $17,500 = $7,500.

James gets a 10% commission on the profit, so his commission on each car is 0.1 * $7,500 = $750.

Since James sold 10 cars, his total commission is 10 * $750 = $7,500.

Therefore, James made $7,500."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that 25% of the 100 riders can stay upright on the wave. This means 0.25 * 100 = 25 riders can stay upright.

Next, we are told that 60% of these 25 riders are women. To find the number of women, we multiply 25 by 0.6, which gives us 15 women.

Since the remaining riders who can stay upright are men, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright. This gives us 25 - 15 = 10 men.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total price for all three jewels, we first need to determine the prices of the gold and silver jewels.

Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, we know that the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of a diamond jewel. 

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * Price of diamond jewel
Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * $2000
Price of gold jewel = $1600

The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold. 

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
Price of silver jewel = $1600 - $400
Price of silver jewel = $1200

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels.

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
Total price = $2000 + $1600 + $1200
Total price = $4800

The final answer is: $4800"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of truck and rose stamps Max bought. 

Let's denote the number of snowflake stamps as S, the number of truck stamps as T, and the number of rose stamps as R. We are given that S = 16.

We are also given that Max bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so T = S + 3 = 16 + 3 = 19.

We are also given that Max bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so R = T - 9 = 19 - 9 = 10.

Now, we can find the total number of stamps Max bought by adding the number of snowflake, truck, and rose stamps: Total = S + T + R = 16 + 19 + 10 = 45.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the relative speed between Bob and Tom, and then calculate the time it takes for Tom to close the gap.

Since Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour and Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour, the relative speed between them is the difference in their speeds, which is 70 - 55 = 15 miles per hour.

The initial distance between them is 75 miles. To find the time it takes for Tom to catch up, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Relative Speed

Plugging in the values, we get:

Time = 75 miles / 15 miles per hour

Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob. 

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of fish Darren caught. Since Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish, we can calculate Darren's catch as follows:

Darren's catch = Naomi's catch - 6
Darren's catch = 17 - 6
Darren's catch = 11

Now that we know Darren caught 11 fish, we can calculate Tommy's catch. Since Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, we can calculate Tommy's catch as follows:

Tommy's catch = Darren's catch + 3
Tommy's catch = 11 + 3
Tommy's catch = 14

"To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of classes Manny can miss before the average cost per class exceeds $10. 

Let's denote the number of classes Manny can miss as 'x'. Since there are 10 total classes, the number of classes he will attend is 10 - x.

The total cost of the classes is $60, which is the same regardless of the number of classes he attends. 

The average cost per class is the total cost divided by the number of classes attended. We want to find the maximum value of x such that the average cost per class is less than or equal to $10.

We can set up the inequality:

(60) / (10 - x) ≤ 10

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by (10 - x):

60 ≤ 10(10 - x)

Expanding the right-hand side:

60 ≤ 100 - 10x

Subtracting 60 from both sides:

0 ≤ 40 - 10x

Subtracting 40 from both sides:

-40 ≤ -10x

Dividing both sides by -10 (remembering to flip the inequality sign):

4 ≥ x

Since x represents the number of classes Manny can miss, it must be an integer. Therefore, the maximum number of classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again is 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we first need to determine their individual daily production and then multiply it by 7 (the number of days in a week).

Jewel processes 50 customers per day. Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, Julie's daily production is 2 * 50 = 100 customers.

The total daily production for both Julie and Jewel is 50 + 100 = 150 customers.

To find the total weekly production, we multiply the daily production by 7: 150 * 7 = 1050.

The final answer is: 1050"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote the distance Lynn ran as 'x'. 

Since Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, Reggie's distance can be expressed as x + 3.

We are also given that Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran. Paisley ran 4 miles, so Reggie's distance can also be expressed as 5 * 4 = 20 miles.

Now we have two expressions for Reggie's distance: x + 3 and 20. Since these two expressions represent the same distance, we can set them equal to each other:

x + 3 = 20

To find the value of x, we need to isolate it. We can do this by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:

x = 20 - 3
x = 17

So, Lynn ran 17 miles.

"To find the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges, we first need to determine the cost of one apple and one orange. 

The cost of 4 apples is $5.20, so the cost of one apple is $5.20 / 4 = $1.30. 

The cost of 3 oranges is $3.30, so the cost of one orange is $3.30 / 3 = $1.10.

Now, we can find the total cost of 5 apples: 5 apples * $1.30/apple = $6.50.

Next, we can find the total cost of 5 oranges: 5 oranges * $1.10/orange = $5.50.

Finally, we can find the total cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges by adding the cost of the apples and the cost of the oranges: $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To find the volume of the hole, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth. 

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Since it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we can multiply the volume by the time it takes to shovel one cubic foot.

Time = Volume * time per cubic foot
Time = 72 * 3
Time = 216 seconds

Therefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add them to the base price.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade costs $7,500.

The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of the leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of the running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the features and the base price:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

"To find the total amount Tim will make in a year, we need to calculate his new monthly salary and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's calculate the 5% raise on his monthly salary:
5% of $20,000 = 0.05 * $20,000 = $1,000
New monthly salary = $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000

Next, let's calculate the bonus, which is half a month's salary:
Bonus = 0.5 * $21,000 = $10,500

Now, let's calculate the total monthly income:
Total monthly income = New monthly salary + Bonus = $21,000 + $10,500 = $31,500

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil. Bill can dig 4 feet/hour through soil, and he needs to dig 24 feet of soil. 

Time to dig through soil = Total soil depth / Rate of digging through soil
Time to dig through soil = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour
Time to dig through soil = 6 hours

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the clay. Bill can dig half as fast through clay as he can through soil, so his rate of digging through clay is 4 / 2 = 2 feet/hour. He needs to dig 8 feet of clay.

Time to dig through clay = Total clay depth / Rate of digging through clay
Time to dig through clay = 8 feet / 2 feet/hour
Time to dig through clay = 4 hours

Now, we add the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay to get the total time.

Total time = Time to dig through soil + Time to dig through clay
Total time = 6 hours + 4 hours
Total time = 10 hours

"To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost of the pomegranates on each day and then subtract the two amounts.

On the first day, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, but she got a $2 discount. The total cost without the discount is 20 * $20 = $400. After the discount, she paid $400 - $2 = $398.

On the second day, the price of each pomegranate increased to $30, and a 10% discount was offered on the total cost. The total cost without the discount is 20 * $30 = $600. The discount amount is 10% of $600, which is 0.1 * $600 = $60. Therefore, the final cost after the discount is $600 - $60 = $540.

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is $540 - $398 = $142.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find the total sales from green hats in the first month. Since the sales from red hats were half the total amount she earned from selling green hats, let's denote the total sales from green hats as G. Then, the sales from red hats, which is half of G, is G/2. We are given that G/2 = $400. 

To find G, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2, which gives us G = 2 * 400 = $800.

Now, we know that the total sales in the first month is the sum of the sales from red and green hats, which is G + G/2. Substituting the value of G, we get 800 + 400 = $1200.

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. So, the sales in the second month is 3/4 * 1200 = $900.

The total amount she made in two months is the sum of the sales in the first and second months, which is 1200 + 900 = $2100.

"To find out how many dollars were withheld from Sally's wage, we need to determine the total amount she should have received and subtract the actual amount she received.

First, let's calculate the total amount Sally should have received. Since her weekly wage is $300, and she worked for the entire week, she should have received $300.

However, we know that her bank account now holds $420, which is $220 more than the initial $200. This means that the $220 difference is the amount she received from her wage.

To find out how much was withheld, we need to subtract the amount she received from her total wage. 

Amount withheld = Total wage - Amount received
Amount withheld = $300 - $220
Amount withheld = $80

"To determine the number of eggs Lori needs, we first need to calculate the total number of deviled egg halves she needs to serve. Since each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves, and she is inviting 16 guests, the total number of deviled egg halves needed is 16 * 3 = 48.

Since Lori needs 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves, we need to find out how many deviled egg halves 1 egg can make. This is 2 deviled egg halves per egg. 

Now, we can calculate the total number of eggs needed by dividing the total number of deviled egg halves needed by the number of deviled egg halves per egg. This is 48 / 2 = 24 eggs.

To convert the number of eggs into dozens, we divide by 12 since 1 dozen is equal to 12. So, 24 eggs / 12 = 2 dozens.

First, let's calculate the total number of days it will take Mike to read the book. 

Total pages in the book = 200 pages
Pages read per day = 10 pages

Total days to read the book = Total pages in the book / Pages read per day
Total days to read the book = 200 / 10
Total days to read the book = 20 days

Since Mike has 30 days to complete the assignment, we need to find out how many days before the deadline he will finish his reading.

Days before the deadline = Total days given - Total days to read the book
Days before the deadline = 30 - 20
Days before the deadline = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total cost of owning and maintaining the plane for the first year, we need to calculate the cost of the plane, the hanger rental, and the fuel expenses.

The cost of the plane is $150,000.

The hanger rental is $5000 per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total hanger rental cost for the first year is:
$5000 * 12 = $60,000

The fuel expenses are twice the hanger rental, which is $5000 * 2 = $10,000 per month. The total fuel expenses for the first year are:
$10,000 * 12 = $120,000

The total cost of owning and maintaining the plane for the first year is the sum of the cost of the plane, the hanger rental, and the fuel expenses:
$150,000 + $60,000 + $120,000 = $230,000

The final numerical answer is: $230,000"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the cooking time for pork and beans. 

Let's denote the cooking time for rice as R, pork as P, and beans as B. We are given that R = 30 minutes.

We are also given that P = R + 20, which means P = 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

We are given that B = (P + R) / 2, which means B = (50 + 30) / 2 = 40 minutes.

Now, we need to find the total cooking time, which is the sum of the cooking times for rice, pork, and beans. 

Total cooking time = R + P + B = 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: 120"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture and then find the difference between them.

For the first mixture, we have 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts. The cost of almonds is $10 per pound, and the cost of walnuts is $15 per pound. 

The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is (1/2) * $10 = $5.
The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is (1/3) * $15 = $5.

The total cost of the first mixture is $5 + $5 = $10.

For the second mixture, we have 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.

The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is (1/5) * $10 = $2.
The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is (1/3) * $15 = $5.

The total cost of the second mixture is $2 + $5 = $7.

Now, we need to find the difference between the costs of the two mixtures. The difference is $10 - $7 = $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of sheep as S and the number of geese as G.

Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, the total number of legs can be represented as:
4S + 2G = 70

We also know that the total number of animal heads is 20, which means the sum of the number of sheep and geese is 20:
S + G = 20

We can solve this system of equations by substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution. From the second equation, we can express G as G = 20 - S. Substituting this into the first equation, we get:
4S + 2(20 - S) = 70
Expanding the equation, we get:
4S + 40 - 2S = 70
Combine like terms:
2S + 40 = 70
Subtract 40 from both sides:
2S = 30
Divide both sides by 2:
S = 15

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee and the cost of the donut. 

First, let's find the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more. 

20% of $5 is 0.2 * $5 = $1. 
So, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

Since Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day and he buys a week's worth, he buys 7 pounds of coffee. 

The cost of the more expensive coffee is 7 * $6 = $42. 
The cost of the donut is $2.

The total cost is $42 + $2 = $44.

The final answer is: $44"
"To find the cost of the apple pie, we need to subtract the total cost of the items Gus bought from the total amount he spent. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Gus bought:

2 bags of chips at $2.00 each = 2 x $2.00 = $4.00
Adding the cost of the bucket of fried chicken: $4.00 + $8.00 = $12.00
Adding the cost of the bottle of soda: $12.00 + $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's subtract the total cost of the items from the total amount Gus spent:

Total amount spent = $20.00
Total cost of items = $13.00
Cost of apple pie = Total amount spent - Total cost of items = $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

The cost of the apple pie is $7.00.

Total newspapers delivered = 600
Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers delivered - (Newspapers delivered to District A + Newspapers delivered to District C)
= 600 - (198 + 209)
= 600 - 407
= 193

"To find the total number of hours John spends in the cooking class, we need to multiply the number of hours per class by the number of classes per week and then by the number of weeks.

Number of hours per class: 2 hours
Number of classes per week: 4
Number of weeks: 6

Total hours per week: 2 hours/class * 4 classes/week = 8 hours/week
Total hours for 6 weeks: 8 hours/week * 6 weeks = 48 hours

Since John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time, we need to divide the total hours by 1.5 to find the number of recipes he learns.

Number of recipes = Total hours / 1.5 hours/recipe
= 48 hours / 1.5 hours/recipe

"To find the number of math teachers, we first need to find the number of history teachers and then subtract that from the total number of teachers. 

60% of 150 teachers are history teachers. To find 60% of 150, we multiply 150 by 0.6. 

150 * 0.6 = 90

So, there are 90 history teachers. To find the number of math teachers, we subtract the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers.

150 - 90 = 60

There are 60 math teachers. 

Each math teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. To find the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day, we multiply the number of math teachers by the number of hours they sleep per day.

60 * 6 = 360

"To solve this problem, we need to find the amount of money Kassidy and Rayna have. 

First, we know Aurelia has $120. Since Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, we can calculate Kassidy's amount as follows:
Kassidy's money = (3/4) * Aurelia's money
Kassidy's money = (3/4) * 120
Kassidy's money = 90

Now, we know Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy. So, we can calculate Rayna's amount as follows:
Rayna's money = Kassidy's money + 60
Rayna's money = 90 + 60
Rayna's money = 150

Now that we have the amounts for all three, we can find the total amount of money they have together:
Total money = Aurelia's money + Kassidy's money + Rayna's money
Total money = 120 + 90 + 150
Total money = 360

To find out how much each would have if they decided to add together their money and share equally among them, we need to divide the total money by 3:
Amount each would have = Total money / 3
Amount each would have = 360 / 3
Amount each would have = 120

"To find the total duration of the game, we need to calculate the duration of the regular four quarters and then add the additional five minutes.

Each quarter is 12 minutes long, and there are four quarters. So, the total duration of the regular four quarters is 4 * 12 = 48 minutes.

Since the game was extended for five minutes, we need to add this to the total duration of the regular four quarters. 

48 minutes (regular four quarters) + 5 minutes (extension) = 53 minutes.

The entire game lasted 53 minutes."

Number of management employees = 0.20 * 50 = 10

Next, we find the number of management employees who oversee the entire company: 
30% of the management employees oversee the entire company. 
30% = 0.30
Number of employees who oversee the company = 0.30 * 10 = 3

"To find the total amount of dry ingredients needed, we need to calculate the total amount of flour, sugar, and salt required for 16 muffins.

For flour, Svetlana needs 5 tablespoons per muffin, so for 16 muffins, she needs 5 * 16 = 80 tablespoons of flour.

For sugar, Svetlana needs 3 tablespoons per muffin, so for 16 muffins, she needs 3 * 16 = 48 tablespoons of sugar.

For salt, Svetlana needs 0.25 tablespoons per muffin, so for 16 muffins, she needs 0.25 * 16 = 4 tablespoons of salt.

Now, we add up the total amount of dry ingredients: 80 (flour) + 48 (sugar) + 4 (salt) = 132 tablespoons.

The total amount of dry ingredients Svetlana needs to make 16 muffins is 132.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Christina recorded her mood for 30 days. Out of these 30 days, 12 were good, 8 were bad, and the rest (30 - 12 - 8 = 10) were neutral.

The first 8 days were good, the next 8 days were bad, and the next 8 days were neutral. This accounts for 8 + 8 + 8 = 24 days.

Now, we are given that the next 3 days were good, neutral, and good. This means that out of the 6 remaining days (30 - 24 = 6), 2 are good (the last two days mentioned) and 1 is neutral (the middle day mentioned).

We already know that there were 12 good days initially, and 2 more good days were added in the last 3 days. So, the total number of good days is 12 + 2 = 14.

However, we are asked to find out how many good days were left in the month. Since we have already accounted for 14 good days, and there are only 6 days left in the month, we need to find out how many of these 6 days are good.

We know that 2 of the 6 days are good (the last two days mentioned), so the number of good days left in the month is 2.

"To find out how many books Sally has, we need to work backwards from the information given about Janey. We know that Janey has 21 books and that this is 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has.

Let's represent the number of books Sally has as 'x'. According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has, so we can write an equation:

Janey's books = 2 * Sally's books + 3
21 = 2x + 3

Now, we need to solve for 'x'. To do this, we'll subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

21 - 3 = 2x + 3 - 3
18 = 2x

Next, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 2 to isolate 'x':

18 / 2 = 2x / 2
9 = x

So, Sally has 9 books.

"To solve this problem, we need to convert the initial height of the bamboo from feet to inches, as the growth rate is given in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so the initial height of 20 feet is equal to 20 * 12 = 240 inches.

Now, we can use the formula for linear growth: 

Final height = Initial height + (growth rate * time)

We want to find the time it takes for the bamboo to reach 600 inches. Rearranging the formula to solve for time, we get:

Time = (Final height - Initial height) / growth rate

Plugging in the values, we get:

Time = (600 - 240) / 30
Time = 360 / 30
Time = 12

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to reach a height of 600 inches.

The final answer is: 12"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs. This means each dog has 1 toy. When 8 more dogs arrive, James needs 8 more toys to bring the total number of toys to 12 (4 initial toys + 8 new toys).

However, when James comes back, he finds that there are twice as many more dogs than when he left. This means there are now 8 * 2 = 16 dogs in the shelter. Since each dog needs a toy, James needs 16 more toys to bring the total number of toys to 28 (12 initial toys + 16 new toys).

When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs 3 toys. This means he needs to subtract 3 toys from the total of 28. 

So, the total number of toys James needs is 28 - 3 = 25.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of signatures the sisters currently have, and then calculate how many more they need to reach their goal.

The total number of signatures the sisters currently have is the sum of Carol's and Jennifer's signatures: 20 + 44 = 64.

Since they want to reach a total of 100 signatures by the end of the summer, we need to subtract the number of signatures they already have from their goal: 100 - 64 = 36.

However, they have three more weeks of summer vacation, and they have already spent five weeks collecting signatures. Since they want to reach their goal by the end of the summer, we need to consider the remaining time they have to collect signatures. 

Since they have three more weeks, and there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we can assume they have about 3/4 of a month left. However, this information is not necessary to solve the problem, as we are only interested in the total number of signatures they need to collect.

Therefore, the sisters need to collect 36 signatures to reach their goal."
"To find out how much Karen earns in two days, we first need to determine her hourly wage. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen's hourly wage is 2 * $10 = $20 per hour.

Next, we need to calculate how many hours Karen works in two days. Since she works 3 hours per day, in two days she works 2 * 3 = 6 hours.

Now, we can find out how much Karen earns in two days by multiplying her hourly wage by the number of hours she works: $20 * 6 = $120.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the ratio of potatoes to hash browns. We know that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns. 

First, let's find the ratio of potatoes to hash browns: 6 potatoes / 36 hash browns. 

To simplify this ratio, we can divide both numbers by their greatest common divisor, which is 6. 

6 / 6 = 1
36 / 6 = 6

So, the simplified ratio is 1 potato to 6 hash browns.

Now, we can use this ratio to find out how many hash browns we can make with 96 potatoes. 

We multiply the number of potatoes by the ratio of hash browns per potato: 96 potatoes * 6 hash browns/potato.

96 * 6 = 576

Therefore, we can make 576 hash browns out of 96 potatoes.

Total weight = average weight of an adult * number of adults
Total weight = 80 kg * 9
Total weight = 720 kg

Since the elevator supports a maximum load of 700 kg, we need to find the excess weight by subtracting the maximum load from the total weight.

Excess weight = Total weight - maximum load
Excess weight = 720 kg - 700 kg
Excess weight = 20 kg

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of cookies Max and Summer have. 

Since Katarina has 68 cookies and she has 5 less than Max, we can find Max's cookies by adding 5 to Katarina's cookies: 
Max's cookies = Katarina's cookies + 5
Max's cookies = 68 + 5
Max's cookies = 73

We know Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, but we don't know how many cookies the Cookie Monster has. However, we can express the Cookie Monster's cookies in terms of Max's cookies:
Cookie Monster's cookies = Max's cookies - 12
Cookie Monster's cookies = 73 - 12
Cookie Monster's cookies = 61

Now, we know Summer has 23 more cookies than Max:
Summer's cookies = Max's cookies + 23
Summer's cookies = 73 + 23
Summer's cookies = 96

Now that we have the number of cookies each person has, we can find the total number of cookies:
Total cookies = Katarina's cookies + Max's cookies + Cookie Monster's cookies + Summer's cookies
Total cookies = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96
Total cookies = 298

"To find the original length of the dress, we need to consider the two changes made to the dress: the extension by 50% and the addition of 20cm.

Let's denote the original length of the dress as 'x'. When Shania extends the dress by 50%, the new length becomes x + 0.5x = 1.5x.

Then, she adds 20cm to the bottom of the dress, making the final length 1.5x + 20.

We are given that the final design is 140cm long, so we can set up the equation:

1.5x + 20 = 140

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. First, subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

1.5x = 140 - 20
1.5x = 120

Next, divide both sides by 1.5:

x = 120 / 1.5
x = 80

The original length of the dress was 80cm.

"Let's denote the age of the younger twin as T, the age of the older twin as T+7, and the age of the triplet as t. We are given that there is one set of twins and one set of triplets, so we have two equations based on the information provided:

1. T + (T+7) + t = 44 (combined ages of the twins and the triplet)
2. Since there is one set of twins, T = T+7 is not possible, so we assume that T is the younger twin and T+7 is the older twin.

We can simplify the first equation by combining like terms:

2T + t = 44

We also know that there are two sets of siblings, so the total number of children is 2 + 3 = 5. However, we are not given any information about the ages of the children, so we cannot use this information to solve the problem.

However, we can use the fact that the older twin is 7 years older than the triplet. Let's denote the age of the triplet as t. Then, the age of the older twin is t+7. We can substitute this into the first equation:

T + (t+7) + t = 44

Combine like terms:

T + 2t + 7 = 44

Subtract 7 from both sides:

T + 2t = 37

We are given that there is one set of twins, so we can assume that T is the younger twin and T+7 is the older twin. We can substitute T+7 for the older twin in the equation:

T + 2t = 37

Subtract T from both sides:

2t = 37 - T

Substitute t = (37 - T)/2 into the equation T + (t+7) + t = 44:

T + ((37 - T)/2 + 7) + (37 - T)/2 = 44

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2T + (37 - T) + 14 + 37 - T = 88

Combine like terms:

2T + 88 - 2T + 14 = 88

Subtract 88 from both sides:

14 = 0

This is a contradiction, which means that our assumption that T is the younger twin and T+7 is the older twin is incorrect. Let's try the other possibility: T+7 is the younger twin and T is the older twin.

We can substitute T+7 for the younger twin in the equation T + (t+7) + t = 44:

(T+7) + (T + 7) + t = 44

Combine like terms:

2T + 14 + t = 44

Subtract 14 from both sides:

2T + t = 30

We are given that there is one set of twins, so we can assume that T is the older twin and T+7 is the younger twin. We can substitute T+7 for the younger twin in the equation 2T + t = 30:

2T + (T-7) = 30

Combine like terms:

3T - 7 = 30

Add 7 to both sides:

3T = 37

Divide both sides by 3:

T = 37/3

T is not an integer, which means that our assumption that T is the older twin and T+7 is the younger twin is incorrect. Let's try the other possibility: T is the younger twin and T+7 is the older twin.

We can substitute T for the younger twin in the equation 2T + t = 30:

2(T+7) + t = 30

Expand the equation:

2T + 14 + t = 30

Subtract 14 from both sides:

2T + t = 16

We are given that there is one set of twins, so we can assume that T is the younger twin and T+7 is the older twin. We can substitute T+7 for the older twin in the equation 2T + t = 16:

2(T+7) + t = 16

Expand the equation:

2T + 14 + t = 16

Subtract 14 from both sides:

2T + t = 2

Subtract 2T from both sides:

t = 2 - 2T

Substitute t = 2 - 2T into the equation T + (t+7) + t = 44:

T + ((2 - 2T) + 7) + (2 - 2T) = 44

Expand the equation:

T + 9 - 2T + 2 - 2T = 44

Combine like terms:

-3T + 11 = 44

Subtract 11 from both sides:

-3T = 33

Divide both sides by -3:

T = -11

T is not a valid age, which means that our assumption that T is the younger twin and T+7 is the older twin is incorrect. Let's try the other possibility: T+7 is the younger twin and T is the older twin.

We can substitute T+7 for the younger twin in the equation 2T + t = 16:

2(T+7) + t = 16

Expand the equation:

2T + 14 + t = 16

Subtract 14 from both sides:

2T + t = 2

Subtract 2T from both sides:

t = 2 - 2T

Substitute t = 2 - 2T into the equation T + (t+7) + t = 44:

(T+7) + ((2 - 2T) + 7) + (2 - 2T) = 44

Expand the equation:

T + 14 - 2T + 9 + 2 - 2T = 44

Combine like terms:

-3T + 25 = 44

Subtract 25 from both sides:

-3T = 19

"To determine how many minutes John has to nap, we first need to calculate the total time he spends on his homework. 

John has 20 minutes of math homework, 40 minutes of reading homework, and 20 minutes of history homework. 

Total homework time = 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes

John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 3 hours to minutes by multiplying 3 by 60.

3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Now, we subtract the total homework time from the total available time to find out how many minutes John has to nap.

Time available for nap = Total available time - Total homework time
= 180 minutes - 80 minutes
= 100 minutes

Therefore, John has 100 minutes to nap. 

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we first need to determine the cost of one candy. Since Manolo bought 5 lollipops and 4 candies for $3.20, and each lollipop costs $0.40, we can calculate the total cost of the lollipops as 5 * $0.40 = $2.00. 

The remaining cost is the cost of the candies, which is $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20. Since there are 4 candies, the cost of one candy is $1.20 / 4 = $0.30.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of 10 lollipops as 10 * $0.40 = $4.00. The total cost of 10 candies is 10 * $0.30 = $3.00.

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00.

The final answer is: $7.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of coins saved by Rong and Neil over 10 years.

Rong saves 20 coins per month. To find the total number of coins saved by Rong in 10 years, we multiply the monthly savings by 12 (months in a year) and then by 10 (years).

Rong's monthly savings: 20 coins
Rong's yearly savings: 20 * 12 = 240 coins
Rong's total savings in 10 years: 240 * 10 = 2400 coins

Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong per month. To find Neil's monthly savings, we multiply Rong's monthly savings by 2/5 and then add it to Rong's monthly savings.

Neil's additional monthly savings: (2/5) * 20 = 8 coins
Neil's monthly savings: 20 + 8 = 28 coins
Neil's yearly savings: 28 * 12 = 336 coins
Neil's total savings in 10 years: 336 * 10 = 3360 coins

Now, we add the total savings of Rong and Neil to find the combined total.

Combined total savings: 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check, and then determine how much John leaves with after paying the vet.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the vaccines: 2 vaccines * $20 each = $40.

Next, we need to find the cost of the heartworm check, which is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill as 'x'. The cost of the heartworm check is 0.6x.

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check: x = $40 + 0.6x.

To find the total bill, we need to solve for x: 
0.4x = $40
x = $40 / 0.4
x = $100

Now that we know the total bill is $100, we can find the cost of the heartworm check: 0.6 * $100 = $60.

The total amount John paid is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check: $40 + $60 = $100.

Since John brought $125 with him, he leaves with: $125 - $100 = $25.

The final answer is: $25"
"To find the price of the crate, we first need to determine the cost of each type of fruit. 

Let's denote the cost of one banana as B. Since one apple costs half as much as a banana, the cost of one apple is B/2. Since oranges cost three times as much as a banana, the cost of one orange is 3B.

Given that one banana costs twice as much as an apple, we can set up the equation: B = 2 * (B/2). This simplifies to B = B, which is true for any value of B. However, we know that B must be twice the cost of an apple, so we can set up the equation: B = 2 * (0.5). This simplifies to B = 1.

Now that we know the cost of a banana (B = 1), we can find the cost of an apple (B/2 = 0.5) and the cost of an orange (3B = 3).

The total cost of the crate is the sum of the cost of 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges. This is equal to (5 * B) + (12 * (B/2)) + (7 * 3B).

Substituting the value of B, we get: (5 * 1) + (12 * 0.5) + (7 * 3) = 5 + 6 + 21 = 32.

"To find the total number of square feet in Brittany's comforter, we need to calculate the total number of squares and multiply it by the area of each square, which is 1 square foot.

The comforter has 14 red squares. 
The number of blue squares is 4 more than the number of red squares, so it is 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.
The number of green squares is 6 more than the number of blue squares, so it is 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.
The number of white squares is 12 fewer than the number of green squares, so it is 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.

Now, we add up the number of squares of each color to find the total number of squares: 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68 squares.

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

The final answer is: 68"
"To find out how many chairs Mia needs, we first need to determine the total number of chairs she has. Since there are 8 high chairs and the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, the number of regular chairs is 8 * 5 = 40.

The total number of chairs Mia currently has is 8 (high chairs) + 40 (regular chairs) = 48.

Since there will be 42 adults and 15 babies attending, we need to account for both adults and babies. Babies will use high chairs, so we need 15 high chairs. Adults will use regular chairs, so we need 42 regular chairs.

The total number of chairs needed is 15 (high chairs for babies) + 42 (regular chairs for adults) = 57.

To find out how many more chairs Mia needs, we subtract the total number of chairs she has from the total number of chairs needed: 57 (total needed) - 48 (total available) = 9.

"To find the number of 8-point bucks, we first need to find the total number of bucks in the field. Since 50% of the deer are bucks, we can calculate this as follows:

Total deer = 50
Percentage of bucks = 50%
Number of bucks = Total deer * Percentage of bucks
= 50 * 0.5
= 25

Next, we need to find the number of 8-point bucks. Since 20% of the bucks are 8-point, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of 8-point bucks = Number of bucks * Percentage of 8-point bucks
= 25 * 0.2
= 5

Therefore, there are 5 8-point bucks in the field.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the total points collected by Adam, Betty, Martha, and Tom, and then subtract this total from the minimum threshold of 400 points.

First, let's find Betty's points. Since Betty collected 30% more points than Adam, we can calculate this as follows:

Betty's points = Adam's points + (30% of Adam's points)
Betty's points = 50 + (0.3 * 50)
Betty's points = 50 + 15
Betty's points = 65

Next, we know that Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so we can calculate Tom's points as follows:

Tom's points = Betty's points - 30
Tom's points = 65 - 30
Tom's points = 35

We also know that Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom, so we can calculate Martha's points as follows:

Martha's points = 3 * Tom's points
Martha's points = 3 * 35
Martha's points = 105

Now, we can find the total points collected by the class:

Total points = Adam's points + Betty's points + Martha's points + Tom's points
Total points = 50 + 65 + 105 + 35
Total points = 255

Finally, we can find the number of points the class is missing to go on the trip by subtracting the total points from the minimum threshold:

Points missing = Minimum threshold - Total points
Points missing = 400 - 255
Points missing = 145

The final answer is: 145"

"To find out how much money Greta has left to spend, we need to calculate the amount she puts into her retirement account and her car payment, and then subtract those amounts from her total paycheck.

First, let's calculate the amount she puts into her retirement account: 50% of $2400.00 is 0.5 x $2400.00 = $1200.00.

Next, let's calculate the amount she uses for her car payment: 20% of $2400.00 is 0.2 x $2400.00 = $480.00.

Now, let's subtract the amounts from her total paycheck: $2400.00 - $1200.00 - $480.00 = $720.00.

Therefore, Greta has $720.00 left to spend.

The final answer is: $720.00"
"To find the number of pairs of pencils in the box, we first need to determine the total number of pencils in the box. Since there are 4 pencils missing, we subtract 4 from the total capacity of the box, which is 20.

Total pencils in the box = 20 - 4 = 16

Now, to find the number of pairs of pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by 2, since a pair consists of 2 pencils.

Number of pairs = Total pencils in the box / 2
= 16 / 2
= 8

"To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we first need to calculate the number of fireworks set off in the city and then find 40% of that number. 

The city is setting off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks set off in the city is 15 * 20 = 300.

40% of 300 is 0.4 * 300 = 120.

Hannah will also set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each in her backyard, which is 3 * 5 = 15 fireworks.

So, the total number of fireworks Hannah will see is 120 (from the city) + 15 (from her backyard) = 135.

"To find the total amount spent on snacks and drinks, we first need to determine the total number of people and the total number of items (drinks and snacks) they buy.

Aiden and his 12 friends make 13 people. When they meet up with 7 more friends, the total number of people becomes 13 + 7 = 20.

Each person buys enough drinks and snacks to fill the seats, which means each person buys 2 drinks and 3 snacks. So, the total number of drinks and snacks bought is 20 * 2 (drinks) + 20 * 3 (snacks) = 40 drinks + 60 snacks = 100 items.

Since each item costs $2, the total amount spent on snacks and drinks is 100 items * $2/item = $200.

The final numerical answer is: $200"
"To solve this problem, we can start by determining the capacity of Gordy's truck. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, and Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds, Gordy's truck can haul 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.

Now, let's denote the capacity of Gary's truck as x. We know that the combined capacity of all three trucks is 11,600 pounds. Therefore, we can write the equation:

4,000 + 4,800 + x = 11,600

Combine the constants on the left-hand side of the equation:

8,800 + x = 11,600

Subtract 8,800 from both sides of the equation to isolate x:

x = 11,600 - 8,800
x = 2,800

So, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.

The final answer is: 2800"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of dumplings each male ate. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, and each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

There are 8 males in the group, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32.

There are 6 females in the group, and each female ate 3 dumplings, so the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.

The total number of dumplings eaten by the group is 32 (males) + 18 (females) = 50.

Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is equal to the total number of dumplings eaten by the group, which is 50.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money Gerald initially received from the $100. 

The ratio of the division is 3:2, which means that for every 3 parts Gerald gets, Julia gets 2 parts. The total number of parts is 3 + 2 = 5. 

To find out how much money each part represents, we divide the total amount of money ($100) by the total number of parts (5). 

$100 / 5 = $20 per part.

Since Gerald's share is 3 parts, we multiply the value of one part ($20) by 3 to find out how much money Gerald initially received.

$20 * 3 = $60.

Gerald spent $10 on a book, so to find out how much money he has left, we subtract the amount he spent from the amount he initially received.

$60 - $10 = $50.

Therefore, Gerald has $50 left.

The final answer is: $50"
"To find the speed of the turtle, we need to divide the speed of the cat by 5, since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle. 

Speed of the cat = 15 feet/second
Speed of the turtle = Speed of the cat / 5
Speed of the turtle = 15 / 5
Speed of the turtle = 3 feet/second

Now, we can find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds by multiplying its speed by the time.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 3 feet/second * 40 seconds
Distance = 120 feet

"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of hours the firefighters need to fundraise to reach their goal. 

First, let's find out how much they need to raise in total after the first 3 hours: $6300 - $2100 = $4200.

Since they raised an equal amount in every hour, we can divide the amount they need to raise by the number of hours they have already worked to find the hourly rate: $2100 / 3 = $700 per hour.

Now, we can divide the total amount they need to raise by the hourly rate to find the total number of hours they need to fundraise: $4200 / $700 = 6.

Since they have already worked for 3 hours, we need to add this to the total number of hours they need to fundraise: 6 + 3 = 9.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the rate at which the factory makes chocolate and vanilla ice cream per hour. 

Let's start with the chocolate ice cream. The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours, so the rate is 100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts per hour.

For the vanilla ice cream, the factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours, so the rate is 50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now, we need to find the total number of quarts made in 48 hours. 

For chocolate ice cream, the total is 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts.
For vanilla ice cream, the total is 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts.

The total number of quarts made in 48 hours is 2400 + 600 = 3000 quarts.

The final answer is: 3000"
"To find Marcus' total bill, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he ordered and then apply the 10% discount.

First, let's calculate the total cost of each item:

- 5 croissants at $3.00 apiece: 5 x $3.00 = $15.00
- 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each: 4 x $2.50 = $10.00
- 3 mini quiches at $4.00 apiece: 3 x $4.00 = $12.00
- 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 apiece: 13 x $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items: $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Since Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him 10% off his purchase, we need to calculate the discount amount: 10% of $50.00 = 0.10 x $50.00 = $5.00

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total cost: $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

The final answer is: $45.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of scoops Erin can buy with her $6.00, considering the deal of buying 2 scoops and getting 1 free.

First, let's calculate the cost of 2 scoops of ice cream: 2 * $1.50 = $3.00. 

Since Erin gets 1 scoop free with every 2 scoops she buys, the effective cost per 3 scoops is $3.00. 

Now, let's divide Erin's total budget by the effective cost per 3 scoops: $6.00 / $3.00 = 2.

This means Erin can buy 2 sets of 3 scoops, which is a total of 6 scoops. 

However, we need to consider the remaining money Erin has after buying 6 scoops. Since 2 sets of 3 scoops cost $6.00, Erin will have no money left after buying 6 scoops.

Therefore, Erin should buy 6 scoops of ice cream.

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of candies eaten by each person in two weeks and then find the difference between their remaining candies.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces.

Initially, both Ginger and Amy had 100 pieces of candy. After two weeks, Ginger has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces left, and Amy has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces left.

The difference in the number of candies Amy has compared to Ginger is 58 - 44 = 14.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find the total number of tiles needed, we first need to calculate the area of two-thirds of the bathroom. 

The area of the entire bathroom is 36 sq ft. To find two-thirds of this area, we multiply 36 by 2/3.

36 * (2/3) = 36 * 2 / 3 = 72 / 3 = 24

So, two-thirds of the bathroom is 24 sq ft. 

Since Mr. Boarden needs 24 tiles per square foot, we multiply the area of two-thirds of the bathroom by 24.

24 * 24 = 576

Therefore, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two-thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom.

"To find out how much James saved, we need to calculate the cost of buying the blueberries at the store and compare it to the cost of picking them.

First, let's calculate the cost of picking the blueberries. The cost to go picking is $20, and the cost per pound is $1.5. Since James picked 30 pounds, the total cost of picking is:

Cost of picking = $20 (initial cost) + ($1.5 * 30 pounds)
Cost of picking = $20 + $45
Cost of picking = $65

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying the blueberries at the store. The cost per pound at the store is $2.5, and James picked 30 pounds, so the total cost at the store is:

Cost at store = $2.5 * 30 pounds
Cost at store = $75

To find out how much James saved, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost at the store:

Savings = Cost at store - Cost of picking
Savings = $75 - $65
Savings = $10

The final answer is: $10"
"To find the total amount of money the company paid for the computers, we first need to determine the new price of each computer. 

The original price of each computer was $700. However, the price increased by 10%. To find the new price, we can calculate 10% of $700 and add it to the original price.

10% of $700 = 0.1 * $700 = $70

New price of each computer = Original price + Increase in price
= $700 + $70
= $770

Now, we can find the total amount of money the company paid for the computers by multiplying the new price of each computer by the number of computers they bought.

Total amount = New price of each computer * Number of computers
= $770 * 500
= $385,000

The final answer is: $385,000"
"To calculate the total calories in the omelet, we need to calculate the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the calories from the eggs: 
There are 6 eggs in the omelet, and each egg is 75 calories. 
So, the total calories from the eggs = 6 * 75 = 450 calories.

Next, let's calculate the calories from the cheese: 
There are 2 oz of cheese in the omelet, and each ounce of cheese is 120 calories. 
So, the total calories from the cheese = 2 * 120 = 240 calories.

Now, let's calculate the calories from the ham: 
There are 2 oz of ham in the omelet, and each ounce of ham is 40 calories. 
So, the total calories from the ham = 2 * 40 = 80 calories.

Now, let's add the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham together to get the total calories in the omelet:
Total calories = 450 (eggs) + 240 (cheese) + 80 (ham) = 770 calories.

The final answer is: 770"

"To find the number of people who accept the position, we need to calculate the number of people at each stage of the process.

First, 30% of 100 people receive interviews. 
30% of 100 = 0.3 * 100 = 30 people receive interviews.

Next, 20% of those who receive interviews receive a job offer. 
20% of 30 = 0.2 * 30 = 6 people receive a job offer.

Finally, a third of those who receive a job offer accept the position. 
A third of 6 = 6 / 3 = 2 people accept the position.

"To find the total amount of rice given to Goldy's cousin and brother, we need to first determine the total number of sacks given away. 

Goldy gave 3 sacks to her cousin and 4 sacks to her brother, so the total number of sacks given away is 3 + 4 = 7 sacks.

Since each sack contains 25 kilograms of rice, we can multiply the total number of sacks given away by the weight of each sack to find the total weight of rice given away.

Total weight of rice given away = 7 sacks * 25 kg/sack = 175 kg

Therefore, Goldy gave 175 kilograms of rice to her cousin and brother.

"To find the difference in the number of boxes of cereal Castle bought this week and last week, we need to first determine the total number of boxes she bought this week and last week.

This week, Castle bought 3 boxes of Coco Crunch and 5 boxes of Fruit Loops. To find the total number of boxes she bought this week, we add the number of boxes of Coco Crunch and Fruit Loops:

3 (Coco Crunch) + 5 (Fruit Loops) = 8 boxes

Last week, Castle bought 4 boxes of cereal.

Now, we can find the difference in the number of boxes of cereal Castle bought this week and last week by subtracting the number of boxes she bought last week from the number of boxes she bought this week:

8 (this week) - 4 (last week) = 4

Total taps in this scenario: 900 + 750 = 1650 taps

Scenario 2: Arms up (2 minutes)
- Right foot: 200 taps/minute * 2 minutes = 400 taps
- Left foot: 200 taps/minute * 2 minutes = 400 taps
Total taps in this scenario: 400 + 400 = 800 taps

Total taps = Total taps in scenario 1 + Total taps in scenario 2

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole and compare it to the potential damage to Ron's car.

The cost of fixing the pothole includes the fine for unauthorized road maintenance and the cost of the asphalt. The fine is $120, and the cost of 3 buckets of asphalt is 3 * $25 = $75. Therefore, the total cost of fixing the pothole is $120 + $75 = $195.

The potential damage to Ron's car is $450. To find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole, we subtract the total cost of fixing the pothole from the potential damage to his car: $450 - $195 = $255.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of slices eaten and subtract it from the total number of slices available.

First, let's find out how many slices Bryce and two friends ate. Since there are 5 people in total, and 3 of them ate 2/3 of their pizzas, we can calculate the total number of slices they ate as follows:

3 people * 2/3 * 12 slices/person = 8 slices/person * 3 people = 24 slices

However, this is the total number of slices eaten by 3 people. Since each person ate 2/3 of their pizza, we need to multiply this by 3 to get the total number of slices eaten by 3 people:

24 slices * 3 = 72 slices

Now, let's find out how many slices the two remaining friends ate. They ate ¾ of their pizzas, which is equivalent to 3/4. Since there are 12 slices in each pizza, we can calculate the number of slices they ate as follows:

2 people * 3/4 * 12 slices/person = 9 slices/person * 2 people = 18 slices

Now, we add the slices eaten by the two groups:

72 slices + 18 slices = 90 slices

Since there are 5 people in total, and each person ordered 1 pizza, the total number of slices available is:

5 people * 12 slices/person = 60 slices

Now, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices available:

60 slices - 90 slices = -30 slices

However, since we cannot have a negative number of slices, this means that there are not enough slices to satisfy the given conditions. This is a classic example of a ""pigeonhole principle"" problem, where the total number of slices eaten exceeds the total number of slices available.

However, if we re-evaluate the problem, we can see that the two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas, which is equivalent to 9 slices each. This means that they ate a total of 18 slices, not 18 slices/person * 2 people = 36 slices. The correct total number of slices eaten is:

72 slices + 18 slices = 90 slices

"To find the average time the cat and dog take to eat the sausages, we first need to determine the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages. 

The cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes. Since the dog eats the same number of sausages in 2/3 the amount of time the cat takes, we can calculate the dog's time as follows:

Dog's time = (2/3) * Cat's time
Dog's time = (2/3) * 30 minutes
Dog's time = 20 minutes

Now, we have the time taken by both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages: 
Cat's time = 30 minutes
Dog's time = 20 minutes

To find the average time, we add the times taken by both the cat and the dog and divide by 2:

Average time = (Cat's time + Dog's time) / 2
Average time = (30 + 20) / 2
Average time = 50 / 2
Average time = 25 minutes

The final answer is: 25"
"To solve this problem, we need to first convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches.

Adding the 4 inches, we get a total of 100 inches for the length of one of Topher's shoes.

Now, we are given that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. We can represent this as an equation:

Length of Topher's shoe = 9 * Length of Bobby's shoe + 10

Substituting the value of the length of Topher's shoe, we get:

100 = 9 * Length of Bobby's shoe + 10

Now, we can solve for the length of Bobby's shoe by subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation:

90 = 9 * Length of Bobby's shoe

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 9 to isolate the length of Bobby's shoe:

Length of Bobby's shoe = 90 / 9
Length of Bobby's shoe = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of windows smashed by Hannah, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed from students' cars and teachers' cars separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of windows smashed from students' cars. There are 64 students' cars with 4 windows each. A quarter of the students' cars' windows are smashed, which is 1/4 * 64 = 16 cars. Since each car has 4 windows, the total number of windows smashed from students' cars is 16 * 4 = 64.

Next, let's find the number of windows smashed from teachers' cars. There are 32 teachers' cars with 2 windows each. Three-fourths of the teachers' cars' windows are smashed, which is 3/4 * 32 = 24 cars. Since each car has 2 windows, the total number of windows smashed from teachers' cars is 24 * 2 = 48.

Now, we add the number of windows smashed from students' cars and teachers' cars to get the total number of windows smashed by Hannah. Total windows smashed = 64 + 48 = 112.

The final answer is: 112"
"To find the percentage of blue spools, we need to first calculate the total number of blue spools and then divide it by the total number of spools, and finally multiply by 100.

Total blue spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60
Total spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 110

Now, let's calculate the percentage of blue spools:
Percentage of blue spools = (Total blue spools / Total spools) * 100
= (60 / 110) * 100
= 0.5454 * 100
= 54.5454%

The final answer is: 54.55"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, 5000 people were in line at 8:00. By midday, 2/5 of them had voted. 

2/5 of 5000 is (2/5) * 5000 = 2000 people who voted by midday.

So, the number of people remaining by midday is 5000 - 2000 = 3000.

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. 

2/3 of 3000 is (2/3) * 3000 = 2000 people who voted by 16:00.

The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is the remaining people minus those who voted by 16:00, which is 3000 - 2000 = 1000.

The final answer is: 1000"
"To determine the number of packs of gum Parker will need, we need to calculate the total number of pieces of gum he will need for 30 days and then divide that by the number of pieces in a pack.

Parker chews 4 pieces of gum per day. To find the total number of pieces he will need for 30 days, we multiply the number of pieces he chews per day by the number of days:

4 pieces/day * 30 days = 120 pieces

Since a pack of gum has 15 pieces, we can divide the total number of pieces Parker needs by the number of pieces in a pack to find the number of packs he will need:

120 pieces / 15 pieces/pack = 8 packs

Therefore, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the number of boxes of graham crackers needed, we first need to calculate the total number of s'mores required. 

9 kids want 2 s'mores each, so the total number of s'mores for kids is 9 * 2 = 18. 
6 adults will eat 1 s'more each, so the total number of s'mores for adults is 6 * 1 = 6. 
The total number of s'mores needed is 18 (for kids) + 6 (for adults) = 24.

Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 large s'mores, we need to divide the total number of s'mores by 8 to find out how many sleeves are needed. 
24 s'mores / 8 s'mores per sleeve = 3 sleeves.

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we need to divide the total number of sleeves needed by 3 to find out how many boxes are required. 
3 sleeves / 3 sleeves per box = 1 box.

Therefore, they will need 1 box of graham crackers.

The final answer is: 1"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the ages of Dora's father and mother. 

Given that Dora is 15 years old, we can find her father's age by using the information that her father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. 

Let's denote Dora's father's age as F and Dora's age as D. We have the equation: F = 2D + 8. 

Substituting D = 15 into the equation, we get F = 2(15) + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38. 

Now that we know Dora's father is 38 years old, we can find her mother's age. We are given that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. 

Let's denote Dora's mother's age as M. We have the equation: M = F - 4. 

Substituting F = 38 into the equation, we get M = 38 - 4 = 34. 

Now that we know Dora's age (15), her father's age (38), and her mother's age (34), we can find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother. 

The total combined age is D + F + M = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87.

The final answer is: 87"
"To find out how much money each of Greg's siblings got, we need to divide the total amount of money ($20) by the number of siblings (3). 

The formula for division is: Total Amount / Number of Siblings = Amount per Sibling

Plugging in the values, we get: $20 / 3 = $6.67

So each of Greg's siblings got $6.67. 

$6.67"
"To find the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying, we need to calculate the weight of each book and then add them together.

Cindy has 3 math and science books, so the total weight of these books is 3 * 2 = 6 pounds.

Her French book weighs 4 pounds and her English book weighs 3 pounds.

Her history book weighs twice as much as her English book, so the weight of the history book is 2 * 3 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of all the books together: 6 (math and science) + 4 (French) + 3 (English) + 6 (history) = 19 pounds.

The total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is 19 pounds.

The final answer is: 19"
"To find the number of votes candidate C received, we first need to determine the number of votes candidate B received. 

Candidate A received 20% of the votes, which is 0.2 * 100 = 20 votes.

Candidate B received 50% more than candidate A's votes, so the number of votes candidate B received is 20 + (50% of 20) = 20 + (0.5 * 20) = 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

Since there are 100 voters in total, the number of votes candidate C received is 100 - (votes received by A + votes received by B) = 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 votes.

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many apples Beck has initially. Since Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, and Boris has 100 apples, we can calculate Beck's initial number of apples as follows:

Beck's initial apples = Boris's apples - 23
Beck's initial apples = 100 - 23
Beck's initial apples = 77

Now, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. So, Beck's new number of apples is:

Beck's new apples = Beck's initial apples + 10
Beck's new apples = 77 + 10
Beck's new apples = 87

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris. Boris still has 100 apples, and Beck has 87 apples. So, the difference is:

Difference = Boris's apples - Beck's new apples
Difference = 100 - 87
Difference = 13

Therefore, Beck has 13 fewer apples than Boris now.

The final answer is: 13"
"To find out how many ounces of water Peter has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and then subtract that from the initial 32 ounces.

For giant cubes: 3 cubes * 4 ounces/cube = 12 ounces
For medium cubes: 7 cubes * 2 ounces/cube = 14 ounces
For small cubes: 8 cubes * 0.5 ounces/cube = 4 ounces

Total water used = 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces

Now, subtract the total water used from the initial 32 ounces to find the remaining water:
32 - 30 = 2 ounces

The final answer is: 2"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of books Steven has. Since Clara has two times as many books as Steven and Clara has 20 books, we can set up the equation:

2x = 20

where x is the number of books Steven has. Solving for x, we get:

x = 20 / 2
x = 10

Now that we know Steven has 10 books, we can find out how many books Alice has. Since Alice has 6 more books than Steven, we can add 6 to the number of books Steven has:

Alice's books = 10 + 6
Alice's books = 16

Now that we know Alice has 16 books and Clara has 20 books, we can find out how many more books Clara has than Alice:

Difference = Clara's books - Alice's books
Difference = 20 - 16
Difference = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the cost of a half-gallon jar. Since a gallon jar costs $5 and it is $2 more than a half-gallon jar, we can set up the following equation:

Gallon jar = Half-gallon jar + $2
5 = Half-gallon jar + 2
Half-gallon jar = 5 - 2
Half-gallon jar = 3

Now that we know the cost of a half-gallon jar, we can find the cost of 16 half-gallon jars:
16 * 3 = 48

Next, we need to find the cost of 10-gallon jars. Since a gallon jar costs $5, we can multiply this by 10:
10 * 5 = 50

Finally, we can add the cost of the half-gallon jars and the gallon jars to find the total amount of money Cecelia spent:
48 + 50 = 98

The final answer is: 98"
"To solve this problem, we can start by identifying the number of students who like to play music. We are given that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number who like to play basketball. Since 5 students like to play basketball, the number of students who like to play music is 2 * 5 = 10.

We know that the total number of students in the class is 50, and 10 like to bake, 5 like to play basketball, and 10 like to play music. To find the number of students who like to play video games, we need to subtract the number of students who like to bake, play basketball, and play music from the total number of students.

Number of students who like to play video games = Total number of students - (Number of students who like to bake + Number of students who like to play basketball + Number of students who like to play music)
= 50 - (10 + 5 + 10)
= 50 - 25
= 25

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, Jeremy saw 12 birds in their backyard. When he threw a stone, he scared away 1/3 of that number. 

1/3 of 12 is calculated as 12 * (1/3) = 4. So, 4 birds were scared away, leaving 12 - 4 = 8 birds.

A few minutes later, 20 more birds joined the fearless birds. So, the total number of birds now is 8 (initial fearless birds) + 20 (new birds) = 28.

The final numerical answer is: 28"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of girls in both classes. Since 40% of the students in each class are girls, and there are 80 students in total, we can set up an equation to represent the situation.

Let x be the number of students in each class. Since there are two classes, the total number of students is 2x. We know that 40% of 2x is the total number of girls in both classes. 

40% of 2x = 0.4 * 2x = 0.8x

Since the total number of students is 80, we can set up the equation:

2x = 80

To find x, we divide both sides by 2:

x = 80 / 2
x = 40

Now that we know there are 40 students in each class, we can find the number of boys in each class. Since 40% of the students are girls, 60% are boys. 

60% of 40 = 0.6 * 40 = 24

So, there are 24 boys in each class.

The final answer is: 24"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Mara added 3 slices to the plate, so now she has 2 + 3 = 5 slices.
2. Mara tripled the number of slices she currently has, so she now has 5 * 3 = 15 slices.
3. Mara ate 2 slices, so she now has 15 - 2 = 13 slices.
4. Her friend stole 5 slices off her plate, so she now has 13 - 5 = 8 slices.

The final number of cake slices remaining on the plate is 8."
"To find out how many animals Melissa will groom each day, we need to calculate the total number of animals and then divide that by the number of days in a week (7).

First, let's calculate the total number of animals:

- Dogs: 8
- Cats: 5
- Birds: 3
- Horses: 12
Total animals = 8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28

Now, let's divide the total number of animals by the number of days in a week:

Total animals / Number of days = 28 / 7 = 4

So, Melissa will groom 4 animals each day of the week.

"To find the profit Mark made, we first need to calculate the total cost of the packs and the total value of the cards he obtained.

The total cost of the packs is 3 packs * $1800 per pack = $5400.

The total value of the cards he obtained is $4000 (1 card) + $1000 (1 card) + (30 cards * $50 per card) = $4000 + $1000 + $1500 = $6500.

The total value of the cards is greater than the cost of the packs, so Mark made a profit. To find the profit, we subtract the cost of the packs from the total value of the cards: $6500 - $5400 = $1100.

The final answer is: $1100"
"To compare the costs of the two amusement parks, we need to calculate the total cost for each park and then find the difference.

For the first amusement park, the total cost is:
2 adults * $26 = $52
2 children * $12 = $24
Total cost for the first amusement park = $52 + $24 = $76

For the second amusement park, the total cost is:
2 adults * $14 = $28
2 children * $10 = $20
Total cost for the second amusement park = $28 + $20 = $48

Now, let's find the difference in cost between the two parks:
Difference in cost = Total cost of the first amusement park - Total cost of the second amusement park
= $76 - $48
= $28

Therefore, Jake's family will be able to save $28 if they choose the second amusement park over the first.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of marbles Carl and Cal have. 

Since Sean has 56 marbles and he has half as many marbles as Cal, we can find the number of marbles Cal has by multiplying Sean's marbles by 2. 

Cal's marbles = 2 * Sean's marbles
Cal's marbles = 2 * 56
Cal's marbles = 112

Now, we know that Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. 

Carl's marbles = 4 * Sean's marbles
Carl's marbles = 4 * 56
Carl's marbles = 224

To find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we add their marbles together.

Total marbles = Carl's marbles + Cal's marbles
Total marbles = 224 + 112
Total marbles = 336

"To find the number of groups needed, we first need to determine the size of each group. Since there are 54 students and they are to be separated into 6 groups of equal size, we can divide the total number of students by the number of groups:

54 students / 6 groups = 9 students per group

However, the problem states that the activity requires 12 groups. To find the total number of students needed for 12 groups, we can multiply the number of groups by the size of each group:

12 groups * 9 students per group = 108 students

Since there are only 54 students, we need to find out how many more students are required to form 12 groups of 9 students each. However, the question asks for the number of groups needed, not the number of students. 

Since we already know that 54 students can be divided into 6 groups of 9 students each, we can find the number of groups needed for 108 students by dividing the total number of students by the size of each group:

108 students / 9 students per group = 12 groups

However, we are asked for the number of groups needed to form, given that 54 students are already separated into 6 groups. Since 54 students are already in 6 groups, we need to find the number of groups needed to accommodate the remaining students. However, the problem does not specify any remaining students. 

Given the information provided, it seems there is a misunderstanding in the question. If we assume that the 54 students are the total number of students and we need to find the number of groups needed, we can divide the total number of students by the size of each group:

"To find the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the number of chairs rented in a week and then multiply it by 8 (2 months * 4 weeks/month).

First, let's calculate the number of chairs rented in a week:

- Weekdays: 5 days * 60 chairs/day = 300 chairs
- Weekends: 2 days * 100 chairs/day = 200 chairs
- Total chairs rented in a week: 300 chairs + 200 chairs = 500 chairs

Now, let's multiply the number of chairs rented in a week by 8:

500 chairs/week * 8 weeks = 4000 chairs

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Initially, Gunther had 48 bananas.

1. Arnold stole half of the bananas from the pile. Half of 48 is 48 / 2 = 24. So, after Arnold's first theft, Gunther had 48 - 24 = 24 bananas left.

2. The next day, Gunther added 25 bananas to his pile. Now, he has 24 + 25 = 49 bananas.

3. Later that evening, Arnold stole 12 bananas from the pile. So, Gunther now has 49 - 12 = 37 bananas.

4. On the third day, Gunther added 6 bananas to his pile. Now, he has 37 + 6 = 43 bananas.

Therefore, when Gunther began counting bananas on the third day, he found 43 bananas in the pile.

The final answer is: 43"
"To find out how much each roommate will pay per year for electricity, we first need to calculate the total annual electricity bill. Since the monthly electricity bill is $100, we multiply this by 12 to get the annual bill.

Annual electricity bill = $100/month * 12 months/year = $1200/year

Next, we divide the total annual bill by the number of roommates to find out each roommate's share.

Each roommate's share = Total annual bill / Number of roommates
= $1200 / 4
= $300

Therefore, each roommate will pay $300 per year for electricity. 

$300"

First, let's calculate the initial number of glasses and plates sent:

- Glasses: 8 dozen = 8 * 12 = 96 glasses
- Plates: 4 dozen = 4 * 12 = 48 plates

Now, let's subtract the number of broken items:

- Broken glasses: 10
- Broken plates: 6

Remaining glasses: 96 - 10 = 86
Remaining plates: 48 - 6 = 42

So, Jeff has 86 glasses and 42 plates now.

The final answer is: 
Glasses: 86
Plates: 42"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, Lorraine has 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

First, she trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers. 
Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons from trading 27 small stickers.

Now, she has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

Next, she trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers. 
Since each large sticker is worth one large button, she gets 20 large buttons from trading 20 large stickers.

Now, she has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

She trades the rest of her large stickers (20) for small buttons. 
Since each large sticker is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons from trading 20 large stickers.

Now, let's calculate the total number of buttons she has:
- Small buttons: 27 (from small stickers) + 60 (from large stickers) = 87 small buttons
- Large buttons: 20 (from large stickers)

Total buttons = 87 (small buttons) + 20 (large buttons) = 107 buttons.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as 'x'. Since the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, the number of votes in favor can be represented as 2x.

We know that the total number of council members is 33, and the sum of votes in favor and against the new regulation must equal 33. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:

3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 11

Since x represents the number of votes against the new regulation, the number of votes in favor is 2x:

2x = 2(11)
= 22

The final answer is: 22"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. 

First, we know that 11 students need size extra-small. 

Next, we are told that twice as many students need size small as extra small. So, the number of students who need size small is 2 * 11 = 22.

Then, we are told that four less than the number of size small students need size medium. So, the number of students who need size medium is 22 - 4 = 18.

After that, we are told that half as many students need size large as size medium. So, the number of students who need size large is 18 / 2 = 9.

Finally, we are told that six more students need size extra-large than large. So, the number of students who need size extra-large is 9 + 6 = 15.

Now, we can add up the number of students who need each size to find the total number of shirts ordered: 11 (extra-small) + 22 (small) + 18 (medium) + 9 (large) + 15 (extra-large) = 75.

"To find the number of people who think horse #12 will win, we first need to find the number of people who think horse #2 will win and the number of people who think horse #7 will win.

20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win. To find 20% of 50, we multiply 50 by 0.2.

50 * 0.2 = 10

So, 10 people think horse #2 will win.

60% of the remaining people think horse #7 will win. The remaining people are 50 - 10 = 40. To find 60% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.6.

40 * 0.6 = 24

So, 24 people think horse #7 will win.

The rest of the people think horse #12 will win. The rest of the people are 50 - 10 - 24 = 16.

Therefore, 16 people think that horse #12 will win.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given. We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. 

Let's denote the total number of Pomeranians as P. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we can set up the equation:

(1/3)P = 6

To solve for P, we can multiply both sides by 3:

P = 6 * 3
P = 18

So, there are 18 Pomeranians. Now, we know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Let's denote the total number of puppies as J. We can set up the equation:

(2/3)J = 18

To solve for J, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

J = 18 * (3/2)
J = 27

Therefore, Jana has 27 puppies. 

The final answer is: 27"
"To find out how much more Jayden needs to buy the camera, we first need to calculate how much money he has after receiving the money from his sister. 

Jayden initially had $70. His sister gave him half of her $90 allowance, which is $45. 

So, Jayden now has $70 + $45 = $115.

The camera costs $200. To find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the amount he has from the cost of the camera: $200 - $115 = $85.

Therefore, Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera.

The final answer is: $85"
"To solve this problem, we can start by assigning variables to the number of cases of shingles each house needs. Let's call the number of cases for the second house ""x"". Since the first house needs 1/2 of the second house, the first house needs x/2 cases. The third house needs double the first house, so it needs 2 * (x/2) = x cases.

We know that the total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. We can write an equation to represent this:

x/2 + x + x = 250

Combine like terms:

(1/2)x + x + x = 250
(5/2)x = 250

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

5x = 500

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 100

Now that we know the second house needs 100 cases, we can find the number of cases the third house needs, which is x = 100.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the total amount spent by Leila, Jack, and Chase, we need to calculate the individual costs and then sum them up.

Leila buys 3 cucumbers at $2 each, so her total cost is 3 * $2 = $6.

Jack buys 5 tomatoes at $1 each, so his total cost is 5 * $1 = $5.

Chase buys 1 head of lettuce at $3, so his total cost is $3.

Now, let's add up their individual costs to find the total amount spent: $6 (Leila) + $5 (Jack) + $3 (Chase) = $14.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of pears George has. Since George has 45% more pears than bananas, we can calculate the number of pears as follows:

Let's assume the number of bananas is x. Then, the number of pears is x + 45% of x.

We are given that the number of bananas is 200. So, x = 200.

Now, we can calculate the number of pears:
Number of pears = x + 45% of x
= 200 + 0.45 * 200
= 200 + 90
= 290

Now, we need to find the total number of fruits George has. This is the sum of the number of bananas and the number of pears:
Total number of fruits = Number of bananas + Number of pears
= 200 + 290
= 490

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total amount of oranges required to make 4 liters of juice. Since Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges to make 1 liter of juice, we can multiply this by 4 to find the total amount of oranges needed for 4 liters.

Total oranges needed = 5 kg/liter * 4 liters = 20 kg

Next, we need to find the total cost of the oranges. Each kilogram of oranges costs $3, so we can multiply the total amount of oranges needed by the cost per kilogram.

Total cost = 20 kg * $3/kg = $60

Therefore, Sam would have to spend $60 to make 4 liters of juice.

The final answer is: $60"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many books Ahmed read in one hour. Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship.

Let's denote the number of books Ahmed read as 'x'. Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, Ezra read 2x books. We are given that Ezra read 300 books, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 300

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 300 / 2
x = 150

So, Ahmed read 150 books in one hour. 

Now, we need to find the total number of books they read altogether. Ezra read 300 books and decided to read 150 more, so Ezra's total is 300 + 150 = 450 books. Ahmed read 150 books. Therefore, the total number of books they read altogether is 450 + 150 = 600.

The final answer is: 600"
"To calculate Tanya's earnings, we need to break down her earnings into two parts: her hourly earnings and her daily bonus.

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Since she earns $15 per hour, her total hourly earnings for Monday are 5 hours * $15/hour = $75. 

Additionally, she earns a daily bonus of $5 for teaching more than 3 classes. Since she teaches 4 classes on Monday, she earns the daily bonus, which is $5.

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Her total hourly earnings for Wednesday are 2 hours * $15/hour = $30.

Since she teaches less than 3 classes on Wednesday, she does not earn the daily bonus.

Now, let's calculate Tanya's total earnings for the two days:

Monday: $75 (hourly earnings) + $5 (daily bonus) = $80
Wednesday: $30 (hourly earnings) + $0 (daily bonus) = $30

Total earnings for the two days: $80 + $30 = $110

"To find the difference in the number of vanilla scents sold compared to the fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of each type of scent sold.

The company sold 5 vanilla scents and there are 4 vanilla scents available, so the total number of vanilla scents sold is 5 * 4 = 20.

The company sold 2 fruity scents and there are 8 fruity scents available, so the total number of fruity scents sold is 2 * 8 = 16.

Now, we need to find the difference between the total number of vanilla scents sold and the total number of fruity scents sold. 

Difference = Total vanilla scents sold - Total fruity scents sold
Difference = 20 - 16
Difference = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total amount of money Bennet makes from selling the eggplants. 

The total amount from selling eggplants = Number of eggplants sold * Price per eggplant
= 20 * $3
= $60

Now, we know that Bennet wants to make a total of $135. Since he already made $60 from selling the eggplants, he needs to make $135 - $60 = $75 from selling the corn.

The total number of ears of corn he has is 25. Let's assume the price per ear of corn is x. 

The total amount from selling corn = Number of ears of corn * Price per ear of corn
= 25 * x

We know that the total amount from selling corn should be $75. So, we can set up the equation:
25 * x = 75

To find the price per ear of corn, we can divide both sides of the equation by 25:
x = 75 / 25
x = 3

Therefore, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To find the percentage of Tatiana's weekend spent playing soccer, we first need to determine the total time she has available for soccer. 

Tatiana has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, for a total of 12 hours. 

She reads for 3 hours, so the remaining time is 12 - 3 = 9 hours.

She plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time, which is 1/3 * 9 = 3 hours.

The time left for soccer is 9 - 3 = 6 hours.

To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we divide the time spent playing soccer by the total time available and multiply by 100.

(6 / 12) * 100 = 50%

"To find out how many pencils Anthony kept, we need to follow the steps of the problem.

Initially, Anthony had 50 pencils.

He gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon. To find out how many pencils he gave to Brandon, we multiply 50 by 1/2:
50 * 1/2 = 25 pencils given to Brandon.

Now, Anthony has 50 - 25 = 25 pencils left.

He then gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. To find out how many pencils he gave to Charlie, we multiply 25 by 3/5:
25 * 3/5 = 15 pencils given to Charlie.

Now, Anthony has 25 - 15 = 10 pencils left.

Therefore, Anthony kept 10 pencils.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time spent driving and the time spent at the museum. 

First, let's calculate the time spent driving to the museum. Since the distance to the museum is 150 miles and Jack drives at 75 mph, we can use the formula time = distance / speed. 

Time to the museum = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours.

Since the distance to the museum is the same as the distance back home, the time spent driving back home is also 2 hours. 

Total time spent driving = time to the museum + time back home = 2 hours + 2 hours = 4 hours.

Now, we add the time spent at the museum (6 hours) to the total time spent driving (4 hours) to find the total time Jack is gone from home.

Total time gone from home = time spent driving + time at the museum = 4 hours + 6 hours = 10 hours.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of wheels needed for the toys, we need to calculate the number of wheels required for the cars and the motorcycles separately and then add them together.

For the cars, Henry needs 4 wheels for each of the 57 cars. So, the total number of wheels needed for the cars is 57 * 4 = 228.

For the motorcycles, Henry needs 2 wheels for each of the 73 motorcycles. So, the total number of wheels needed for the motorcycles is 73 * 2 = 146.

Now, we add the total number of wheels needed for the cars and the motorcycles: 228 + 146 = 374.

Since Henry has a box with 650 wheels, we subtract the total number of wheels needed from the total number of wheels available: 650 - 374 = 276.

The final answer is: 276"

20% of $1000 = 0.20 * $1000 = $200

Now, subtract the discount from the original price:
$1000 - $200 = $800

So, you have to pay $800 after the 20% discount.

The final answer is: $800"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how many movies are in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of movies in series = Total movies / 3
= 600 / 3
= 200 movies

Since Mike can buy these series movies for $6 each, we can calculate the cost of these movies as follows:

Cost of series movies = Number of movies in series * Cost of series movies
= 200 * $6
= $1200

Now, let's find out how many movies are not in series. We can do this by subtracting the number of movies in series from the total number of movies:

Number of movies not in series = Total movies - Number of movies in series
= 600 - 200
= 400 movies

Next, let's find out how many of these movies are older movies. Since 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of older movies = Number of movies not in series * 0.4
= 400 * 0.4
= 160 movies

Since older movies cost $5 each, we can calculate the cost of these movies as follows:

Cost of older movies = Number of older movies * Cost of older movies
= 160 * $5
= $800

Now, let's find out how many movies are normal movies. We can do this by subtracting the number of older movies from the number of movies not in series:

Number of normal movies = Number of movies not in series - Number of older movies
= 400 - 160
= 240 movies

Since normal movies cost $10 each, we can calculate the cost of these movies as follows:

Cost of normal movies = Number of normal movies * Cost of normal movies
= 240 * $10
= $2400

Now, we can find the total cost of replacing the movies by adding the cost of series movies, older movies, and normal movies:

Total cost = Cost of series movies + Cost of older movies + Cost of normal movies
= $1200 + $800 + $2400
= $4400

The final answer is: $4400"

The cost of apricots is 6 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $18.00

Now, we add the costs together: $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00

The final numerical answer is: $38.00"
"To find the distance to the vacation spot, we first need to calculate the distance covered by driving and hiking separately.

The Llesis family drove for 6 hours at an average speed of 50 miles per hour. The distance covered by driving can be calculated as:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 50 miles/hour * 6 hours
Distance = 300 miles

Next, we need to find the speed at which they hiked. It is given that they hiked at an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Half of their driving speed is 50 / 2 = 25 miles per hour. Therefore, their hiking speed is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

They hiked for 1.5 hours at this speed. The distance covered by hiking can be calculated as:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 20 miles/hour * 1.5 hours
Distance = 30 miles

The total distance to the vacation spot is the sum of the distance covered by driving and hiking:

Total Distance = Distance covered by driving + Distance covered by hiking
Total Distance = 300 miles + 30 miles
Total Distance = 330 miles

The final answer is: 330"

Since Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, Ava's enemy score is x + 8. 
Since Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, Ava's berry score is x + 3.
Since Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, Ava's timer score is (60 - (x + 4)) * 30 (assuming the level time is 60 seconds).

Emma's total score is x + (number of enemies Emma jumps on) * 10 + (number of berries Emma collects) * 5 + (time left when Emma finishes the level) * 30. 
Since we don't know the number of enemies Emma jumps on or the number of berries she collects, let's represent it as y and z respectively. 
Emma's total score is x + 10y + 5z + 30(60 - x).

Ava's total score is (x + 8) * 10 + (x + 3) * 5 + 30(60 - (x + 4)).

Simplifying Ava's total score: 
10x + 80 + 5x + 15 + 30(56 - x) 
= 10x + 5x + 80 + 15 + 1680 - 30x 
= -15x + 1775

Simplifying Emma's total score: 
x + 10y + 5z + 1800 - 30x 
= -29x + 10y + 5z + 1800

The difference between their scores is Ava's score - Emma's score: 
(-15x + 1775) - (-29x + 10y + 5z + 1800) 
= -15x + 1775 + 29x - 10y - 5z - 1800 
= 14x - 10y - 5z - 25

Since we don't have the values of y and z, we can't find the exact difference. However, we can express the difference in terms of x, y, and z.

However, we can simplify the expression by combining like terms: 
14x - 10y - 5z - 25.

But we can also express the difference in terms of the given information that Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma and collects 3 more berries. 
Let's represent the number of enemies Emma jumps on as y and the number of berries Emma collects as z. 
Then the number of enemies Ava jumps on is y + 8 and the number of berries Ava collects is z + 3.

The difference in their enemy scores is (y + 8) * 10 - y * 10 = 80.
The difference in their berry scores is (z + 3) * 5 - z * 5 = 15.

The difference in their timer scores is 30(60 - (x + 4)) - 30(60 - x) = 30(56 - x - 4) - 30(60 - x) = 30(52 - x) - 30(60 - x) = 1560 - 30x - 1800 + 30x = -240.

The difference in their scores is 80 + 15 - 240 = -145.

The final answer is: $\boxed{-145}$"
"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we first need to determine the total cost of the two pizzas that are already known. Since two pizzas cost 30 dollars each, the total cost of these two pizzas is 2 * 30 = 60 dollars.

Now, we subtract the cost of these two pizzas from the total cost of all four pizzas to find the total cost of the other two pizzas. The total cost of all four pizzas is 64 dollars, so the total cost of the other two pizzas is 64 - 60 = 4 dollars.

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we can find the cost of each pizza by dividing the total cost of the other two pizzas by 2. Therefore, the cost of each of the other two pizzas is 4 / 2 = 2 dollars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of times they ride their bikes on the usual days and the days when they ride twice the usual times.

On usual days, they ride thrice a day for 5 days, so the total number of times they ride on usual days is 3 * 5 = 15.

On the two days when they ride twice the usual times, they ride 2 * 3 = 6 times a day. Since there are 2 such days, the total number of times they ride on these days is 6 * 2 = 12.

Now, we add the total number of times they ride on usual days and the days when they ride twice the usual times: 15 + 12 = 27.

However, we still need to consider the remaining 2 days when they ride thrice a day. So, we add 3 * 2 = 6 to the total.

The total number of times they ride their bikes in a week is 27 + 6 = 33.

The final answer is: 33"
"Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as 'w' and the number of orange fish Bob bought as 'o'. 

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After buying 'w' white fish and 'o' orange fish, he had a total of 3 + o + w orange fish and 4 + w white fish.

Since he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up the equation: 3 + o + w = 2(4 + w).

Simplifying the equation, we get 3 + o + w = 8 + 2w.

Subtracting w from both sides, we get 3 + o = 8 + w.

Subtracting 3 from both sides, we get o = 5 + w.

We also know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17, so o + w = 17.

Substituting o = 5 + w into the equation, we get (5 + w) + w = 17.

Combining like terms, we get 5 + 2w = 17.

Subtracting 5 from both sides, we get 2w = 12.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get w = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To calculate the weekly fuel consumption of Andy's car, we need to determine the total distance traveled in a week and then divide it by the fuel efficiency of the car.

The one-way distance between Andy's home and office is 5 miles, and he travels this distance twice a day (to and from work). Since he works from Monday to Friday, the total number of working days in a week is 5.

The total distance traveled in a week is: 2 * 5 miles * 5 days = 50 miles

Now, we can calculate the fuel consumption in a week by dividing the total distance traveled by the fuel efficiency of the car:

Fuel consumption per week = Total distance traveled / Fuel efficiency
Fuel consumption per week = 50 miles / 10 MPG
Fuel consumption per week = 5 gallons

Since the price of regular gas is $3/gallon, we can calculate the weekly fuel cost by multiplying the fuel consumption per week by the price per gallon:

Weekly fuel cost = Fuel consumption per week * Price per gallon
Weekly fuel cost = 5 gallons * $3/gallon
Weekly fuel cost = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Carrie received and then subtract the amount she spent.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie received:

- Ten twenties equal 10 x $20 = $200
- 140 quarters equal 140 x $0.25 = $35

Total amount of money Carrie received = $200 + $35 = $235

Carrie spent all the quarters, which is $35, and 3/5 of the twenties. To find 3/5 of the twenties, we multiply $200 by 3/5:

3/5 x $200 = (3/5) x 200 = 3 x 40 = $120

Carrie spent $120 from the twenties and $35 from the quarters, for a total of $155.

The final answer is: $155"
"To find the total number of fruits Ricardo can get from his plants, we need to calculate the total number of tomatoes and eggplants separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total number of tomatoes: 
Number of tomato plants = 5
Tomatoes per plant = 22
Total tomatoes = Number of tomato plants * Tomatoes per plant
Total tomatoes = 5 * 22
Total tomatoes = 110

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggplants:
Number of eggplant plants = 8
Eggplants per plant = 4
Total eggplants = Number of eggplant plants * Eggplants per plant
Total eggplants = 8 * 4
Total eggplants = 32

Now, let's add the total number of tomatoes and eggplants to find the total number of fruits:
Total fruits = Total tomatoes + Total eggplants
Total fruits = 110 + 32
Total fruits = 142

The final answer is: 142"
"To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we first need to determine the total percentage of smart TVs and analog TVs sold. 

One-fourth of the TVs are smart TVs, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 TVs. 
One-eighth of the TVs are analog TVs, which is 1/8 * 40 = 5 TVs.

The total number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold is 10 + 5 = 15 TVs.

Since the rest of the TVs are OLED, we subtract the total number of smart and analog TVs from the total number of TVs sold: 40 - 15 = 25.

Therefore, Samwell sold 25 OLED TVs.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how much money John is missing, we first need to determine the total cost of the trip that John needs to cover. Since the school is covering half the cost, John will need to cover the other half. 

The total cost of the trip is $300. Half of $300 is $300 / 2 = $150. 

Since John already has $50, we need to subtract this from the amount he needs to cover: $150 - $50 = $100.

Therefore, John is missing $100.

The final answer is: $100"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the temperature at night and then calculate how many logs Carson needs to burn to maintain a temperature above 32 degrees.

First, let's find the temperature at night. It's 33 degrees colder during the night compared to the day, and the day temperature is 45 degrees. 

Night temperature = Day temperature - 33
Night temperature = 45 - 33
Night temperature = 12 degrees

Since the pipes will freeze at 32 degrees, Carson needs to maintain a temperature above 32 degrees at night. To do this, he needs to heat the house by 32 - 12 = 20 degrees.

Each log of wood heats the house by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we divide the total temperature increase needed by the temperature increase per log.

Number of logs = Total temperature increase / Temperature increase per log
Number of logs = 20 / 5
Number of logs = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we first need to find the total number of groups formed. Since 90 people were divided into 9-person groups, we can find the total number of groups by dividing 90 by 9.

Total number of groups = 90 / 9 = 10

Next, we need to find the number of groups that had members bring back 2 seashells each. Since 3/5 of the groups did this, we can multiply the total number of groups by 3/5.

Number of groups with seashells = 10 * (3/5) = 6

Now, we need to find the total number of seashells brought back by these groups. Since each group brought back 2 seashells, we can multiply the number of groups with seashells by 2.

Total seashells = 6 * 2 = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the number of people on the train after the two stops, we need to perform a series of subtractions and additions.

Initially, there are 172 people on the train.

At the first stop, 47 people get off, so we subtract 47 from 172:
172 - 47 = 125

Then, 13 people get on the train, so we add 13 to 125:
125 + 13 = 138

At the next stop, 38 people get off, so we subtract 38 from 138:
138 - 38 = 100

"To find the amount Mike will have left over after purchasing the jeans, we need to calculate the discounted price of the jeans and then subtract that from the $50 bill.

First, let's calculate the discounted price of the jeans. The original price is $40, and it's 25% off. To find the discount amount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage (25% or 0.25).

Discount = Original Price * Discount Percentage
Discount = $40 * 0.25
Discount = $10

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the discounted price.

Discounted Price = Original Price - Discount
Discounted Price = $40 - $10
Discounted Price = $30

Now, we need to find out how much money Mike will have left over after paying with a $50 bill. We subtract the discounted price from the $50 bill.

Amount Left Over = $50 - $30
Amount Left Over = $20

"To find out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we need to calculate their total earnings after working 20 hours.

Billy's initial hourly wage is $10. After 2 months, he gets a raise of $0.50 per hour, making his new hourly wage $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. On his first anniversary, he gets another raise of $1.00 per hour, making his final hourly wage $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50.

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary, which was $10. So, Sally's starting salary is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. 

Now, let's calculate their total earnings after working 20 hours:

Billy's total earnings = 20 hours * $11.50 per hour = $230
Sally's total earnings = 20 hours * $10.50 per hour = $210

"To find the total number of trees planted by the students, we first need to find the total number of students. 

There are 40 classes with an average of 25 students per class. So, the total number of students is 40 * 25 = 1000.

Each student plants 1 tree, so the total number of trees planted by students is 1000.

Next, we need to find the total number of teachers. There are 40 classes with an average of 3 teachers per class. So, the total number of teachers is 40 * 3 = 120.

Each teacher plants 2 trees, so the total number of trees planted by teachers is 120 * 2 = 240.

"To find the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy, we first need to determine the total number of stuffed animals she currently has. 

Bubbles has 3 stuffed puppies, 5 stuffed koalas, 2 stuffed zebras, and 4 stuffed frogs. 

Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Now, we need to find the number of stuffed goats that will make up 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. Let's represent the number of stuffed goats as 'x'. 

The total number of stuffed animals after buying 'x' goats will be 14 + x.

We want 30% of the total number of stuffed animals to be goats, so we can set up the equation:

(30/100) * (14 + x) = x

To solve for 'x', we can multiply both sides by 100 to get rid of the fraction:

0.3 * (14 + x) = x

Now, we can distribute 0.3 to 14 and x:

4.2 + 0.3x = x

Next, we can subtract 0.3x from both sides to isolate x:

4.2 = 0.7x

Now, we can divide both sides by 0.7 to solve for x:

x = 4.2 / 0.7
x = 6

So, Bubbles needs to buy 6 stuffed goats to make up 30% of her total number of stuffed animals.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total hours Kris has played and subtract that from the target of 30 hours.

First, let's calculate the hours Kris played in the first 2 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, 2 weeks is 2 * 7 = 14 days. If Kris plays for half an hour every day, she plays 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours in the first 2 weeks.

Next, let's calculate the hours Kris played in the next week. If Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week, she plays 7 * 2 = 14 hours in the next week.

Now, let's add the hours Kris played in both periods: 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours.

To find out how many hours Kris still needs to play, we subtract the total hours played from the target of 30 hours: 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

Therefore, Kris still needs to play 9 hours to earn the achievement.

The overall pass rate is 46%."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of square inches in the mosaic and then calculate how many inches of length Milo can make with the available glass chips.

First, let's find the total number of square inches in the mosaic. Since Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall, and it takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch, the total number of square inches is not directly relevant to the problem. However, we can calculate the total number of square inches in the mosaic by multiplying the height by the number of glass chips per square inch. 

The total number of square inches in the mosaic is 3 inches * 12 chips/square inch = 36 square inches.

However, the problem asks for the length of the mosaic. Since we have the total number of glass chips and the number of chips per square inch, we can calculate the total number of square inches that can be made with the available glass chips. 

Milo has two bags of glass chips, each holding 72 chips. So, the total number of glass chips is 2 * 72 = 144 chips.

Now, we can calculate the total number of square inches that can be made with the available glass chips. 

Total square inches = Total number of glass chips / Number of chips per square inch
Total square inches = 144 / 12
Total square inches = 12 square inches

Since the total number of square inches is 12, and the mosaic is 3 inches tall, we can calculate the length of the mosaic by dividing the total number of square inches by the height.

Length of the mosaic = Total square inches / Height
Length of the mosaic = 12 / 3
Length of the mosaic = 4 inches

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students. 

Four students drank 1.5 quarts each, so the total amount of tea consumed by these students is 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts.

Sixteen students drank 2 quarts each, so the total amount of tea consumed by these students is 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

The total amount of tea consumed is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 10 quarts of tea left, the initial amount of tea at the beginning of the party is 38 + 10 = 48 quarts.

To convert quarts to gallons, we know that 1 gallon is equal to 4 quarts. Therefore, the initial amount of tea at the beginning of the party is 48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

Jack can play for 20 minutes. His two friends who are worse can play for half as long, which is 20 / 2 = 10 minutes. The friend who is better can play for 1.5 times as long, which is 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes.

Since they play for 4 hours, we need to convert this to minutes: 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the total time each person plays:

- Jack: 240 minutes
- Two worse friends: 2 * 10 minutes = 20 minutes each, so 2 * 20 minutes = 40 minutes total
- Better friend: 240 minutes

Now, let's calculate the total time played by all friends: 240 (Jack) + 40 (worse friends) + 240 (better friend) = 520 minutes.

Since Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter, we need to calculate how many 20-minute intervals are in 520 minutes: 520 / 20 = 26.

However, we need to account for the fact that the better friend plays for 240 minutes, which is 12 intervals of 20 minutes. The two worse friends play for 40 minutes, which is 2 intervals of 20 minutes. Jack plays for 240 minutes, which is 12 intervals of 20 minutes.

So, the total number of 20-minute intervals is 12 (Jack) + 2 (worse friends) + 12 (better friend) = 26 intervals.

Since each interval costs 1 quarter, the total number of quarters used is 26.

The final answer is: 26"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the amount of citrus zest as Z, the amount of fragrance as F, the amount of salt as S, the amount of sugar as S (since it's the same as salt), and the amount of oil as O.

We know that Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, so F = Z.

We also know that she uses twice as much salt as zest, so S = 2Z.

Since she uses twice as much oil as salt, O = 2S.

Substituting S = 2Z into the equation O = 2S, we get O = 2(2Z) = 4Z.

We are also given that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, and the total amount is the sum of all the ingredients: Z + F + S + S + O = 10.

Substituting F = Z and S = 2Z into the equation, we get Z + Z + 2Z + 2Z + 4Z = 10.

Combining like terms, we get 10Z = 10.

Dividing both sides by 10, we get Z = 1.

Now that we know Z = 1, we can find the amount of oil: O = 4Z = 4(1) = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total amount of money John spent, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows separately and then add them together.

The cost of the goats is 3 * $500 = $1500.
The cost of the cows is 2 * $1500 = $3000.

Now, we add the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows to find the total amount spent: $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

The final numerical answer is: $4500"
"To find out how many more cupcakes Paul needs to buy, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs.

Total cupcakes needed = 63
Cupcakes already available = 8 (chocolate) + 40 (toffee) = 48

Number of cupcakes Paul needs to buy = Total cupcakes needed - Cupcakes already available
= 63 - 48
= 15

Therefore, Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes. 

15"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

2. Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find 20% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.2: 40 * 0.2 = 8. So, Joe sells 8 cars.

3. Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars to his mother.

4. Now, we need to find out how many cars Joe has left. Initially, he had 40 cars. He sold 8 and gave away 16. So, the total number of cars he gave away or sold is 8 + 16 = 24.

5. To find out how many cars Joe has left, we subtract the total number of cars he gave away or sold from the initial number of cars: 40 - 24 = 16.

Therefore, Joe remains with 16 cars after selling and giving some to his mother.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to first determine the total amount raised by the students. Since the charity raised a total of $175,000 and $50,000 came from organizations, the amount raised by the students is $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000.

Now, we know that there are 20 students and they all raised the same amount. To find the amount each student raised, we divide the total amount raised by the number of students: $125,000 / 20 = $6,250.

The final answer is: $6,250."
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the first day and the second day, and then add them together.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. 

On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she walked on the first day, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

To find the total time in minutes, we need to convert the hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes
4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes

The total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 480 + 240 = 720 minutes.

The final answer is: 720"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of cars in the parking lot after the first break. Initially, there were 50 cars. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, so the total number of cars after the first break is 50 + 20 = 70.

When Hunter got out of class for the lunch break, he realized that 1/2 the number of cars in the parking lot had gone. This means that 1/2 of 70 cars left, and the remaining 1/2 stayed. To find the number of cars that left, we multiply 70 by 1/2, which is 35. 

So, the number of cars that left is 35. To find the total number of cars he counted during lunch break, we need to subtract the number of cars that left from the total number of cars after the first break. 

Total number of cars during lunch break = Total number of cars after the first break - Number of cars that left
= 70 - 35
= 35

The final answer is: 35"
"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of tasks he completes in a day and then multiply it by the number of days he works in a week.

John does 30 cycles of work a day, and each cycle has 5 different tasks. So, the total number of tasks he completes in a day is 30 cycles * 5 tasks/cycle = 150 tasks/day.

Since each task pays $1.20, the total amount John makes in a day is 150 tasks/day * $1.20/task = $180/day.

John works a full 7-day week, so the total amount he makes in a week is $180/day * 7 days = $1260.

The final answer is: $1260"
"To find the total points scored by Sasha, we need to calculate her points in both games. 

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. 

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points in the first game. 

Now, we know Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game, so Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

To find the total points scored by Sasha, we add her points from both games: 14 + 4 = 18.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the total number of tins of cat food, we multiply the number of packages of cat food by the number of tins per package: 8 * 11 = 88 tins of cat food.

To find the total number of tins of dog food, we multiply the number of packages of dog food by the number of tins per package: 6 * 6 = 36 tins of dog food.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of tins of cat food and dog food: 88 - 36 = 52.

The final answer is: 52"
"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as x. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is 341, which is the sum of the cards Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

Since PJ has x cards, Smendrick has 3x cards, and Becca has 3x + 12 cards, we can find the number of cards Becca has by substituting x = 47 into the expression 3x + 12:

Becca has 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

The final answer is: 153"
"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color of eggs and then add them together.

Cindy had 5 green eggs. 
She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.
She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.
She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had (1/3) * 9 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add the number of eggs of each color together: 
5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27

"To calculate the total cost of shipping, we need to calculate the cost per pound and the cost per mile, then multiply them by their respective quantities. The cost per pound is $0.35, and the cost per mile is $0.08. 

The total cost for shipping the book is 4 pounds * $0.35/pound + 20 miles * $0.08/mile. This equals $1.40 + $1.60, which is $2.99.

The refund Milly will receive is 75% of the book's purchase price, which is 0.75 * $32 = $24.

The total cost of shipping minus the refund is $2.99 - $24 = -$21.41. However, since you cannot lose a negative amount of money, we need to recalculate the refund amount. The actual refund amount should be the cost of shipping, which is $2.99. 

The amount Milly will lose is the cost of shipping minus the refund, which is $2.99 - $2.99 = $0.

The final answer is $0."
"To find out how much money Mulan has left, we need to calculate the total amount of money she spent and subtract it from the initial amount she had, including the money her father gave her.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Mulan had initially: $40 (initial money) + $100 (money from her father) = $140.

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money she spent: 2 pairs of jeans at $30 each = 2 x $30 = $60, and a bag for $20. So, the total amount spent is $60 + $20 = $80.

Now, let's subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $140 - $80 = $60.

Therefore, Mulan has $60 left.

"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the production for the first three weeks and then determine the pattern.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.

In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.

In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Now, let's calculate the total production for the first three weeks: 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in a month, we can find out how much he produces in the fourth week by subtracting the total production of the first three weeks from the total monthly production: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

The final answer is: 14,000"
"To calculate the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and then sum them up.

1. Time spent recording videos: 
Britany records 18 videos per week, each taking 4 minutes. 
Time spent recording videos per week = 18 videos * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes
Time spent recording videos per month = 72 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 288 minutes

2. Time spent writing amateur songs:
Britany spends 2 hours per week writing songs. 
Time spent writing songs per week = 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes
Time spent writing songs per month = 120 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 480 minutes

3. Time spent doing makeup:
Britany spends 15 minutes per day doing makeup, 6 days a week. 
Time spent doing makeup per week = 15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = 90 minutes
Time spent doing makeup per month = 90 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 360 minutes

4. Total time spent on TikTok per month = Time spent recording videos + Time spent writing songs + Time spent doing makeup
Total time spent on TikTok per month = 288 minutes + 480 minutes + 360 minutes = 1128 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 
1128 minutes / 60 = 18.8 hours

The final answer is: 1128"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to first determine the cost of the initial installation and then add the cost of the additional items.

The initial installation includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. However, Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures that she needs installed. Since the initial installation already includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, and 1 chandelier, we only need to consider the additional items.

Angela has 2 extra mirrors (6 - 4 = 2), 1 extra chandelier (2 - 1 = 1), and 10 extra pictures (20 - 10 = 10). The cost of the additional items is $15.00 per item.

The total number of additional items is 2 (mirrors) + 1 (chandelier) + 10 (pictures) = 13 items.

The cost of the additional items is 13 items * $15.00 per item = $195.00.

The initial installation cost is $129.00.

The total cost is $129.00 (initial installation) + $195.00 (additional items) = $324.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the relative lifting capacity of each person in terms of the number of mountains they can lift. 

Let's denote the number of mountains Pompei can lift as x. Then Saskay can lift 12x mountains, Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12x = 48x mountains, and Naruto can lift 10 * 48x = 480x mountains.

Since Pompei can lift 1 mountain, x = 1. Therefore, Naruto can lift 480x = 480 * 1 = 480 mountains.

Now, we need to convert the number of mountains to inches. Let's assume the height of a mountain is 1 inch. Then Naruto can lift 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches). Therefore, Naruto can lift 480 / 12 = 40 feet.

"To find the total distance traveled by Mason, we need to calculate the distance covered in the first 4 hours and the distance covered in the next 6 hours, and then add them together.

Distance = Speed x Time

For the first 4 hours:
Distance = 8 miles/hour x 4 hours = 32 miles

For the next 6 hours:
Distance = 8 miles/hour x 6 hours = 48 miles

Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the time it takes for one kangaroo to travel across the highway. Since three kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can divide the total time by the number of kangaroos to find the time it takes for one kangaroo.

Time for one kangaroo = Total time / Number of kangaroos
Time for one kangaroo = 18 hours / 3
Time for one kangaroo = 6 hours

Next, we need to find the speed of the kangaroo. Since speed is distance/time, we can assume the distance is the same for all animals. Let's call the distance 'd'. We can set up the equation:

Speed of kangaroo = Distance / Time for one kangaroo
Speed of kangaroo = d / 6

Now, we need to find the speed of the turtles. The problem states that the turtles travel at half the speed of a kangaroo. So, the speed of the turtles is:

Speed of turtle = (1/2) * Speed of kangaroo
Speed of turtle = (1/2) * (d / 6)
Speed of turtle = d / 12

Since the turtles travel at half the speed of a kangaroo, it will take them twice as long to travel the same distance. Therefore, the time it takes for four turtles to travel across the highway is:

Time for four turtles = 2 * Time for one kangaroo
Time for four turtles = 2 * 6 hours
Time for four turtles = 12 hours

However, since there are four turtles, and they are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, we need to multiply the time by 2 again to account for the slower speed.

Time for four turtles = 2 * 12 hours
Time for four turtles = 24 hours

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. The original price of the laptop is $600.
2. The sales assistant offers a discount of $200 if Erika trades in her old laptop, so the new price is $600 - $200 = $400.
3. Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, so she must have $400 - $50 = $350.
4. Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job and her mom has given her $80, so she has $150 + $80 = $230 from these sources.
5. Since Erika needs $350 and has $230 from her job and her mom, she must have $350 - $230 = $120 in her purse.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of apple slices Adam has initially and then subtract the number of slices he eats.

First, let's calculate the total number of slices from the large apples. Since each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces, 3 large apples will yield 3 * 5 = 15 slices.

Next, let's calculate the total number of slices from the small apples. Since each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces, 5 small apples will yield 5 * 3 = 15 slices.

Now, we add the total number of slices from the large and small apples: 15 (large) + 15 (small) = 30 slices.

Adam eats 15 slices, so we subtract this from the total number of slices: 30 - 15 = 15.

Therefore, the number of apple slices left is 15.

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total amount of milk the farmer currently produces per day. Since he extracts 5 liters of milk from each cow and he has 3 cows, the total amount of milk he produces per day is:

5 liters/cow * 3 cows = 15 liters/day

Now, we need to find out how many more cows he needs to produce 25 liters of milk per day. To do this, we can set up an equation:

Let x be the number of additional cows needed. The total amount of milk produced per day will be the sum of the milk produced by the current cows and the milk produced by the additional cows:

15 liters/day (current production) + 5x liters/day (additional production) = 25 liters/day (target production)

Subtracting 15 from both sides of the equation gives us:

5x = 10

Dividing both sides by 5 gives us:

x = 2

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk per day.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the unused portion of each glue stick and add them together.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, which means 5/6 is used. The length of the used portion is 5/6 * 12 mm = 10 mm. The length of the unused portion is 12 mm - 10 mm = 2 mm.

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, which means 1/3 is used. The length of the used portion is 1/3 * 12 mm = 4 mm. The length of the unused portion is 12 mm - 4 mm = 8 mm.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, which means 1/2 is used. The length of the used portion is 1/2 * 12 mm = 6 mm. The length of the unused portion is 12 mm - 6 mm = 6 mm.

Now, we add the lengths of the unused portions together: 2 mm + 8 mm + 6 mm = 16 mm.

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 16 mm."
"To find out how much money Gabriel still needs, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has and subtract it from the total cost of the items he wants to buy.

Gabriel has $5000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200, so he has a total of $5000 + $200 = $5200.

The total cost of the items he wants to buy is $10000 (car) + $800 (phone) = $10800.

To find out how much money Gabriel still needs, we subtract the amount he has from the total cost: $10800 - $5200 = $5600.

Therefore, Gabriel still needs $5600.

"To solve this problem, we can use the principle of set theory, specifically the concept of the union and intersection of sets.

Let's denote the set of students good at math as M and the set of students good at English as E. We are given that:

- |M ∩ E| (the number of students good at both math and English) is not explicitly given, but we can find it using the information provided.
- |M| (the total number of students good at math) is what we want to find.
- |E| (the total number of students good at English) is given as 8 + |M ∩ E|, since 8 students are good at English only.

We are also given that the total number of students in the class is 20, and 5 students are good at math only. This means that the number of students good at math only is |M| - |M ∩ E|.

Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we can write the equation:

|M| + |E| - |M ∩ E| = 20

Substituting |E| = 8 + |M ∩ E| and |M| - |M ∩ E| = 5, we get:

|M| + (8 + |M ∩ E|) - |M ∩ E| = 20

Simplifying the equation, we get:

|M| + 8 = 20

Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get:

|M| = 12

Therefore, the number of students good at math is 12.

"To find the total number of groups that can perform, we need to calculate the total available time for performances and then divide it by the time required for each group to perform, including getting on and off the stage.

The total available time for performances is the total concert time minus the intermission time. 

Total concert time = 2 hours = 2 * 60 minutes = 120 minutes
Intermission time = 10 minutes
Total available time for performances = 120 minutes - 10 minutes = 110 minutes

Each group requires 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit the stage. So, the total time required for each group is 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes.

Now, we can calculate the number of groups that can perform:
Number of groups = Total available time for performances / Time required for each group
= 110 minutes / 10 minutes
= 11

"To solve this problem, we need to understand that it's a simple interest scenario, but with a twist. The interest rate is not a fixed percentage, but rather a fraction of the original amount. 

Let's break it down:

Year 1: The interest earned is 3/4 of the original amount, which is $300 * (3/4) = $225. The total amount after 1 year is $300 (initial) + $225 (interest) = $525.

Year 2: The interest earned is 3/4 of the new amount, which is $525 * (3/4) = $393.75. The total amount after 2 years is $525 (previous total) + $393.75 (interest) = $918.75.

Year 3: The interest earned is 3/4 of the new amount, which is $918.75 * (3/4) = $344.31 (rounded to two decimal places). The total amount after 3 years is $918.75 (previous total) + $344.31 (interest) = $1263.06.

First, we need to find the number of white shirts with collars and the number of floral shirts with buttons.

Since half of the white shirts have collars, the number of white shirts with collars is 40 / 2 = 20.

The number of floral shirts with buttons is given as 20.

Now, let's find the number of white shirts with no collars. Since 20 out of 40 white shirts have collars, the number of white shirts with no collars is 40 - 20 = 20.

Next, let's find the number of floral shirts with no buttons. The total number of floral shirts is 50, and 20 of them have buttons. So, the number of floral shirts with no buttons is 50 - 20 = 30.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars. This difference is 30 - 20 = 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total amount the farmer will earn, we need to determine the number of trays the farmer can fill with 900 eggs and then multiply that by the price per tray.

Since each tray holds 30 eggs, we can divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs per tray to find the number of trays:

900 eggs / 30 eggs per tray = 30 trays

Now, we multiply the number of trays by the price per tray to find the total earnings:

30 trays * $2.5 per tray = $75

The final answer is: $75"
"To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we first need to determine the number of goats sold from each farm. 

From Farm X, Mr. Smith sold 10 goats. 
From Farm Y, he sold twice as many goats as from Farm X, which is 2 * 10 = 20 goats.

Now, let's calculate the number of goats left in each farm:
- Farm X: 55 - 10 = 45 goats
- Farm Y: 45 - 20 = 25 goats

To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the number of goats in Farm X and Farm Y:
45 (Farm X) + 25 (Farm Y) = 70 goats

The final answer is: 70"
"To find the average cost of each pair of shoes, we need to divide the total amount spent on shoes per year by the number of pairs purchased per year.

First, let's calculate the number of pairs James buys per year: 2 pairs/month * 12 months/year = 24 pairs/year.

Next, we'll divide the total amount spent on shoes per year by the number of pairs purchased per year: $2640/year ÷ 24 pairs/year = $110/pair.

The final answer is: $110"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the green and red baskets separately and then combine them.

The cost of 3 baskets of green food is 3 * $25 = $75.

The cost of 3 baskets of red food is 3 * $18 = $54. 

Since you get $2 off for each basket of red food, the total discount is 3 * $2 = $6.

The total cost of the red baskets after the discount is $54 - $6 = $48.

The total cost of all the baskets is $75 (green) + $48 (red) = $123.

The final numerical answer is: $123"
"To find the time it takes to clean one-half of the rooms, we first need to determine the number of rooms that is half of 90. 

Half of 90 is 45 rooms. 

Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, we need to multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room. 

45 rooms * 20 minutes per room = 900 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). 

900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours

Therefore, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms.

"To find the total number of homes built over the next three years, we need to calculate the number of homes built in each year and then sum them up.

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will count the total number of homes built in the first two years and double it. The total number of homes built in the first two years is 12 + 36 = 48. Doubling this amount gives 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

Now, we add up the number of homes built in each year: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144.

The final answer is: 144"
"Let's denote my age as 'x'. Since I am three years younger than my brother, my brother's age is x + 3. My sister is 2 years younger than me, so her age is x - 2.

My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, which can be expressed as 3(x + 3) - 1.

The sum of our ages is 87, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + 3(x + 3) - 1 = 87.

Combine like terms: 5x + 10 + 3x - 1 = 87.

Combine the x terms and the constants: 8x + 9 = 87.

Subtract 9 from both sides: 8x = 78.

Divide both sides by 8: x = 9.75.

Since age cannot be a fraction, we need to re-examine the equation. The issue lies in the fact that we assumed my age is an integer. However, the problem statement does not explicitly state that the ages are integers. 

To find the closest integer solution, we can try the nearest integers to 9.75, which are 9 and 10. 

Let's test x = 9: 9 + (9 + 3) + (9 - 2) + 3(9 + 3) - 1 = 9 + 12 + 7 + 3(12) - 1 = 9 + 12 + 7 + 36 - 1 = 63. This is less than 87.

Let's test x = 10: 10 + (10 + 3) + (10 - 2) + 3(10 + 3) - 1 = 10 + 13 + 8 + 3(13) - 1 = 10 + 13 + 8 + 39 - 1 = 69. This is still less than 87.

Let's test x = 11: 11 + (11 + 3) + (11 - 2) + 3(11 + 3) - 1 = 11 + 14 + 9 + 3(14) - 1 = 11 + 14 + 9 + 42 - 1 = 75. This is still less than 87.

Let's test x = 12: 12 + (12 + 3) + (12 - 2) + 3(12 + 3) - 1 = 12 + 15 + 10 + 3(15) - 1 = 12 + 15 + 10 + 45 - 1 = 81. This is still less than 87.

Let's test x = 13: 13 + (13 + 3) + (13 - 2) + 3(13 + 3) - 1 = 13 + 16 + 11 + 3(16) - 1 = 13 + 16 + 11 + 48 - 1 = 87.

Therefore, the final answer is: 13"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of glue sticks required and then divide that by the number of glue sticks per pack, rounding up to the nearest whole number since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs.

First, we calculate the total number of glue sticks needed: 27 students * 2 glue sticks per student = 54 glue sticks.

Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we divide the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack: 54 glue sticks / 8 glue sticks per pack = 6.75.

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, we round up to the nearest whole number: 7 packs.

Therefore, Mr. Jackson will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks to ensure every student has 2 glue sticks, with some extra glue sticks left over.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water passing through the river at the given point over the three days.

On the first day, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

On the second day, the amount of water passing through the river doubles, so it becomes 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.

On the third day, the amount of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons, so it becomes 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

To find the total amount of water passing through the river at that point over the three days, we need to add the amounts of water passing through the river each day:

Total amount of water = 4000 + 8000 + 14000 = 24000 gallons.

The final answer is: 24000"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of exponential growth, which is characteristic of infectious diseases. The number of infected people at each time step can be calculated using the formula for exponential growth:

N(t) = N0 * (1 + r)^t

where:
- N(t) is the number of infected people at time t
- N0 is the initial number of infected people (10 in this case)
- r is the growth rate (6 new infections per infected person per day)
- t is the time in days

However, since the growth rate is per infected person, we need to adjust the formula to account for the number of infected individuals at each time step. This can be done by using the formula for exponential growth with a variable population:

N(t) = N0 * (1 + r)^t - 1

where:
- N(t) is the number of infected people at time t
- N0 is the initial number of infected people (10 in this case)
- r is the growth rate (6 new infections per infected person per day)
- t is the time in days

Plugging in the values, we get:

N(0) = 10 (initially infected people)
r = 6 (growth rate)
t = 3 (time in days)

N(3) = 10 * (1 + 6/10)^3 - 1
N(3) = 10 * (1.6)^3 - 1
N(3) = 10 * 4.096 - 1
N(3) = 40.96 - 1
N(3) = 39.96

However, since the number of people must be a whole number, we round down to the nearest whole number, as you cannot have a fraction of a person.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the total amount of money Rafaela received, we need to multiply the number of customers by the tip amount each customer gave. 

Number of customers = 40
Tip amount per customer = $20

Total amount Rafaela received = Number of customers * Tip amount per customer
Total amount Rafaela received = 40 * $20
Total amount Rafaela received = $800

Julieta received 10% less money than Rafaela. To find the amount Julieta received, we need to calculate 10% of Rafaela's total and subtract it from Rafaela's total.

10% of Rafaela's total = 0.1 * $800
10% of Rafaela's total = $80

Amount Julieta received = Rafaela's total - 10% of Rafaela's total
Amount Julieta received = $800 - $80
Amount Julieta received = $720

Total amount both received = Rafaela's total + Julieta's total
Total amount both received = $800 + $720
Total amount both received = $1520

"To find out how many oranges Jennifer remained with, we need to calculate the total number of oranges given to her children. 

First, let's calculate the total number of oranges given to her daughters: 3 daughters * 2 oranges per daughter = 6 oranges. 

Next, we add the oranges given to her son: 6 oranges (given to daughters) + 3 oranges (given to son) = 9 oranges.

Now, we subtract the total number of oranges given to her children from the initial number of oranges she bought: 12 oranges (initial) - 9 oranges (given to children) = 3 oranges.

Therefore, Jennifer remained with 3 oranges.

The final answer is: 3"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume Claire earns 1 badge per month. Since it takes Amber twice as long to earn a badge than Claire, Amber earns 1 badge every 2 months. 

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame. Since Claire earns 1 badge per month, Wendy earns 3 badges per month.

In a 1-year time frame (12 months), Claire will earn 12 badges. 

Amber earns 1 badge every 2 months, so in 12 months, Amber will earn 12 / 2 = 6 badges.

Wendy earns 3 badges per month, so in 12 months, Wendy will earn 3 * 12 = 36 badges.

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a 1-year time frame, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns: 36 - 6 = 30.

"To find the total amount raised, we need to calculate the total number of slices sold and then multiply it by the price per slice.

First, let's find the total number of hours Paige baked. She baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is 5 hours.

Since Paige can bake 2 loaves per hour, the total number of loaves baked in 5 hours is 2 loaves/hour * 5 hours = 10 loaves.

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices is 10 loaves * 8 slices/loaf = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is equivalent to $0.50. To find the total amount raised, we multiply the total number of slices by the price per slice: 80 slices * $0.50/slice = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find the total number of coins Gretchen has, we need to determine the number of silver coins first. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, and Gretchen has 70 gold coins, we can set up an equation to represent the relationship between the number of gold and silver coins.

Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. Then, the number of gold coins is 'x + 30'. We know that the number of gold coins is 70, so we can set up the equation:

x + 30 = 70

To solve for 'x', we subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:

x = 70 - 30
x = 40

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins. To find the total number of coins, we add the number of gold coins and silver coins:

Total coins = Number of gold coins + Number of silver coins
Total coins = 70 + 40
Total coins = 110

The final answer is: 110"
"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we first need to determine the total number of burritos consumed. 

There were 50 students at the picnic, and each student was given 10 burritos. So, the total number of burritos given to the students is 50 * 10 = 500.

Mr. George also ate 20 burritos. Therefore, the total number of burritos consumed is 500 (by students) + 20 (by Mr. George) = 520.

Since there were 600 burritos ordered initially, the total number of leftover burritos is 600 - 520 = 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of green and blue cars. We know that there are 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so the number of green cars is 12 - 2 = 10. 

We also know that there are 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars, so the number of blue cars is 3 * 10 = 30.

Now, we can calculate the total number of red, green, and blue cars: 12 (red) + 10 (green) + 30 (blue) = 52.

Since the rink has 75 cars in total, the number of yellow cars can be found by subtracting the total number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars: 75 - 52 = 23.

The final answer is: 23"
"To solve this problem, we can start by assigning variables to the number of books each person has. Let's say Anne has x books. Since Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, Sofie has x + 25 books. Fawn has 12 more books than Anne, so Fawn has x + 12 books.

We know that together, Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have 85 books. We can write an equation to represent this:

x + (x + 25) + (x + 12) = 85

Combine like terms:

3x + 37 = 85

Subtract 37 from both sides:

3x = 48

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 16

Now that we know Anne has 16 books, we can find out how many books Fawn has by adding 12 to x:

Fawn has x + 12 = 16 + 12 = 28 books.

The final answer is: 28"
"To find the weight of the carrots, we first need to determine the weight of the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, the sweet potatoes weigh 2 * 5 = 10 pounds.

Next, we need to find the weight of the carrots, which is 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes. So, the weight of the carrots is 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

The weight of the carrots is 7 pounds."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of jello cups needed and then calculate the total cost.

First, we need to find out how many jello cups Greg needs in total. Since there are 30 kids and each kid will get 4 jello cups, the total number of jello cups needed is:

30 kids * 4 jello cups/kid = 120 jello cups

Since one 3-ounce box of flavored jello makes 10 small jello cups, we need to find out how many boxes of jello Greg needs to buy. 

To do this, we divide the total number of jello cups needed by the number of jello cups per box:

120 jello cups / 10 jello cups/box = 12 boxes

Now, we need to calculate the total cost of the jello. Since each box costs $1.25, we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box:

12 boxes * $1.25/box = $15

"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we first need to determine how much Keenan spends in a month. Since Madeline pays 60% of the total cost, Keenan pays the remaining 40%. 

First, let's calculate Keenan's monthly expenditure: 
Total monthly expenditure = $400
Madeline's monthly expenditure = 60% of $400 = 0.6 * $400 = $240
Keenan's monthly expenditure = Total monthly expenditure - Madeline's monthly expenditure
Keenan's monthly expenditure = $400 - $240 = $160

Now, we need to find out how much Keenan spends per week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we can divide Keenan's monthly expenditure by 4:
Keenan's weekly expenditure = Keenan's monthly expenditure / 4
Keenan's weekly expenditure = $160 / 4
Keenan's weekly expenditure = $40

"To find the total number of pizza pieces eaten by Tobias, we need to calculate the number of pieces he ate on each day and add them together.

On the first day, Tobias ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces. To find 2/5 of 60, we multiply 60 by 2 and divide by 5:
(2/5) * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

So, on the first day, Tobias ate 24 pieces.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces. To find the remaining pieces after the first two days, we subtract the pieces eaten on the first two days from the total:
60 - 24 - 10 = 26

Now, we need to find 7/13 of 26:
(7/13) * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14

So, on the third day, Tobias ate 14 pieces.

To find the total number of pieces eaten, we add the pieces eaten on each day:
24 + 10 + 14 = 48

The final answer is: 48"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the cost of one bottle of soda and one bottle of water. 

Let's start by finding the cost of one bottle of soda. We know that 7 bottles of soda cost $21.00, so we can divide $21.00 by 7 to find the cost of one bottle of soda.

Cost of one bottle of soda = $21.00 / 7 = $3.00

Next, we'll find the cost of one bottle of water. We know that 4 bottles of water cost $8.00, so we can divide $8.00 by 4 to find the cost of one bottle of water.

Cost of one bottle of water = $8.00 / 4 = $2.00

Now that we know the cost of one bottle of soda and one bottle of water, we can find the total cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water.

Total cost of 3 bottles of soda = 3 x $3.00 = $9.00
Total cost of 2 bottles of water = 2 x $2.00 = $4.00

Total cost = $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00

The cost of each bolt is $0.03, and David wants to buy 16 bolts. 

Total cost of bolts = Number of bolts * Cost per bolt
Total cost of bolts = 16 * $0.03
Total cost of bolts = $0.48

Now, we subtract the total cost of the bolts from the initial amount of money David has:

Initial amount of money = $12.48
Total cost of bolts = $0.48
Money left = Initial amount of money - Total cost of bolts
Money left = $12.48 - $0.48
Money left = $12.00

First, we calculate her hourly wage by dividing the amount she earned ($33) by the number of hours she worked (3). 

Hourly wage = Total earnings / Number of hours worked
Hourly wage = $33 / 3
Hourly wage = $11

Now that we know her hourly wage, we can calculate her earnings after 12 hours by multiplying her hourly wage by the number of hours she will work.

Earnings after 12 hours = Hourly wage * Number of hours worked
Earnings after 12 hours = $11 * 12
Earnings after 12 hours = $132

Initially, Paul has 52 marbles. His friend gave him 28 marbles, so we add 28 to 52:

52 + 28 = 80

Then, Paul lost 1/4 of his marbles. To find 1/4 of 80, we multiply 80 by 1/4 or divide by 4:

80 / 4 = 20

Since Paul lost 20 marbles, we subtract 20 from the total number of marbles he had after receiving the gift:

80 - 20 = 60

Therefore, Paul has 60 marbles left.

"To find Amy's total score, we need to calculate the points she scores from each type of question and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the points from the multiple-choice questions. Amy correctly answers 80% of the 10 multiple-choice questions, so she gets 0.8 * 10 = 8 questions correct. Since each multiple-choice question is worth 1 point, she scores 8 points from the multiple-choice questions.

Next, let's calculate the points from the true/false questions. Amy correctly answers 90% of the 20 true/false questions, so she gets 0.9 * 20 = 18 questions correct. Since each true/false question is worth 1 point, she scores 18 points from the true/false questions.

Finally, let's calculate the points from the long-answer questions. Amy correctly answers 60% of the 5 long-answer questions, so she gets 0.6 * 5 = 3 questions correct. Since each long-answer question is worth 5 points, she scores 3 * 5 = 15 points from the long-answer questions.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many chickens Isaias plans to sell. Since he has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them, we can calculate the number of chickens he plans to sell as follows:

Number of chickens to sell = 3/5 * 300
= 3 * 60
= 180

Next, we need to find out the total amount of money Isaias will make from selling these chickens at $50 per chicken:

Total amount of money = Number of chickens to sell * Price per chicken
= 180 * 50
= 9000

Since Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000, we can set up an equation to find the total cost of the chickens:

Total amount of money = Total cost + Profit
9000 = Total cost + 2000

Now, we can solve for the total cost:

Total cost = 9000 - 2000
= 7000

Therefore, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for sale for $7000.

The final answer is: $7000"

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Sarah will receive from selling the rope and then subtract the cost of the new rope.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Sarah will receive from selling the rope:

Length of the rope = 20 meters
Price per meter = $2
Total amount of money = Length of the rope * Price per meter
Total amount of money = 20 * $2
Total amount of money = $40

Next, let's calculate the cost of the new rope:

Length of the new rope = 20 meters (assuming Sarah wants to buy a rope of the same length)
Price per meter of the new rope = $1.5
Cost of the new rope = Length of the new rope * Price per meter of the new rope
Cost of the new rope = 20 * $1.5
Cost of the new rope = $30

Now, let's calculate the amount of money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope:

First, let's find the cost of the chicken. Since each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, and the 5 packs of bacon cost $10, the cost of each pack of chicken is $10 / 5 = $2. Since Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, the total cost of the chicken is 6 * $2 = $12.

Next, let's find the cost of the strawberries. Each pack of strawberries costs $4, and Kelly has 3 packs, so the total cost of the strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.

Now, let's find the cost of the apples. Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is $4 / 2 = $2. Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost of the apples is 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items in Kelly's cart: $10 (bacon) + $12 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $48.

Finally, let's subtract the total cost of the items from Kelly's budget: $65 - $48 = $17.

The final answer is: $17"
"Let's denote the runtime of Elaina's usual concerts as 'x' minutes. Since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, its runtime is 2x minutes. Additionally, the encore adds 15 minutes to the total runtime. We are given that the total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes.

We can set up the equation: 2x + 15 = 65

To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable x. Subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 65 - 15
2x = 50

Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for x:

x = 50 / 2
x = 25

So, Elaina's usual concerts run for 25 minutes.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how many toys Argo has now, we need to subtract the number of toys he gave away from the total number of toys he initially had.

Initially, Argo had 200 toys.

He gave away 40 toys to Alyssa, 80 toys to Bonnie, and 30 toys to Nicky. 

Total toys given away = 40 + 80 + 30 = 150

Now, let's subtract the total toys given away from the initial number of toys:

200 - 150 = 50

So, Argo has 50 toys now.

"To find the total number of chimichangas made on those three days, we need to add the number of chimichangas made on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday.

On Tuesday, they make 125 chimichangas.
On Wednesday, they also make 125 chimichangas.
On Friday, they make twice as many as Wednesday, which is 2 * 125 = 250 chimichangas.

Now, let's add the number of chimichangas made on each day: 
125 (Tuesday) + 125 (Wednesday) + 250 (Friday) = 400

The final answer is: 400"
"To solve this problem, we first need to find out how many microphones were not arranged in pairs. Since 20% of the microphones couldn't fit, we can calculate this as 20% of 50, which is 0.20 * 50 = 10 microphones.

Now, we know that the singer arranged the remaining microphones in pairs. To find the number of pairs, we need to subtract the unarranged microphones from the total number of microphones and divide by 2 (since each pair consists of 2 microphones).

Number of microphones arranged = Total microphones - Unarranged microphones
= 50 - 10
= 40

Number of pairs = Number of microphones arranged / 2
= 40 / 2
= 20

"To find the total number of birds, we need to calculate the number of birds in each group and add them together.

First, Jerry counts 6 birds nesting in the bushes.

Next, 2/3rd of the number of birds nesting in the bushes are flying overhead. To find this number, we multiply 6 by 2/3.

6 * (2/3) = 4

So, there are 4 birds flying overhead.

Then, Jerry sees 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. To find the total number of birds in these groups, we multiply 8 by 3.

8 * 3 = 24

Now, we add the number of birds in each group together: 6 (nesting) + 4 (flying) + 24 (feeding) = 34.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find out how many cookies were in each jar, we need to first determine how many cookies Lani had left after eating 5 cookies. 

Lani started with 55 cookies and ate 5, so she had 55 - 5 = 50 cookies left.

Since she placed the remaining cookies equally into 5 jars, we need to divide the remaining cookies by 5.

50 cookies / 5 jars = 10 cookies per jar.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of petals on the orchids, we multiply the number of orchids by the number of petals per orchid: 5 orchids * 5 petals/orchid = 25 petals.

To find the total number of petals on the daisies, we multiply the number of daisies by the number of petals per daisy: 4 daisies * 10 petals/daisy = 40 petals.

Now, we subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies to find the difference: 40 petals (daisies) - 25 petals (orchids) = 15 petals.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the percentage of flowering plants, we first need to determine the number of flowering plants. 

There are 100 plants in total. One-fourth of them are indoor plants, which is 100 * (1/4) = 25 plants. 

The remaining plants are 100 - 25 = 75 plants. Two-thirds of these remaining plants are outdoor plants, which is 75 * (2/3) = 50 plants. 

The rest of the remaining plants are flowering plants, which is 75 - 50 = 25 plants.

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100: (25/100) * 100 = 25%.

The final answer is: 25"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the speeds of the whirligig, whatchamacallit, and thingamabob. 

Let's denote the speed of the thingamabob as 'x'. 

Given that a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, its speed can be expressed as 11x.

We are also given that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second. Therefore, we can set up the equation 11x = 121.

To find the speed of the thingamabob, we need to solve for x. 

Dividing both sides of the equation by 11, we get x = 121 / 11 = 11.

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig. Since the whirligig spins at five times the speed of the thingamabog, its speed is 5x = 5 * 11 = 55 meters per second.

The final answer is: 55"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the price of one carrot as 'c'. Since the yogurt is half the price of the salad, the price of the yogurt is $6 / 2 = $3.

Ellen's daily expenses can be represented as 2c (for two carrots) + 6 (for the salad) + 3 (for the yogurt) = 11 (total daily expenses).

Now, we can write the equation: 2c + 6 + 3 = 11.

Combine the constants: 2c + 9 = 11.

Subtract 9 from both sides: 2c = 2.

Divide both sides by 2: c = 1.

The price of one carrot is $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To find Mark's new weekly earnings, we need to calculate his new hourly wage and then multiply it by the number of hours he works in a week.

Mark's original hourly wage was $10. The company raised his pay by $2 per hour, so his new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12.

Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so the total number of hours he works in a week is 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week.

Now, we can calculate Mark's new weekly earnings by multiplying his new hourly wage by the number of hours he works in a week: $12/hour * 40 hours/week = $480/week.

The final answer is: $480"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of times Tasha mowed each lawn. Let's denote the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. 

Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, the number of times she mowed Kamala's lawn is 3x. 

The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, so the number of times she mowed Alba's lawn is 5x.

The total amount Tasha made from mowing lawns is $6 per lawn. Therefore, the total amount she made from mowing lawns is 6x + 6(3x) + 6(5x) = 6x + 18x + 30x = 54x.

We know that Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. Since we have the total amount she made from mowing lawns, we can set up the equation 54x + y = 80, where y is the amount she made from lemonade sales.

We also know that she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn, which is 6x. Since she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn, we can set up the equation 6x = 6.

Solving for x, we get x = 1.

Now that we know x, we can substitute it into the equation 54x + y = 80 to find the value of y. 

54(1) + y = 80
54 + y = 80
y = 26

"To find Harry's weight, we need to determine the weight of Christian first, then subtract 5 kg from it.

Martin's weight is 55 kg. 
Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so Carl's weight is 55 + 16 = 71 kg.
Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight is 71 + 8 = 79 kg.
Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight is 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

"To calculate John's profit, we need to first calculate his total revenue from renting out his car. 

He rents his car 10 times a month for 3 hours each time, so the total hours he rents his car per month is 10 * 3 = 30 hours.

His hourly rate is $25, so his total revenue is 30 hours * $25/hour = $750.

His car payment is $500, so his profit is his total revenue minus his car payment: $750 - $500 = $250.

The final answer is: $250"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many notebooks Martha had initially. Since she bought 5 more notebooks to reach a total of 7, we can set up an equation to find her initial number of notebooks.

Let's denote Martha's initial number of notebooks as M. We know that after buying 5 more notebooks, she had 7. So, we can write the equation as:

M + 5 = 7

Subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation gives us:

M = 2

Now that we know Martha had 2 notebooks initially, we can find out how many notebooks Joseph had. We are told that Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha. So, we can write an equation for Joseph's notebooks as:

Joseph's notebooks = 3 * Martha's notebooks
= 3 * 2
= 6

Now that we know both Martha and Joseph's initial number of notebooks, we can find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph. We subtract Joseph's notebooks from Martha's:

Martha's notebooks - Joseph's notebooks = 7 - 6
= 1

So, Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph."
"To find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we first need to determine the distance rowed by Anis. 

Dijana rowed 50 miles. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. To find 1/5 of Dijana's distance, we multiply 50 by 1/5, which is 10 miles. 

Since Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, we add the 1/5 of Dijana's distance to Dijana's distance. So, Anis rowed 50 + 10 = 60 miles.

Now, we add the distances rowed by Dijana and Anis to find the total distance. The total distance is 50 + 60 = 110 miles.

The final answer is: 110"
"To find out how many cookies each of Susan's nephews will get, we first need to determine the total number of cookies available after her husband took some. Initially, Susan had 100 cookies. Her husband took 4 cookies, so the remaining number of cookies is 100 - 4 = 96.

Since Susan wants to divide the cookies equally among her 6 nephews, we need to divide the remaining cookies by 6. 

96 ÷ 6 = 16

So, each of Susan's nephews will get 16 cookies."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many pages Denise read today and then compare it to Daniel's total pages read.

Yesterday, Daniel read 13 pages. Today, he read 0 pages.

Denise read 10 pages yesterday. Today, she read 5 more than Daniel's pages from yesterday, which is 5 + 13 = 18 pages.

So, Denise read a total of 10 + 18 = 28 pages. Daniel read a total of 13 pages.

The difference between Denise's and Daniel's pages read is 28 - 13 = 15.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of bowls that can be filled with the leftover soup and then divide that by the number of child-sized bowls.

Since the pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls, we can assume that the capacity of the pot is equivalent to 8 child bowls.

Calvin, his wife, and their two children will eat a total of 3 adult bowls (since Calvin and his wife are adults, and each child is equivalent to 1/2 an adult bowl). 

Since 1 adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls, 3 adult bowls will be equivalent to 6 child bowls.

The leftover soup will be enough to fill 8 - 6 = 2 child bowls.

Since each child will eat one bowl at a meal, the leftover soup will be enough for each child to have 2 bowls for lunch.

"To determine the amount of material needed, we need to calculate the total material required for small and large masks separately and then add them together.

For small masks, Jo needs 2 yards of material to make 4 masks. To find out how much material is needed for 20 small masks, we can set up a proportion:

2 yards / 4 masks = x yards / 20 masks

Cross-multiplying, we get:
2 * 20 = 4x
40 = 4x
x = 40 / 4
x = 10 yards

So, Jo needs 10 yards of material to make 20 small masks.

For large masks, Jo needs 2.25 yards of material to make 3 masks. To find out how much material is needed for 8 large masks, we can set up a proportion:

2.25 yards / 3 masks = x yards / 8 masks

Cross-multiplying, we get:
2.25 * 8 = 3x
18 = 3x
x = 18 / 3
x = 6 yards

So, Jo needs 6 yards of material to make 8 large masks.

To find the total amount of material needed, we add the material required for small and large masks:
10 yards (small) + 6 yards (large) = 16 yards

"To find Harold's free time, we need to calculate the total time he spends on activities and subtract that from the total hours in a day (24 hours).

Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night. 
He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for 10 - 2 = 8 hours a day.
He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Total time spent on activities = 10 (sleep) + 8 (work) + 1 (walking the dog) = 19 hours

Free time = Total hours in a day - Total time spent on activities
Free time = 24 - 19
Free time = 5 hours

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many red shoeboxes Tim used for fishing. Since he used 1/3 of his red shoeboxes, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of red shoeboxes = 9
Fraction used = 1/3
Number of red shoeboxes used = 9 * (1/3) = 3

Now, we know that Tim used 3 blue shoeboxes and 3 red shoeboxes for fishing. So, we subtract these from the total number of blue and red shoeboxes:

Initial blue shoeboxes = 7
Initial red shoeboxes = 9
Blue shoeboxes left = 7 - 3 = 4
Red shoeboxes left = 9 - 3 = 6

Therefore, Tim has 4 blue shoeboxes and 6 red shoeboxes left.

"To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we need to first calculate the number of marbles he gave away to Jamie and Donald.

Dean gives 1/5 of his marbles to Jamie. Since Dean has 30 marbles, we can calculate the number of marbles he gave to Jamie as follows:

1/5 of 30 = (1/5) * 30 = 6 marbles

So, Dean gave 6 marbles to Jamie.

Dean also gave 10 marbles to Donald.

In total, Dean gave away 6 + 10 = 16 marbles.

To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we subtract the number of marbles he gave away from the total number of marbles he had:

30 (initial marbles) - 16 (marbles given away) = 14 marbles

Therefore, Dean has 14 marbles left.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Duncan's current age as D and Adam's current age as A.

We are given that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. This can be expressed as:

D - 8 = 2(A - 4)

We are also given that Duncan's current age is 60. So, we can substitute D = 60 into the equation:

60 - 8 = 2(A - 4)

Simplifying the equation:

52 = 2(A - 4)

Divide both sides by 2:

26 = A - 4

Add 4 to both sides:

30 = A

So, Adam's current age is 30.

To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

30 + 8 = 38

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes to complete an extreme sudoku puzzle and then calculate how many half-hour intervals fit into that time. 

A normal sudoku puzzle takes 45 minutes, and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long. So, the time it takes to complete an extreme sudoku is 45 * 4 = 180 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we need to find out how many half-hour intervals fit into 180 minutes. There are 2 half-hour intervals in 1 hour, so in 180 minutes, there are 180 / 30 = 6 hours. 

However, we need to find the number of half-hour intervals, not hours. Since there are 2 half-hour intervals in 1 hour, we multiply 6 hours by 2 to get 12 half-hour intervals.

Therefore, John drinks 12 bottles of water in the time it takes to complete an extreme sudoku puzzle.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of yellow balloons as 'y'. We know that Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces at each yellow balloon. Since there are 20 red balloons, the total number of bologna pieces thrown at red balloons is 2 * 20 = 40. 

The total number of bologna pieces thrown at all balloons is 58. The number of bologna pieces thrown at yellow balloons is 3y. Therefore, the equation becomes: 40 + 3y = 58.

To solve for y, we subtract 40 from both sides of the equation: 3y = 58 - 40, which simplifies to 3y = 18. 

Now, we divide both sides of the equation by 3 to find the value of y: y = 18 / 3, which simplifies to y = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find out how many tune-ups Jon needs in a 30-day month, we need to calculate the total miles driven in that time period. 

Since Jon drives 100 miles a day, the total miles driven in 30 days is 100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles.

Given that Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we can divide the total miles driven by the interval between tune-ups to find out how many tune-ups are needed.

3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3 tune-ups.

Therefore, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in a 30-day month.

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total amount of money spent on the cake, balloons, and ice cream. 

The cost of the cake is $11. 
The cost of 1 dozen balloons is $0.5 for 2 balloons. Since 1 dozen is 12, we can calculate the cost of 1 balloon as $0.5 / 2 = $0.25. Therefore, the cost of 12 balloons is 12 * $0.25 = $3. 
The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

The total cost of the items purchased is $11 + $3 + $14 = $28.

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowance to buy these items, the total amount of money they had is $28. 

Let's assume the amount of allowance each girl received is x. Since they combined their allowance, the total amount of money they had is 2x. 

We can set up the equation 2x = 28 to represent the situation. 

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2: x = 28 / 2 = 14.

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14.

"To find the total profit made by the class, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

First, let's calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class. Since each student sold 10 lollipops on average, and there are 30 students, the total number of lollipops sold is:

Total lollipops sold = 10 lollipops/student * 30 students = 300 lollipops

The total revenue is the total number of lollipops sold multiplied by the selling price of each lollipop:

Total revenue = 300 lollipops * $0.8/lollipop = $240

The total cost is the total number of lollipops sold multiplied by the cost of each lollipop:

Total cost = 300 lollipops * $0.5/lollipop = $150

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $240 - $150 = $90

Therefore, the class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops.

$90"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 * 7 = 21 fish.
5. He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

Now, let's add up the total number of pets Larry has: 3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47.

Since she started collecting shells at 5 years old and we want to know the total by her 10th birthday, we need to consider the months from her 5th birthday to her 10th birthday.

There are 12 months in a year. From her 5th birthday to her 10th birthday, Martha would have been 5 years old for 1 year, 6 years old for 1 year, 7 years old for 1 year, 8 years old for 1 year, and 9 years old for 1 year. 

So, the total number of months is 5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months.

Since Martha collects one shell every month, the total number of shells she has collected by her 10th birthday is equal to the total number of months she has been collecting shells, which is 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many cups of tea are in each row. Since Lana divides the 27 cups into 3 rows, we can divide 27 by 3 to get the number of cups in each row.

27 cups / 3 rows = 9 cups per row

Since Lana creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, the total number of mint tea cups in each row is half of the total cups in each row.

9 cups per row / 2 = 4.5 cups of mint tea per row

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a cup, we can assume that Lana must have made a whole number of cups of mint tea in each row. This means that the 4.5 cups of mint tea per row must be rounded down to 4 cups of mint tea per row, as she cannot make a fraction of a cup.

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip. 

Let's denote the number of berries picked up per trip as 'x'. Since the sloth takes 4 hours for a round trip, he can make 8/4 = 2 trips in 8 hours. 

Since he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, and he makes 2 trips, the total number of berries he picks up in 8 hours is 2x. 

We can set up the equation 2x = 24 to find the minimum number of berries he can pick up per trip. 

Solving for x, we get x = 24/2 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the initial amount of water in the tank and then calculate the remaining water after 6 days.

First, Anthony and his father fill the tank with half the amount of water in the pool. Since there are 10,000 gallons of water in the pool, half of that is 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 gallons.

Next, we need to calculate the amount of water used from the tank over 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so over 6 days, the total amount of water used is 500 * 6 = 3,000 gallons.

To find the remaining water in the tank, we subtract the amount used from the initial amount: 5,000 - 3,000 = 2,000 gallons.

The final answer is: 2000"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the remaining budget Colby has for the last day of the month. 

Colby's initial budget is $150. He has already spent money on:

- 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays: 5 * $10 = $50
- 8 movies on other days: 8 * $7 = $56
- 2 tubs of popcorn: 2 * $8 = $16
- 4 boxes of candy: 4 * $2 = $8

Total spent so far: $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130

Remaining budget: $150 - $130 = $20

Since Colby wants to buy a popcorn and a box of candy, he will spend $8 + $2 = $10 on these items.

Remaining budget after buying popcorn and candy: $20 - $10 = $10

Now, we need to find out how many movies he can see with the remaining budget. 

Tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10, and he has $10 left. He can see 1 movie on a Friday or Saturday.

Tickets for other days cost $7, and he has $10 left. He can see 1 movie on an other day.

However, since it's the last day of the month and it's a Friday, he can only see 1 movie.

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the total calories of the pastries, we first need to calculate the calories of each type of mini pastry. 

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, so the calories of a mini cinnamon roll are 600 * (1/3) = 200 calories.

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, so the calories of a mini blueberry muffin are 450 * (1/3) = 150 calories.

Now, we can calculate the total calories of each type of pastry. The total calories of the mini cinnamon rolls are 200 * 200 = 40,000 calories. The total calories of the mini blueberry muffins are 150 * 300 = 45,000 calories.

The total calories of all the pastries are the sum of the calories of the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins, which is 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories.

The final answer is: 85000"
"To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed and then divide it by the number of days.

On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday, she removed twice as many as Monday, so 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs.
On Wednesday, she removed twice as many as Tuesday, so 2 * 78 = 156 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 78 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 378

There are 5 days in total. 

Average number of Junebugs removed per day = Total Junebugs removed / Number of days
= 378 / 5
= 75.6

The final answer is: 75.6"
"To find the distance traveled by the bus, we multiply its speed by the time it traveled: 60 miles/hour * 5 hours = 300 miles.

To find the distance traveled by the car, we multiply its speed by the time it traveled: 30 miles/hour * 8 hours = 240 miles.

Now, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus to find the difference: 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles.

The bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find the number of bouncy balls, we need to subtract the total number of toys Sophie had before buying the bouncy balls from the total number of toys she has now. 

Initially, Sophie had 31 blocks and 8 stuffed animals, which gives us a total of 31 + 8 = 39 toys. 

Adding the 9 multicolored rings to this total, we get 39 + 9 = 48 toys.

Now, we know that after buying the bouncy balls, Sophie has a total of 62 toys. To find the number of bouncy balls, we subtract the total number of toys before buying the bouncy balls from the total number of toys after buying the bouncy balls: 62 - 48 = 14.

The final answer is: 14"
"Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as p, and John's age as j. We are given the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old. However, there is no information about Jean's age, so we will ignore this statement for now.
2. Paul is 10 years older than John, so p = j + 10.
3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age, so P = p + j.

From statement 2, we can express p in terms of j: p = j + 10.

Substituting p = j + 10 into statement 3, we get P = (j + 10) + j = 2j + 10.

Now, we have two equations:

1. P = 2j + 10
2. p = j + 10

We can substitute p = j + 10 into the first equation:

P = 2j + 10
P = 2(j + 10)
P = 2j + 20

Now we have P = 2j + 20 and p = j + 10. However, we still need to find the value of P. We can use the fact that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old. However, we don't have any information about Jean's age, so we will ignore this statement.

We can use the fact that p = j + 10 to express p in terms of P:

p = (P - 20)/2 (from P = 2j + 20 and p = j + 10)

Now we have two equations:

1. P = 2j + 20
2. p = (P - 20)/2

We can substitute p = (P - 20)/2 into the first equation:

P = 2j + 20
(P - 20)/2 = j + 10

Multiply both sides by 2:

P - 20 = 2j + 20
P - 20 = 2j + 20
P - 40 = 2j
P = 2j + 40

Now we have two equations:

1. P = 2j + 20
2. P = 2j + 40

Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:

0 = 20

This is a contradiction, which means that the initial assumption that we can ignore the statement about Jean's age is incorrect. However, we can use the fact that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old to find the value of P.

Let's denote Jean's age as J. We can write the equation:

P + p + J = 100

Substituting p = j + 10 and P = 2j + 20, we get:

2j + 20 + j + 10 + J = 100

Combine like terms:

3j + 30 + J = 100

Subtract 30 from both sides:

3j + J = 70

Now we have two equations:

1. 3j + J = 70
2. p = j + 10

We can substitute p = j + 10 into the first equation:

3j + J = 70
3j + (j + 10) = 70

Combine like terms:

4j + 10 = 70

Subtract 10 from both sides:

4j = 60

Divide both sides by 4:

j = 15

Now we can find the value of p:

p = j + 10
p = 15 + 10
p = 25

Now we can find the value of P:

P = 2j + 20
P = 2(15) + 20
P = 30 + 20
P = 50

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To find the total number of balloons, we need to calculate the initial number of balloons and then add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, Maria had 1 water balloon, and each of her 4 friends had 2 water balloons. So, the total number of balloons initially is:
1 (Maria's balloon) + (4 friends * 2 balloons per friend) = 1 + 8 = 9 balloons

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional balloons is:
5 people * 3 balloons per person = 15 balloons

Now, we add the initial number of balloons to the additional balloons:
9 (initial balloons) + 15 (additional balloons) = 24 balloons

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the total number of boxes of stuff, we need to add the boxes donated by the people and the boxes they already have. 

10 people donate 5 boxes each, so the total number of boxes donated is 10 * 5 = 50 boxes.

They already have 10 boxes, so the total number of boxes is 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

Since they can fit 2 boxes per table, the total number of tables needed is 60 / 2 = 30 tables.

However, they already own 15 tables, so the number of new tables they need is 30 - 15 = 15 tables.

"To find the average total distance spat, we need to calculate the total distance spat by each person and then divide it by the total number of seeds spat.

Zoey spits 40 seeds, each 10 feet, so the total distance spat by Zoey is 40 * 10 = 400 feet.

Sydney spits 35 seeds, each 12 feet, so the total distance spat by Sydney is 35 * 12 = 420 feet.

The total distance spat by both Zoey and Sydney is 400 + 420 = 820 feet.

The total number of seeds spat is 40 + 35 = 75.

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the total distance spat by the total number of seeds spat: 820 / 75 = 10.93 (rounded to two decimal places).

The final answer is: 10.93"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine in a month and then find the difference in revenue.

First, let's calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine in a month:

WidgetMaster 9000: 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets

Next, let's calculate the revenue generated by each machine in a month:

Widgeteer 3000: 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200
WidgetMaster 9000: 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

"To determine how much money Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his stay with the two options and then find the difference.

Option 1: 24-hour stay - The hotel charges 1600 pesos for a 24-hour stay.

Option 2: 12-hour stay + additional hours - Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours. The 12-hour stay costs 1000 pesos, and the additional 5 hours (17 - 12 = 5) will cost 5 * 70 = 350 pesos. So, the total cost for this option is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

Now, let's calculate the amount of money Cameron would save by choosing the second option: 
Savings = Cost of Option 1 - Cost of Option 2
Savings = 1600 - 1350
Savings = 250 pesos

"To find the total amount of hay needed, we first need to determine the amount each sheep needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds and each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, we can calculate the amount each sheep needs as follows:

Each goat needs 5 pounds, so twice that amount is 5 * 2 = 10 pounds. Three pounds less than that is 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep separately. There are 15 goats, each needing 5 pounds, so the total for the goats is 15 * 5 = 75 pounds. There are 12 sheep, each needing 7 pounds, so the total for the sheep is 12 * 7 = 84 pounds.

The total amount of hay needed is the sum of the hay needed for the goats and the sheep, which is 75 + 84 = 159 pounds.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the pencils: 
5 pencils * 10 dollars/pencil = 50 dollars

Now, let's subtract John's gas expenses and the cost of the pencils from his total earnings: 
300 dollars - 50 dollars - 50 dollars = 200 dollars

John wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so we subtract that from his remaining money:

"To find the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself, we first need to determine the total number of bottles she gives to the students. 

The teacher has 29 students and gives each student 2 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles given to the students is 29 * 2 = 58 bottles.

The teacher has 9 coupons, each redeemable for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles she can redeem is 9 * 100 = 900 bottles.

However, since she only needs 58 bottles for the students, she will only redeem 58 bottles from the coupons. The remaining bottles will be 900 - 58 = 842 bottles.

Therefore, the teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice for herself.

"To find the total amount Patty charged, we need to calculate the labor cost and add it to the cost of parts. 

First, let's calculate the labor cost. The job took 2.25 hours, and the labor rate is $35 per hour. Since the labor rate is charged per hour or part thereof, we need to round up to the nearest hour for the labor cost. However, in this case, 2.25 hours is less than 3 hours, so we can simply multiply 2.25 hours by the labor rate.

Labor cost = 2.25 hours * $35/hour = $78.75

Next, we add the cost of parts, which is $60.

Total cost = Labor cost + Cost of parts
Total cost = $78.75 + $60
Total cost = $138.75

Therefore, Patty charged $138.75 for the job.

"To find out how much James spent on the CDs, we first need to calculate the original price of the CDs and then subtract the discount. 

The original price of 10 CDs at $15 each is 10 * $15 = $150.

Since James gets a 40% discount, we need to find 40% of $150. 
40% of $150 = 0.4 * $150 = $60.

The discounted price of the CDs is $150 - $60 = $90.

James decides to sell 5 CDs for $40 each. 
The total amount he gets from selling the CDs is 5 * $40 = $200.

However, he spent $90 on the CDs, and he got $200 from selling 5 of them. To find out how much money he was out, we need to subtract the amount he got from the amount he spent. 

But first, we need to find out how much he spent on the 5 CDs he sold. 
The original price of 5 CDs at $15 each is 5 * $15 = $75.

Since he got a 40% discount, we need to find 40% of $75. 
40% of $75 = 0.4 * $75 = $30.

The amount he spent on the 5 CDs is $75 - $30 = $45.

Now, we can find out how much money he was out. 
He spent $90 on the CDs and got $200 from selling 5 of them, but he spent $45 on those 5 CDs. 
So, the amount he was out is $90 - ($200 - $45) = $90 - $155 = -$65.

However, since we can't be out a negative amount of money, this means he actually made a profit of $65.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's calculate the time James takes to swim 60% of the distance. The total distance is 20 miles, and 60% of that is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles. 

Since James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time taken to swim 12 miles is 12 / 2 = 6 hours.

After swimming 12 miles, James rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

Now, James has to swim the remaining 20 - 12 = 8 miles. However, he swims at half the speed, which is 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour. The time taken to swim the remaining 8 miles is 8 / 1 = 8 hours.

The total time taken is the sum of the swimming time, resting time, and the time taken to swim the remaining distance: 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.

"To solve this problem, we can start by using the information that Deanna is 26 years old. We know that Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, so we can calculate Marcus's age as follows:

Marcus's age = Deanna's age - 5
Marcus's age = 26 - 5
Marcus's age = 21

We are also given that Marcus is half of Leo's age. Let's represent Leo's age as 'L'. We can set up an equation based on this information:

Marcus's age = L / 2
21 = L / 2

To find Leo's age, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

L = 21 * 2
L = 42

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old.

The final answer is: 42"
"To find out how many points Azibo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Bahati and Dinar. 

Let's denote the points scored by Dinar as x. Since Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, Bahati's points can be represented as x + 10. 

We are also given that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo. Therefore, Azibo's points can be represented as (x + 10) - 20 = x - 10.

The total points scored by the team is 45, which is the sum of the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar. We can write this as an equation:

x + (x + 10) + (x - 10) = 45

Combine like terms:

3x = 45

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 15

Now that we know Dinar scored 15 points, we can find Azibo's points by substituting x into the expression for Azibo's points:

Azibo's points = x - 10
= 15 - 10
= 5

"To find the total number of reports Vince stapled, we need to calculate the total time he spent stapling reports and then multiply it by his stapling rate.

First, let's find the total time Vince spent stapling reports. He stapled from 8:00 AM until 11:00 PM, which is a total of 15 hours.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can multiply 15 hours by 60 to get the total minutes:

15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Now, we know that Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many sets of 15 minutes are in 900 minutes, we can divide 900 by 15:

900 minutes / 15 minutes = 60 sets

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we can multiply the number of sets by his stapling rate:

60 sets * 30 reports/set = 1800 reports

Therefore, Vince stapled a total of 1800 reports.

The final answer is: 1800"
"To find the total time Kim slept on her bed, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m., which is a total of 8 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she usually sleeps for 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, that day she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 5:55 a.m. instead of 6 a.m. This means she slept from 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m., which is a total of 7 hours and 55 minutes. Converting this to minutes, we get 7 * 60 + 55 = 455 minutes.

Now, we need to subtract the time she was sleepwalking, which was from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. This is a total of 23 minutes.

So, the total time she slept on her bed that day is 455 - 23 = 432 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of measuring spoons Jonathan initially has. Since he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, and he has two dozen cups, we can calculate the number of measuring spoons as follows:

Two dozen cups is equal to 2 x 12 = 24 cups.

Since Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, we can multiply the number of cups by 2/3 to find the number of measuring spoons:

Measuring spoons = 24 cups * (2/3) = 16 spoons

Now, Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so we need to subtract 6 from the initial number of measuring spoons to find the remaining number of measuring spoons:

Remaining measuring spoons = 16 - 6 = 10

Since Jonathan has 24 measuring cups and 10 measuring spoons, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

Total utensils = 24 (measuring cups) + 10 (measuring spoons) = 34

The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 of them are occupied. 

1/5 of 1000 is 100, so 100 beds are occupied initially.

Each day, 50 patients are admitted into the hospital. Since there are 7 days in a week, in 2 weeks, there will be 14 days.

In 14 days, 50 patients are admitted each day, so the total number of patients admitted in 14 days is 50 * 14 = 700.

Initially, there were 100 occupied beds, and 700 more patients were admitted in 14 days. So, the total number of occupied beds after 14 days is 100 + 700 = 800.

The total capacity of the hospital is 1000 beds, and 800 beds are occupied. Therefore, the number of unoccupied beds is 1000 - 800 = 200.

The final answer is: 200"
"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we first need to determine the number of non-work emails she sends. 

Robyn sends 16 emails a day, and 7 of them are work emails. So, the number of non-work emails is 16 - 7 = 9.

Two-thirds of the remainder (non-work emails) are to family. This means 2/3 * 9 = 6 emails are to family. 

The remaining non-work emails (after subtracting the ones to family) are to her boyfriend. Since 6 emails are to family, the number of emails to her boyfriend is 9 - 6 = 3.

The final answer is: 3"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Shawna's age, and then use that to find her father's age.

Given that Aliya is 3 years old, and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, we can find Shawna's age by multiplying Aliya's age by 3.

Shawna's age = 3 * Aliya's age
Shawna's age = 3 * 3
Shawna's age = 9

Now that we know Shawna's age, we can find her father's age by multiplying Shawna's age by 5.

Shawna's father's age = 5 * Shawna's age
Shawna's father's age = 5 * 9
Shawna's father's age = 45

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number reported by Courtney and subtract it from her total.

Let's denote the actual number of people as 'x'. Since Courtney overestimated by 20%, we can express her reported number as x + 20% of x.

We know that Courtney reported 48 people, so we can set up the equation:

x + 0.20x = 48

Combine like terms:

1.20x = 48

Now, divide both sides by 1.20 to solve for x:

x = 48 / 1.20
x = 40

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the relationships between the number of balls each boy carried. Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as x.

Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jason carried 2x balls.

Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried 2(2x) = 4x balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls each of them carried: x + 2x + 4x = 7x.

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so we can set up the equation 2x = 2 to solve for x.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 1.

Now that we know x = 1, we can find the total number of balls carried by the boys: 7x = 7(1) = 7.

However, this is the number of balls carried by the boys, not the total number of balls the coach brought to practice. Since the boys carried all the balls in one trip, the total number of balls the coach brought to practice is equal to the number of balls the boys carried.

Therefore, the total number of balls the coach brought to practice is 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of holes dug on the first day as H1 = 10, on the second day as H2 = 13, and on the third day as H3 = 8. However, we know that the pirates filled in 2 holes on the third day, so the actual number of holes at the end of the third day is H3 - 2 = 6.

We are given that the island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. This means the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 4 * H1 = 4 * 10 = 40.

We also know that the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is the sum of the holes dug on the first three days and the holes dug on the fourth day. Since the pirates filled in 2 holes on the third day, the total number of holes at the end of the third day is H1 + H2 + (H3 - 2) = 10 + 13 + 6 = 29.

Now, we can set up an equation to find the number of holes dug on the fourth day (H4). The total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 40, which is equal to the sum of the holes dug on the first three days and the holes dug on the fourth day: 29 + H4 = 40.

To find H4, we can subtract 29 from both sides of the equation: H4 = 40 - 29 = 11.

Therefore, the pirates dug 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.

The final answer is: 11"
"Let's denote the number of corn chips that Amora and Lainey got as 'x'. Since Collins got 15 more corn chips than the others, Collins got x + 15 corn chips.

We are given that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, so we can set up the equation:

x = 70

Since Collins got x + 15 corn chips, we can set up the equation for the total number of corn chips as:

x + (x + 15) + x = total number of corn chips

Substituting x = 70 into the equation, we get:

70 + (70 + 15) + 70 = total number of corn chips

Combine like terms:

70 + 85 + 70 = total number of corn chips

225 = total number of corn chips

The final answer is: 225"
"To find the cost of travel, we first need to determine the cost of the supplies, which is given as $400. 

Since the tickets for travel cost 50% more than the supplies, we need to calculate 50% of $400 and add it to the cost of the supplies.

50% of $400 is calculated as 0.5 * $400 = $200.

Now, we add this to the cost of the supplies: $400 + $200 = $600.

Therefore, the cost of travel is $600.

The final answer is: $600"
"To solve this problem, we can start by assigning variables to the number of Pokémon each person has caught. Let's say Adelwolfe has caught x Pokémon. Since Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe, Stan has caught 4x - 13 Pokémon. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so Alex has caught (4x - 13) + 5 = 4x - 8 Pokémon.

We know that the total number of Pokémon caught by all three is 339, so we can set up the equation:

x + (4x - 13) + (4x - 8) = 339

Combine like terms:

9x - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:

9x = 360

Divide by 9:

x = 40

Now that we know Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokémon, we can find out how many Stan has caught:

Stan has caught 4x - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 Pokémon.

The final answer is: 147"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of episodes and then multiply it by the length of each episode.

Let's denote the number of episodes as 'e'. According to the problem, there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. Since each episode is 20 minutes long, we can set up the equation:

e = 20 / 2
e = 10

So, there are 10 episodes in total.

Now, we need to find the total time John will spend watching the show. We can do this by multiplying the number of episodes by the length of each episode:

Total time = e * 20
Total time = 10 * 20
Total time = 200

The final answer is: 200"
"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in the southerly direction and then add it to the distance traveled in the northerly direction.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled in the southerly direction for the first 10 hours at 30 miles per hour:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 10 hours
Distance = 300 miles

Then, the bird flies towards the north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour. Since this is in the opposite direction, we subtract this distance from the previous distance:

Distance traveled in the southerly direction = 300 miles
Distance traveled in the northerly direction = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours = 36 miles
Net distance traveled in the southerly direction = 300 miles - 36 miles = 264 miles

Finally, the bird flies towards the south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour. We add this distance to the net distance traveled in the southerly direction:

Net distance traveled in the southerly direction = 264 miles
Distance traveled in the final southerly direction = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours = 110 miles
Total distance = 264 miles + 110 miles = 374 miles

The final answer is: 374"
"To find the total number of brownies Greta had left over, we need to calculate the total number of brownies she received and subtract the number of brownies eaten.

Greta made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies for herself, which is 12 brownies. 

At her office, she received 1/2 a dozen brownies, which is 6 brownies. 

Her friends brought 4 dozen brownies, which is 48 brownies.

In total, Greta received 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies.

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies.

To find the number of brownies left over, we subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies received: 66 - 18 = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the total age of all three family members, we need to determine the age of Nani's brother and sister.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 2 * 8 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means her age is 75% of Nani's age. To find 75% of Nani's age, we multiply his age by 0.75: 8 * 0.75 = 6 years.

Now, we have the ages of all three family members: Nani (8 years), his brother (16 years), and his sister (6 years). 

The total age of all three family members is 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

The final answer is: 30"

3 racquets * 15 minutes per racquet = 45 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time spent on polyester stringing:
5 racquets * 22 minutes per racquet = 110 minutes

Now, let's calculate the time spent on hybrid stringing:
4 racquets * 18 minutes per racquet = 72 minutes

Finally, let's add up the time spent on each type of stringing:
45 minutes + 110 minutes + 72 minutes = 227 minutes

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first two phones and the cost of the remaining phones. 

The first two phones cost the full price of $600 each, so the total cost for the first two phones is 2 * $600 = $1200.

The remaining phones are 2 (for the kids and the wife), and each of these phones is half the price of the first two, which is $600 / 2 = $300.

The total cost for the remaining phones is 2 * $300 = $600.

The total cost for all phones is the sum of the cost of the first two phones and the cost of the remaining phones: $1200 + $600 = $1800.

"To find the total number of players in both teams, we first need to determine the number of players on Zeke's team. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, and Carlton's team has 13 players, we can calculate the number of players on Zeke's team by adding 7 to 13.

Number of players on Zeke's team = 13 + 7 = 20

Now, to find the total number of players in both teams combined, we add the number of players on Zeke's team to the number of players on Carlton's team.

Total number of players = Number of players on Zeke's team + Number of players on Carlton's team
Total number of players = 20 + 13
Total number of players = 33

"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2l + 2w, where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the dimensions of the fence, we can plug in the values: l = 15 feet and w = 10 feet.

P = 2(15) + 2(10)
P = 30 + 20
P = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

Total slats needed = 50 * 2
Total slats needed = 100

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington had initially. Since she bought 12 boxes of oranges, and each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges she had is:

12 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 240 oranges

Then, she gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes each, which is a total of 4 boxes. Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges she gave away is:

4 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 80 oranges

So, the number of oranges she had left is:

240 oranges - 80 oranges = 160 oranges

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges, which is:

160 oranges * 1/4 = 40 oranges

She sold the rest, which is:

160 oranges - 40 oranges = 120 oranges

Therefore, Mrs. Harrington sold 120 oranges.

"To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books. 

The total cost of the books is the sum of the cost of the dictionary, the dinosaur book, and the children's cookbook. 

Total cost = $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39

Since Tyler has already saved $14 from his allowance, we need to subtract this from the total cost to find out how much more he needs to earn.

Amount needed to earn = Total cost - Amount saved = $39 - $14 = $25

Now, we can calculate the number of hours Tyler needs to work by dividing the amount he needs to earn by his hourly wage.

Number of hours = Amount needed to earn / Hourly wage = $25 / $5 = 5 hours

Therefore, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford his books.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of cherries Richard has. Since Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, and Robert has 30 cherries, we can set up an equation to find Richard's share:

Robert's cherries = Richard's cherries + 10
30 = Richard's cherries + 10
Richard's cherries = 30 - 10
Richard's cherries = 20

Now that we know Richard has 20 cherries, we can find Jerry's share. The total number of cherries is 60, and we know Robert and Richard's shares, so we can subtract their shares from the total to find Jerry's share:

Jerry's cherries = Total cherries - (Robert's cherries + Richard's cherries)
Jerry's cherries = 60 - (30 + 20)
Jerry's cherries = 60 - 50
Jerry's cherries = 10

Now that we know Jerry has 10 cherries, we can find the difference between Robert's and Jerry's shares:

Difference = Robert's cherries - Jerry's cherries
Difference = 30 - 10
Difference = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many boxes of gingerbread and apple pie Sunny sold on both days and then calculate the total earnings.

Let's denote the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday as G and the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday as A.

We know that on Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread, so G = 10.

We also know that on Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday, and on Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie. Therefore, A = 15 - 4 = 11.

On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday is G + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15.

Now, we can calculate the total earnings for both days.

The total earnings from gingerbread on Saturday is 10 * $6 = $60.
The total earnings from apple pie on Saturday is 11 * $15 = $165.
The total earnings from gingerbread on Sunday is 15 * $6 = $90.
The total earnings from apple pie on Sunday is 15 * $15 = $225.

The total earnings for both days is $60 + $165 + $90 + $225 = $480.

"To determine the total amount of sunscreen needed, we need to calculate the total number of ounces Pamela will use over the 8-day period. 

Since she reapplies sunscreen every hour and will be outside for 4 hours a day, she will reapply sunscreen 4 times a day. 

Over 8 days, she will reapply sunscreen 4 times/day * 8 days = 32 times.

Since each application is 1 ounce, she will need 32 ounces of sunscreen.

Each bottle contains 8 ounces, so to find out how many bottles she needs, we divide the total ounces needed by the ounces per bottle: 32 ounces / 8 ounces/bottle = 4 bottles.

Therefore, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Let E be Emil's current age, D be his dad's current age, and B be his brother's current age. 

We know that Emil is 19 years old now, so E = 19. 

When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad, so 24 = 0.5D. 

We can solve for D by multiplying both sides by 2: 2 * 24 = D, which gives D = 48.

When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother, so 24 = 2B. 

We can solve for B by dividing both sides by 2: 24 / 2 = B, which gives B = 12.

Now that we have the current ages of Emil's dad and brother, we can find the sum of their ages: D + B = 48 + 12 = 60.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount of Thursday's catch, which is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.

On Saturday, he caught half the amount of Friday's catch, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the total amount of crawfish caught: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can find the total number of servings by dividing the total amount of crawfish by the serving size: 21 / 3 = 7.

"To find the number of students leaving early, we first need to determine the number of football players, cheerleaders, and band members.

First, let's find the number of football players. 20% of 30 students are football players. 

20% of 30 = 0.20 * 30 = 6

So, there are 6 football players.

Next, we need to find the number of remaining students. Since 6 students are football players, the remaining students are 30 - 6 = 24.

Now, 25% of the remaining 24 students are cheerleaders or part of the band.

25% of 24 = 0.25 * 24 = 6

So, there are 6 cheerleaders or band members.

The total number of students leaving early is the sum of football players and cheerleaders/band members.

Total students leaving early = 6 (football players) + 6 (cheerleaders/band members) = 12

Charlie's boot size = 5 * 5
Charlie's boot size = 25

Now, we can find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie by adding their sizes and dividing by 2:

Average size = (Sophie's boot size + Charlie's boot size) / 2

"To find the total number of plants Pat needs, we first need to calculate the total space available in the flower bed and subtract the space taken up by the existing plants. 

The flower bed is 111 feet long. Since Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between every plant, we need to find the total space taken up by the plants and the spaces between them. 

Let's assume the number of plants is 'n'. The total space taken up by the plants is 12 inches (1 foot) * n. However, we need to convert this to feet to match the units of the flower bed length. Since 1 foot = 12 inches, 12 inches = 1 foot. 

The total space taken up by the spaces between the plants is 1.5 feet * (n - 1), since there are n - 1 spaces between n plants.

The total space available in the flower bed is 111 feet. The total space taken up by the plants and the spaces between them is 1 foot * n + 1.5 feet * (n - 1). 

We can set up the equation: 
111 = 1n + 1.5(n - 1)

Simplifying the equation: 
111 = n + 1.5n - 1.5
111 = 2.5n - 1.5
111 + 1.5 = 2.5n
112.5 = 2.5n
n = 112.5 / 2.5
n = 45

However, Pat already owns 17 flowers. So, the number of additional plants she needs to buy is 45 - 17 = 28.

The cost of each plant is $6. Therefore, the total cost of the additional plants is 28 * $6 = $168.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of petunias: 
Number of petunias per basket = 3
Number of baskets = 5
Total number of petunias = 3 * 5 = 15
Cost of each petunia = $3.00
Total cost of petunias = 15 * $3.00 = $45.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of sweet potato vines:
Number of sweet potato vines per basket = 2
Number of baskets = 5
Total number of sweet potato vines = 2 * 5 = 10
Cost of each sweet potato vine = $2.50
Total cost of sweet potato vines = 10 * $2.50 = $25.00

Now, let's add the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines to find the total cost:
Total cost = Total cost of petunias + Total cost of sweet potato vines

"To find out how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we first need to determine how much soil is left after planting the sunflowers and carnations. 

First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers: 4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds.

Next, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the carnations: 10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds.

Now, let's add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations: 12 pounds + 15 pounds = 27 pounds.

Since the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations is 27 pounds, we subtract this from the total amount of soil: 30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds.

Now, we know that each rose needs 1 pound of soil. To find out how many roses they can plant, we divide the remaining soil by the amount needed for each rose: 3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses.

"To find out how many shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we first need to calculate how much she sets aside each month for shoes. 

Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month and sets 25% of her paycheck aside for shoes. To find 25% of $2,000.00, we multiply $2,000.00 by 0.25 (since 25% is equivalent to 0.25).

$2,000.00 * 0.25 = $500.00

So, Jessica sets aside $500.00 each month for shoes.

Next, we need to find out how many months are in a year. There are 12 months in a year.

Now, we need to calculate how much Jessica can save for shoes in a year. We multiply the monthly savings by the number of months in a year.

$500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00

Since each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, we can find out how many pairs she can buy by dividing the total savings by the cost of one pair.

$6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two separate tasks: peeling and cooking. 

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp a minute, we can divide the total number of shrimp by her peeling rate:

90 shrimp / 6 shrimp per minute = 15 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to cook 90 shrimp. Since she can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we can divide the total number of shrimp by her cooking rate:

90 shrimp / 30 shrimp per 10 minutes = 3 sets of 30 shrimp

Since each set takes 10 minutes, we multiply the number of sets by the cooking time:

3 sets * 10 minutes per set = 30 minutes

However, we need to consider that peeling and cooking are sequential tasks. We can't do them simultaneously. Therefore, we need to add the time it takes for peeling and cooking:

15 minutes (peeling) + 30 minutes (cooking) = 45 minutes

The final answer is: 45"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net change in temperature after the air conditioner has been running and turned off.

First, let's calculate the temperature change when the air conditioner is running on low for 3 hours:

Temperature change on low = -2 degrees/hour * 3 hours = -6 degrees

Next, let's calculate the temperature change when the air conditioner is running on high for 4 hours:

Temperature change on high = -3 degrees/hour * 4 hours = -12 degrees

Now, let's calculate the total temperature change when the air conditioner is running:

Total temperature change while running = -6 degrees + (-12 degrees) = -18 degrees

The air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours, and during this time, the room warmed up at 2 degrees/hour:

Temperature change while off = 2 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 4 degrees

Now, let's calculate the net temperature change:

Net temperature change = Total temperature change while running + Temperature change while off
= -18 degrees + 4 degrees
= -14 degrees

Since the net temperature change is -14 degrees, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the age of Bill's father when Bill saw the comet for the second time. 

Let's denote the age of Bill's father when he saw the comet as 'x'. Since Bill saw the comet when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet, Bill's age at that time is 3x.

We are given that Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. This means that the time elapsed between the two sightings is a multiple of the comet's orbital period, which is 75 years.

Since Bill's age at the second sighting is 3x, and his father's age at the first sighting is x, the time elapsed between the two sightings is 3x - x = 2x.

We know that 2x is a multiple of 75, so we can write 2x = 75n, where n is a positive integer.

Now, we need to find the age of Bill's father when he saw the comet, which is x. We are given that Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. This means that the time elapsed between the two sightings is 75 years, and the age of Bill's father at the second sighting is 30 + 75 = 105 years.

Since the time elapsed between the two sightings is 2x, we can write 2x = 75n = 75. Since 75n = 75, n = 1. 

Now, we can find x by substituting n = 1 into the equation 2x = 75n. This gives us 2x = 75(1), so x = 75/2 = 37.5.

However, x must be an integer, since it represents the age of Bill's father. This means that the initial assumption that 2x = 75n is incorrect, and we need to find another multiple of 75 that is close to 37.5.

The next multiple of 75 is 150, so we can write 2x = 150. Solving for x, we get x = 150/2 = 75.

Now, we can find the age of Bill when his father saw the comet by subtracting x from the age of Bill's father. However, we are asked to find the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time. 

Since the time elapsed between the two sightings is 75 years, and Bill's father saw the comet when he was 30 years old, Bill was 30 - 75 = -45 years old when his father saw the comet. However, this is not possible, since Bill's age cannot be negative.

This means that our initial assumption that 2x = 75n is incorrect, and we need to find another multiple of 75 that is close to 37.5.

"To find the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks for each category and then add them together.

1. Checks for the electric bill: Since Buford writes a check once per month, and there are 12 months in a year, he writes 12 checks for the electric bill per year.
2. Checks for the gas bill: Similarly, since Buford writes a check once per month, he writes 12 checks for the gas bill per year.
3. Checks to the church: Buford writes a check twice per month, so in a year, he writes 2 * 12 = 24 checks to the church.
4. Checks to the pest and lawn service: Buford writes a check quarterly, which means 4 times per year. So, he writes 4 checks to the pest and lawn service per year.

Now, let's add the total number of checks:

12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52

The final answer is: 52"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the total number of flights made by the first plane as 'x'. Since the second plane makes 44 flights, which is half the number of flights made by the first plane, the first plane makes 2 * 44 = 88 flights per day.

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, which is (3/4) * 88 = 66 flights. The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of flights to France and Germany is (1/2) * (88 - 66) = 11.

Since the flights to France and Germany are equal, the number of flights to France is 11.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the individual howling times and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. 
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we add the individual howling times together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to determine the total amount of money he received from his parents and subtract that from the cost of the trousers.

Adam's mother gave him $6. 
His father gave him twice as much as his mother, so his father gave him 2 * $6 = $12.

The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Since the trousers cost $30, we subtract the amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers to find out how much he had to contribute from his savings: $30 - $18 = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To solve this problem, we can start by representing the ages of the children as variables. Let's denote the age of Wilfred as W. We know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children, which is 20/4 = 5. Since Helene is twice as old as the average age, Helene's age is 2 * 5 = 10.

We also know that the total age of the children is 20, and we have the ages of Akbar and Alessandro as 3 and 4, respectively. We can set up an equation to represent the total age of the children:

3 + 4 + 10 + W = 20

Combine the constants on the left-hand side of the equation:

17 + W = 20

Subtract 17 from both sides of the equation to isolate W:

W = 20 - 17
W = 3

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how much Walter's lawyer will contribute, we need to calculate the total amount collected from Walter's neighbors and the online fund, and then multiply it by 3.

Walter collects $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. 

Total amount collected so far = $500 + $1500 = $2000

Walter's friend donates $200, but this is not included in the amount that the lawyer will base his donation on. The lawyer will donate three times the amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund, which is $2000.

Lawyer's contribution = 3 * $2000 = $6000

"To find the total number of cookies, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies brought by the guests. Since each guest brought 15 cookies and there were 100 guests, the total number of cookies is 100 * 15 = 1500.

The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door. So, the number of cookies given to the church is 1/2 * 1500 = 750.

Since each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, we can find the number of people in the church by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received. 

Number of people in the church = Total cookies given to the church / Cookies per person
= 750 / 15
= 50

"To solve this problem, let's assume the total number of slices the watermelon is divided into is 'x'. Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices is 6. 

Let's denote the number of slices each kid gets as 'k'. Since each adult gets twice as many slices as each kid, the number of slices each adult gets is '2k'. 

We know that the total number of slices is 6, so we can write the equation: 2 * 2k + 4 * k = 6. 

Simplifying the equation, we get 4k + 4k = 6, which gives us 8k = 6. 

Dividing both sides by 8, we get k = 6/8 = 0.75. 

Since each adult gets 2k slices, each adult gets 2 * 0.75 = 1.5 slices. 

The total number of slices is 6, so the total number of slices is 6. 

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to divide the number of slices each adult gets by the total number of slices and multiply by 100. 

So, (1.5 / 6) * 100 = 25%.

The final answer is: 25"
"To determine the time Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time spent on rounds and appointments, and then subtract that from the total hours he spends at the clinic.

First, let's calculate the time spent on rounds. Since each round takes 20 minutes and there are 10 inpatients, the total time spent on rounds is:
10 inpatients * 20 minutes/inpatient = 200 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time spent on rounds to hours:
200 minutes / 60 = 3.33 hours

Next, let's calculate the time spent on appointments. Since each appointment takes 30 minutes and there are 10 appointments, the total time spent on appointments is:
10 appointments * 30 minutes/appointment = 300 minutes

Converting the total time spent on appointments to hours:
300 minutes / 60 = 5 hours

Now, let's add the time spent on rounds and appointments to get the total time spent on clinical activities:
3.33 hours (rounds) + 5 hours (appointments) = 8.33 hours

Since Doctor Jones spends 9 hours at the clinic, we can subtract the total time spent on clinical activities from the total hours to find the time left for updating records:
9 hours - 8.33 hours = 0.67 hours

The final answer is: 0.67"
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required for the entire process. 

First, let's break down the time required for each step:

1. Making the cake batter: 20 minutes
2. Baking the cake: 30 minutes
3. Cooling the cake: 2 hours (120 minutes)
4. Frosting the cake: 10 minutes

Total time required = 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours:
180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours

Jordan wants to serve the cake at 5:00 pm, so we need to subtract the total time required from the serving time to find the latest start time.

Latest start time = 5:00 pm - 3 hours
Latest start time = 2:00 pm

Therefore, Jordan can start making the cake at 2:00 pm to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as 'x'. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, so she sold 3.5x chocolate bars. 
Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so he sold 4.5x chocolate bars. 
Together, they sold 64 chocolate bars, so the equation is 3.5x + 4.5x = 64.

Combine like terms: 8x = 64.

Now, divide both sides by 8 to solve for x: x = 64 / 8.

x = 8.

The number of chocolate bars in a box is 8."
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to first calculate the daily earnings and then multiply it by the number of days in a month.

The daily earnings can be calculated as follows:

- The cost to rent the studio per session is $25.
- The cost per student per session is $1.50.
- The studio has 10 students, so the total cost per session for students is 10 * $1.50 = $15.
- The total cost per session is $25 (rent) + $15 (students) = $40.
- The studio is rented 3 days a week, so the weekly earnings are 3 * $40 = $120.
- There are approximately 4 weeks in a month, so the monthly earnings are 4 * $120 = $480.

However, this calculation does not take into account the number of sessions per week. Since we don't know the number of sessions per week, we need to make an assumption or get more information. Assuming a standard dance studio has 1 session per day, the weekly earnings would be $120. 

However, if the studio has more than one session per day, the weekly earnings would be higher. For example, if the studio has 2 sessions per day, the weekly earnings would be 2 * $120 = $240. 

To provide a more accurate answer, we need more information about the number of sessions per week. 

However, if we assume 1 session per day, the monthly earnings would be $480."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of chocolate bars in each box for both Peter and Martha. 

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each box as 'x'. Since Peter has 4 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each, the total number of chocolate bars Peter has is 4x. Similarly, since Martha has 7 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each, the total number of chocolate bars Martha has is 7x.

We are given that Peter has a total of 64 chocolate bars and Martha has a total of 56 chocolate bars. We can set up the following equations:

4x = 64 (for Peter)
7x = 56 (for Martha)

To find the value of 'x', we can solve these equations. 

For Peter: 
4x = 64
x = 64 / 4
x = 16

For Martha: 
7x = 56
x = 56 / 7
x = 8

Now that we know the number of chocolate bars in each box for both Peter and Martha, we can find the difference in the number of chocolate bars in each box.

Difference = Number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter - Number of chocolate bars in each box for Martha
= 16 - 8
= 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the number of female porcupines, we multiply the total population by 3/5. 

Number of female porcupines = 50 * (3/5) = 30

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, the total number of babies born in a month is 30 * 4 = 120.

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is 120 * 12 = 1440.

The initial population of porcupines is 50, and 1440 babies are added in a year. Therefore, the total population after a year is 50 + 1440 = 1490.

The final answer is: 1490"
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to calculate the area of the base and multiply it by the depth. The base of the pool is a rectangle, so we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle: length * width.

Area = length * width
Area = 25 * 14
Area = 350 square feet

Now, we need to multiply the area by the depth to find the volume:
Volume = Area * depth
Volume = 350 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 7.48 (not 5.9) to convert cubic feet to gallons, we can do that now:
Volume in gallons = Volume * 7.48
Volume in gallons = 1400 * 7.48
Volume in gallons = 10472 gallons

Now, we can calculate the cost to fill the pool:
Cost = Volume in gallons * cost per gallon
Cost = 10472 * 0.10
Cost = 1047.2

The final answer is: $1047.20"
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to determine the number of each color and then add them together.

We know there are 9 red sticks. 
There are 5 more blue sticks than red, so the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14.
The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is 14 - 3 = 11.

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of each color together: 9 (red) + 14 (blue) + 11 (yellow) = 34.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the distance traveled by Matteo, we multiply his speed by the time he traveled: 55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles.

To find the distance traveled by Shandy, we multiply his speed by the time he traveled: 45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles.

To find the difference in distance traveled between Shandy and Matteo, we subtract the distance traveled by Matteo from the distance traveled by Shandy: 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles.

The final answer is: 230"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find the number of students over 16 years old. Since half of the students are over 16, we can calculate this as follows:

3000 students / 2 = 1500 students over 16 years old

Next, we need to find the number of male students over 16 years old. Since one-fourth of the students over 16 are male, we can calculate this as follows:

1500 students / 4 = 375 male students over 16 years old

Now, let's find the number of female students over 16 years old. Since the remaining students over 16 are female, we can subtract the number of male students from the total number of students over 16:

1500 students - 375 students = 1125 female students over 16 years old

Next, let's find the number of students under 16 years old. Since the remaining half of the students are under 16, we can calculate this as follows:

3000 students / 2 = 1500 students under 16 years old

Now, let's find the number of male students under 16 years old. Since one-half of the students under 16 are male, we can calculate this as follows:

1500 students / 2 = 750 male students under 16 years old

Now, let's find the number of female students under 16 years old. Since the remaining students under 16 are female, we can subtract the number of male students from the total number of students under 16:

1500 students - 750 students = 750 female students under 16 years old

Finally, let's find the total number of female students enrolled at the school. We can add the number of female students over 16 and under 16:

1125 female students + 750 female students = 1875 female students

The final answer is: 1875"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of laps each person can run and then compare Bethany's laps to Quinn's laps.

Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.

Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.

Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.

Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

To find the difference in the number of laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract Quinn's laps from Bethany's laps: 10 - 5 = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank and subtract it from the tank's capacity.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is (1/4) * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped (3/4) * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is (2/3) * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is (1/3) * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped into the tank is 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 12000 gallons. To find the remaining amount of water needed to fill the tank, we subtract this from the tank's capacity: 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is: 6000"
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into two parts: the first part where the power bank loses 9% of its capacity per hour for 5 hours, and the second part where it loses 7% of its capacity per hour for 3 hours.

Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is x.

In the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity per hour. So, after 5 hours, the remaining charge will be x - (9% of x) * 5 = x - 0.45x = 0.55x.

In the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity per hour. So, after 3 hours, the remaining charge will be 0.55x - (7% of 0.55x) * 3 = 0.55x - 0.1545x = 0.3955x.

We are given that the final charge remaining is 28% of the initial charge. So, we can set up the equation:

0.3955x = 0.28x

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.3955:

x = 0.28x / 0.3955
x = 0.71x

However, this is not correct. We need to find the initial charge when the power bank was 100% charged. We can set up the equation:

0.3955x = 0.28x
0.3955x - 0.28x = 0

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate Janet's total weekly earnings and then determine how many weeks she needs to work to save 20% of the car's cost.

First, let's calculate Janet's total weekly earnings. She makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, so her total hourly earnings are $10 + $15 = $25 per hour.

Since she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are $25/hour * 40 hours/week = $1000/week.

Next, we need to calculate the amount Janet needs to save for the down payment. She wants to save 20% of the car's cost, which is 20% of $10,000. To calculate 20% of $10,000, we multiply $10,000 by 0.20, which is $2,000.

Now, we need to determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save $2,000. We can do this by dividing the amount she needs to save ($2,000) by her weekly earnings ($1,000). 

$2,000 / $1,000 = 2

Therefore, Janet needs to work 2 weeks to save the down payment.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has spent so far and subtract that from the $10 he has. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items he has already purchased:

- 3 peaches at $0.5 each: 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
- 4 pears at $0.5 each: 4 * $0.5 = $2
- 2 kiwis at $1 each: 2 * $1 = $2
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Total cost so far: $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25

Now, let's subtract the total cost from the $10 Jamaar has:

$10 - $9.25 = $0.75

Since plums cost $0.25 each, we can divide the remaining amount by the cost of one plum to find out how many plums Jamaar can buy:

$0.75 / $0.25 = 3

So, Jamaar can buy 3 plums.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many pieces of sweets each of her friends received, we first need to determine the total number of packs Anne gave away. Since she kept 2 packs for herself, she gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs.

Next, we need to find out how many packs each friend received. Since she gave the packs equally to 10 friends, we divide the total number of packs given away (13) by the number of friends (10). 

13 packs / 10 friends = 1.3 packs per friend. However, since each pack contains 60 pieces, we need to multiply the number of packs each friend received by the number of pieces in each pack.

1.3 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 78 pieces per friend.

The final answer is: 78"
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the increase in price each year and add it to the original price.

Year 1: 
Original price = $120
Increase in price = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Original price = $126
Increase in price = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Original price = $132.30
Increase in price = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of pictures in each type of album. Since Olivia put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide the total number of pictures (72) by 8 to find the number of pictures in each album.

72 ÷ 8 = 9

So, each album has 9 pictures. 

Since 3 albums were selfies only, the total number of selfies is 3 * 9 = 27.

The remaining albums are portraits, which is 8 - 3 = 5 albums. Since each album has 9 pictures, the total number of portraits is 5 * 9 = 45.

Therefore, Olivia had 27 selfies and 45 portraits.

The final answer is: 
Selfies: 27
Portraits: 45"
"To find the time James spends reading, we need to determine how many sets of 3 pages he reads and then multiply that by the time it takes him to read one set of 3 pages. 

First, let's find out how many sets of 3 pages James reads: 
18 pages / 3 pages per set = 6 sets

Now, we multiply the number of sets by the time it takes to read one set: 
6 sets * 10 minutes per set = 60 minutes

The final numerical answer is: 60"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, the hotel had 100 guests.

24 guests checked out early, so the number of guests remaining is:
100 - 24 = 76

15 guests opted for a late checkout, so the number of guests remaining is still 76.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout, which is 2 * 15 = 30. So, the number of guests now is:
76 + 30 = 106

After dinner, 7 more people checked in, so the final number of guests is:
106 + 7 = 113

The final number of guests in the hotel is 113."
"To find the total number of bananas John has, we need to calculate the number of bananas he picked each day and add them together.

On Wednesday, John picked 4 bananas.
On Thursday, John picked 6 bananas.
On Friday, John picked triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 bananas.

Now, let's add the bananas picked each day: 4 (Wednesday) + 6 (Thursday) + 12 (Friday) = 22 bananas.

The final answer is: 22"
"To find the number of points Aries is sure to get, we first need to determine the number of easy, average, and difficult questions in the quiz.

Given that 40% of the questions are easy, we can calculate the number of easy questions as follows:
Number of easy questions = 40% of 60 = 0.4 * 60 = 24

Since the rest of the questions are equally divided between average and difficult, we can calculate the number of average and difficult questions as follows:
Number of average questions = (60 - 24) / 2 = 36 / 2 = 18
Number of difficult questions = 18

Now, let's calculate the number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:
Easy questions: 75% of 24 = 0.75 * 24 = 18
Average questions: 50% of 18 = 0.5 * 18 = 9
Difficult questions: 50% of 18 = 0.5 * 18 = 9

Total points Aries is sure to get = 18 + 9 + 9 = 36

The final answer is: 36"
"Let's denote the number of small stuffed animals as 's' and the number of large stuffed animals as 'l'. We are given that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so we can express this as s = 2l.

We are also given that the price of a small stuffed animal is $4. Since Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small ones, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.

The total earnings from the sales are $120. The total earnings can be calculated as the sum of the earnings from small and large stuffed animals. The earnings from small stuffed animals are 4s and the earnings from large stuffed animals are 12l. Therefore, we can write the equation as 4s + 12l = 120.

Substituting s = 2l into the equation, we get 4(2l) + 12l = 120, which simplifies to 8l + 12l = 120. Combining like terms, we get 20l = 120.

To find the value of l, we divide both sides of the equation by 20, resulting in l = 6. Since s = 2l, we can substitute l = 6 into this equation to find s = 2 * 6 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total number of sandwiches the family eats in one week, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches each family member eats in a week and then sum them up.

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, so in a week (7 days), he eats 5 * 7 = 35 sandwiches.

The wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, so in a week (7 days), she eats 4 * 7 = 28 sandwiches.

The son eats 2 sandwiches per day, so in a week (7 days), he eats 2 * 7 = 14 sandwiches.

Now, let's add up the total number of sandwiches the family eats in a week: 35 (man) + 28 (wife) + 14 (son) = 77 sandwiches.

The final answer is: 77"
"To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we need to calculate her total earnings and then subtract the amount she gave to her sisters.

First, let's calculate her earnings from selling cookies and cupcakes. 

Earnings from cookies: 80 cookies * $1 each = $80
Earnings from cupcakes: 60 cupcakes * $4 each = $240
Total earnings: $80 + $240 = $320

Next, let's calculate the amount she gave to her sisters: 2 sisters * $10 each = $20

Now, let's subtract the amount she gave to her sisters from her total earnings: $320 - $20 = $300

Therefore, Suzanne has $300 left from her earnings.

The final answer is: $300"
"To find the number of eggs found by the friends, we first need to determine the total number of eggs found by the Smith twins. Since each twin found 30 eggs, the total number of eggs found by the twins is 2 * 30 = 60.

The total number of eggs hidden is 100, and 10 eggs were not found by the friends. This means that the remaining eggs, which were found by the friends, are 100 - 10 = 90.

However, we already know that the Smith twins found 60 eggs. To find the number of eggs found by the friends, we need to subtract the number of eggs found by the twins from the total number of eggs found by the friends. But since the twins found 60 eggs, and the friends found the remaining eggs, we can directly calculate the number of eggs found by the friends as 90.

The final answer is: 90"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the amount of ore a single dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe. 

A dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, which is 2 * 12 = 24 pounds per day. With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, which is 1.5 * 24 = 36 pounds per day.

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month (30 days) with steel pickaxes. 

First, we calculate the total amount of ore one dwarf can mine in 30 days with a steel pickaxe: 36 pounds/day * 30 days = 1080 pounds.

Then, we multiply this by the number of dwarves: 1080 pounds/dwarf * 40 dwarves = 43200 pounds.

The final answer is: 43200"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of proportionality. Let's denote the price of the package with 8 sandwiches as x.

We know that the price of the first package (2 sandwiches) is $3, and the price of the second package (4 sandwiches) is $6. We can set up a proportion to relate the prices and the number of sandwiches:

(2 sandwiches / $3) = (4 sandwiches / $6) = (8 sandwiches / x)

We can simplify the first two ratios to get:

(1/1.5) = (2/3) = (8/x)

Now, we can equate the second and third ratios:

(2/3) = (8/x)

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

2x = 8 * 3
2x = 24

Now, we can divide both sides by 2 to get:

x = 24 / 2
x = 12

Therefore, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To find out how much Tom has to pay per month for the bedroom set, we need to first determine the remaining amount he owes after using the $1000 from selling his old bedroom set.

Initial cost of the bedroom set: $3000
Amount paid from selling the old bedroom set: $1000
Remaining amount owed: $3000 - $1000 = $2000

Since Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month, we can calculate the monthly payment as follows:

Monthly payment = 10% of $2000
Monthly payment = 0.10 * $2000
Monthly payment = $200

Therefore, Tom has to pay $200 per month for the bedroom set."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

First, 40% of the red balloons burst, so the number of red balloons remaining is 25 - (40% of 25) = 25 - 0.4 * 25 = 25 - 10 = 15.

Next, Sally released half of the yellow balloons, so the number of yellow balloons remaining is 12 - (1/2 * 12) = 12 - 6 = 6.

Then, she found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch. 75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6. So, she added 6 blue balloons to her clutch.

Now, let's calculate the total number of balloons she carried into the school. The remaining red balloons are 15, the remaining yellow balloons are 6, and the added blue balloons are 6. The green balloons were not affected by any events, so they remain 7.

The total number of balloons she carried into the school is 15 + 6 + 6 + 7 = 34.

"To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to consider the scenarios where he won't get an extension. 

First, let's consider the case where the substitute teacher is present. In this case, there's a 50% chance of having a substitute, and since the homework won't be collected, the probability of having to turn it in is 0.

Next, let's consider the case where the normal teacher is present. In this case, there's a 60% chance (100% - 40% extension chance). Within this 60%, there's a 80% chance (100% - 20% chance of getting a personal extension) that Marcus won't get an extension.

Now, we can calculate the probability of having to turn in the homework:

- Probability of having to turn it in with a substitute: 0.5 * 1 = 0.5
- Probability of having to turn it in with the normal teacher: 0.6 * 0.8 = 0.48

The total probability of having to turn in the homework is the sum of these two probabilities: 0.5 + 0.48 = 0.98

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.98 * 100 = 98%

The final answer is: 98"
"To find out how many tickets each graduate can receive, we first need to determine the total number of available seats for guests. 

Total capacity of the Fine Arts Center = 6000
Seats for graduates = 950
Seats for faculty = 300

Total seats reserved = 950 + 300 = 1250

Available seats for guests = Total capacity - Total seats reserved
Available seats for guests = 6000 - 1250
Available seats for guests = 4750

Now, we need to find out how many guests each graduate can invite. Since there are 950 graduates, we divide the available seats by the number of graduates.

Tickets per graduate = Available seats for guests / Number of graduates
Tickets per graduate = 4750 / 950
Tickets per graduate = 5

We are given that it takes 75 large beans to fill Grandpa up, so L = 75.

We are also given that Grandpa can eat twice as many medium beans as large beans, so M = 2L = 2 * 75 = 150.

Lastly, we are given that eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium bean, so S = 3M = 3 * 150 = 450.

Therefore, Grandpa can eat 450 small beans.

The final answer is: 450"
"To find out how much Melissa makes per hour after expenses, we need to first calculate her total earnings and total expenses. 

Her total earnings can be calculated by multiplying her daily pay by the number of days she spends on jury duty: 
$15/day * 3 days = $45

Her total expenses can be calculated by multiplying her daily parking expense by the number of days she spends on jury duty:
$3/day * 3 days = $9

Now, we can find her total net earnings by subtracting her total expenses from her total earnings:
$45 - $9 = $36

To find out how much she makes per hour, we need to divide her total net earnings by the total number of hours she spends on jury duty:
6 hours/day * 3 days = 18 hours
$36 / 18 hours = $2 per hour

"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to first determine the total number of soda bottles he will place along the driveway. 

Given that the driveway is 24 feet wide and Richard wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet, we can calculate the total number of bottles as follows:

Total number of bottles = Total length of driveway / Distance between each bottle
Total number of bottles = 24 feet / 3 feet
Total number of bottles = 8

Since it takes Richard 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, we can calculate the total time by multiplying the number of bottles by the time it takes to set off each one:

Total time = Total number of bottles * Time per bottle
Total time = 8 * 5 seconds
Total time = 40 seconds

Therefore, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is 40 seconds.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim lost due to loans and lost income while in college. 

First, let's calculate the total amount of loans he took: 
4 years * $50,000/year = $200,000

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money he lost due to not working while in college. 
His income before college was $25,000/year. 
His income after college is $25,000 * 3 = $75,000/year. 
The difference in income is $75,000 - $25,000 = $50,000/year. 
The total amount of money he lost due to not working while in college is $50,000/year * 4 years = $200,000.

The total amount of money he needs to earn is the sum of the loans and the lost income: 
$200,000 (loans) + $200,000 (lost income) = $400,000.

Now, let's calculate how long it will take him to earn this amount at his new income of $75,000/year:
Time = Total amount / Annual income
Time = $400,000 / $75,000
Time = 5.33 years

"To find the total area of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the two pieces of fabric. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide, so the fabric pieces will be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than that.

The length of the fabric pieces will be 6 + 2 = 8 feet (original length) + 2 = 10 feet.
The width of the fabric pieces will be 8 + 2 = 10 feet.

Now, we can calculate the area of one fabric piece: 
Area = length * width = 10 * 10 = 100 square feet.

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area by 2:
Total area = 2 * 100 = 200 square feet.

Therefore, Jim needs to buy 200 square feet of fabric.

"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then sum them up.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. One-fifth of 425 is 425 / 5 = 85. 17 more than that is 85 + 17 = 102. So, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. Twice as many as Tuesday is 102 * 2 = 204. 5 more than that is 204 + 5 = 209. So, on Wednesday, they delivered 209 letters.

Now, let's add up the number of letters delivered each day: 425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the share of the first person as x. 

Since the second person took $80 more than the first, the second person's share is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is 2(x + 80).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920

Combine like terms again:

4x + 240 = 1920

Subtract 240 from both sides:

4x = 1680

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 420

The share of the first person is $420.

"To find the total hours worked by each painter, we first need to calculate the total hours worked in 3 weeks. 

There are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks have 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Since the painters worked 3/8ths of a day every day, we need to convert 3/8ths to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3/8 * 24 = 9 hours.

Now, we multiply the hours worked per day by the number of days to get the total hours worked: 9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours.

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4 to get the hours worked by each painter: 189 hours / 4 = 47.25 hours.

The final numerical answer is: 47.25"
"Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. 

Since Rory retrieved four more balls in the first set than in the second, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set, which is given as 19. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for x, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Expanding the equation:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

Number of balls in the first set = x + 4
= 6 + 4

"To find the price of the car in the year 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation of the car from 2007 to 2010.

The car was bought in 2007 for $20,000. 

The price of the car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year. 

We can use the formula for exponential decay to calculate the price of the car in 2010:

P(t) = P0 * (1 - r)^t

where:
P(t) = price at time t
P0 = initial price = $20,000
r = depreciation rate = 21% = 0.21
t = time in years

Since the car was bought in 2007, we need to calculate the price in 2008, 2009, and 2010.

For 2008:
P(1) = 20000 * (1 - 0.21)^1
P(1) = 20000 * 0.79
P(1) = 15800

For 2009:
P(2) = 20000 * (1 - 0.21)^2
P(2) = 20000 * (0.79)^2
P(2) = 20000 * 0.6241
P(2) = 12482

For 2010:
P(3) = 20000 * (1 - 0.21)^3
P(3) = 20000 * (0.79)^3
P(3) = 20000 * 0.491841
P(3) = 9836.82

The price of the car in the year 2010 is $9836.82."
"To find the number of Spanish books, we first need to determine the total number of books that are not written in English. Since half of the books are written in English, that's 50 / 2 = 25 books in English.

We are also given that 10% of the books are written in German. To find the number of German books, we calculate 10% of 50, which is 0.1 * 50 = 5 books in German.

Now, to find the number of Spanish books, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books: 50 - 25 - 5 = 20 books.

"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to first calculate the total number of cups she drinks in 30 days. 

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. To find the total cups in 30 days, we multiply the daily cups by 30: 
8 cups/day * 30 days = 240 cups

Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we can find the total gallons by dividing the total cups by 16:
240 cups / 16 cups/gallon = 15 gallons

Therefore, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Initially, Romeo boards the train with 120 people.

At the first stop, 20 more people board the train. So, the total number of people on the train becomes:
120 (initial people) + 20 (new people) = 140

At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, and twice that number (100 people) board the train. So, the total number of people on the train becomes:
140 (previous total) - 50 (people who descended) = 90
90 + 100 (new people) = 190

At the third stop, 80 more people descend from the train. So, the total number of people on the train becomes:
190 (previous total) - 80 (people who descended) = 110

The final answer is: 110"
"To find the total amount Alison spent on athletic gear, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

1. The tank top costs $10.
2. The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $10 + $5 = $15.
3. The tennis shoes were originally $48, but they were on sale for half price. Half of $48 is $48 / 2 = $24.
4. The athletic socks cost $8, and she had a coupon for $2 off, so the socks cost $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items:

$10 (tank top) + $15 (shorts) + $24 (tennis shoes) + $6 (socks) = $55

The final answer is: $55"
"To determine the total cost of renovating your kitchen floor, we need to calculate the total number of tiles required and then multiply it by the cost of each tile.

First, let's find the area of a single tile. Since each tile is a square with a side length of 1 ft, the area of a single tile is:

Area of a single tile = side length * side length = 1 ft * 1 ft = 1 SqFt

Now, let's find the total number of tiles required to cover the kitchen floor. We can do this by dividing the total area of the kitchen floor by the area of a single tile:

Total number of tiles = Total area of kitchen floor / Area of a single tile
= 200 SqFt / 1 SqFt
= 200 tiles

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the tiles:

Total cost = Total number of tiles * Cost of each tile
= 200 tiles * $12/tile
= $2400

The final answer is: $2400"
"To find the increased cost of the insurance, we need to calculate 60% of the normal cost and add it to the normal cost. 

First, let's find 60% of the normal cost: 
60% of $120 = 0.6 * $120 = $72

Now, let's add this to the normal cost: 
$120 + $72 = $192

Since James has to pay this increased cost for a year, we need to multiply it by 12 (the number of months in a year):
$192 * 12 = $2304

The final answer is: $2304"
"To find the total number of loads of laundry Greg does in a week, we need to calculate the total number of twin and king size sheets he puts on the beds and divide that by the number of sheets he can wash at a time.

Greg puts 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed, which means he puts 4 + 1 = 5 sets of sheets on the beds every week. 

Since he can wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set at a time, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 2 and 1, which is 2. This means he can wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set in 2 loads.

Now, let's calculate the number of loads of laundry he does in a week. He has 5 sets of sheets, and he can wash 3 sets (2 twin + 1 king) in 2 loads. So, he needs 5 / 3 = 1.67 loads to wash all the sheets. However, since he can't do a fraction of a load, he needs to do 2 loads to wash all the sheets.

Now, let's calculate the number of loads of laundry he does in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total number of loads of laundry he does in a year is 2 * 52 = 104 loads.

The final answer is: 104"
"To find the total number of movies Jill and her friends watch in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the number of movies they watch in one weekend and then multiply it by 4.

On Saturday, they watch 4 movies. On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies they watch on Saturday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies.

So, in one weekend, they watch 4 + 2 = 6 movies.

To find the total number of movies they watch in 4 weeks, we multiply the number of movies they watch in one weekend by 4: 6 * 4 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection, we need to calculate the number of stickers he collected this year and add it to the total number of stickers he had two years ago and last year.

Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers. 
Last year, he collected 50 stickers, so he had 100 + 50 = 150 stickers.
This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which is 2 * 50 = 100 stickers.

Now, we add the number of stickers he had last year to the number of stickers he collected this year: 150 + 100 = 250 stickers.

The total number of stickers Leo has in his collection is 250.

"To find out how many days the cat food will last, we need to calculate the total amount of food consumed by the cats per day and then divide the total amount of food available by that amount.

Imma feeds her 3 cats twice a day with 60 grams of cat food each time. So, the total amount of food consumed by the cats per day is:

3 cats * 2 meals/day * 60 grams/meal = 360 grams/day

Now, we need to divide the total amount of food available (720 grams) by the daily consumption (360 grams):

720 grams / 360 grams/day = 2 days

The cat food will last for 2 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many slices Jake and Silvia ate. 

Since Becky ate 10 slices and she ate 3 more slices than Jake, Jake must have eaten 10 - 3 = 7 slices.

Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate 2 * 7 = 14 slices.

Now, we know that Becky ate 10 slices, Jake ate 7 slices, and Silvia ate 14 slices. To find the total number of slices they ate, we add these numbers together: 10 + 7 + 14 = 31.

The final answer is: 31"
"Let's denote the time Donovan took to make his part as 'x'. Since Betsy took 18 minutes longer than Donovan, the time Betsy took can be represented as (x + 18).

The total time taken to make the meal is the sum of the time taken by both Betsy and Donovan, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation as:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:
2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Since x represents the time Donovan took, and Betsy took 18 minutes longer, Betsy's part took 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

The final answer is: 58"
"To calculate the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to calculate the costs of the cast, the visit, the painkillers, and the parking separately and then add them together.

1. The cost of the cast is $200.
2. The cost of the visit is $300/hour for 0.5 hours (30 minutes). So, the cost of the visit is $300 * 0.5 = $150.
3. The cost of the painkillers is $4/pill for 30 pills. So, the cost of the painkillers is $4 * 30 = $120.
4. The cost of parking is $6/hour for 2 hours. So, the cost of parking is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, let's add the costs together: $200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482.

The final answer is: $482"
"To find out how many emails James responds to, we first need to find out how many emails he doesn't respond to. 

20% of 80 emails is 0.2 * 80 = 16 emails. 

Since James doesn't respond to these 16 emails, he responds to the rest, which is 80 - 16 = 64 emails.

Now, we need to find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week. 

Since James responds to 64 emails per day, in a 5-day work week, he responds to 64 * 5 = 320 emails.

The final answer is: 320"
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center, we need to calculate the number of classes that visited each day and then add them up.

On Monday, 32 classes visited.
On Tuesday, twice as many visited, so 2 * 32 = 64 classes visited.
On Wednesday, three times as many visited, so 3 * 32 = 96 classes visited.
On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add up the number of classes that visited each day:
32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 = 207

"To find the average score across the 4 tests, we need to calculate the total score and then divide it by the number of tests.

John scored 100 on his first 3 tests, so the total score for these tests is 3 x 100 = 300.

Adding the score of the 4th test, which is 80, to the total score gives us 300 + 80 = 380.

Now, we divide the total score by the number of tests, which is 4, to get the average score: 380 / 4 = 95.

The final answer is: 95"
"To find the total number of pizzas left, we first need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club and the football team.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. To find 70% of 20, we multiply 20 by 0.7:
20 * 0.7 = 14 pizzas eaten by the glee club.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. They ate 80% of them. To find 80% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.8:
40 * 0.8 = 32 pizzas eaten by the football team.

Now, we add the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club and the football team to find the total number of pizzas eaten:
14 + 32 = 46 pizzas eaten in total.

Since the glee club and the football team ordered a total of 20 + 40 = 60 pizzas, we subtract the total number of pizzas eaten from the total number of pizzas ordered to find the number of pizzas left:
60 - 46 = 14 pizzas left.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of big coupons. Since Anthony wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, and he is sending out 700 small coupons, the number of big coupons is 2 * 700 = 1400.

The cost of mailing the small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents.

The cost of mailing the big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

To find the total cost of postage, we add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons: 3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100: 24500 / 100 = 245 dollars.

The final answer is: $245"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches. This means Sidney ordered 10 - 3 = 7 meatball sub sandwiches.

2. Each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs. So, the total number of meatballs in the 7 sub sandwiches is 7 * 4 = 28.

3. Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. This means there are now 7 - 4 = 3 sub sandwiches left.

4. Since each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the remaining 3 sub sandwiches is 3 * 4 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we first need to determine the number of trucks that did not experience mechanical failures. 

Since a quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures, we can calculate the number of trucks that failed as follows:

Number of trucks dispatched = 20
Number of trucks with mechanical failures = 20 * (1/4) = 5

Now, we subtract the number of trucks with mechanical failures from the total number of trucks dispatched to find the number of trucks that reached the farmers:

Number of trucks that reached the farmers = 20 - 5 = 15

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. To find the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we multiply the number of trucks that reached the farmers by the tons of fertiliser each truck carried:

Total tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers = 15 * 20 = 300

The final answer is: 300"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of 6 pounds of butter with the promotion. 

First, let's calculate the number of pounds of butter Dennis needs to buy. Since he needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants and he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he needs 6 pounds of butter.

Since the grocery store has a promotion for buy one pound of butter get one half off, we can calculate the cost of 6 pounds of butter as follows:

- For the first 3 pounds of butter, Dennis will pay full price, which is $4.00 per pound. So, the cost for the first 3 pounds is 3 * $4.00 = $12.00.
- For the next 3 pounds of butter, Dennis will get one half off, which means he will pay half of the full price, which is $2.00 per pound. So, the cost for the next 3 pounds is 3 * $2.00 = $6.00.

The total cost of 6 pounds of butter is $12.00 + $6.00 = $18.00.

The final answer is: $18.00"
"To find the total cost of the party, we need to calculate the number of additional guests beyond the initial 20 and then multiply that by the cost per additional guest. 

First, let's find the total number of guests: 
Kayla invited 25 classmates + 7 dance class girls + 13 family members = 45 guests. 
However, 4 people said they could not come, so the total number of guests is 45 - 4 = 41.

Since the initial 20 guests are included in the rental fee, we need to find the number of additional guests: 
41 (total guests) - 20 (initial guests) = 21 additional guests.

Now, we can calculate the cost for the additional guests: 
21 additional guests * $6 per guest = $126.

Adding the initial rental fee to the cost for the additional guests, we get: 
$125 (rental fee) + $126 (additional guests) = $251.

The final numerical answer is: $251"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much money Maggie and Riza had initially. Since they each had $60 after spending a portion of their money, we can set up an equation to represent the situation.

Let's denote the initial amount of money Maggie had as M and the initial amount of money Riza had as R. We know that Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which means she has 3/4 of her initial amount left. Similarly, Riza spent one-third of her money, so she has 2/3 of her initial amount left.

We can set up the following equations:

M - (1/4)M = 60
R - (1/3)R = 60

Simplifying the equations, we get:

(3/4)M = 60
(2/3)R = 60

To find the initial amount of money each had, we can multiply both sides of each equation by the reciprocal of the fraction:

M = 60 * (4/3)
R = 60 * (3/2)

M = 80
R = 90

Now that we know the initial amount of money each had, we can find the total amount of money they had initially:

Total initial amount = M + R
= 80 + 90
= 170

Since they spent a portion of their money, we need to find the total amount they spent. Maggie spent 1/4 of her money, which is (1/4) * 80 = 20. Riza spent 1/3 of her money, which is (1/3) * 90 = 30.

The total amount they spent is 20 + 30 = 50.

To find the total amount of money they have left, we subtract the total amount they spent from the total initial amount:

Total amount left = Total initial amount - Total amount spent
= 170 - 50
= 120

The final answer is: $120"
"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we first need to determine the total number of bananas each monkey eats in a day. 

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. 
The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day. 

Since there are three monkeys, the total number of bananas they eat in a day is 10 + 14 + x, where x is the number of bananas the third monkey eats. However, we know that the total number of bananas the monkeys eat in a day is equal to the total number of bananas Mr. Robles buys, which is 315. 

Since Mr. Robles buys enough bananas for a week, we need to divide 315 by 7 to find out how many bananas the monkeys eat in a day. 

315 / 7 = 45 bananas per day for all three monkeys.

Now we can set up an equation to find the number of bananas the third monkey eats: 
10 + 14 + x = 45

Combine like terms: 
24 + x = 45

Subtract 24 from both sides: 
x = 21

The third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

The final answer is: 21"
"To find the number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we need to determine how many pieces he placed in total and then subtract the pieces he placed before the hour.

Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, which means he placed 500 / 2 = 250 pieces before the hour.

During the hour, he finished another 500 piece puzzle, which means he placed 500 pieces during that hour.

So, the total number of pieces he placed during that hour is 500.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the roses and then find out how much change Jenny should receive. 

First, let's calculate the cost of the roses. Jenny bought 15 roses, but the florist sells roses in dozens. Since 1 dozen is 12 roses, we can calculate the number of dozens as follows:

15 roses / 12 roses per dozen = 1.25 dozen

Since you can't buy a fraction of a dozen, we'll round down to 1 dozen and 3 individual roses. The cost of 1 dozen roses is $15, and the cost of 3 individual roses is 3 * $2 = $6. 

The total cost of the roses is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny arrived with 5 $5 bills, which is a total of 5 * $5 = $25.

To find out how much change she should receive, we subtract the cost of the roses from the amount she paid with:

$25 - $21 = $4

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the $4 to quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so:

$4 / $1 = 4 quarters per dollar
4 dollars * 4 quarters per dollar = 16 quarters

Jenny leaves with 16 quarters.

The final answer is: 16"

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. 

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the first train leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves the station. Since the first train leaves at 30 minutes, the second train arrives at 30 + 30 = 60 minutes.

3. The second train stays in the station for a quarter of the amount of time that the first train stayed in the station. The first train stayed for 20 minutes, so the second train stays for 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. The second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

4. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves the station. Since the second train leaves at 65 minutes, the third train arrives at 65 + 60 = 125 minutes.

5. The third train leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it leaves at 125 minutes.

6. The fourth train will arrive 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station. Since the third train leaves at 125 minutes, the fourth train arrives at 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

7. Paul will board the fourth train, which arrives at 145 minutes. Since he is at the station at time 0, he will wait for 145 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of toothpicks Melanie has saved so far and then determine how many more weeks it will take her to reach 200 toothpicks.

Melanie has saved 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. To find the total number of toothpicks she has saved, we multiply the number of toothpicks saved per week by the number of weeks:

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Since Melanie needs 200 toothpicks in total, we subtract the number of toothpicks she has already saved from the total required:

200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take Melanie to save the remaining 80 toothpicks at a rate of 10 toothpicks per week:

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

Therefore, Melanie will need 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to first determine the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch and the price at which he sold it to his friend.

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price, so the price he paid is:

2000 * 0.75 = $1500

Then, he sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, so the price his friend paid is:

1500 * 1.20 = $1800

To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to calculate the difference between the original price and the price his friend paid, and then divide it by the original price, and multiply by 100:

((2000 - 1800) / 2000) * 100 = 10%

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours and then multiply it by the rate at which the springs create jellyfish.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, and 60 seconds in a minute. So, the total number of seconds in 4 hours is:

60 minutes/hour * 60 seconds/minute * 4 hours = 14400 seconds

Since each spring creates a new jellyfish every second, the total number of jellyfish created by one spring in 14400 seconds is 14400.

Now, if we have 5 springs working at the same rate, the total number of jellyfish created in 14400 seconds is:

14400 * 5 = 72000

Therefore, 5 springs working at the same rate would create 72000 jellyfish in 4 hours.

The final answer is: 72000"
"To find Frankie's score, we need to first determine what ""twice as high as Binkie's"" means. This implies that we need to multiply Binkie's score by 2. 

Binkie's score is 90. Twice Binkie's score is 2 * 90 = 180.

The problem states that Frankie's score is 15 better than twice Binkie's score. This means we need to add 15 to the result we obtained in the previous step.

Frankie's score = 180 + 15 = 195.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the time it took James to walk to the store and the time it took him to walk back home.

First, let's calculate the time it took James to walk to the store. Since he walked halfway to the store and then turned back, we can consider the distance he walked to the store as half of the total distance, which is 4 miles / 2 = 2 miles.

The time it took James to walk to the store can be calculated using the formula: time = distance / speed. In this case, the distance is 2 miles and the speed is 4 miles per hour.

time_to_store = distance / speed = 2 miles / 4 mph = 0.5 hours

Now, let's calculate the time it took James to walk back home. Since he walked the same distance back, the time it took him to walk back home is also 0.5 hours.

However, the question asks for the time it took him to reach the store. Since James walked to the store and then back home, we need to add the time it took him to walk to the store and the time it took him to walk back home.

total_time = time_to_store + time_to_store = 0.5 hours + 0.5 hours = 1 hour

"To find the total cost of buying bananas individually, we need to calculate the total number of bananas and multiply it by the cost per banana. 

First, let's find the total number of bananas. Jenny buys 10 bunches with 4 bananas per bunch, so the total number of bananas is 10 * 4 = 40.

The cost per banana is $0.80. Therefore, the total cost of buying 40 bananas individually is 40 * $0.80 = $32.00.

Now, let's find the total cost of buying the bananas in bunches. Jenny buys 10 bunches for $3.00 each, so the total cost is 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

To find the amount of money saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as 'x'. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, the amount of fence Harry gets is 'x + 60'. 

We know that the total amount of fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

This means Sam gets 20 feet of fence. To find out how much is left over for Sam, we need to subtract the amount he gets from the total amount of fence. However, the question asks how much is left over for Sam, which implies that the leftover amount is the amount that Sam does not get, which is the amount Harry gets. 

The amount left over for Sam is the amount Harry gets, which is 20 + 60 = 80 feet."
"To find the rate of growth per year, we need to divide the growth in inches by the number of years. 

Growth rate per year = 8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches/year

Now, we can multiply the growth rate per year by the number of years to find the total growth in 13 years.

Total growth in 13 years = 2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches

"To find the total earnings, we first need to determine the number of each type of bike sold. 

Let's start by finding the number of Trekking bikes sold. We know that half of the 300 bikes sold were Trekking bikes, so the number of Trekking bikes sold is 300 / 2 = 150.

Next, we find the number of BMX bikes sold. We know that 15% of the 300 bikes sold were BMX bikes, so the number of BMX bikes sold is 0.15 * 300 = 45.

Now, we can find the number of MTB bikes sold by subtracting the number of Trekking and BMX bikes from the total number of bikes sold: 300 - 150 - 45 = 105.

We know the prices of each type of bike: MTB is $500, BMX is half the price of an MTB, so BMX is $500 / 2 = $250, and Trekking is $450.

Now, we can calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of each type of bike sold by its price and adding them together:

Total earnings = (105 * $500) + (45 * $250) + (150 * $450)
Total earnings = $52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500
Total earnings = $131,250

The final answer is: $131,250"
"To find the number of bales left in the field, we need to determine the net change in the number of bales over the 6-hour period. 

The farmer produces 5 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the farmer will produce 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck will pick up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

The net change in the number of bales is the difference between the number of bales produced and the number of bales picked up, which is 30 - 18 = 12 bales.

Since the farmer starts with 0 bales in the field, the number of bales left in the field after 6 hours is 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total time John spends learning, we need to calculate the time spent in classes, the time spent on Saturday and Sunday, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time spent in classes. John takes 2 extra classes, each 40 minutes long, 5 days a week. So, the total time spent in classes per week is:
2 classes/day * 40 minutes/class * 5 days/week = 400 minutes/week

Next, we need to calculate the time spent on Saturday and Sunday. John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on these days. To find his weekly minutes, we need to convert the time spent in classes to hours and then multiply by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week). 

First, convert 400 minutes to hours: 400 minutes / 60 = 6.67 hours
Then, multiply by 7: 6.67 hours * 7 = 46.69 hours
Now, find 1/16 of this: 46.69 hours / 16 = 2.92 hours

Now, add the time spent in classes and the time spent on Saturday and Sunday: 
6.67 hours + 2.92 hours = 9.59 hours

The final answer is: 9.59"
"To find the height of the ball on its second bounce, we need to calculate the height of the ball after the first bounce and then multiply it by 2/3.

The initial height from which the ball is dropped is 3 stories * 24 feet/story = 72 feet.

On the first bounce, the ball reaches 2/3 of the initial height, which is (2/3) * 72 = 48 feet.

On the second bounce, the ball reaches 2/3 of the height it reached on the first bounce, which is (2/3) * 48 = 32 feet.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the height of each child in inches. 

The first child is 6 feet tall, which is equivalent to 6 * 12 = 72 inches.

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child's height is 72 + 2 = 74 inches.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child's height is 74 - 5 = 69 inches.

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child's height is 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

The final answer is: 72"
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to determine the number of bags sold and then multiply that by the price per bag.

Since the orchard sold a total of 2000 apples and each bag contains 10 apples, we can find the number of bags sold by dividing the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag:

Number of bags sold = Total apples / Apples per bag
= 2000 / 10
= 200

Now, we can find the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags sold by the price per bag:

Total earnings = Number of bags sold * Price per bag
= 200 * $5
= $1000

The final answer is: $1000"
"To solve this problem, we can work backwards from the information given. 

Let's start with the fact that the Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat. Since the velociraptors scavenged half of what was left after the T-Rex ate, the amount of meat left after the T-Rex ate must have been twice the amount the Allosaurus ate. 

So, the amount of meat left after the T-Rex ate = 2 * 270 kg = 540 kg.

Since the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, the amount of meat left after the T-Rex ate was half of the original amount. 

Let's call the original amount of meat on the triceratops 'x'. Then, x / 2 = 540 kg.

To find the original amount of meat, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 540 kg * 2
x = 1080 kg

Therefore, the triceratops had 1080 kilograms of meat before the T-Rex ate.

The final answer is: 1080"
"To determine the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total surface area of the walls that need to be painted. 

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 10 * 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two walls, their total area is 2 * 80 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 5 * 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two walls, their total area is 2 * 40 = 80 square feet.

The total surface area of the walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, the total number of gallons needed is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

Each gallon costs $12, so the total cost of painting the room is 12 * 12 = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To find the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to determine the probability of her selecting a shaken can out of the remaining cans.

Initially, Ellen had 12 sodas, and she shook 3 of them. So, the probability of a can being shaken is 3/12 or 1/4.

Ellen took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 11 sodas. Her brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 2 shaken sodas and 8 unshaken sodas.

The total number of cans left is 10. The probability of Ellen's friend selecting a shaken can is the number of shaken cans divided by the total number of cans, which is 2/10 or 1/5.

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

(1/5) * 100 = 20%

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each train travels in 3 hours and then add those distances together.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will travel 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will travel 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, we need to add their distances together to find the total distance between them. So, the total distance is 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

The final answer is: 270"
"To find the total number of people Billy can help, we first need to determine the number of days he works. 

March has 31 days, and April has 19 days (since April 19th is the last day). The total number of days between March 1st and April 19th is 31 + 19 = 50 days.

Billy takes 20% of the days off, so the number of days he works is 80% of 50 days. To find 80% of 50, we multiply 50 by 0.8: 50 * 0.8 = 40 days.

Since Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, the number of people he can help per day is 2 * 3 = 6 people.

To find the total number of people Billy can help, we multiply the number of days he works by the number of people he can help per day: 40 * 6 = 240 people.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the total number of people inside the church, we first need to calculate the total number of people that were transported by the buses and the cars. 

The number of people transported by the buses is the product of the number of buses and the number of people each bus carried: 12 buses * 35 people/bus = 420 people.

The number of people transported by the cars is the product of the number of cars and the number of people each car carried: 20 cars * 3 people/car = 60 people.

The total number of people transported is the sum of the people transported by the buses and the cars: 420 people + 60 people = 480 people.

Since the question asks for the number of people inside the church, we need to subtract the total number of people transported from the total number of people present. However, the total number of people present is not given. 

Assuming that the total number of people present is the sum of the people inside the church and the people outside the church, and that there are no people outside the church, we can assume that the total number of people present is the sum of the people transported by the buses and the cars. 

However, this is an incorrect assumption as it does not account for the people who were not transported (e.g., the bride, groom, and possibly other guests). 

To accurately answer the question, we would need more information about the total number of people present. 

However, if we assume that the total number of people present is the sum of the people transported by the buses and the cars, then the number of people inside the church would be 0.

But, if we consider the context of the question, it is more likely that the question is asking for the number of people who were not transported, which would be the bride and groom, and possibly other guests who were not transported. 

In this case, the number of people inside the church would be 2 (the bride and groom) plus any other guests who were not transported.

"To find Jeff's age, we need to determine Martha's age first. Since Mike is 24 years old and Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, we can calculate Martha's age by subtracting 4 from Mike's age.

Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
Martha's age = 24 - 4
Martha's age = 20

Now that we know Martha's age, we can find Jeff's age since he is 10 years older than Martha.

Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
Jeff's age = 20 + 10
Jeff's age = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the time it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of each slide by the speed at which people slide down. 

For the biggest slide: time = length / speed = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes.

For the second biggest slide: time = length / speed = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes.

To find the difference in time, we subtract the time it takes to ride the second biggest slide from the time it takes to ride the biggest slide: 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total time spent on lunches and breaks, we need to calculate the total time spent per day and then multiply it by 5.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 x 15-minute breaks per day. The total time spent on breaks is 2 x 15 = 30 minutes. 

So, the total time spent per day is 30 (lunch) + 30 (breaks) = 60 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60. 

60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour.

Since Bobby works for 5 days, we multiply the time spent per day by 5.

1 hour/day * 5 days = 5 hours.

The total time spent on lunches and breaks after 5 days is 5 hours.

"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we first need to determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate Micah's distance as 3.5 * 8 = 28 miles.

Now, we know that the total distance run by all three is 52 miles, and Amber and Micah ran a combined 8 + 28 = 36 miles. To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we subtract the combined distance of Amber and Micah from the total distance: 52 - 36 = 16 miles.

Ahito ran 16 miles."
"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total amount she spent after returning the item and then add it to the initial charge.

1. Initial charge: $85.00
2. Return: -$15.00 (since she returned an item)
   New balance after return: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

3. Frying pan purchase: 20% off $20.00
   Discount: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
   Price of frying pan: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

4. Towel purchase: 10% off $30.00
   Discount: 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
   Price of towels: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

5. Total amount spent after return: $70.00 (initial balance) + $16.00 (frying pan) + $27.00 (towels) = $113.00

The new balance on her credit card is $113.00."
"To solve this problem, we can start by identifying the information given:

- A fifth of the jellyfish are large.
- A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light.
- The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue.
- When a UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish changed color.

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is x/5.

We are told that a third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. This means 1/3 of the large jellyfish change color, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (1/3) * (x/5) = x/15.

The problem states that when the UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish changed color. Since these are the large jellyfish that change color, we can set up the equation x/15 = 6.

To solve for x, we multiply both sides of the equation by 15:

x = 6 * 15
x = 90

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find Caroline's age, we need to determine Ben's age first, and then multiply it by 3.

Given that Chris is 4 years old, and Ben is two times older than Chris, we can calculate Ben's age as follows:

Ben's age = 2 * 4
Ben's age = 8

Now that we know Ben's age, we can find Caroline's age by multiplying Ben's age by 3:

Caroline's age = 3 * Ben's age
Caroline's age = 3 * 8
Caroline's age = 24

Since she plans to live for 20 years, her total expenses during retirement will be 20 * $40,000 = $800,000.

Lauren saves 20% of her current salary, which is 0.2 * $100,000 = $20,000 per year.

To find out how many years she needs to work to save for her retirement, we can divide the total amount she needs to save by the amount she saves per year: $800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years.

However, this is the total number of years she needs to work to save for her retirement. Since she already has a retirement period of 20 years, we need to subtract this from the total number of years: 40 - 20 = 20 years.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the length of each final cut, we need to first determine the length of each of the 4 equal parts that Marty will cut the ribbon into. 

Since Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon and he wants to cut it into 4 equal parts, we can divide 100 by 4 to find the length of each of these parts.

100 cm / 4 = 25 cm

Now, each of these 4 parts will be divided into 5 equal parts. To find the length of each of these final cuts, we can divide the length of each of the 4 parts by 5.

25 cm / 5 = 5 cm

Therefore, each final cut will be 5 cm long.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total population of the school, we can use the information given about the boys. Since 40% of the school population is 240 boys, we can set up the equation:

0.4x = 240

where x is the total population of the school.

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.4:

x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

Now that we know the total population of the school is 600, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total population:

Number of girls = Total population - Number of boys
= 600 - 240
= 360

The final answer is: 360"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items before applying the coupon. 

The cost of the set of pots is $19, and the cost of the sack of garden soil is $26. 

Total cost before coupon = cost of pots + cost of soil
Total cost before coupon = $19 + $26
Total cost before coupon = $45

Next, we apply the coupon for $7 off.

Total cost after coupon = Total cost before coupon - coupon amount
Total cost after coupon = $45 - $7
Total cost after coupon = $38

Therefore, the total amount spent at the gardening shop is $38.

The final answer is: $38"
"To find the average height of heels at the party, we need to calculate the total height of all heels and then divide by the total number of women.

The total number of women is 6 (3 wearing 4-inch heels and 3 wearing 2-inch heels).

The total height of heels for the women wearing 4-inch heels is 3 * 4 = 12 inches.
The total height of heels for the women wearing 2-inch heels is 3 * 2 = 6 inches.

The total height of all heels is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.

The average height of heels is the total height of all heels divided by the total number of women: 18 / 6 = 3 inches.

The final answer is: 3"
"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike, we first need to calculate the total number of days in June. June has 30 days.

Since Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in 30 days, we can calculate her required daily hike as follows:

Total miles / Total days = Required daily miles
9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

Soledad plans to hike 125 miles twice a day, which is a total of:

125 miles * 2 = 250 miles per day

To find out how many more miles per day she needs to hike, we subtract her planned daily hike from the required daily hike:

Required daily miles - Planned daily miles = Additional miles per day
310 miles - 250 miles = 60 miles

So, Soledad must hike 60 more miles per day to complete her journey on time.

"To find the total amount the store will receive after selling all the balls, we need to calculate the total revenue from each color of ball and then sum them up.

The store has 3 red balls, each costing $9. So, the total revenue from red balls is 3 * $9 = $27.

The store has 11 blue balls, each costing $5. So, the total revenue from blue balls is 11 * $5 = $55.

The store has 25 green balls, each costing $3. So, the total revenue from green balls is 25 * $3 = $75.

Now, let's add up the revenues from all the balls: $27 + $55 + $75 = $157.

The final numerical answer is: $157"
"To find out how much James will have left, we first need to determine how much Pierre and Paul will take. 

Pierre wants a quarter of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/4 = 3 kg. 

Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/3 = 4 kg.

The total amount taken by Pierre and Paul is 3 + 4 = 7 kg.

Since there are three people (Pierre, Paul, and Jacques), and we are assuming Jacques is the one left, we need to find out how much he will have. However, the question does not mention Jacques initially, but rather Peter. It seems there is a mix-up in names. Assuming the question is referring to Jacques instead of Peter, we can proceed.

The total amount taken by Pierre and Paul is 7 kg. Jacques will have the remaining amount, which is 12 - 7 = 5 kg.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the temperature in the morning, we need to subtract the overnight drop from the initial temperature and then add the morning increase.

Initial temperature = 2 degrees Celsius
Overnight drop = 8 degrees Celsius
Morning increase = 3 degrees Celsius

Temperature after overnight drop = Initial temperature - Overnight drop
= 2 - 8
= -6 degrees Celsius

Temperature in the morning = Temperature after overnight drop + Morning increase
= -6 + 3
= -3 degrees Celsius

The final answer is: -3"
"To find out how much money Raymond has left, we need to calculate the total amount of money he spent and subtract that from the initial amount he had.

Initially, Raymond had $21.

He saved $11 from his allowance, so now he has: $21 + $11 = $32.

Then, he spent $5 on a comic book and $19 on a puzzle, so the total amount spent is: $5 + $19 = $24.

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the new total: $32 - $24 = $8.

Therefore, Raymond has $8 left.

The final answer is: $8"
"To find the cost of each book, we need to first determine how much Anna spent on the books. Since she had a budget of $16 and has $2 left, she spent $16 - $2 = $14 on the books.

Since Anna bought 2 books and they cost the same amount of money, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

2x = 14

where x is the cost of each book.

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 14 / 2
x = 7

Therefore, each book cost $7.

The final answer is: $7"
"To find the number of students enrolled this year, we need to calculate 20% of the previous year's enrollment and add it to the previous year's enrollment.

Previous year's enrollment: 50 students
20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 students

Add the increase to the previous year's enrollment: 50 + 10 = 60 students

Therefore, there are 60 students enrolled in the calligraphy class this year.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the rate at which the light blinks. We can do this by dividing the total number of blinks by the time it takes to blink that many times.

First, let's find the rate of blinking per minute. The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes, so we can divide 255 by 5 to get the rate per minute:

255 blinks / 5 minutes = 51 blinks per minute

Now that we know the rate of blinking per minute, we can find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times by dividing the total number of blinks by the rate per minute:

459 blinks / 51 blinks per minute = 9 minutes

Therefore, it will take the light 9 minutes to blink 459 times.

"To find the difference between the number of female and male fishes, we first need to calculate the total number of each type of fish after Tate's purchase.

Initially, there are:
- 4 male guppies
- 7 female guppies
- 3 male goldfishes
- 5 female goldfishes

Tate buys:
- 2 male guppies
- 1 female guppy
- 2 male goldfishes
- 3 female goldfishes

So, the total number of each type of fish after the purchase is:
- Male guppies: 4 + 2 = 6
- Female guppies: 7 + 1 = 8
- Male goldfishes: 3 + 2 = 5
- Female goldfishes: 5 + 3 = 8

Now, we calculate the total number of male and female fishes:
- Total male fishes: 6 (guppies) + 5 (goldfishes) = 11
- Total female fishes: 8 (guppies) + 8 (goldfishes) = 16

The difference between the number of female and male fishes is: 16 - 11 = 5

"To find the total time they all took to do their chores, we need to calculate the time each person took and add them together.

Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia, so Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours to walk the dog.

Dior took over 4 hours longer than Amalia, so Dior took 4 + 4 = 8 hours to do laundry.

Now, we add the time each person took to do their chores: 4 (Amalia) + 6 (Megan) + 8 (Dior) = 18 hours.

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 18 hours."
"To find the total distance John drives in a month, we need to calculate the round-trip distance for one visit and then multiply it by the number of visits.

The round-trip distance for one visit is 2 hours * 70 mph = 140 miles.

Since John visits his parents twice a month, the total distance driven in a month is 140 miles * 2 visits = 280 miles.

The final numerical answer is: 280"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total distance Sofie will walk in 7 days. Since Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, we can multiply the daily distance by the number of days:

Total distance walked by Sofie = 10 miles/day * 7 days = 70 miles

Since Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days, we can set up an equation to represent the relationship between the distances walked by Sofie and Brian:

Distance walked by Brian = (1/2) * Distance walked by Sofie

Substituting the value of the distance walked by Sofie, we get:

Distance walked by Brian = (1/2) * 70 miles
Distance walked by Brian = 35 miles

Therefore, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

The final answer is: 35"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers and then find the difference between the total number of toys needed and the number of toys produced by the first 4 workers.

First, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the 2 workers who produce 6 toys an hour:

2 workers * 6 toys/hour * 10 hours = 120 toys

Next, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour:

2 workers * 4 toys/hour * 10 hours = 80 toys

Now, let's add the number of toys produced by these 4 workers:

120 toys + 80 toys = 200 toys

Since the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to ship the order, the total number of toys needed is 400. 

The total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is 200. Therefore, the number of toys produced by the fifth worker is:

400 (total needed) - 200 (produced by first 4 workers) = 200 toys

Now, let's find the number of toys produced by the fifth worker per hour:

200 toys / 10 hours = 20 toys/hour

The fifth worker produces 20 toys per hour. 

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total weight of Elijah's dogs, we first need to determine the weight of each of his dogs. 

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so we can calculate its weight by multiplying Kory's dog's weight by 1/4. 

Weight of Elijah's first dog = 60 * (1/4) = 15 pounds

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so we can calculate its weight by multiplying Kory's dog's weight by 1/2.

Weight of Elijah's second dog = 60 * (1/2) = 30 pounds

Now, we can find the total weight of Elijah's dogs by adding the weights of both dogs.

Total weight of Elijah's dogs = 15 + 30 = 45 pounds

To find the total weight of all the dogs, we need to add the weight of Kory's dog to the total weight of Elijah's dogs.

Total weight of all dogs = 60 + 45 = 105 pounds

"To solve this problem, we can work backwards from the information given. 

Kris had 7 stickers left after giving some to Rob. Before that, Kris had 7 + 9 = 16 stickers. 

Before giving some to Kris, Luis had 16 stickers. Since Luis gave half of the stickers to Kris, Luis must have had 16 * 2 = 32 stickers. 

Before giving half of his stickers to Luis, Seth had 32 * 2 = 64 stickers.

The final numerical answer is: 64"
"To find the total number of M&M's John has, we need to calculate the total weight of the M&M's and then multiply it by the number of M&M's per ounce. 

First, let's find the total weight of the M&M's: 
3 large bags * 10 ounces per bag = 30 ounces

Since an ounce of M&M's has 30 M&M's, the total number of M&M's is:
30 ounces * 30 M&M's per ounce = 900 M&M's

Now, we need to find out how many small bags John can make with 10 M&M's in each bag:
Total M&M's / M&M's per small bag = 900 M&M's / 10 M&M's per bag = 90 small bags

"To find the number of days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we need to first calculate the distance that is half of the earth's circumference. 

The earth's circumference is 40,000 kilometers, so half of that would be 40,000 / 2 = 20,000 kilometers.

Since Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day, we can find the number of days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers by dividing the total distance by the daily distance.

20,000 km / 400 km/day = 50 days

"To solve this problem, we need to find the speed of the 2nd fastest car first, and then use that to find the speed of the fastest car.

Given that the average car can go 120 miles per hour, and the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, we can calculate the speed of the 2nd fastest car as follows:

Speed of 2nd fastest car = 5 * Speed of average car
= 5 * 120
= 600 miles per hour

Now, we are given that the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. We can calculate the speed of the fastest car as follows:

Speed of fastest car = 1.25 * Speed of 2nd fastest car
= 1.25 * 600

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine Liam's age two years ago and then use that information to find Vince's current age.

Liam is 16 years old now. Two years ago, Liam's age would be 16 - 2 = 14 years.

Two years ago, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince. This means that Vince's age two years ago was 14 / 2 = 7 years.

To find Vince's current age, we need to add 2 years to his age two years ago. Vince's current age is 7 + 2 = 9 years.

The final answer is: 9"
"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold as A, Madeline as M, Camden as C, and Sarah as S. We are given the following information:

1. A = M (since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs)
2. C + S = 30 (since Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs)
3. C = S + 12 (since Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah)

From equation 3, we can express C in terms of S: C = S + 12.

Substituting C = S + 12 into equation 2, we get:
(S + 12) + S = 30
Combine like terms:
2S + 12 = 30
Subtract 12 from both sides:
2S = 18
Divide both sides by 2:
S = 9

Now that we know S, we can find C:
C = S + 12
C = 9 + 12
C = 21

Since A = M, and the total number of eggs is 56, we can set up the equation:
A + M + C + S = 56
Substitute A = M and C = 21, S = 9:
M + M + 21 + 9 = 56
Combine like terms:
2M + 30 = 56
Subtract 30 from both sides:
2M = 26
Divide both sides by 2:
M = 13
Since A = M, A = 13

Now we can find the difference between the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold:
C - A = 21 - 13
C - A = 8

"To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we first need to determine the total number of boxes and the total weight of the crayons. 

Since Nik wants to put the crayons into groups of 8, we can divide the total number of crayons by 8 to find the number of boxes: 200 / 8 = 25 boxes.

Each box weighs 8 ounces, and there are 25 boxes, so the total weight of the boxes is 8 * 25 = 200 ounces.

Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, and there are 200 crayons, so the total weight of the crayons is 1 * 200 = 200 ounces.

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is the sum of their individual weights: 200 ounces (boxes) + 200 ounces (crayons) = 400 ounces.

Since there are 16 ounces to a pound, we can convert the total weight from ounces to pounds by dividing by 16: 400 / 16 = 25 pounds.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how much John makes, we need to calculate the total number of planks he can make and then multiply it by the price of each plank.

First, let's find out how many logs John can make from the tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, and the tree is 80 feet long, we can calculate the length of the usable part of the tree:

80% of 80 feet = 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet

Since each log is 4 feet long, we can divide the length of the usable part of the tree by the length of each log to find the number of logs:

64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs

Now, let's find out how many planks John can make from each log. Since he cuts 5 planks from each log, and he has 16 logs, we can multiply the number of logs by the number of planks per log:

16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks

Finally, let's calculate the total amount of money John makes by selling each plank for $1.2:

80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96

The final answer is: $96"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the monthly earnings of Valerie's brother and their mother.

Let's denote Valerie's brother's monthly earnings as B. Since Valerie earns 1/2 of what her brother earns, we can write an equation:

Valerie's earnings = 1/2 * B
5000 = 1/2 * B
B = 5000 * 2
B = 10000

Now, we know that their mother earns twice their combined salary. The combined salary of Valerie and her brother is 5000 + 10000 = 15000. Therefore, their mother's earnings can be calculated as:

Mother's earnings = 2 * (Valerie's earnings + Brother's earnings)
Mother's earnings = 2 * 15000
Mother's earnings = 30000

Now, we can find the total amount of money they all have together by adding their individual earnings:

Total amount = Valerie's earnings + Brother's earnings + Mother's earnings
Total amount = 5000 + 10000 + 30000
Total amount = 40000

The final answer is: $40000"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine Grandma's speed on the beach and on the sidewalk. Let's denote her speed on the beach as x miles per minute. Since she walks at twice the rate on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.

We know that she spends 40 minutes walking on the beach, which covers 2 miles. We can use the formula: distance = speed * time to find her speed on the beach. 

2 miles = x * 40 minutes
x = 2 miles / 40 minutes
x = 0.05 miles per minute

Now that we know her speed on the beach, we can find her speed on the sidewalk, which is 2x = 2 * 0.05 = 0.1 miles per minute.

The total time spent walking on the sidewalk is 3 - 2 = 1 mile / 0.1 miles per minute = 10 minutes.

The total time spent walking is 40 minutes on the beach + 10 minutes on the sidewalk = 50 minutes.

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total amount Jane has saved so far. Since she has saved $4 every week for 8 weeks, we can multiply the amount saved per week by the number of weeks:

$4/week * 8 weeks = $32

Now, we need to find out how much more she needs to save to reach a total of $60. We subtract the amount she has already saved from the target amount:

$60 - $32 = $28

Since she saves $4 every week, we can divide the remaining amount by the amount she saves per week to find out how many more weeks it will take:

$28 / $4/week = 7 weeks

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to have saved a total of $60.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total number of blue birds, we need to calculate the number of blue birds in each group of trees and then sum them up.

First, we have 3 trees with 7 blue birds each, so the total number of blue birds in these trees is 3 * 7 = 21.

Next, we have 2 trees with 4 blue birds each, so the total number of blue birds in these trees is 2 * 4 = 8.

Finally, we have 1 tree with 3 blue birds.

Now, we add up the number of blue birds in each group: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many marbles Bob initially has. We know that if he receives 2 dozen (24) more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. 

Let's denote the initial number of marbles Bob has as 'x'. Then, the equation can be written as:

x + 24 = 60

To find 'x', we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 24 from both sides:

x = 60 - 24
x = 36

So, Bob initially has 36 marbles. Now, if he loses 10 marbles, we need to subtract 10 from 36 to find the final number of marbles he has:

36 - 10 = 26

"To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum temperature of the second bottle of water. 

Let's denote the temperature of the second bottle as x degrees. 

When Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle into his water bottle, the total volume of water in the bottle is 5 ounces. 

Since the temperature of the mixture is at least 40 degrees, we can set up the following equation:

(33 * 4 + x * 1) / 5 ≥ 40

Simplifying the equation:

132 + x ≥ 200

Subtracting 132 from both sides:

x ≥ 68

So, the temperature of the second bottle must be at least 68 degrees.

The final answer is: 68"
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of cows:

Melanie's father starts with 50 cows. Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, there are 21 days in three weeks. 

Number of cows added in three weeks = 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
Total number of cows = Initial number of cows + Number of cows added
Total number of cows = 50 + 420
Total number of cows = 470

Next, let's calculate the number of chickens:

Melanie's father starts with 20 chickens. Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. 

Number of chickens added in three weeks = 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens
Total number of chickens = Initial number of chickens + Number of chickens added
Total number of chickens = 20 + 210
Total number of chickens = 230

Now, let's add the total number of cows and chickens to find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks:

Total number of animals = Total number of cows + Total number of chickens
Total number of animals = 470 + 230
Total number of animals = 700

"To find the cost of each single bagel after the discount, we need to first calculate the total cost of the 4 packs of bagels before the discount, and then subtract the discount amount. 

The cost of 4 packs of bagels before the discount is 4 packs * $10.00 per pack = $40.00.

The discount amount is 10% of $40.00, which is 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00.

The total cost after the discount is $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Since each pack contains 9 bagels, the total number of bagels is 4 packs * 9 bagels per pack = 36 bagels.

To find the cost of each single bagel, we divide the total cost after the discount by the total number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00 per bagel.

The final answer is: $1.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. We know that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops, so we can write this as:

Gomer's scoops = 23 - 5
Gomer's scoops = 18

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes it takes to make one scoop of mashed potatoes. We are given that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. Let's represent this as an equation:

Let x be the number of potatoes needed for 1 scoop
3 less than 6 potatoes = x
6 - 3 = x
x = 3

However, this is the number of potatoes needed for 1 scoop, but we are given that it's for 1 less than 3 scoops. So, we need to multiply the number of potatoes by 3 (since 1 less than 3 scoops is 2 scoops). 

Number of potatoes for 2 scoops = 3 * 2
Number of potatoes for 2 scoops = 6

Now, we know that it takes 6 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. To find out how many potatoes Gomer ate, we need to multiply the number of scoops he ate by the number of potatoes needed for 2 scoops.

Number of potatoes Gomer ate = Gomer's scoops * Number of potatoes for 2 scoops
Number of potatoes Gomer ate = 18 * 6
Number of potatoes Gomer ate = 108

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days, and then add them together.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs per day. So, the total number of eggs in the first 30 days is:
3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs per day. So, the total number of eggs in the next 30 days is:
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Now, we add the total number of eggs from both periods:
90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens:

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of red jellybeans. We are given that there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans, and there are 17 green jellybeans. 

Let's denote the number of red jellybeans as R and the number of green jellybeans as G. We know that R = 2G. Since we are given that G = 17, we can substitute this value into the equation to find R.

R = 2G
R = 2(17)
R = 34

Now that we know there are 34 red jellybeans, we can find the total number of non-blue jellybeans by adding the number of green and red jellybeans.

Total non-blue jellybeans = G + R
Total non-blue jellybeans = 17 + 34
Total non-blue jellybeans = 51

Since there are a total of 60 jellybeans, we can find the number of blue jellybeans by subtracting the total number of non-blue jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans.

Number of blue jellybeans = Total jellybeans - Total non-blue jellybeans
Number of blue jellybeans = 60 - 51
Number of blue jellybeans = 9

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade, we need to calculate the total number of lemons he collects in one year and then multiply it by 10.

First, let's find the total number of lemons he collects in one year. Since he has 5 trees and each tree produces 6 lemons per year, we multiply the number of trees by the number of lemons per tree:

5 trees * 6 lemons/tree = 30 lemons/year

Now, we multiply the number of lemons collected in one year by 10 to find the total number of lemons collected in a decade:

30 lemons/year * 10 years = 300 lemons

The final answer is: 300"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of men and women on the bus. 

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, we can let the number of men be 5x and the number of women be 9x. 

The total number of passengers on the bus is 84, so we can set up the equation: 5x + 9x = 84.

Combine like terms: 14x = 84.

Divide both sides by 14: x = 6.

Now that we know x, we can find the number of women on the bus: 9x = 9(6) = 54.

After 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining is: 54 - 20 = 34.

The final answer is: 34"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many sunflowers and bouquets Faraday sold per day. 

Let's denote the number of sunflowers sold per day as 's' and the number of bouquets sold per day as 'b'. We know that each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, so the total number of sunflowers sold per day is 12b + s.

We are given that Faraday earned $26 from the sunflowers and $56 from the bouquets per day. Since each sunflower costs $2 and each bouquet costs $8, we can set up the following equations:

2s + 8b = 26 (equation 1)
8b = 56 (equation 2)

From equation 2, we can solve for b:
b = 56 / 8
b = 7

Now that we know the number of bouquets sold per day, we can substitute this value into equation 1 to solve for s:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the inventory, the revenue generated from selling 60% of the inventory, and then find the difference between the revenue and the cost.

First, let's calculate the total number of rocks Adam can buy with $100. Since each rock costs $5, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost per rock:

Total money = $100
Cost per rock = $5
Total rocks = Total money / Cost per rock
Total rocks = $100 / $5
Total rocks = 20

Now, let's calculate the revenue generated from selling 60% of the inventory. Since Adam sells 60% of 20 rocks, we can multiply 20 by 0.6:

Revenue = 20 * 0.6
Revenue = $12

Next, let's calculate the cost of the inventory. Since Adam buys 20 rocks at $5 each, we can multiply the number of rocks by the cost per rock:

Cost = Total rocks * Cost per rock
Cost = 20 * $5
Cost = $100

However, since Adam only sells 60% of the inventory, he still has 40% of the rocks left. To find the cost of the unsold rocks, we need to calculate 40% of the total cost:

Unsold cost = Cost * 0.4
Unsold cost = $100 * 0.4
Unsold cost = $40

Now, we can find the total cost by adding the revenue and the unsold cost:

Total cost = Revenue + Unsold cost
Total cost = $12 + $40
Total cost = $52

Finally, we can find the loss by subtracting the total cost from the initial investment:

Loss = Initial investment - Total cost
Loss = $100 - $52
Loss = $48

The final answer is: $48"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of days it takes Lauren to complete each type of picture scene. 

First, let's find the number of days it takes Lauren to complete each type of picture scene:

- Large-sized picture scenes: 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days
- Medium-sized picture scenes: 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days
- Small-sized picture scenes: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days

Now, we need to find the LCM of 9, 6, and 7. 

The prime factorization of 6 is 2 * 3.
The prime factorization of 7 is 7.
The prime factorization of 9 is 3^2.

To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the numbers:
- The highest power of 2 is 2^1 (from 6).
- The highest power of 3 is 3^2 (from 9).
- The highest power of 7 is 7^1 (from 7).

The LCM is 2^1 * 3^2 * 7^1 = 2 * 9 * 7 = 126.

Therefore, it will take Lauren 126 days to complete all the picture scenes.

Next, we need to find the number of days in May. May has 31 days.

Now, we can calculate the total cost for May: 
Total cost = Daily cost * Number of days in May
Total cost = $3 * 31
Total cost = $93

The final answer is: $93"
"To find the total number of roses Patricia has now, we need to first determine how many roses she had after giving some to her mother, and then add the number of roses she bought.

Initially, Patricia had 30 roses. She gave 24 roses to her mother, so we subtract 24 from 30 to find out how many roses she had left:

30 - 24 = 6

Now, Patricia bought 15 more roses. To find the total number of roses she has now, we add the number of roses she bought to the number of roses she had left:

6 + 15 = 21

Therefore, Patricia now has 21 roses.

"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken. 

The total distance traveled is the sum of the two distances: 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles.

The total time taken is the sum of the two times: 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours.

The average speed is calculated by dividing the total distance by the total time: average speed = total distance / total time = 250 miles / 5 hours = 50 miles per hour.

"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning. 

The probability of the first ticket winning is 20% or 0.2. 
The probability of the second ticket winning is three times more likely, so it's 3 * 0.2 = 0.6.

Now, we multiply the probabilities of both tickets winning: 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of seashells each person collected. 

Let's denote the number of seashells Carrey collected as x. Since Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, the number of seashells Carlos collected is 2x. 

We are given that Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, so the number of seashells Jim collected is 2x + 5.

We know that the total number of seashells collected by all three is the sum of the seashells collected by each person: x + 2x + (2x + 5) = 5x + 5.

Since they divided the seashells equally among themselves, the total number of seashells is also equal to 3 times the number of seashells each person got: (5x + 5) = 3y, where y is the number of seashells each person got.

Now, we can solve for y: 

(5x + 5) = 3y
5x + 5 = 3y
5x = 3y - 5
x = (3y - 5) / 5

However, we also know that Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 2x + 5. So, we can set up the equation: 2x + 5 = 27.

2x + 5 = 27
2x = 22
x = 11

Now that we know x, we can find y: 

y = (5x + 5) / 3
y = (5 * 11 + 5) / 3
y = (55 + 5) / 3
y = 60 / 3
y = 20

So, each person got 20 seashells."
"To find the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the number of carrots he eats on weekdays and add the number of carrots he eats on the weekend.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday). So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is 4 * 5 = 20.

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is 5 + 5 = 10.

Now, we add the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend to get the total number of carrots he eats in a week: 20 + 10 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song and then add it to the length of the first song.

The first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. To find 60% of 5 minutes, we multiply 5 by 0.6 (which is equivalent to 60% as a decimal).

5 * 0.6 = 3 minutes

So, the second song is 3 minutes longer than the first song. To find the total length of the second song, we add 3 minutes to the length of the first song.

5 + 3 = 8 minutes

Now, we add the length of the first song (5 minutes) to the length of the second song (8 minutes) to find the total time of the cassette.

5 + 8 = 13 minutes

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes.

"To find the total profit earned by Linus, we need to calculate the profit from each day and then sum them up.

On Monday, Linus bought 2 devices for $20 each. So, the total cost price for Monday is 2 * $20 = $40. He sold each device for twice the original price, which is 2 * $20 = $40. So, the total selling price for Monday is 2 * $40 = $80. The profit for Monday is $80 - $40 = $40.

On Tuesday, Linus bought 4 devices for $20 each. So, the total cost price for Tuesday is 4 * $20 = $80. He sold each device for twice the original price, which is 2 * $20 = $40. So, the total selling price for Tuesday is 4 * $40 = $160. The profit for Tuesday is $160 - $80 = $80.

The total profit earned by Linus is the sum of the profit from Monday and Tuesday, which is $40 + $80 = $120.

Isabel's height = 7 feet
Ned's height = Isabel's height - 2 feet
Ned's height = 7 - 2
Ned's height = 5 feet

Since Carl is one foot taller than Ned, we can calculate Carl's height as follows:

Carl's height = Ned's height + 1 foot
Carl's height = 5 + 1
Carl's height = 6 feet

We are given that Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. Therefore, we can calculate the length of Carl's cane as follows:

Cane's length = Carl's height / 2
Cane's length = 6 / 2
Cane's length = 3 feet

The final answer is: 3"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of bottles required to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, and then subtract the number of bottles Hortex can currently produce.

First, let's calculate the total number of bottles required to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people. Since each bottle covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand, we need to find out how many bottles are required to cover 100% of the energy demand of 2300 people.

100% of the energy demand of one person is covered by 1 / 0.2 = 5 bottles.

To cover 100% of the energy demand of 2300 people, we need 5 * 2300 = 11500 bottles.

Since Hortex can currently produce 4200 bottles per day, we need to find out how many more bottles they need to produce to meet the demand of 11500 bottles.

The additional number of bottles Hortex needs to produce is 11500 - 4200 = 7300.

The final answer is: 7300"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's determine the number of babies wearing purple and blue. Since Carla has 8 identical octuplets, 3/4 of them wear purple, and 1/4 wear blue. 

Number of purple-wearers = 8 * (3/4) = 6
Number of blue-wearers = 8 * (1/4) = 2

Next, we need to find out how many of the purple-wearers also wear bows. Since 1/3 of the purple-wearers wear bows, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of purple-wearers with bows = 6 * (1/3) = 2

Now, we need to find the total number of babies wearing bows. This includes all the blue-wearers and the purple-wearers with bows:

Total number of babies wearing bows = Number of blue-wearers + Number of purple-wearers with bows
= 2 + 2
= 4

To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we can use the following formula:

Percentage chance = (Number of purple-wearers with bows / Total number of babies wearing bows) * 100
= (2 / 4) * 100
= 50%

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the number of reports received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday, and then subtract that result from the total number of reports received last week.

Total reports received last week = 5168
Reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

First, let's find the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday. 

Reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

Now, let's find the total number of reports received on Wednesday by subtracting the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday. However, we need to subtract the reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total reports received last week to get the reports received on Wednesday.

Reports received on Wednesday = Total reports received last week - (Reports received on Monday and Tuesday + Reports received on Thursday and Friday)
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - (1907 + 2136)
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - 4043
Reports received on Wednesday = 1125

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how much land Abraham sold in the first two transactions. He initially had 80 square meters of land. He sold half of it for $50, which means he sold 80 / 2 = 40 square meters. Then, he sold 1/4 of the remaining land, which is 80 - 40 = 40 square meters. 1/4 of 40 is 10 square meters. So, in total, he sold 40 + 10 = 50 square meters in the first two transactions.

Now, let's find out how much land is left. He initially had 80 square meters and sold 50 square meters, so he has 80 - 50 = 30 square meters left.

He sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, the total amount he earned from selling the remaining land is 30 * 3 = $90.

In the first two transactions, he earned $50 + $30 = $80.

Therefore, the total amount he will be able to earn after selling all his unused land is $80 + $90 = $170.

The final answer is: $170"
"To find Geb's age, we need to first calculate half of Haley's age. Haley is 26 years old, so half of her age would be 26 / 2 = 13.

Since Geb is 10 less than half of Haley's age, we subtract 10 from 13 to find Geb's age. 

Geb's age = 13 - 10 = 3."
"To find out how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to first determine how many face masks he uses in a day. 

Since Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out and he goes out three times a day, the total number of face masks he uses in a day is 2 * 3 = 6.

Now, to find out how many face masks he uses in 2 days, we multiply the number of face masks he uses in a day by 2. 

6 * 2 = 12

Therefore, Tyrion uses 12 face masks every 2 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's determine the total number of eggs Cole hid. Since a dozen is 12, Cole hid 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Next, we know Lamar finds 5 eggs. Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 2 * 5 = 10 eggs.

Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.

Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up the number of eggs found by each person: 5 (Lamar) + 10 (Stacy) + 8 (Charlie) + 4 (Mei) = 27 eggs.

To find the number of eggs still hidden, we subtract the number of eggs found from the total number of eggs: 36 - 27 = 9.

"To find the total amount John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of apartments in each complex and then multiply it by the number of collections per week and the payment per collection.

The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so the total number of apartments in these two complexes is 2 * 200 = 400.

The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, which means it is 160% of the other two combined (100% + 60% = 160%). To find the number of apartments in the last complex, we multiply the total number of apartments in the first two complexes by 1.6 (which is the same as 160% or 160/100).

Number of apartments in the last complex = 400 * 1.6 = 640

Total number of apartments in all three complexes = 400 + 640 = 1040

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so the total number of collections per week is 3 * 1040 = 3120.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so the total amount he makes in a week is 3120 * $0.40 = $1248.

The final answer is: $1248"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of fruits produced by the tree in each year and then sum them up.

In the 5th year, the tree produces 50 fruits.
In the 6th year, it produces 3 times the initial amount, which is 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
In the 7th year, it produces 7 times the initial amount, which is 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
In the 8th year, it produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree, but we don't know the production of a 10-year-old tree yet. Let's denote the production of a 10-year-old tree as x. So, in the 8th year, it produces x - 200 fruits.
In the 9th year, the tree doesn't produce any fruit.
In the 10th year, a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now, we need to find the production of a 10-year-old tree in the 8th year. Since a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount in the 10th year, and a 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount, we can set up a proportion to find the production of a 10-year-old tree in the 7th year. However, we are given that a 10-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree in the 8th year. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

7 * 50 = (x - 200) / 3 * 50

Solving for x, we get:
350 = (x - 200) / 150
x - 200 = 350 * 150
x - 200 = 52500
x = 52700

Now that we know the production of a 10-year-old tree in the 8th year, we can find the production of a 10-year-old tree in the 10th year, which is 52700 + 200 = 52900 fruits.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits produced by the tree in each year and sum them up:
50 + 150 + 350 + (52900 - 200) + 0 + 1000 = 52900

"To find out how much money Jack has now, we need to calculate the amount Sophia gave him and add it to his initial amount.

Sophia gave Jack 1/5 of her $100. To find 1/5 of $100, we multiply $100 by 1/5, which is the same as dividing $100 by 5.

$100 / 5 = $20

So, Sophia gave Jack $20. 

Now, we add the amount Sophia gave Jack to his initial amount:

$100 (initial amount) + $20 (amount given by Sophia) = $120

Jack now has $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as B, the length of the yellow rope as Y, and the length of the red rope as R. We are given that R = 4B and B = Y - 7.

We can express Y in terms of B as Y = B + 7. 

Now, we can express R in terms of B as R = 4B. 

The total length of the three ropes is given as 37 centimeters, so we can write the equation: R + B + Y = 37.

Substituting the expressions for R and Y in terms of B into the equation, we get: 4B + B + (B + 7) = 37.

Combine like terms: 6B + 7 = 37.

Subtract 7 from both sides: 6B = 30.

Divide both sides by 6: B = 5.

Now that we have the value of B, we can find the value of R: R = 4B = 4 * 5 = 20.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's assume Ronnie was given $5 initially. Since Rissa was given thrice as much, Rissa was given 3 * $5 = $15.

After giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, let's call the amount given to the little sister 'x'. So, Ronnie is left with $5 - x and Rissa is left with $15 - x.

According to the problem, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. This means (15 - x) = (4/5) * 15. 

To find the value of x, we can solve the equation: 
(15 - x) = (4/5) * 15
15 - x = 12
x = 3

Now that we know x, we can find out how much money Ronnie is left with:
Ronnie's money left = $5 - x
= $5 - 3
= $2

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the amount of red, white, and purple paint as R, W, and P, respectively. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, we can say R = W = P.

We are given that half the mural is yellow, which means the other half is painted with red, white, and purple. Since the total amount of paint used is 12 pints, and half of it is yellow, the other half is also 6 pints (12 / 2 = 6).

Since the other half is painted with red, white, and purple, and there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple, we can say that R + W + P = 6.

We also know that R = W = P, so we can substitute W and P with R in the equation: R + R + R = 6.

Combine like terms: 3R = 6.

Divide both sides by 3: R = 2.

Therefore, the amount of red paint used is 2 pints.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom: 
Area of one bedroom = length * width = 20 * 12 = 240 square feet.

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms = 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area = 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is given as 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add up the areas of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house to find the total area of the house:
Total area = area of bedrooms + area of living room + area of the rest of the house
Total area = 960 + 1200 + 1000
Total area = 3160 square feet.

The final answer is: 3160"
"To solve this problem, we can use a geometric progression formula. A geometric progression is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous one by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio.

In this case, the first term (a) is 3, and the common ratio (r) is 2, since Alice sees double the number of clouds each day.

The formula to find the sum of a geometric progression is: S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r), where S is the sum, a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.

In this case, a = 3, r = 2, and n = 5 (since there are 5 days).

Plugging in the values, we get: S = 3 * (1 - 2^5) / (1 - 2)
S = 3 * (1 - 32) / (-1)
S = 3 * (-31) / (-1)
S = 3 * 31
S = 93

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many pods are in the new box and then divide that number by 1 (since 1 pod is used per cycle) and finally divide the total number of pods by 12 (the cost of the box) to find out how many cycles can be run for $1.

First, let's find the number of pods in the new box. The new box has 20% more pods than the regular box. 

Let's denote the number of pods in the regular box as x. Then the number of pods in the new box is 1.2x (since 20% more is the same as multiplying by 1.2).

We know that the regular box has 100 pods, so x = 100. 

The number of pods in the new box is 1.2 * 100 = 120.

Now, we need to find out how many cycles can be run for $1. We know that the new box costs $12 and has 120 pods. 

To find out how many cycles can be run for $1, we need to divide the total number of pods by the cost of the box and then divide by the number of pods used per cycle.

The number of cycles that can be run for $1 is (120 / 12) / 1 = 10.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since he withdraws $1000, and each bill is $20, we can find the number of bills as follows:

Number of bills = Total amount / Bill value
Number of bills = $1000 / $20
Number of bills = 50

Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home. So, the remaining number of bills is:

Remaining bills = Initial number of bills - Number of lost bills
Remaining bills = 50 - 10
Remaining bills = 40

Thomas then uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he uses 20 bills to pay for the bill. The remaining number of bills is:

Remaining bills = Initial remaining bills - Number of bills used
Remaining bills = 40 - 20
Remaining bills = 20

Thomas then triples his money. Since he has 20 bills, and each bill is $20, the total amount of money he has is:

Total amount = Number of bills * Bill value
Total amount = 20 * $20
Total amount = $400

Since he triples his money, the new total amount is:

New total amount = 3 * Total amount
New total amount = 3 * $400
New total amount = $1200

Now, Thomas converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. To find the number of 5 dollar bills, we can divide the new total amount by the value of each 5 dollar bill:

Number of 5 dollar bills = New total amount / Bill value
Number of 5 dollar bills = $1200 / $5
Number of 5 dollar bills = 240

The final answer is: 240"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of goals scored by team A in the first half as 'x'. Since team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A in the first half, the number of goals scored by team B in the first half is 'x - 2'.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4(x - 2).

Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B in the second half. Since team B scored 4(x - 2) goals in the second half, team A scored (1/4) * 4(x - 2) = (x - 2) goals in the second half.

The total number of goals scored by team A is the sum of the goals scored in the first and second half, which is x + (x - 2) = 2x - 2.

The total number of goals scored by team B is the sum of the goals scored in the first and second half, which is (x - 2) + 4(x - 2) = 5(x - 2).

Since the total number of goals scored in the match is the sum of the goals scored by both teams, we can set up the equation: 2x - 2 + 5(x - 2) = total goals.

Simplifying the equation, we get 2x - 2 + 5x - 10 = total goals, which simplifies to 7x - 12 = total goals.

We are given that team A scores 4 goals in the first half. So, x = 4. Substituting x = 4 into the equation 7x - 12 = total goals, we get 7(4) - 12 = total goals.

7(4) - 12 = 28 - 12 = 16.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much chalk the teacher has left after Monday and then determine how many days it will last.

The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk. He uses 45% of it on Monday, so the amount of chalk used is 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches.

The amount of chalk left is 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches.

Since the teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches, we need to find out how many days the remaining 2.75 inches will last at a rate of 20% usage per day.

Let's set up an equation to represent the situation:

2.75 = 5 * (1 - 0.20)^n

where n is the number of days.

Simplifying the equation:

2.75 = 5 * (0.80)^n

Divide both sides by 5:

0.55 = (0.80)^n

To solve for n, we can take the logarithm of both sides:

log(0.55) = n * log(0.80)

Now, we can use a calculator to find the value of n:

n = log(0.55) / log(0.80)
n ≈ 3.93

Since the teacher can't use a fraction of a day, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the teacher has approximately 4 days before he has to recycle the piece of chalk.

Mike bought 5 face masks. 

Three times the number of face masks Mike bought is 3 * 5 = 15.

Johnny bought 2 more than three times as many as Mike, so we add 2 to 15: 15 + 2 = 17.

Therefore, Johnny bought 17 face masks.

The total number of teeth the dentist works on is 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 teeth.

To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we divide the total number of teeth the dentist works on by the total number of James' teeth and multiply by 100.

"To find the total cost of the milk that Mr. Marcellus purchased, we need to multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon. 

Total cost = Number of gallons * Cost per gallon
Total cost = 4000 * $3.5
Total cost = $14,000

Since 2/5 of the milk was expired, we need to find 2/5 of 4000 gallons to determine the amount that was returned.

Expired milk = (2/5) * 4000
Expired milk = (2 * 4000) / 5
Expired milk = 8000 / 5
Expired milk = 1600 gallons

The refund amount will be the cost of the expired milk, which is the same as the total cost per gallon multiplied by the number of expired gallons.

Refund amount = Total cost per gallon * Expired milk
Refund amount = $3.5 * 1600
Refund amount = $5600

"Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be expressed as:

W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be expressed as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

We can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:

C + 25 = (5/3)(C + 7)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2:

20 = C

Colin is 20 years old now.

"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we first need to determine the total number of books he can buy with $27,000. 

Since he can buy 100 books for $500, we can find the total number of books he can buy by dividing the total amount he has ($27,000) by the cost of 100 books ($500).

Total number of books = Total amount / Cost per 100 books
Total number of books = $27,000 / $500
Total number of books = 54

Now that we know Bob can buy a total of 54 books, we need to divide this number by the number of schools (3) to find out how many books he can buy per school.

Books per school = Total number of books / Number of schools
Books per school = 54 / 3

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, 2 apples fell out of the tree. Newton picked up 2 apples, put one in his pocket, and threw the other into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. This means he now has 1 apple in his pocket and 5 new apples. 

So, the total number of apples he has now is 1 (in his pocket) + 5 (new apples) = 6 apples.

He then threw 1 apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out. This means he now has 6 (previous apples) + 1 (thrown apple) + 6 (new apples) = 13 apples.

However, he picked up all the remaining apples, which means he picked up the 6 new apples that fell out after throwing the apple at the tree. So, the total number of apples he brought home is 13 - 1 (the apple he threw) = 12 apples.

6 friends * 6 slices per friend = 36 slices

Next, let's calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten by Kate's friends: 
6 friends * 4 slices per friend = 24 slices

Since the cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices and the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, we need to find the minimum number of whole pizzas required for each type. 

For the cheese pizza, we need to divide the total number of slices eaten by the number of slices per pizza: 
36 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas

For the pepperoni pizza, we need to divide the total number of slices eaten by the number of slices per pizza: 
24 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas

Since Kate needs to buy whole pizzas, she needs to buy at least 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas.

Therefore, Kate needs to buy a total of 3 + 3 = 6 pizzas.

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. To find the rate at which snowballs melt, we need to convert this to snowballs per minute. Since 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, the rate of melting is 2/15 snowballs per minute.

Now, let's find the net rate of building snowballs. The net rate is the rate of building minus the rate of melting. 

Net rate = (1/3) - (2/15)
To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 15. 

Net rate = (5/15) - (2/15) = 3/15 = 1/5 snowballs per minute.

Now, we need to find how long it will take Jay to build 60 snowballs at a net rate of 1/5 snowballs per minute. 

Time = Total snowballs / Net rate
Time = 60 / (1/5)
Time = 60 * 5
Time = 300 minutes

Therefore, it will take Jay 300 minutes to build 60 snowballs.

The final answer is: 300"
"To solve this problem, we need to find Jim's age at the time Digimon was released, and then add 20 years to it to find his current age.

Let's denote Jim's age at the time Digimon was released as 'x'. Since John was twice as old as Jim at that time, John's age would be 2x.

We are given that John is 28 now, so we can set up the equation: 2x + 20 = 28, where 20 represents the 20 years that have passed since the release of Digimon.

Now, let's solve for x:
2x + 20 = 28
Subtract 20 from both sides:
2x = 8
Divide both sides by 2:
x = 4

So, Jim was 4 years old when Digimon was released. To find Jim's current age, we add 20 years to his age at that time:
Jim's current age = 4 + 20 = 24

The final answer is: 24"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of slices each person ate and then add them up.

Doxa ate 1 slice. 
Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so her sister ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.
Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so her brother ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

Now, let's add up the number of slices each person ate: 
1 (Doxa) + 2 (her sister) + 3 (her brother) = 6

The final numerical answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, the remaining bandages after the first day are x - 38 + 50.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. The remaining bandages after the second day are (x - 38 + 50) - 28.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they had 2 * 50 = 100 bandages added. They used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages. The remaining bandages after the third day are ((x - 38 + 50) - 28) + 100 - 25.

We are given that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. So, we can set up the equation:

(x - 38 + 50) - 28 + 100 - 25 = 78

Simplifying the equation:

x - 38 + 50 - 28 + 100 - 25 = 78
x + 57 = 78

Subtracting 57 from both sides:

x = 21

The initial number of bandages is 21. 

The final answer is: 21"

The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch, and May's hair was cut from 10 inches to 8 inches. So, the length of hair cut is 10 - 8 = 2 inches. 

The cost of the haircut is 2 inches * $30 per inch = $60.

The cost of the color is $40.

The total cost is $60 (haircut) + $40 (color) = $100.

The final answer is: $100"
"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to calculate her regular earnings and her attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her regular earnings. Jen works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week. Since there are 4 weeks in April, we need to calculate the total number of working hours in April.

Total working hours in April = 7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week * 4 weeks
Total working hours in April = 180 hours

Now, let's calculate her regular earnings. Her hourly rate is $1.5.

Regular earnings = Total working hours in April * Hourly rate
Regular earnings = 180 hours * $1.5/hour
Regular earnings = $270

Next, let's calculate her attendance bonus. She receives an additional $10 for complete attendance.

Attendance bonus = $10

Now, let's calculate her total earnings for April.

Total earnings = Regular earnings + Attendance bonus
Total earnings = $270 + $10
Total earnings = $280

The final answer is: $280"

"To find the total amount of blood in ten sharks, we first need to determine the amount of blood in one shark. Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and a whale has 40 gallons of blood, we can calculate the amount of blood in one shark as follows:

Blood in one shark = 3 * Blood in one whale
Blood in one shark = 3 * 40
Blood in one shark = 120 gallons

Now, to find the total amount of blood in ten sharks, we multiply the amount of blood in one shark by 10:

Total blood in ten sharks = Blood in one shark * 10
Total blood in ten sharks = 120 * 10
Total blood in ten sharks = 1200 gallons

The final answer is: 1200"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. 50 people entered the restaurant in the morning.
2. At 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant. 
3. After that, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is 2 * 40 = 80 people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first (50) had entered the restaurant, which is 3 * 50 = 150 people.

Now, let's calculate the total number of people who entered the restaurant:

Total = 50 (morning) + 40 (at 10:00) + 80 (after 10:00) + 150 (by evening)
Total = 50 + 40 + 80 + 150

"To find the total number of pens Alain has, we first need to determine the number of red pens and black pens separately.

Since Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens, and each pack has 5 pens, the total number of red pens is 5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 red pens.

It is given that Alain's mom bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens. Therefore, the number of black pens is 2 * 25 = 50 black pens.

To find the total number of pens Alain has, we add the number of red pens and black pens: 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens.

The final answer is: 75"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find the cost of one bottle of scotch. Since John buys 10 bottles for $600, we can divide the total cost by the number of bottles to get the cost per bottle:

Cost per bottle of scotch = Total cost / Number of bottles
= $600 / 10
= $60

Now, we know that John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch. Since he buys 10 bottles of scotch, he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The cost of cognac is 50% more than the cost of scotch. To find the cost of one bottle of cognac, we need to calculate 50% of the cost of scotch and add it to the cost of scotch:

Cost of scotch = $60
50% of $60 = 0.5 * $60 = $30
Cost of cognac = Cost of scotch + 50% of cost of scotch
= $60 + $30
= $90

Now, we can find the total cost of cognac by multiplying the cost per bottle by the number of bottles:

Total cost of cognac = Cost per bottle of cognac * Number of bottles of cognac
= $90 * 20
= $1800

Finally, we can find the total amount John spends by adding the cost of scotch and the cost of cognac:

Total amount spent = Total cost of scotch + Total cost of cognac
= $600 + $1800
= $2400

The final answer is: $2400"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of trees planted on the first day and the second day separately, and then add them together.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees and twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which is 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees. So, the total number of trees planted on the first day is 20 + 40 = 60.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees than on the first day, which is 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day, which is 40 + (1/4 * 40) = 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees. So, the total number of trees planted on the second day is 30 + 50 = 80.

The total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 60 + 80 = 140.

"To find the amount of root beer available for each person to drink during the party, we need to calculate the total amount of root beer remaining after all the events.

Initially, Fred made 24 gallons of root beer.

On the first day, 4 gallons were consumed by his children, so the remaining amount is:
24 - 4 = 20 gallons

On the second day, 7 gallons were spilled, so the remaining amount is:
20 - 7 = 13 gallons

On the third day, 5 gallons were consumed by Ronnie, so the remaining amount is:
13 - 5 = 8 gallons

On the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party, and they shared the remaining root beer equally. To find the amount each person got, we divide the remaining amount by the number of people:
8 / 3 = 2.67 gallons

So, each person got approximately 2.67 gallons of root beer to drink during the party.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2.67}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by translating the given information into a mathematical equation. Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge as 'x'. The problem states that ""eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" can be represented as 4x + 8. This expression is equal to 40, according to the problem.

So, the equation is: 4x + 8 = 40

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate the variable 'x'. We can do this by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:

4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for 'x':

4x / 4 = 32 / 4
x = 8

Therefore, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the number of fish with red stripes, we first calculate one-third of the total number of fish. 

One-third of 66 is 66 / 3 = 22.

Now, we know that 22 fish have red stripes. To find the number of remaining fish, we subtract the number of fish with red stripes from the total number of fish.

Remaining fish = Total fish - Fish with red stripes
Remaining fish = 66 - 22
Remaining fish = 44

Next, we find the number of fish with blue stripes, which is 5/11 of the remaining fish.

Number of fish with blue stripes = (5/11) * Remaining fish
Number of fish with blue stripes = (5/11) * 44
Number of fish with blue stripes = 20

Now, we need to find the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes. We add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes.

Total fish with red and blue stripes = Fish with red stripes + Fish with blue stripes
Total fish with red and blue stripes = 22 + 20
Total fish with red and blue stripes = 42

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Amy had 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each, so she had a total of 2 * 4 = 8 eyeshadow colors from the palettes.

She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 eyeshadow colors each, so she had a total of 3 * 6 = 18 eyeshadow colors from the makeup sets.

In total, Amy had 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors.

Her sister stole one of the palettes, which means Amy lost 4 eyeshadow colors (since each palette has 4 colors).

Now, Amy has 26 - 4 = 22 eyeshadow colors left.

Amy then uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. Since each makeup set has 6 eyeshadow colors, half of that is 6 / 2 = 3 eyeshadow colors.

So, Amy uses up 3 eyeshadow colors from one makeup set.

Now, Amy has 22 - 3 = 19 eyeshadow colors left.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. First, we find the height of the two-story house. Since it's 7 times as high as Mattison, we multiply his height by 7:
   Height of the house = 60 * 7 = 420 inches

2. Next, we find the height of the first floor. It's thrice as high as Mattison:
   Height of the first floor = 60 * 3 = 180 inches

3. Since the total height of the house is 420 inches, and the first floor is 180 inches, we can find the height of the second floor by subtracting the height of the first floor from the total height of the house:
   Height of the second floor = 420 - 180 = 240 inches

4. Finally, to find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to find the height of the second floor to the ceiling, which is the same as the height of the first floor, and then subtract it from the height of the second floor:
   Height of the roof from the second floor's floor = Height of the second floor - Height of the first floor = 240 - 180 = 60 inches

"To find the number of shells found by team Gogetters, we first need to determine the number of shells found by team Alphas and team The finders.

Team Alphas found 40% of the total 700 shells. To find 40% of 700, we multiply 700 by 0.4:

700 * 0.4 = 280 shells found by team Alphas.

The remaining shells are 700 - 280 = 420 shells.

Team The finders found 60% of the remaining 420 shells. To find 60% of 420, we multiply 420 by 0.6:

420 * 0.6 = 252 shells found by team The finders.

Now, we subtract the shells found by team Alphas and team The finders from the total to find the number of shells found by team Gogetters:

"To find the combined capacity of both schools, we first need to determine the capacity of John's school. 

Since each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, and Ali's class has 120 students, we can find the capacity of one of John's classes by multiplying 120 by 1/8.

Capacity of one of John's classes = 120 * (1/8) = 15 students

Since John has two classes, we can find the total capacity of his school by multiplying the capacity of one class by 2.

Capacity of John's school = 15 * 2 = 30 students

Now, we can find the combined capacity of both schools by adding the capacity of Ali's school (which is 120 students) to the capacity of John's school (which is 30 students).

Combined capacity of both schools = 120 + 30 = 150 students

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total interest Stephen owes his sister and then subtract the total amount he has paid in the 11 months from the total amount he owes, including interest.

First, let's calculate the total interest Stephen owes his sister. The interest rate is 2% of the principal amount, which is $300. 

Interest = 2% of $300 = 0.02 * $300 = $6

Now, let's calculate the total amount Stephen owes his sister, including the interest. 

Total amount owed = Principal + Interest = $300 + $6 = $306

Next, let's calculate the total amount Stephen pays in the 11 months. He pays $25 per month for 11 months.

Total amount paid in 11 months = $25 * 11 = $275

Now, let's calculate the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month. This is the difference between the total amount he owes, including interest, and the total amount he has paid in the 11 months.

"To find the total number of jelly beans in the jar, we first need to calculate the volume of the jar. The jar has a square base with a side length of 6 inches and a height of 15 inches. The volume of a rectangular prism (such as the jar) is given by the formula V = lwh, where l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height.

Given that the base is square, the length and width are the same, so we can calculate the volume as V = 6 * 6 * 15 = 540 cubic inches.

Since the jelly beans have a volume of 0.15 cubic inches, we can calculate the total number of jelly beans in the jar by dividing the volume of the jar by the volume of a single jelly bean. However, we need to account for the packing efficiency, which is 80%. This means that the actual number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar is 80% of the calculated number.

First, let's calculate the total number of jelly beans without considering the packing efficiency: 540 / 0.15 = 3600.

To account for the packing efficiency, we multiply this number by 0.8: 3600 * 0.8 = 2880.

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we can calculate the number of red jelly beans by multiplying the total number of jelly beans by 0.3: 2880 * 0.3 = 864.

However, we are given that the true number of red jelly beans in the container is 900. To find out how far off Tim's guess was, we need to know what his guess was. Since we don't have this information, we can't calculate the exact difference. 

However, we can calculate the percentage difference between the true number of red jelly beans and the calculated number of red jelly beans: ((true number - calculated number) / true number) * 100 = ((900 - 864) / 900) * 100 = 4%.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, the bus had 20 people. 

At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus became 20 + 40 = 60.

At the second stop, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. Since 40 people entered at the first station, 3/4 of 40 is (3/4) * 40 = 30. So, 30 people entered the bus at the second stop. The total number of people on the bus became 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus became 2 * 90 = 180.

The bus has a capacity of 200 people. To find the remaining spaces, we subtract the current number of people from the capacity: 200 - 180 = 20.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of visits for the first 5 years and the total cost of visits for the next 3 years.

For the first 5 years, the cost of one visit is $2. Since Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year, the annual cost is 3 * $2 = $6. For 5 years, the total cost is 5 * $6 = $30.

After 5 years, the cost of one visit has increased by 150%. This means the new cost of one visit is $2 + (150% of $2) = $2 + $3 = $5. Since Pauline still visits the museum 3 times a year, the new annual cost is 3 * $5 = $15. For the next 3 years, the total cost is 3 * $15 = $45.

The total cost of all visits to the museum is the sum of the cost for the first 5 years and the cost for the next 3 years: $30 + $45 = $75.

"To determine how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of groups required and then multiply that by the time it takes for each group to try the escape room.

There are 4 grades (4-7) with 10 students in each grade, so the total number of students is 4 * 10 = 40.

Since only the top 10 students in each grade get to try the escape room, we need to find the total number of students who will try the escape room. Since there are 4 grades, we need to find the total number of students who will try the escape room in each grade, which is 10 students per grade. So, the total number of students who will try the escape room is 4 * 10 = 40.

However, since only 8 students can try the escape room at a time, we need to divide the total number of students who will try the escape room by 8 to find the total number of groups required. 

40 / 8 = 5

Since each group takes 45 minutes to try the escape room, we multiply the number of groups by the time it takes for each group to try the escape room.

"To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length can be represented as 4x.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, and it is divided into two pieces. Therefore, the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is equal to 40 feet. We can write this as an equation:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece (x = 8), we can find the length of the longer piece by multiplying x by 4:

Longer piece = 4x = 4(8) = 32

The final answer is: 32"
"To determine the amount of seasoning Aiden needs, we first need to find out how many pounds of ground beef he requires to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound to find the total pounds of meat needed.

Total meatballs needed = 80
Meatballs per pound = 16

Total pounds of meat needed = Total meatballs needed / Meatballs per pound
Total pounds of meat needed = 80 / 16
Total pounds of meat needed = 5

Now that we know Aiden needs 5 pounds of ground beef, we can find out how much seasoning he needs by multiplying the total pounds of meat by the amount of seasoning per pound.

Seasoning per pound = 2 tablespoons
Total pounds of meat = 5

Total seasoning needed = Seasoning per pound * Total pounds of meat
Total seasoning needed = 2 * 5
Total seasoning needed = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total width of the windows, we need to multiply the width of one window by the total number of windows. 

Width of one window = 35 inches
Number of windows = 5

Total width of windows = Width of one window * Number of windows
Total width of windows = 35 * 5
Total width of windows = 175 inches

Since Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, we need to multiply the total width by 2.

Fabric needed = 2 * Total width of windows
Fabric needed = 2 * 175
Fabric needed = 350 inches

The final answer is: 350"
"To find the total cost of the call, we need to calculate the cost for the first 16 minutes and the cost for the remaining minutes. 

The cost for the first 16 minutes is 16 * $0.25 = $4. 

The remaining minutes are 36 - 16 = 20 minutes. The cost for these minutes is 20 * $0.2 = $4.

The total cost is the sum of the cost for the first 16 minutes and the cost for the remaining minutes: $4 + $4 = $8.

"To find the total inches of rain on Tuesday, we first need to determine the amount of rain that fell on Monday, which is given as 2 inches. 

Next, we need to calculate the amount of rain expected on Tuesday, which is 1 more inch than twice the amount that fell on Monday. 

Twice the amount that fell on Monday is 2 * 2 = 4 inches. 

One more inch than that is 4 + 1 = 5 inches.

Therefore, the total inches of rain expected on Tuesday is 5 inches.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's denote the number of cupcakes as C and the number of brownies as B. We are given that Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, so we can write this as B = 3C - 2.

We also know that each person gets two treats, and there are five people in the class. Therefore, the total number of treats is 2 * 5 = 10.

Since the total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, we can write this as C + B = 10.

Substituting the expression for B from the first equation into the second equation, we get C + (3C - 2) = 10.

Simplifying the equation, we get 4C - 2 = 10.

Adding 2 to both sides of the equation, we get 4C = 12.

Dividing both sides of the equation by 4, we get C = 3.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the 20% discount. 

The original cost of the manicure and pedicure is $35 + $40 = $75. 

The 20% discount on $75 is 0.20 * $75 = $15. 

So, the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure is $75 - $15 = $60.

Since Karen wants to add nail art on each of her fingers, and assuming she has 10 fingers (2 hands with 5 fingers each), the total cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost for Karen would be the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure plus the cost of the nail art, which is $60 + $30 = $90.

The final numerical answer is: $90"
"To find the total number of magazines Susan receives per year, we need to calculate the number of issues from each magazine and add them together.

The first 3 magazines send 12 issues each, so the total number of issues from these magazines is 3 * 12 = 36.

The second magazine sends 6 issues per year.

The third magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6-issue magazine, which is 4 * 6 = 24 issues per year.

Now, we add the total number of issues from all magazines: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

Therefore, Susan receives 66 magazines every year.

66"
"To solve this problem, we can start by using the information that Samantha has 27 paintings and that she has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley. This means Shelley has 27 + 12 = 39 paintings.

We also know that Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. To find out how many paintings Kim has, we need to subtract 8 from the number of paintings Shelley has. 

So, the number of paintings Kim has is 39 - 8 = 31.

The final answer is: 31"
"To find the price of the toy after the discount in January, we need to calculate the price after the increase in December and then apply the decrease in January.

The initial price of the toy in November is $40.

In December, the price increased by 80%. To find the new price, we multiply the initial price by 1.8 (100% + 80% = 180%, or 1 + 0.8 = 1.8).

Price in December = $40 * 1.8 = $72

In January, the price decreased by 50%. To find the new price, we multiply the price in December by 0.5 (100% - 50% = 50%, or 1 - 0.5 = 0.5).

Price in January = $72 * 0.5 = $36

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"To find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to calculate the revenue from the standard rate lessons and the reduced rate lessons separately and then add them together.

The standard rate is $80 per hour, and Charlie has 4 lessons at this rate. So, the revenue from standard rate lessons is 4 * $80 = $320.

The reduced rate is 25% less than the standard rate, which is 80 - (80 * 0.25) = 80 - 20 = $60 per hour. Charlie has 2 lessons at this rate. So, the revenue from reduced rate lessons is 2 * $60 = $120.

Now, we add the revenue from both types of lessons to find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day: $320 + $120 = $440.

The final answer is: $440"
"To find the mean score, we need to add up all the scores and then divide by the total number of scores.

First, let's add up the scores: 
50 + 80 = 130
130 + 80 = 210
210 + 60 = 270
270 + 40 = 310
310 + 90 = 400
400 + 100 = 500
500 + 70 = 570
570 + 60 = 630

The sum of the scores is 630.

Next, we need to count the total number of scores, which is 9.

Now, we divide the sum of the scores by the total number of scores to find the mean:
630 / 9 = 70

The final answer is: 70"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of pomelos Eve had left after giving some away. Since she was left with 1/4 of the original amount, we can calculate this as follows:

Original number of pomelos = 20
Number of pomelos left = 1/4 * 20 = 5

This means Eve was left with 5 pomelos. To find out how many pomelos she gave away, we subtract the number of pomelos left from the original number:

Number of pomelos given away = Original number of pomelos - Number of pomelos left
= 20 - 5
= 15

Therefore, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

15"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. Walter bought 60 apples and ate 2/5 of them. To find out how many apples he ate, we multiply 60 by 2/5.

   Number of apples eaten = 60 * (2/5) = 24 apples

2. Now, we need to find out how many apples are remaining. We subtract the number of apples eaten from the total number of apples.

   Remaining apples = 60 - 24 = 36 apples

3. Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples. To find out how many apples he gave away, we multiply the remaining apples by 25% (or 0.25).

   Apples given to sister = 36 * 0.25 = 9 apples

4. Now, we need to find out how many apples are left after giving some to his sister.

   Remaining apples = 36 - 9 = 27 apples

5. Walter sold the remaining apples to his uncle at $3 each. To find out how much money he received, we multiply the remaining apples by the price per apple.

   Money received = 27 * 3 = $81

The final answer is: $81"
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the total number of novels Regina wrote this year as 'x'. We know that 9 novels is 3 quarters of the total number of novels she wrote this year. 

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

9 = (3/4)x

To find the value of 'x', we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4/3 to isolate 'x':

x = 9 * (4/3)

x = 12

So, Regina wrote 12 novels this year. 

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the distance covered by Michael in 3 days, we need to calculate the total distance he travels in that time. 

First, we need to find the total hours he travels in 3 days. Since there are 24 hours in a day, the total hours he travels is 3 days * 24 hours/day = 72 hours.

Now, we can find the distance he travels in 72 hours by multiplying his average speed by the total hours: 50 km/hr * 72 hr = 3600 km.

To find the percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas that he has covered, we need to divide the distance he traveled (3600 km) by the total distance (6000 km) and multiply by 100: (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100 = 60%.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Madeline ate 6 grapes.
2. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make a full glass, so he used 5 * 6 = 30 grapes.
3. The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.
4. Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies. Each pie requires 12 grapes, so the total number of grapes used by their mother is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.
5. The total number of grapes used by all three is 36 + 48 = 84 grapes.
6. Since Madeline ate 6 grapes initially, the total number of grapes at the beginning is 84 + 6 = 90 grapes.

"To find the total cost of making macaroni and cheese, we need to calculate the cost of the pasta, cheddar cheese, and gruyere cheese.

The cost of the pasta is $1.00 per box. Since Bud makes it once a week, he buys 52 boxes in a year (52 weeks). The total cost of the pasta is 52 * $1.00 = $52.00.

The cost of the cheddar cheese is $3.00. Since Bud makes it once a week, he buys 52 * $3.00 = $156.00 worth of cheddar cheese in a year.

The cost of the gruyere cheese is twice the cost of the cheddar cheese, which is 2 * $3.00 = $6.00. Since Bud makes it once a week, he buys 52 * $6.00 = $312.00 worth of gruyere cheese in a year.

The total cost of making macaroni and cheese in a year is the sum of the costs of the pasta, cheddar cheese, and gruyere cheese: $52.00 + $156.00 + $312.00 = $520.00.

The final answer is: $520.00"
"To find the total number of classrooms the custodian needs to clean, we already know that number is 80. 

The custodian has 5 days to complete the task. We need to find out how many minutes they have to work in total. Since they work 8 hours a day, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 8 hours by 60 minutes per hour to get the total minutes per day: 8 * 60 = 480 minutes per day.

Since they have 5 days, we multiply the total minutes per day by 5 to get the total minutes for the entire task: 480 * 5 = 2400 minutes.

Now, we know it takes them 15 minutes per classroom, so we multiply the total number of classrooms by the time per classroom: 80 * 15 = 1200 minutes.

To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms, we divide the total time spent cleaning by the total time available and multiply by 100: (1200 / 2400) * 100 = 50%.

"To solve this problem, let's first determine the capacity of each shelf. 

Let's denote the capacity of a middle shelf as 'x'. Since the bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, its capacity is 2x. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so its capacity is 2x - 5.

We know that each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books. Therefore, we can set up the equation 2x = 10, since there are two middle shelves.

Solving for x, we get x = 10 / 2 = 5. 

Now that we know the capacity of a middle shelf, we can find the capacity of the bottom and top shelves. The bottom shelf can hold 2x = 2 * 5 = 10 books. The top shelf can hold 2x - 5 = 5 books.

The total capacity of the three shelves is 10 + 10 + 5 = 25 books.

Since Elly has 110 books, we need to find out how many sets of 25 books she needs to hold all of them. 

110 / 25 = 4.4

Since we can't have a fraction of a bookcase, Elly needs 5 bookcases to hold all of her books.

"To find Rose's profit, we first need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

The cost of five dozens of eggs is $2.40 per dozen. Since one dozen is equal to 12 eggs, five dozens will be 5 * 12 = 60 eggs. The total cost is 5 * $2.40 = $12.

Now, let's calculate the total revenue. Rose will sell the eggs for $1 for 3 eggs. Since she has 60 eggs, the total number of sets of 3 eggs is 60 / 3 = 20. The total revenue is 20 * $1 = $20.

The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost. So, the profit is $20 - $12 = $8.

"To find the cost of each stick of jerky, we need to first calculate the total cost of the bag after the discount and then divide it by the number of sticks.

The original price of the bag is $18.00, and there's a $3.00 discount. So, the discounted price is $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00.

Since the price is in dollars, we need to convert it to cents for uniformity. There are 100 cents in a dollar, so the discounted price in cents is $15.00 * 100 = 1500 cents.

Now, we know that there are 30 sticks in a bag. To find the cost of each stick, we divide the total cost in cents by the number of sticks: 1500 cents / 30 sticks = 50 cents per stick.

First, let's find the total number of questions Audrey needs to answer correctly to pass the 6th grade. Since she needs to get 70% of the total questions correct, we need to find the total number of questions. However, the total number of questions is not given. We can assume that the total number of questions is the sum of the questions in both tests, which is 70 + 40 = 110 questions.

Now, let's find the total number of questions Audrey needs to answer correctly to pass the 6th grade. 70% of 110 questions is 0.7 * 110 = 77 questions.

Next, let's find the number of questions Audrey got correct on the first test. She got 60% of 70 questions correct, which is 0.6 * 70 = 42 questions.

Now, let's subtract the number of questions she got correct on the first test from the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly to pass the 6th grade. 77 - 42 = 35 questions.

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions correct on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as 's' and the number of blueberry cubes as 'b'. We are given that the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, so we can write this as:

b = 5s - 4

We are also given that the total number of ice cubes is 116, which is the sum of strawberry and blueberry cubes:

s + b = 116

Substituting the expression for b from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

s + (5s - 4) = 116

Combine like terms:

6s - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides:

6s = 120

Divide both sides by 6:

s = 20

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting s into the first equation:

b = 5s - 4
b = 5(20) - 4
b = 100 - 4
b = 96

"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of flashlights and the number of candles separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of flashlights. There are 4 people in the family, and each person has a flashlight. So, the total number of flashlights is 4.

Next, let's calculate the number of candles. There are 8 rooms in the house, and half of them have 4 small candles each, while the other half have 5 medium candles each. Half of 8 is 4, so there are 4 rooms with 4 small candles each and 4 rooms with 5 medium candles each.

The total number of small candles is 4 rooms * 4 candles per room = 16 small candles.

The total number of medium candles is 4 rooms * 5 candles per room = 20 medium candles.

The total number of candles is 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles.

Now, we add the number of flashlights and the number of candles together to get the total number of candles and flashlights.

Total number of candles and flashlights = 4 flashlights + 36 candles = 40

"To find the total time it takes to solve the Rubik's cube, we need to calculate the time taken for each side and add them up.

The first side takes 5 minutes. 
The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so they take 2 * 5 = 10 minutes each.
The last two sides each take half as long as the first side, so they take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes each.

Now, let's add up the time taken for all sides:
5 (first side) + 10 (second side) + 10 (third side) + 2.5 (fourth side) + 2.5 (fifth side) = 30 minutes

The total time it takes to solve the Rubik's cube is 30 minutes.

"To find the total amount of water Crista needs, we need to calculate the water required for each type of plant and then sum them up.

First, let's find the number of plants that need a quarter of a cup of water. Since Crista has 20 plants in total, and 4 need half a cup and 8 need 1 cup, the number of plants that need a quarter of a cup is 20 - 4 - 8 = 8.

Now, let's calculate the total water required for each type of plant:

- 4 plants need half a cup of water, so the total water required for these plants is 4 * 0.5 = 2 cups.
- 8 plants need 1 cup of water, so the total water required for these plants is 8 * 1 = 8 cups.
- 8 plants need a quarter of a cup of water, so the total water required for these plants is 8 * 0.25 = 2 cups.

Now, let's sum up the total water required for all the plants: 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 cups.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time it takes for Phineas to cover the distance on land and in water separately, and then add them together.

Since Phineas needs to cover 200 yards, half of the distance is 100 yards on land and the other half is also 100 yards in water.

Time taken to cover 100 yards on land at a speed of 20 yards per minute is:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 100 yards / 20 yards/minute
Time = 5 minutes

Time taken to cover 100 yards in water at a speed of 10 yards per minute is:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 100 yards / 10 yards/minute
Time = 10 minutes

Total time taken to return home is the sum of the time taken on land and in water:
Total Time = Time on land + Time in water
Total Time = 5 minutes + 10 minutes
Total Time = 15 minutes

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of the additional phones and then add the cost of the main phone to it.

Let's assume the cost of each additional phone is x. Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of the main phone is 2x.

We are given that the main phone plan costs $20, which is equal to 2x. So, we can set up the equation:

2x = 20

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 20 / 2
x = 10

Now that we know the cost of each additional phone is $10, we can find the total cost of the additional phones. There are 4 additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is:

4x = 4 * 10
4x = 40

The cost of the main phone is $20, and the cost of the additional phones is $40. Therefore, the total cost of the whole phone plan is:

"To find out how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to calculate the total number of doughnuts he sells in a day and then multiply it by the number of days in June.

First, let's calculate the total number of doughnuts Derrick makes in a day. Since he makes 10 dozen doughnuts, and 1 dozen is equal to 12, we can calculate the total number of doughnuts as follows:

10 dozen * 12 doughnuts/dozen = 120 doughnuts/day

Since Derrick sells all the doughnuts, we can assume he sells 120 doughnuts every day.

Now, let's calculate the total number of days in June. June has 30 days.

To find out the total number of doughnuts Derrick sells in June, we multiply the number of doughnuts he sells in a day by the number of days in June:

120 doughnuts/day * 30 days = 3600 doughnuts

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Derrick makes in June by multiplying the total number of doughnuts sold by the price per doughnut:

3600 doughnuts * $2/doughnut = $7200

The final answer is: $7200"
"To find out how many days Jade needs to upload all her photos, we need to divide the total number of photos by the number of photos she can upload per day.

First, let's find out how many photos Jade can upload per day. Since she uploads 6 batches of 7 photos each day, we multiply the number of batches by the number of photos per batch:

6 batches/day * 7 photos/batch = 42 photos/day

Now, we divide the total number of photos by the number of photos Jade can upload per day:

210 photos / 42 photos/day = 5 days

So, Jade will need 5 days to upload all her photos.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total cost of dry-cleaning, we need to calculate the cost for each item and then multiply it by the number of weeks.

The cost for blouses is $5.00 per blouse, and Alicia has 5 blouses. So, the weekly cost for blouses is 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

The cost for the skirt is $6.00 per skirt, and Alicia has 1 skirt. So, the weekly cost for the skirt is 1 * $6.00 = $6.00.

The cost for pants is $8.00 per pair, and Alicia has 2 pants. So, the weekly cost for pants is 2 * $8.00 = $16.00.

The total weekly cost is the sum of the costs for blouses, skirt, and pants: $25.00 + $6.00 + $16.00 = $47.00.

To find the total cost for 5 weeks, we multiply the weekly cost by 5: $47.00 * 5 = $235.00.

The final answer is: $235.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate John's new speaking speed after training. 

His original speed is 150 WPM (words per minute). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster, so his new speed is 150 * 2.5 = 375 WPM.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of words in 10 pages. Each page has 450 words, so 10 pages have 10 * 450 = 4500 words.

Now, we can calculate the time it would take John to speak 4500 words at his new speed. Time = Total words / Speed = 4500 / 375 = 12 minutes.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the total number of people he saw on the first three days and add it to the total number of people he saw on the remaining days.

On the first day, Conor saw 50 people.

On the second day, there were 20 more people than on the first day, so the number of people on the second day is 50 + 20 = 70.

On the third day, the number of people was twice the number on the second day, so the number of people on the third day is 2 * 70 = 140.

The total number of people on the first three days is 50 + 70 + 140 = 260.

Since there are 7 days in a week, and Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the remaining 4 days, the total number of people he saw on the remaining days is 60 * 4 = 240.

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 260 + 240 = 500.

The final answer is: 500"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps and calculate the number of kernels that popped in each 30-second interval.

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped.
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount popped, so 3 * 20 = 60 kernels popped.
3. In the next 30 seconds, four times the rate of the previous interval popped, so 4 * 60 = 240 kernels popped.
4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slowed down to half the rate of the previous interval, so 0.5 * 240 = 120 kernels popped.

Now, we need to calculate the number of kernels that popped from residual heat. A quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds popped from residual heat, so 0.25 * 120 = 30 kernels.

To find the total number of kernels that popped, we add the kernels from each interval: 20 + 60 + 240 + 120 + 30 = 370 kernels.

The final answer is: 370"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of lemonade Tim needs to make, including the extra gallon for Allen. Since Tim needs to make 4 gallons of regular lemonade and 1 gallon of extra tart lemonade, the total amount of lemonade is 4 + 1 = 5 gallons.

Since each gallon of lemonade requires 1 cup of fresh lemon juice, and Tim needs to make 5 gallons, he will need 5 cups of lemon juice in total.

Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the total number of lemons needed by multiplying the total cups of juice required by 6. 

Total lemons needed = 5 cups * 6 lemons/cup = 30 lemons.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the total amount of dog food needed for a week, we need to calculate the daily consumption of both breeds and then multiply it by 7.

The German Shepherds consume 5 kilograms each per day, and there are 3 of them. So, their total daily consumption is 5 kg/day * 3 = 15 kg/day.

The Bulldogs consume 3 kilograms each per day, and there are 2 of them. So, their total daily consumption is 3 kg/day * 2 = 6 kg/day.

The total daily consumption of both breeds is 15 kg/day (German Shepherds) + 6 kg/day (Bulldogs) = 21 kg/day.

To find the total weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7: 21 kg/day * 7 days = 147 kg.

Therefore, the Kennel house will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week.

"To find the total number of animal legs on the farm, we need to calculate the total number of legs from both the 2-legged and 4-legged animals.

The 2-legged animals contribute 2 legs each, so the total number of legs from 2-legged animals is 10 * 2 = 20.

The 4-legged animals contribute 4 legs each, so the total number of legs from 4-legged animals is 15 * 4 = 60.

Now, we add the total number of legs from both types of animals to get the overall total: 20 + 60 = 80.

Therefore, the total number of animal legs on the farm is 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, we can start by identifying the known quantities. We know that the tower is made up of 4 blue blocks and twice as many yellow blocks, which means there are 2 * 4 = 8 yellow blocks. 

The total number of blue and yellow blocks is 4 + 8 = 12 blocks. Since the total number of blocks in the tower is 32, the number of red blocks can be found by subtracting the number of blue and yellow blocks from the total number of blocks.

Red blocks = Total blocks - (Blue blocks + Yellow blocks)
Red blocks = 32 - 12
Red blocks = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by Elvis in both directions and then find the remaining distance from his house.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled in the west direction. Distance = Speed * Time. Since Elvis traveled for 5 hours at 18mph, the distance traveled in the west direction is:

Distance = 18mph * 5 hours = 90 miles

Now, Elvis turns around and travels east for 8 hours at the same speed of 18mph. The distance traveled in the east direction is:

Distance = 18mph * 8 hours = 144 miles

Since Elvis traveled 90 miles in the west direction and 144 miles in the east direction, the net distance from his house is the difference between the two distances:

Net distance = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles

The final answer is: 54"
"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year and subtract it from the initial value.

Initial value of the boat = $9000

First year depreciation: 30% of $9000 = 0.3 * $9000 = $2700
Value after first year = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Second year depreciation: 30% of $6300 = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890
Value after second year = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Third year depreciation: 20% of $4410 = 0.2 * $4410 = $882
Value after third year = $4410 - $882 = $3528

The final value of the boat after three years is $3528.

The final answer is: $3528"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of orange and yellow candies first, and then find the remaining candies which will be pink.

Given:
- Total candies = 232
- Red candies = 54
- Orange candies = 2 * Red candies = 2 * 54 = 108
- Yellow candies = 0.5 * Red candies = 0.5 * 54 = 27

Now, let's calculate the total number of non-pink candies:
Total non-pink candies = Red candies + Orange candies + Yellow candies
Total non-pink candies = 54 + 108 + 27 = 189

To find the number of pink candies, subtract the total non-pink candies from the total number of candies:
Pink candies = Total candies - Total non-pink candies
Pink candies = 232 - 189
Pink candies = 43

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of marbles Dallas received from Mazie. Since Dallas has 21 marbles after dropping 4, we can calculate the number of marbles he received from Mazie by adding the marbles he dropped back to the total he has now.

Dallas' marbles from Mazie = Dallas' current marbles + marbles dropped
= 21 + 4
= 25

Since Mazie gave a total of 52 marbles to the twins, and Dallas received 25, we can calculate the number of marbles Darla received by subtracting the number of marbles Dallas received from the total.

Marbles given to Darla = Total marbles given - Marbles given to Dallas
= 52 - 25

"To determine the total weight of the car and its contents, we need to add the weight of the car, the luggage, and the weight of the two children. 

Total weight = weight of the car + weight of the luggage + weight of the two children
Total weight = 1200 pounds + 250 pounds + (2 * 75 pounds)
Total weight = 1200 pounds + 250 pounds + 150 pounds
Total weight = 1600 pounds

Since the force required to move the car is 1% of the total weight, we need to calculate 1% of 1600 pounds.

Force required = 1% * 1600 pounds
Force required = 0.01 * 1600 pounds
Force required = 16 pounds

"To determine the amount of crepe paper James needs, we need to calculate the perimeter of the backyard fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides. 

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2l + 2w, where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the length (l) is 20 feet and the width (w) is 15 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

P = 2(20) + 2(15)
P = 40 + 30
P = 70

Therefore, James needs 70 feet of crepe paper to go around the entire fence.

"To find the average age of Mia and Emma, we first need to determine Emma's age. Since Mia is 40 years old and they are 16 years apart in age, we can calculate Emma's age by adding 16 to Mia's age.

Emma's age = Mia's age + 16
Emma's age = 40 + 16
Emma's age = 56

Now that we know both Mia's and Emma's ages, we can find the average of their ages by adding their ages and dividing by 2.

Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2
Average age = (40 + 56) / 2
Average age = 96 / 2
Average age = 48

"To find the total cost of the place settings, we need to calculate the cost of each type of plate and then add them together.

Avery needs 12 dinner plates, and each costs $6.00, so the total cost of dinner plates is 12 * $6.00 = $72.00.

She also needs 12 bowls, and each costs $5.00, so the total cost of bowls is 12 * $5.00 = $60.00.

For the salad plates, she needs 12 as well, and each costs $4.00, so the total cost of salad plates is 12 * $4.00 = $48.00.

Now, we add the costs of all three types of plates together: $72.00 (dinner plates) + $60.00 (bowls) + $48.00 (salad plates) = $180.00.

The total amount Avery will spend on place settings is $180.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of feed consumed by the pigs in a day and then multiply it by 7 to find the total consumption for a week.

Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, so the total feed consumed by one pig in a day is 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.

Since Dexter has 5 pigs, the total feed consumed by all pigs in a day is 8 * 5 = 40 pounds.

To find the total feed consumed in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7: 40 * 7 = 280 pounds.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, so the amount left after a week is 300 - 280 = 20 pounds.

"To find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. The original price of each T-shirt is $8. Since Jake buys 2 T-shirts, the total cost of the T-shirts without the discount is 2 * $8 = $16. However, Jake gets a buy one get one 50% off deal, which means one of the T-shirts is 50% off. The discount on one T-shirt is 50% of $8, which is 0.5 * $8 = $4. So, the cost of the T-shirt with the discount is $8 - $4 = $4. Since Jake gets one T-shirt at the original price and one at the discounted price, the total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and Jake gets a 40% discount. The discount on the shoes is 40% of $40, which is 0.4 * $40 = $16. So, the cost of the shoes after the discount is $40 - $16 = $24.

- Bracelet: $8.50
Total spent: $3.50 + $15.00 + $8.50 = $27.00

Now, let's subtract the total amount spent from the amount her parents gave her:

$40 (initial amount) - $27.00 (total spent) = $13.00

Janet has $13.00 left."
"To find out how much Josh makes in 2 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of days he is open and then multiply that by the number of cars he services per day and his hourly wage.

Josh is open every day except Sunday and Wednesday, so he is open 5 days a week. In 2 weeks, he will be open for 5 days/week * 2 weeks = 10 days.

Since Josh services 3 cars a day, in 10 days, he will service 3 cars/day * 10 days = 30 cars.

Josh gets paid $4 per car, so his total earnings in 2 weeks will be 30 cars * $4/car = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To solve this problem, we need to track the number of cookies Randy has at each step.

Initially, Randy has 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies. 

1. He ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor. 
   - Oatmeal cookies: 9 - 1 = 8
   - Chocolate chip cookies: 4 - 1 = 3
   - Sugar cookies: 5 - 1 = 4

2. He ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch.
   - Oatmeal cookies: 8 - 2 = 6
   - Chocolate chip cookies: 3 (no change)
   - Sugar cookies: 4 (no change)

3. He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends.
   - Oatmeal cookies: 6 (no change)
   - Chocolate chip cookies: 3 (no change)
   - Sugar cookies: 4 - 2 = 2

4. He bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner.
   - Oatmeal cookies: 6 + 4 = 10
   - Chocolate chip cookies: 3 + 4 = 7
   - Sugar cookies: 2 + 4 = 6

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies Randy has:
Total cookies = Oatmeal cookies + Chocolate chip cookies + Sugar cookies
Total cookies = 10 + 7 + 6
Total cookies = 23

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we need to determine how many toy soldiers are in each half of the collection. Since Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers, we can divide the collection into two equal halves.

12 / 2 = 6

So, Matthew has 6 toy soldiers that the buyer is willing to pay $5 per toy for, and 6 toy soldiers that the buyer is willing to pay $7 per toy for.

The amount earned from the first half of the collection is:
6 toy soldiers * $5 per toy = $30

The amount earned from the second half of the collection is:
6 toy soldiers * $7 per toy = $42

To find the total amount earned, we add the amounts from both halves:
$30 + $42 = $72

The final answer is: $72"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog and then determine how many holes Nate needs to fill in per day to catch up.

The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes dug is 6 * 14 = 84 holes.

Since Nate starts filling in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night, the net number of holes filled in per day is 9 - 6 = 3 holes.

To find out how many days it takes to fill in all the holes, we divide the total number of holes by the net number of holes filled in per day: 84 / 3 = 28 days.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can convert the number of days to weeks by dividing by 7: 28 / 7 = 4 weeks.

Therefore, it will take Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the average enrollment at Butler High School, we need to calculate 3/4 of the average enrollment at Norman High School. 

3/4 of 4000 is (3/4) * 4000 = 3000.

Now, we need to find the difference between the average enrollment at Norman High School and Butler High School. 

The difference is 4000 - 3000 = 1000.

The final answer is: 1000"
"To find the number of chocolate chip cookies, we need to subtract the total number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies made.

Total cookies made = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

Total rainbow and oatmeal cookies = 2595 + 3075 = 5670

Number of chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies made - Total rainbow and oatmeal cookies
= 7995 - 5670
= 2325

The final answer is: 2325"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of test tubes as T, the number of beakers as B, and the number of Petri dishes as P.

We know that Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, so T = 16 / 2 = 8.

We also know that Igor gathered two more Petri dishes than requested, so P = 14 + 2 = 16.

The total number of items Igor had is 29, and we know that T + B + P = 29.

Substituting the values we know, we get 8 + B + 16 = 29.

Simplifying the equation, we get B + 24 = 29.

Subtracting 24 from both sides, we get B = 5.

However, we know that Igor initially picked up the correct number of beakers, which is 7. Since he lost some beakers, the number of beakers he had left is 5.

To find the number of beakers he lost, we subtract the number of beakers he had left from the initial number of beakers: 7 - 5 = 2.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws required for the tables and subtract that from the total number of screws he has.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws, so each table requires 4 * 2 = 8 screws.

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws required is 8 * 4 = 32 screws.

James has 40 screws, so to find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws required from the total number of screws he has: 40 - 32 = 8.

Therefore, James will have 8 screws left over.

The final answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of eggs in the second basket and then add it to the number of eggs in the first basket.

Since there are twice as many eggs in the second basket as in the first, and the first basket has 10 eggs, the second basket has 2 * 10 = 20 eggs.

Now, we add the number of eggs in both baskets: 10 (first basket) + 20 (second basket) = 30 eggs.

The final numerical answer is: 30"
"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to calculate the individual amounts raised by each girl and then add them together.

Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, who raises $430. So, Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750.

Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, who raises $300. So, Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, we add up the amounts raised by each girl: $750 (Kim) + $430 (Alexandra) + $700 (Maryam) + $300 (Sarah) = $2180.

The final answer is: $2180"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between Aaron's and Vanessa's running speeds and distances. Let's denote Aaron's speed as A and Vanessa's speed as V. We are given that Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, so A = 2V.

We also know that Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron did. Since Vanessa ran 4 miles, Aaron ran half of that distance, which is 2 miles.

Given that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, we can calculate his speed as follows:

Speed = Distance / Time
A = 2 miles / 16 minutes
A = 1/8 miles per minute

Since A = 2V, we can substitute the value of A and solve for V:

2V = 1/8
V = (1/8) / 2
V = 1/16 miles per minute

Now that we have Vanessa's speed, we can calculate the time it took her to complete her part of the race:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 4 miles / (1/16 miles per minute)
Time = 4 * 16
Time = 64 minutes

The final answer is: 64"
"To determine the total amount of line needed, we first need to calculate the total length of line required for the existing dock. Since the caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock, the total length of line required is 3 * 200 = 600 feet.

However, the caretaker already has 6 feet of new line. To find out how much more line he needs to buy, we subtract the amount he already has from the total required: 600 - 6 = 594 feet.

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line.

"To find out how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to calculate their daily revenue and then multiply it by the number of days they are open.

First, let's calculate the daily revenue. They get 6 reservations a night, and each reservation includes 2 meals that cost $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine. 

Daily revenue = (6 reservations * 2 meals * $5) + (6 reservations * $5)
Daily revenue = (6 * 2 * $5) + (6 * $5)
Daily revenue = $60 + $30
Daily revenue = $90

Since they are open 2 days a week, we multiply the daily revenue by 2.

Weekly revenue = Daily revenue * 2
Weekly revenue = $90 * 2
Weekly revenue = $180

The final answer is: $180"
"To find the cost price of each watermelon, we first need to find the total cost of the watermelons. The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80, so the cost price per watermelon can be found by dividing the total cost by the number of watermelons.

Cost price per watermelon = Total cost / Number of watermelons
Cost price per watermelon = $80 / 50
Cost price per watermelon = $1.60

Now, we need to find the selling price of each watermelon, which is the cost price plus the profit. The profit percentage is 25%, so we need to find 25% of the cost price and add it to the cost price.

Profit per watermelon = Cost price per watermelon * (Profit percentage / 100)
Profit per watermelon = $1.60 * (25 / 100)
Profit per watermelon = $0.40

Selling price per watermelon = Cost price per watermelon + Profit per watermelon
Selling price per watermelon = $1.60 + $0.40
Selling price per watermelon = $2

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the current age of James and then determine the age of John's youngest son.

First, let's find James' current age. We know that James is twice as old as Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years. This means that James is twice as old as 12 - 3 = 9 years old. Therefore, James is 9 * 2 = 18 years old.

Since James is 18 years old and John had him when he was 19, John is currently 19 + 18 = 37 years old.

Now, we need to find the age of John's youngest son. We know that John's youngest son was born when John was 32. Since John is currently 37, his youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years old.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

The final numerical answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many oranges each person can peel in an hour and then find the difference between their rates.

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so her rate is 1 orange / 3 minutes. 

Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so her rate is 1 orange / 4 minutes.

We need to find out how many oranges they can peel in 60 minutes (1 hour). 

Ana's rate in 1 hour = (1/3) * 60 = 20 oranges
Jane's rate in 1 hour = (1/4) * 60 = 15 oranges

Now, we need to find the difference between their rates to determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane.

Difference = Ana's rate - Jane's rate = 20 - 15 = 5 oranges

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total amount Mark paid, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator and the labor cost.

First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator. The original price is $400, and Mark gets it for 80% off. To find the discount amount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage (80% = 0.8).

Discount = $400 * 0.8 = $320

The cost of the radiator after the discount is the original price minus the discount amount.

Radiator cost = $400 - $320 = $80

Next, let's calculate the labor cost. The mechanic works for 3 hours at $50 an hour.

Labor cost = 3 hours * $50/hour = $150

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the labor cost to find the total amount Mark paid.

Total cost = Radiator cost + Labor cost
Total cost = $80 + $150
Total cost = $230

The final answer is: $230"
"Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as W. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write the equation:

C + W = 20

We also know that the total number of legs is 70. Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, so we can write the equation:

2C + 4W = 70

We can solve this system of equations by multiplying the first equation by 2 to get:

2C + 2W = 40

Now, we can subtract this equation from the second equation to eliminate C:

(2C + 4W) - (2C + 2W) = 70 - 40
2W = 30

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

W = 15

Now that we know the number of cows, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find the number of chickens:

C + 15 = 20
C = 5

Therefore, the number of chickens is 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

First, let's calculate the total number of slices. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is 7 * 8 = 56.

Now, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people, which is 4 (Henry and his 3 friends). 

56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices per person.

The final answer is: 14"
