"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to first determine how many eggs she has left after eating and baking. 

Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast and bakes 4 for muffins, so she uses a total of 3 + 4 = 7 eggs. 

Now, we subtract the number of eggs used from the total number of eggs laid: 16 - 7 = 9 eggs left.

Janet sells these 9 eggs at $2 each, so she makes 9 * 2 = $18 per day at the farmers' market.

The final answer is: $18"
"To find the total number of bolts needed, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber first. Since it's half the amount of blue fiber, and there are 2 bolts of blue fiber, we can calculate the white fiber as follows:

White fiber = 2 bolts / 2 = 1 bolt

Now, we add the blue fiber and white fiber to get the total:

Total bolts = 2 bolts (blue) + 1 bolt (white) = 3 bolts

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the profit Josh made, we first need to determine the value of the house after the repairs. 

Let's denote the original value of the house as V. After the repairs, the value of the house increased by 150%, which means the new value is 2.5 times the original value (100% + 150% = 250%, or 2.5 times the original value).

The original value of the house is $80,000, and Josh added $50,000 in repairs. The total value after repairs is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.

However, we know that the value after repairs is 2.5 times the original value. So, we can set up the equation:

2.5V = $130,000

To find the original value V, we can divide both sides by 2.5:

V = $130,000 / 2.5
V = $52,000

Now that we know the original value of the house, we can find the profit Josh made. The profit is the difference between the value after repairs and the original value:

Profit = Value after repairs - Original value
Profit = $130,000 - $52,000
Profit = $78,000

The final answer is: $78,000"
"To find the total number of meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total number of meters he runs in one sprint session and then multiply it by the number of sprint sessions he has in a week.

Since James runs 3 sprints in one session, and each sprint is 60 meters, the total number of meters he runs in one session is:
3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/session

Since James has 3 sprint sessions in a week, the total number of meters he runs in a week is:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

The final answer is: 540"
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to determine the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon meals. 

In the morning, Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups of feed. In the afternoon, she gives her chickens 25 cups of feed. The total amount of feed given in these two meals is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

Since Wendi feeds each chicken 3 cups of feed per day, and she has a flock of 20 chickens, the total amount of feed needed per day is 3 * 20 = 60 cups.

Now, to find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we subtract the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon meals from the total amount of feed needed per day. 

60 (total feed needed per day) - 40 (feed given in morning and afternoon) = 20 cups.

So, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining glasses. 

The first glass costs $5. 
The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * 5 = $3. 
The third glass costs 60% of $3, which is 0.6 * 3 = $1.8. 
We can see that the cost of each subsequent glass is 60% of the previous glass. 

This forms a geometric sequence with the first term a = 5 and the common ratio r = 0.6. 
The total number of glasses is 16, but the first glass is already given, so we need to find the cost of 15 glasses. 
The cost of the remaining 15 glasses can be calculated using the formula for the sum of a geometric series: S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r), where n is the number of terms. 
However, since we are only interested in the sum of the remaining 15 glasses, we can use the formula S = a * r^(n-1) * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r) = a * r^(n-1) * (1 - r) / (1 - r) = a * r^(n-1) = 5 * (0.6)^(15-1) = 5 * (0.6)^14.

Now, let's calculate the value of (0.6)^14:
(0.6)^14 ≈ 0.0006103515625

Now, multiply this value by 5:
5 * 0.0006103515625 ≈ 0.0030517578125

Now, add the cost of the first glass to the cost of the remaining glasses:
5 + 0.0030517578125 ≈ 5.0030517578125

The final answer is: $5.0030517578125"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of sheep in Toulouse and Charleston first. 

Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, and Seattle has 20 sheep, we can find the number of sheep in Charleston by multiplying 20 by 4. 

Charleston has 20 * 4 = 80 sheep.

Since Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, we can find the number of sheep in Toulouse by multiplying 80 by 2.

Toulouse has 80 * 2 = 160 sheep.

Now, we can find the total number of sheep by adding the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle.

Total sheep = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260

The final answer is: 260"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how long it would take Carla to download the file without any interruptions. 

The total size of the file is 200 GB. Carla can download 2 GB/minute. 

Time taken to download the file = Total size / Download speed
Time taken to download the file = 200 GB / 2 GB/minute
Time taken to download the file = 100 minutes

Now, let's consider the interruption. Carla downloads 40% of the file before the restart. 

40% of 200 GB = 0.4 * 200 GB = 80 GB

Time taken to download 80 GB = 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes

After the restart, Carla has to download the remaining 160 GB (200 - 40 = 160) of the file.

Time taken to download the remaining 160 GB = 160 GB / 2 GB/minute = 80 minutes

Total time taken = Time taken to download 80 GB + Time taken to download the remaining 160 GB + Time taken for the restart
Total time taken = 40 minutes + 80 minutes + 20 minutes
Total time taken = 140 minutes

The final answer is: 140"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance John travels to the point where he turns around, and the distance he travels back home.

First, let's calculate the distance John travels to the point where he turns around. He drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph, so the distance is:

Distance = Speed * Time = 60 mph * 3 hours = 180 miles

Now, let's calculate the distance John travels back home. He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't move. Then, he drives for 0.5 hours at a speed of 30 mph, covering a distance of:

Distance = Speed * Time = 30 mph * 0.5 hours = 15 miles

After that, he drives for the remaining 1.5 hours (4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours) at a speed of 80 mph, covering a distance of:

Distance = Speed * Time = 80 mph * 1.5 hours = 120 miles

The total distance John travels back home is the sum of the distance covered in the last 0.5 hours and the distance covered in the last 1.5 hours:

Total distance back home = 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles

Since John was 180 miles away from home when he turned around, the distance he is from home at the end of those 4 hours is:

Distance from home = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles

The final answer is: 45"
"To find Eliza's total earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately, then add them together.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings are:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours, she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours. Her overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, so her overtime rate is:
$10/hour * 1.2 = $12/hour

Her overtime earnings are:
5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Total earnings for the week are:
$400 + $60 = $460

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and add them together.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the downloads were reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which is 54. Then, we subtract 54 from 180 to get 126 downloads in the third month.

Now, we add the downloads from each month together: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The final answer is: 366"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then add them together.

The cost of 3 dozen donuts is 3 * $68 = $204.
The cost of 2 dozen mini cupcakes is 2 * $80 = $160.
The cost of 6 dozen mini cheesecakes is 6 * $55 = $330.

Now, we add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The final answer is: $694"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the break-even point, which is the point at which the total cost of planting and maintaining the tree equals the total revenue from selling the lemons.

Let's denote the number of years as 'n'. The total cost of planting the tree is $90. The annual cost of watering and feeding the tree is $3. The total revenue from selling the lemons is 7 lemons/year * $1.5/lemon = $10.5/year.

The total cost for 'n' years is $90 + $3n. The total revenue for 'n' years is $10.5n.

To find the break-even point, we set the total cost equal to the total revenue and solve for 'n':

$90 + $3n = $10.5n

Subtract $3n from both sides:

$90 = $7.5n

Divide both sides by $7.5:

n = $90 / $7.5
n = 12

So, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

n = 12"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's say Melanie started with x vacuum cleaners.

At the green house, she sold a third of her vacuum cleaners, which is x/3.

At the red house, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners.

At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, which is (x - x/3 - 2)/2.

We know that after selling at all three houses, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the equation:

x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

To simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 6 to get rid of the fractions:

6x - 2x - 12 - 3(x - x/3 - 2) = 30

Combine like terms:

4x - 12 - 3x + x + 6 = 30

Combine like terms:

2x - 6 = 30

Add 6 to both sides:

2x = 36

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 18

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to find the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance, and then subtract that from the total number of students.

20% of 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance:
20 * 0.2 = 4 students

The remaining students are 20 - 4 = 16 students.

25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:
16 * 0.25 = 4 students

The number of students enrolled in jazz dance is 4, and the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance is 4. So, the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance is 20 - 4 - 4 = 12 students.

To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100:
(12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is: 60"
"To maximize profit, we need to calculate the potential profit for each option and compare them.

For the jewelry option, the potential profit is the initial value of the jewelry plus the 2.5% increase:
$5,000 + (2.5% of $5,000) = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125

For the electronic gadgets option, the potential profit is the initial value of the gadgets plus the 1.2% increase:
$8,000 + (1.2% of $8,000) = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096

Since $8,096 is greater than $5,125, the merchant should choose the electronic gadgets option to maximize profit.

The profit would be the difference between the potential profit and the initial cost:
$8,096 - $8,000 = $96"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance covered on the first day and the distance covered on the second day.

On the first day, both trains travel 80 miles westward. Since they are traveling in the same direction, they cover the same distance. 

On the second day, they travel 150 miles northward. Again, since they are traveling in the same direction, they cover the same distance.

So, the distance covered by each train in the two days is:

Day 1: 80 miles (westward)
Day 2: 150 miles (northward)

The total distance covered by each train in the two days is the sum of the distances covered on each day, which is 80 + 150 = 230 miles.

The final answer is: 230"
"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:

She works 35 hours a week as a teacher and gets paid $20 per hour. Since she works 50 weeks a year, her total hours worked as a teacher in a year is:
35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year

Her earnings from teaching in a year is:
1750 hours/year * $20/hour = $35,000/year

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:

She works 15 hours a week as a coach and gets paid $30 per hour. Since she works 50 weeks a year, her total hours worked as a coach in a year is:
15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year

Her earnings from coaching in a year is:
750 hours/year * $30/hour = $22,500/year

Now, let's add her earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary:
$35,000/year + $22,500/year = $57,500/year

The final answer is: $57,500"
"To find out how many eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in a week and then multiply it by 4.

Since Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning, she eats 3 eggs per day. 

There are 7 days in a week, so she eats 3 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 21 eggs/week.

In 4 weeks, she will eat 21 eggs/week * 4 weeks = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens she will eat in 4 weeks.

84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozen eggs.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the total time Marissa has taken so far and the total distance she has covered so far. 

She took 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles and another hour to walk the next 2 miles. So, the total time taken so far is 1 + 1 = 2 hours. 

The total distance covered so far is 4 + 2 = 6 miles.

The total distance of the trail is 12 miles. If she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, the total time she should take to cover the entire trail is 12 / 4 = 3 hours.

Since she has already taken 2 hours, she has 3 - 2 = 1 hour left to cover the remaining distance.

The remaining distance is 12 - 6 = 6 miles. 

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance, we divide the remaining distance by the remaining time: 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the amount of water in the orange drink, we first need to calculate two-thirds of 10 liters. 

Two-thirds of 10 liters is (2/3) * 10 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters.

Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the amount of water in the orange drink is 6.67 liters.

Now, to find the amount of water in the pineapple drink, we need to calculate three-fifths of 15 liters.

Three-fifths of 15 liters is (3/5) * 15 = 45/5 = 9 liters.

Since the pineapple drink is three-fifths water, the amount of water in the pineapple drink is 9 liters.

Now, we need to subtract the 1 liter that was spilled from the orange drink. 

The remaining amount of water in the orange drink is 6.67 - 1 = 5.67 liters.

Now, we add the amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink to find the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters.

Total water = 5.67 + 9 = 14.67 liters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14.67}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the age of Raymond when his son was born. 

First, we know that Samantha is 31 years old now. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, we can find Raymond's current age by adding 6 to Samantha's age: 31 + 6 = 37.

We also know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find the age of Raymond's son, we need to subtract 23 from Raymond's current age: 37 - 23 = 14.

However, we are asked to find how many years ago Raymond's son was born. Since we know the son's current age (14), we can find the number of years since his birth by subtracting his age from the current year. However, the current year is not provided in the question. 

Since we are not given the current year, we can express the answer in terms of the difference between Samantha's age and the age of Raymond's son. The difference between their ages is 31 - 14 = 17 years.

However, since we are asked to find how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to subtract the age of the son from the age of Samantha. The difference between their ages is 31 - 14 = 17 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"To find the total number of DVDs sold, we need to calculate the number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers.

The first 3 customers buy 1 DVD each, so they buy a total of 3 DVDs.
The next 2 customers buy 2 DVDs each, so they buy a total of 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs.

Now, let's add the total number of DVDs sold to the first 5 customers: 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs.

The last 3 customers don't buy any DVDs, so we don't need to add anything to the total.

The total number of DVDs sold on Tuesday is 7."
"To find the total number of centimeters the candle will be shorter, we need to calculate the total time it burns and multiply it by the rate at which it melts.

The candle burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, which is a total of 4 hours.

The rate at which the candle melts is 2 centimeters per hour.

So, the total number of centimeters the candle will be shorter is 4 hours * 2 centimeters/hour = 8 centimeters.

"To find the original price of the book, we need to use the concept of percentage decrease. 

Let's denote the original price as 'x'. Since there was a 25% discount, the amount of the discount is 25% of the original price, which is 0.25x.

The discounted price is the original price minus the discount, so we can set up the equation:

x - 0.25x = 19.50

Combine like terms:

0.75x = 19.50

Now, divide both sides by 0.75 to solve for x:

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book was $26.

The final answer is: $26"
"To find the total cost of the items Marie ordered, excluding the pizza, we can calculate the cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples.

Cost of chicken meal: $12
Cost of 5 packs of milk: 5 * $3 = $15
Cost of 4 apples: 4 * $1.50 = $6
Total cost of chicken meal, milk, and apples: $12 + $15 + $6 = $33

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the cost of the pizza boxes can be found by subtracting the total cost of the other items from the total amount paid.

Cost of pizza boxes: $50 - $33 = $17

Now, to find the number of boxes of pizza, we can divide the cost of the pizza boxes by the cost of each box.

Number of boxes of pizza: $17 / $8.50 = 2

The cost of 3 pairs of shoes is 3 x $42 = $126.

Now, we add the costs together: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243.

The final answer is: $243"
"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream, we need to calculate the total number of cartons she buys and multiply it by the cost per carton.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she will need 60 cartons of ice cream for 60 days (1 serving per night * 60 nights).

Each carton has 15 servings, so to find the total number of cartons needed, we divide the total number of servings needed (60) by the number of servings per carton (15):

60 servings / 15 servings per carton = 4 cartons

Now, we multiply the total number of cartons by the cost per carton:

4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00

So, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream after 60 days.

The final answer is: $16.00"
"To find the distance Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to determine the distance between the two stops. 

Henry's first stop was after 20 miles, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total distance of the trip is 60 miles, we can find the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip by subtracting 15 miles from 60 miles. 

60 - 15 = 45 miles

Now, we know that the distance from the first stop to the second stop is the difference between the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip and the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip. 

Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip = 60 miles
Distance from the second stop to the end of the trip = 45 miles

Distance between the first and second stops = 60 - 45
Distance between the first and second stops = 15 miles

However, this is the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip minus the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip. But we need to find the distance between the first and second stops. 

To find the distance between the first and second stops, we need to find the distance from the first stop to the second stop. 

Distance from the first stop to the second stop = Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip - Distance from the second stop to the end of the trip
Distance from the first stop to the second stop = 20 + 15
Distance from the first stop to the second stop = 35 miles

The distance between the first and second stops is 35 miles.

"Let's denote the cost of the boots as B, the cost of the first pair of heels as H1, and the cost of the second pair of heels as H2. We are given that H1 = $33 and H2 = 2 * H1 = 2 * 33 = $66.

We are also given that the total cost of the two pairs of heels is $5 less than the cost of the boots. This can be expressed as:

H1 + H2 = B - 5

Substituting the values of H1 and H2, we get:

33 + 66 = B - 5

Combine like terms:

99 = B - 5

Add 5 to both sides:

104 = B

The cost of the boots is $104.

The final answer is: $104"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let Darrell's age be 7x and Allen's age be 11x, where x is a constant.

Since their total age is 162, we can set up the equation:
7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms:
18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18:
x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Darrell's and Allen's current ages:
Darrell's age = 7x = 7(9) = 63
Allen's age = 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, add 10 to his current age:
Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

"To find the average guess, we need to calculate the total number of guesses and divide it by the number of people.

The first person guesses 80 jelly beans.
The second person guesses 20 more than half of the first one, which is (80 / 2) + 20 = 60.
The third person guesses 25% more than the first one, which is 80 + (0.25 * 80) = 80 + 20 = 100.

Now, let's add up all the guesses: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

There are 3 people, so we divide the total by 3 to find the average: 240 / 3 = 80.

"To find the total hours John spends taking care of dogs in a week, we need to first calculate the total hours he spends per day and then multiply it by 7 (the number of days in a week).

Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business. Since John takes care of 10 dogs, the total hours he spends per day is:
10 dogs * 0.5 hours/dog = 5 hours/day

Now, we multiply the daily hours by 7 to get the total hours per week:
5 hours/day * 7 days/week = 35 hours/week

The final answer is: 35"
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as S and the number of gold coins as G. We are given that G = S + 30. We also know that the total number of coins is 110, so S + G = 110.

Substituting G = S + 30 into the second equation, we get S + (S + 30) = 110. Combining like terms, we get 2S + 30 = 110.

Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get 2S = 80. Dividing both sides by 2, we get S = 40.

Now that we know S = 40, we can find G by substituting S into the equation G = S + 30. G = 40 + 30 = 70.

The final answer is: 70"
"To find out how many jewels Siobhan has, we need to first determine how many jewels Aaron has. 

Since Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, we need to find half of Raymond's jewels. Raymond has 40 jewels, so half of that is 40 / 2 = 20. 

Now, we know Aaron has 5 more jewels than 20, so Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.

Since Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, we subtract 2 from Aaron's total: 25 - 2 = 23.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points he scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes separately, and then add them together.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% of 4, we multiply 4 by 0.25, which is 1. Then, we add this to the original 4 points to get the total points scored in the second 20 minutes: 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Now, we add the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes: 4 + 5 = 9 points.

The total points Mike scored is 9.

"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to first determine how many yogurts he eats in 30 days and then calculate the cost.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

Since they are on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00, we need to find out how many sets of 4 yogurts Terry buys in 30 days. 

To do this, we divide the total number of yogurts he eats in 30 days (60) by the number of yogurts in a set (4). 

60 / 4 = 15 sets of yogurts.

Now, we multiply the number of sets by the cost per set ($5.00) to find the total cost.

15 sets * $5.00 = $75.00

The final answer is: $75.00"
"To find out how many Lego sets John has left, we first need to determine how much money he made from selling the Lego sets and how much he spent on video games.

John sells 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount of money he made is:
13 * 15 = 195 dollars

He then buys 8 video games for $20 each, so the total amount of money he spent is:
8 * 20 = 160 dollars

Since he had $5 left after buying the video games, we can find out how much money he had before buying the video games by adding the $5 to the amount he spent:
195 - 160 = 35 dollars

However, this is the amount of money he had before buying the video games, not the amount he made from selling the Lego sets. Since he spent $160 on video games, we need to subtract this from the total amount he made to find out how much he had left:
195 - 160 = 35 dollars

Now, we know that John had $35 left after buying the video games, and he had $5 left after buying the video games. This means that the $35 is the amount of money he had before buying the video games, and the $5 is the remaining amount after buying the video games. To find out how much he spent on the video games, we subtract the remaining amount from the amount he had before buying the video games:
35 - 5 = 30 dollars

However, we already know that he spent $160 on video games, so we can ignore this calculation. The correct approach is to find out how much money he made from selling the Lego sets and then subtract the amount he spent on video games.

John made 195 dollars from selling the Lego sets and spent 160 dollars on video games. To find out how many Lego sets he has left, we need to find out how many sets he can buy with the remaining money. Since he has $5 left, we can find out how many sets he can buy with this amount:
5 / 15 = 0.33 (round down to 0, since you can't buy a fraction of a set)

"To find John's running speed, we need to calculate the total time he spends running in a week and then divide the total distance by that time.

First, let's find the total time John spends running in a week. He runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days. Half of 3 hours is 1.5 hours. So, he runs 1.5 hours on each of the other two days.

Total time spent running in a week = 3 hours (first day) + 1.5 hours (second day) + 1.5 hours (third day)
Total time spent running in a week = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5
Total time spent running in a week = 6 hours

Now, we can find John's running speed by dividing the total distance by the total time.

John's running speed = Total distance / Total time
John's running speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
John's running speed = 10 miles per hour

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Dana's running and walking speeds. 

Given that Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour and her skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed, we can find her running speed by multiplying her skipping speed by 2. 

Running speed = 2 * Skipping speed
Running speed = 2 * 3
Running speed = 6 miles per hour

Since Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, we can find her walking speed by dividing her running speed by 4.

Walking speed = Running speed / 4
Walking speed = 6 / 4
Walking speed = 1.5 miles per hour

Now, we know that Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. So, in 6 hours, she will spend 2 hours running and 4 hours walking.

Distance traveled while running = Speed * Time
Distance traveled while running = 6 * 2
Distance traveled while running = 12 miles

Distance traveled while walking = Speed * Time
Distance traveled while walking = 1.5 * 4
Distance traveled while walking = 6 miles

Total distance traveled = Distance traveled while running + Distance traveled while walking
Total distance traveled = 12 + 6
Total distance traveled = 18 miles

The final answer is: 18"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone.
2. Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old.

Since Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, we can calculate Ben's iPhone age as:
Ben's iPhone age = 2 * Suzy's iPhone age
Ben's iPhone age = 2 * 1
Ben's iPhone age = 2 years

Now, we know that Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. So, we can calculate Brandon's iPhone age as:
Brandon's iPhone age = 4 * Ben's iPhone age
Brandon's iPhone age = 4 * 2
Brandon's iPhone age = 8 years

"To solve this problem, we need to find the distance Polly can throw the javelin when holding the gemstone and then subtract the dragon's reach from that distance.

When Polly holds the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone. Since she can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone, she can throw it 3 * 400 = 1200 feet with the gemstone.

The dragon's reach is 1000 feet, so Polly can stand 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet outside of the dragon's reach and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

We are given that there were 14 pieces of pie remaining at the end of the evening. To find the number of pieces taken by the guests, we subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces: 40 - 14 = 26.

"To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we first need to calculate how many calories you have left for the day. 

Your daily calorie target is 2000, and you have already consumed 1800 calories. 

2000 (daily target) - 1800 (already consumed) = 200 calories left for the day.

Since each serving of chips has 250 calories, we can divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving to find out how many servings you can have.

200 (calories left) / 250 (calories per serving) = 0.8 servings

Since a 300g bag has 5 servings, we can multiply the number of servings you can have by the total weight of the bag to find out how many grams you can eat.

0.8 (servings) * 300 (grams per bag) = 240 grams

"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

First, let's find the total cost. Since Charlie needs 1 pound of beeswax and wicks for 10 candles, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks for 20 candles (2 sets of 10 candles). The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks is 2 * $10.00 = $20.00.

Next, let's find the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, and he sells 20 candles, so the total revenue is 20 * $2.00 = $40.00.

Now, let's find the net profit. The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.

"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply it by the average time it takes to write an article (4 hours).

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. To find 2/5 of 5, we multiply 5 by 2/5:
5 * (2/5) = 2
So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 7 * 2 = 14 articles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles she wrote in the three days:
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles

Since each article takes 4 hours to write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours

"To find the number of Post-it notes in the package Candice purchased, we need to determine how many Post-it notes she had after buying the package and before placing any on the cups.

Initially, Candice had 80 Post-it notes. After purchasing a package, she had 80 + x Post-it notes, where x is the number of Post-it notes in the package. After placing a Post-it note on each of the 220 cups, she had 80 + x - 220 Post-it notes remaining.

We are given that she had 23 Post-it notes remaining. So, we can set up the equation:

80 + x - 220 = 23

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - 140 = 23

Adding 140 to both sides, we get:

x = 163

Therefore, the number of Post-it notes in the package Candice purchased is 163.

The final answer is: 163"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of blue ties and the cost of red ties.

First, let's find the number of blue ties. Since John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can divide the total amount spent by the cost per tie:

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is:

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
= 2 * 5
= 10

Now, let's find the cost of a red tie. Since the red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, the cost of a red tie is:

Cost of a red tie = Cost of a blue tie + (50% of the cost of a blue tie)
= $40 + (0.5 * $40)
= $40 + $20
= $60

Now, we can find the total amount spent on red ties:

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of a red tie
= 10 * $60
= $600

Finally, we can find the total amount spent on ties by adding the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties:

Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
= $200 + $600
= $800

The final answer is: $800"

Since Lloyd sells eggs by the dozen, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens:
1764 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 147 dozen eggs per week

"To find the total time it takes for Tom to travel from 1 to 4 PM and back, we need to calculate the time taken for each leg of the journey separately.

First, let's find the time taken to travel from 1 to 4 PM. Since the time is given in a 12-hour format, we can assume that the time from 1 to 4 PM is 3 hours.

Now, let's find the distance traveled from 1 to 4 PM. Distance = Speed * Time = 10 miles/hour * 3 hours = 30 miles.

Since the distance is the same for the return trip, the time taken to travel back will be the same as the time taken to travel from 1 to 4 PM, which is 3 hours.

However, the question asks for the time taken to travel back at a rate of 6 mph. We can find this time by dividing the distance by the speed: Time = Distance / Speed = 30 miles / 6 mph = 5 hours.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much weight the comic books weigh in total. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and Uriah removes 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is:

30 * (1/4) = 30/4 = 7.5 pounds

Since Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds, the remaining weight that needs to be removed from the toys is:

15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, the number of toys that need to be removed is:

7.5 / (1/2) = 7.5 * 2 = 15

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the revenue earned by the mechanic on each day, we need to calculate the total revenue from truck tires and car tires separately for both days.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. The revenue from truck tires is 6 * $60 = $360. The revenue from car tires is 4 * $40 = $160. The total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires. The revenue from car tires is 12 * $40 = $480. Since there are no truck tires, the total revenue on Friday is $480.

To find the day with higher revenue, we compare the revenues: $520 (Thursday) and $480 (Friday). Thursday has higher revenue.

The difference in revenue between the two days is $520 - $480 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find the total number of kittens, we need to calculate the number of kittens each cat has and add them together.

Patchy has thrice the number of adopted kittens, which is 3 * 7 = 21 kittens.

Trixie has 12 kittens.

The Doubtfire family now has 33 kittens."
"To find the number of bags Jean can fill, we need to first determine the number of lollipops remaining after eating 2. 

Jean starts with 30 lollipops and eats 2, so the number of lollipops remaining is:
30 - 2 = 28

Since Jean wants to package 2 lollipops in one bag, we need to divide the number of remaining lollipops by 2 to find the number of bags:
28 / 2 = 14

So, Jean can fill 14 bags with the remaining lollipops.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find out how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to calculate how many times he can afford the total cost of a movie outing, which is the sum of the ticket price and the popcorn price.

The total cost of a movie outing is $7 (ticket) + $7 (popcorn) = $14.

Now, we need to divide the total amount of money Peter has ($42) by the cost of a movie outing ($14) to find out how many times he can go to the movies.

Number of times Peter can go to the movies = Total money / Cost of a movie outing
= 42 / 14

"To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck, we need to subtract the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit, and then divide the result by the weight of each box.

First, let's calculate the remaining weight capacity of the bridge:

Bridge's weight limit: 5000 pounds
Combined weight of driver and empty truck: 3755 pounds
Remaining weight capacity: 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds

Next, let's divide the remaining weight capacity by the weight of each box:

Weight of each box: 15 pounds
Maximum number of boxes: 1245 / 15 = 83

So, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83.

The final answer is: 83"
"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to follow the order of operations. 

First, we need to calculate the 25% fee added to the final total. 25% of $40.00 is 0.25 * 40 = $10.00. 

Next, we add the delivery fee of $3.00 to the 25% fee, which is $10.00 + $3.00 = $13.00.

Now, we add the 25% fee and the delivery fee to the original total of $40.00, which is $40.00 + $13.00 = $53.00.

Finally, we add the $4.00 tip to the new total of $53.00, which is $53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00.

The final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00.

The final answer is: $57.00"
"To find the total number of raspberries, we need to calculate the number of raspberries in the clusters and add the number of individual fruit.

The number of raspberries in the clusters is 6 clusters * 20 fruit per cluster = 120 fruit.

"To find the number of good oranges, we first need to find the total number of unripe and bad oranges. 

There are 1 bad oranges and 20% of 25 oranges are unripe. 
20% of 25 = (20/100) * 25 = 5 oranges are unripe.

Now, we know that there are 2 sour oranges. 
So, the total number of unripe, bad, and sour oranges = 5 (unripe) + 1 (bad) + 2 (sour) = 8 oranges.

Now, we can find the number of good oranges by subtracting the total number of unripe, bad, and sour oranges from the total number of oranges.
Number of good oranges = Total number of oranges - Total number of unripe, bad, and sour oranges
= 25 - 8
= 17

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the total amount Janet paid, we need to add the cost of the material and the cost of the jeweler, then add the insurance cost.

The cost of the material is $500.
The cost of the jeweler is $800.

Total cost so far: $500 + $800 = $1300

Janet pays 10% of the total cost to get it insured. To find 10% of $1300, we multiply $1300 by 0.1.

Insurance cost: $1300 * 0.1 = $130

Now, we add the insurance cost to the total cost: $1300 + $130 = $1430

The final answer is: $1430"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the annual pension for the first 20 years and the annual pension for the next 10 years.

For the first 20 years, Marcy gets a fixed annual pension of $50,000.

For the next 10 years, she gets 5% of the value of the pension per year. To find the value of the pension, we need to calculate the total amount she would have received in 20 years. Since it's a fixed annual pension, we can use the formula for the future value of an annuity:

FV = PMT * [(1 + r)^n - 1] / r

where FV is the future value, PMT is the annual payment ($50,000), r is the interest rate (0, since it's a fixed pension), and n is the number of years (20).

However, since the pension is fixed and not growing, we can simply multiply the annual pension by the number of years to find the total value of the pension:

Total value of pension = $50,000 * 20 = $1,000,000

Now, we need to find 5% of this value for each year:

Annual pension for the next 10 years = 0.05 * $1,000,000 = $50,000

So, Marcy's annual pension for the next 10 years will be $50,000.

To find the total annual pension, we need to add the annual pension for the first 20 years and the annual pension for the next 10 years:

Total annual pension = $50,000 + $50,000 = $100,000

The final answer is: $100,000"
"To find the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to calculate the amount she paid for the first half of the year and the second half of the year separately and then add them together.

The first half of the year is 6 months, so the amount she paid for the first half is:
$140 * 6 = $840

For the second half of the year, she paid 10% less than the initial amount. To find 10% of $140, we multiply $140 by 0.1:
$140 * 0.1 = $14
Then, we subtract this amount from the initial amount to find the reduced amount:
$140 - $14 = $126
The amount she paid for the second half of the year is:
$126 * 6 = $756

Now, we add the amounts she paid for the first and second half of the year to find the total amount:
$840 + $756 = $1596

The final answer is: $1596"
"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to determine the car's miles per gallon (mpg) rating. We can do this by dividing the distance traveled since the last fill-up (100 miles) by the amount of gas used (4 gallons).

mpg = distance / gas used
mpg = 100 miles / 4 gallons
mpg = 25 miles per gallon

Now that we know the car's mpg rating, we can calculate the total distance Sophia can drive on a full tank by multiplying the tank capacity (12 gallons) by the mpg rating.

total distance = tank capacity * mpg
total distance = 12 gallons * 25 miles/gallon
total distance = 300 miles

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the total time spent on TV and reading, we need to calculate the time spent in one week and then multiply it by 4.

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV. 
He then reads for half as long, which is 2 / 2 = 1 hour.

So, in one day, he spends 2 + 1 = 3 hours on TV and reading.

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total time spent in one week is 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

To find the total time spent in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly time by 4: 9 * 4 = 36 hours.

The final answer is: 36"
"To find the total number of people sent by the schools, we need to calculate the number of students and coaches for each school and then multiply it by the number of schools.

Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys') with 5 players each, so the total number of students per school is 2 * 5 = 10.

Each school also has 2 coaches, one for each team.

So, the total number of people per school is 10 (students) + 2 (coaches) = 12.

Since there are 4 schools, the total number of people sent by all the schools is 12 * 4 = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the total number of gems, we need to calculate the number of rubies and emeralds first.

Number of diamonds = 175
Number of rubies = Number of diamonds - 35
= 175 - 35
= 140

Number of emeralds = 2 * Number of rubies
= 2 * 140
= 280

Total number of gems = Number of diamonds + Number of rubies + Number of emeralds
= 175 + 140 + 280

The final answer is: 595"
"To find the number of boys, we know that there are twice as many boys as girls. Since there are 60 girls, the number of boys is 2 * 60 = 120.

The total number of students is the sum of boys and girls, which is 60 + 120 = 180.

Since there are 5 students to every teacher, we can find the number of teachers by dividing the total number of students by 5.

Number of teachers = Total number of students / 5
= 180 / 5
= 36

"To find out how much money Bailey started with, we need to subtract the total amount she received from her weekly allowance from the total amount she has at the end of 8 weeks.

Let's denote the initial amount of money Bailey had as x.

Bailey receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks, so the total amount she received from her allowance is 5 * 8 = $40.

At the end of 8 weeks, Bailey has a total of $100. This includes the initial amount she had (x) and the total amount she received from her allowance ($40).

We can set up the equation: x + 40 = 100

To find the initial amount Bailey had, we need to isolate x. We can do this by subtracting 40 from both sides of the equation:

x = 100 - 40
x = 60

So, Bailey started with $60.

The final answer is: $60"
"To find out how much money Judy makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of classes she teaches in a week and then multiply it by the number of students per class and the charge per student.

Judy teaches 5 classes per day on weekdays, which is 5 classes/day * 5 days = 25 classes. 
On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes. 
So, the total number of classes in a week is 25 classes + 8 classes = 33 classes.

Each class has 15 students, so the total number of students per week is 33 classes * 15 students/class = 495 students.

Judy charges $15.00 per student, so the total amount she makes in a week is 495 students * $15/student = $7,425.

"To find the total amount Shiela will pay each month, we need to calculate the total cost of the cell phones and then divide it by the number of months.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the cell phones:
5 cell phones * $150 each = $750

Since a 2% interest will be charged for each unit, we need to calculate the interest for the total amount:
2% of $750 = 0.02 * $750 = $15

Now, we add the interest to the total cost:
$750 + $15 = $765

Since Shiela will pay this amount over 3 months, we need to divide the total amount by 3:
$765 / 3 = $255

So, Shiela will pay $255 each month for 3 months.

The final answer is: $255"

"To find the total number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total number of cups of dog food the puppy will eat in the first year and then divide it by the number of cups in a bag.

First, let's calculate the number of cups the puppy will eat in the first 180 days. Since the puppy eats 1 cup of dog food every day for the first 180 days, the total number of cups is:

1 cup/day * 180 days = 180 cups

Next, let's calculate the number of days in a year. There are 365 days in a year.

Now, let's calculate the number of cups the puppy will eat after the first 180 days. Since the puppy eats 2 cups of dog food every day for the rest of its life, we need to subtract the first 180 days from the total number of days in a year:

365 days - 180 days = 185 days

The puppy will eat 2 cups of dog food every day for 185 days, so the total number of cups is:

2 cups/day * 185 days = 370 cups

Now, let's add the number of cups the puppy will eat in the first 180 days and the number of cups the puppy will eat after the first 180 days:

180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, we can divide the total number of cups by the number of cups in a bag to find the total number of bags:

550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags

The final answer is: 5"

"To find the better price, we need to calculate the cost per flower for each package option.

For the package of 3 flowers for $2.50, the cost per flower is:
$2.50 / 3 = $0.8333 per flower

For the package of 2 flowers for $1, the cost per flower is:
$1 / 2 = $0.5 per flower

Since $0.5 per flower is less than $0.8333 per flower, the package of 2 flowers for $1 is the better option.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price:
18 flowers / 2 flowers per package = 9 packages
9 packages * $1 per package = $9

The cost of buying 18 flowers at the original price (package of 3 flowers for $2.50) is:
18 flowers / 3 flowers per package = 6 packages
6 packages * $2.50 per package = $15

The amount of money saved by buying 18 flowers at the better price is:
$15 - $9 = $6

"Let's denote the number of games the team lost as L and the number of games they won as W. We are given that W = L + 8.

We also know that the total number of games played is 22, which is the sum of the games won and lost. Therefore, we can write the equation:

W + L = 22

Substituting W = L + 8 into the equation, we get:

L + 8 + L = 22

Combine like terms:

2L + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2L = 14

Divide both sides by 2:

"To find Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate her salary after the 5th year and then calculate the increase for the next three years.

Initially, Sylvie's salary is $600. 

After 5 years, her salary is increased by 10% of the initial salary for each year. So, the increase for the first year is 10% of $600, which is 0.1 * 600 = $60. Her salary after the first year is $600 + $60 = $660.

For the second year, the increase is 10% of $660, which is 0.1 * 660 = $66. Her salary after the second year is $660 + $66 = $726.

For the third year, the increase is 10% of $726, which is 0.1 * 726 = $72.6. Her salary after the third year is $726 + $72.6 = $798.6.

For the fourth year, the increase is 10% of $798.6, which is 0.1 * 798.6 = $79.86. Her salary after the fourth year is $798.6 + $79.86 = $878.46.

For the fifth year, the increase is 10% of $878.46, which is 0.1 * 878.46 = $87.846. Her salary after the fifth year is $878.46 + $87.846 = $966.306.

Now, for the next three years, the increase will be 10% of the salary after the fifth year, which is $966.306. 

For the sixth year, the increase is 10% of $966.306, which is 0.1 * 966.306 = $96.6306. Her salary after the sixth year is $966.306 + $96.6306 = $1062.9366.

For the seventh year, the increase is 10% of $1062.9366, which is 0.1 * 1062.9366 = $106.29366. Her salary after the seventh year is $1062.9366 + $106.29366 = $1169.23026.

For the eighth year, the increase is 10% of $1169.23026, which is 0.1 * 1169.23026 = $116.923026. Her salary after the eighth year is $1169.23026 + $116.923026 = $1286.153286.

"To find out how many gift bags Christina needs, we first need to calculate the number of guests who will actually attend the party. Since 1/4 of the invited guests don't show up, we can find the number of guests who will attend by subtracting 1/4 from the total number of invited guests.

Number of invited guests = 16
Number of guests who don't show up = 1/4 * 16 = 4
Number of guests who will attend = 16 - 4 = 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we can multiply the number of guests who will attend by 0.75 to find the total number of gift bags needed.

Number of gift bags needed = 12 * 0.75 = 9

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of gift bags needed by the cost per gift bag.

Cost per gift bag = $2
Total cost = 9 * $2 = $18

3. Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets.

To find the total number of pets, we add the number of pets each person has: 4 (Cindy) + 6 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan) = 28.

The final answer is: 28"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey, so Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old.
2. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.
3. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so Jackson is 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it takes Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles before he changed his diet. Since Lee runs 2 seconds faster than Gerald, we can set up an equation:

Time it takes Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles = Time it takes Lee to run the 400-meter hurdles + 2 seconds
Time it takes Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles = 38 + 2
Time it takes Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles = 40 seconds

Now, we know that Gerald's speed improved by 10% after changing his diet. To find out how much time he can save, we need to calculate 10% of 40 seconds:

10% of 40 seconds = 0.1 * 40 = 4 seconds

Since Gerald's speed improved by 10%, he can save 4 seconds from his original time. To find out his new time, we subtract 4 seconds from his original time:

New time it takes Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles = Original time - Time saved
New time it takes Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles = 40 - 4
New time it takes Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles = 36 seconds

The final answer is: 36"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats.
2. There are two cats for every dog.
3. The number of dogs is 60.

Since there are two cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs, the number of cats can be calculated as follows:
Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
= 2 * 60
= 120

Now, we know the number of dogs and cats. The combined number of dogs and cats is:
Number of dogs + Number of cats
= 60 + 120
= 180

According to the first point, the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats:
Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
= 180 - 12
= 168

To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of rabbits, dogs, and cats:
Total number of pets = Number of rabbits + Number of dogs + Number of cats
= 168 + 60 + 120
= 348

The final answer is: 348"
"To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we first need to find the total number of girls and then subtract the number of girls in the girl scout.

First, let's find the number of boys and girls. We know that 2/5 of the students are boys. 

Number of boys = (2/5) * 200 = 80

Since there are 200 students in total, the number of girls can be found by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students.

Number of girls = 200 - 80 = 120

Now, we know that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. 

Number of girls in the girl scout = (2/3) * 120 = 80

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls.

Number of girls not in the girl scout = 120 - 80 = 40

The final answer is: 40"
"To find out how many hours James slept, we need to calculate 2/3 of the hours Harry slept. 

Harry slept 9 hours, so 2/3 of 9 is (2/3) * 9 = 6 hours.

Now, we need to find the difference between the hours Harry and James slept. 

Harry slept 9 hours and James slept 6 hours, so the difference is 9 - 6 = 3 hours.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we first need to determine the total volume of the tomatoes before they were cooked. Since the sauce made 32 ounces and the tomatoes lose half their volume, the total volume of the tomatoes before cooking must be 2 times the volume of the sauce, which is 2 * 32 = 64 ounces.

Since each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces, we can divide the total volume of the tomatoes before cooking by the volume of each can to find out how many cans were used: 64 / 16 = 4 cans.

Each can contains 3 tomatoes, so the total number of tomatoes used is 4 cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes.

The final answer is: 12"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as x.

We know that 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. 

The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the sum of the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. Since 5 cars took an exit, we need to subtract these from the total number of cars.

The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is (x + 20) - 5.

We are given that there were originally 30 cars on the motorway. Since 5 cars took an exit, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 30 - 5 = 25.

Now we can set up an equation:

x + 20 - 5 = 25

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 15 = 25

Subtracting 15 from both sides, we get:

x = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many potted plants Mary will have left, we need to first determine how many potted plants she has initially and then subtract the number of plants she gives away.

Initially, Mary has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, so she has a total of 2 * 40 = 80 potted plants.

She received 18 new potted plants from the nursery, so now she has 80 + 18 = 98 potted plants.

Tomorrow, she will give away 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges, so she will give away 40 potted plants.

To find out how many potted plants Mary will have left, we subtract the number of plants she gives away from the total number of plants she has: 98 - 40 = 58.

The final answer is: 58"
"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell and add them up.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend, which is 20 + (1/4 * 20) = 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, and since the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times, the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

Now, let's add up the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell: 20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175.

"To find the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to calculate the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends separately and then add them together.

On weekdays, John drinks 4 glasses of water (one with breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and one before bed). Since there are 5 weekdays, he drinks 4 * 5 = 20 glasses of water on weekdays.

On weekends, John drinks 3 glasses of water (one with breakfast, lunch, and one before bed) and 1 glass of soda with dinner. So, he drinks 3 glasses of water on each weekend day. Since there are 2 weekend days, he drinks 3 * 2 = 6 glasses of water on weekends.

Now, we add the total number of glasses of water John drinks on weekdays and weekends: 20 (weekdays) + 6 (weekends) = 26.

The city is 42 miles across, and the fog bank covers 3 miles every 10 minutes. 

First, we need to find out how many 3-mile sections are in 42 miles. We can do this by dividing 42 by 3.

42 miles / 3 miles per section = 14 sections

Since it takes 10 minutes to cover each 3-mile section, we multiply the number of sections by the time it takes to cover each section.

14 sections * 10 minutes per section = 140 minutes

"To find out how many pieces are left to be placed, we first need to determine how many pieces Poppy and her mom have placed.

Poppy places a quarter of the 1000 pieces, which is 1000 * 1/4 = 250 pieces.

The remaining pieces after Poppy's turn are 1000 - 250 = 750.

Then, her mom places a third of the remaining 750 pieces, which is 750 * 1/3 = 250 pieces.

The number of pieces her mom placed is subtracted from the remaining pieces, so 750 - 250 = 500 pieces are left to be placed.

"To find the total number of cookies both Cody and Amir eat, we need to determine how many cookies Cody eats and then add it to the number of cookies Amir eats.

Since Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir, and Amir eats 5 cookies, we can find the number of cookies Cody eats by multiplying the number of cookies Amir eats by 3.

Cody eats 3 * 5 = 15 cookies.

Now, to find the total number of cookies both of them eat, we add the number of cookies Cody eats to the number of cookies Amir eats.

Total cookies = 15 (Cody's cookies) + 5 (Amir's cookies) = 20

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we need to first find the inner volume of one box and then multiply it by 3.

The dimensions of the box are given as 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches, but the walls are 1 inch thick. This means that the inner dimensions of the box will be (5-2) inches by (6-2) inches by (4-2) inches, since 1 inch is subtracted from each side for the wall thickness.

So, the inner dimensions of the box are 3 inches by 4 inches by 2 inches.

The formula to find the volume of a rectangular prism is length * width * height. 

Inner volume of one box = 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches.

Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes = 24 * 3 = 72 cubic inches.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 2 episodes of 1-hour shows, which is a total of 2 * 1 = 2 hours.

On Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. Let's call the number of episodes x. Since each episode is 30 minutes, the total time he watched on Wednesday is 30x minutes.

On Thursday, he watched 1 hour (60 minutes) and 1 30-minute show, for a total of 90 minutes.

On Friday, he watched 2 episodes of 1-hour shows, which is a total of 2 * 1 = 2 hours.

The total time Frankie watched TV is 7 hours, which is equivalent to 7 * 60 = 420 minutes.

We can set up an equation to represent the total time Frankie watched TV:

2 + 30x + 90 + 2 * 60 = 420

Combine like terms:

2 + 30x + 90 + 120 = 420

Combine the constants:

212 + 30x = 420

Subtract 212 from both sides:

30x = 208

Divide both sides by 30:

x = 208 / 30

x = 6.93 (round down to 6.93, but since you can't watch a fraction of an episode, we'll round down to 6)

However, since the question asks for the number of 30-minute episodes, we need to round down to the nearest whole number."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as x.
2. This year, Henry wants to make twice as many cookies as he did last year, so he bakes 2x cookies.
3. However, he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the actual number of cookies he baked is 2x + 15.
4. After dropping 5 cookies, he has a total of 110 cookies, so we can set up the equation: 2x + 15 - 5 = 110.
5. Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 10 = 110.
6. Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get 2x = 100.
7. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 50.

"To find the total cost of gas after the cashback rewards, we need to first calculate the total cost of gas without the rewards, and then subtract the cashback amount.

The cost of gas per gallon is $3.00, and the person is buying 10 gallons. 

Total cost of gas = cost per gallon * number of gallons
Total cost of gas = $3.00 * 10
Total cost of gas = $30.00

The cashback reward is $0.20 per gallon, and the person is buying 10 gallons.

Total cashback = cashback per gallon * number of gallons
Total cashback = $0.20 * 10
Total cashback = $2.00

Now, we subtract the total cashback from the total cost of gas to find the final cost.

Final cost = Total cost of gas - Total cashback
Final cost = $30.00 - $2.00
Final cost = $28.00

The final answer is: $28.00"
"To find the total number of fruit roll-ups eaten by each person, we need to multiply the width and length of each roll-up.

Beatrice's roll-up: 2 roll-ups wide * 24 roll-ups long = 48 roll-ups
Marcell's roll-up: 3 roll-ups wide * 14 roll-ups long = 42 roll-ups

Now, we need to find the total number of roll-ups eaten by each person. Since they ate their entire amount, we can add the number of roll-ups they had.

Total roll-ups eaten by Beatrice: 48 roll-ups
Total roll-ups eaten by Marcell: 42 roll-ups

To find the average number of roll-ups eaten, we need to add the total number of roll-ups eaten by both people and divide by 2.

Total roll-ups eaten by both: 48 roll-ups + 42 roll-ups = 90 roll-ups
Average roll-ups eaten: 90 roll-ups / 2 = 45 roll-ups

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many sets of 10 feet Julia rows in 64 seconds, and then multiply that by the amount of water taken on per set.

First, let's find out how many sets of 10 feet Julia rows in 16 seconds. Since it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can find the rate of rowing as follows:

Rate = Distance / Time = 20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet/second

Now, let's find out how many sets of 10 feet Julia rows in 64 seconds:

Number of sets = Total distance / Distance per set = 64 seconds * (1.25 feet/second) / 10 feet/set = 8 sets

Since Julia takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet she rows, the total amount of water taken on is:

Total water = Number of sets * Water per set = 8 sets * 2 liters/set = 16 liters

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
2. The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.
3. Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.

From point 1, we know that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. Let's denote the number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold as B. Then, Jamal's phone can hold 6B photographs.

We are given that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs. So, we can set up the equation:

6B = 1800

To find the value of B, we divide both sides by 6:

B = 1800 / 6
B = 300

Now, we know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Let's denote the number of birds in Jamal's photograph as D. Then, we can set up the equation:

B = 50D
300 = 50D

To find the value of D, we divide both sides by 50:

D = 300 / 50
D = 6

Therefore, there are 6 ducks that can be seen in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.

"To find the profit, we first need to calculate the total cost and total selling price of the lumber.

The total cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $10 = $100.
The total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $16 = $80.
The total cost of all the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since prices have gone up by 50%, the new price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each.
The new price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 each.

The total selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $15 = $150.
The total selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $24 = $120.
The total selling price of all the lumber is $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit is the total selling price minus the total cost, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of ratios and proportions. The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, which means for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, there are 13 cups of water. 

Let's assume the number of teaspoons of sugar used is 7x and the number of cups of water used is 13x. Since the total amount of sugar and water used is 120, we can set up the equation:

7x + 13x = 120

Combine like terms:

20x = 120

Divide both sides by 20:

"To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we first need to find the total number of vehicles that were already at the port on the first day. 

The customs officer counted 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles on the first day is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of vehicles at the port on the second day is 30. To find the number of vehicles that were brought in on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles on the first day from the total number of vehicles on the second day: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can find the number of containers brought in on the second day by dividing the number of vehicles brought in on the second day by 5: 20 / 5 = 4.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find Lylah's salary four years ago. 

Let's assume Lylah's salary four years ago was x. Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can write an equation:

Adrien's salary = 1.3x

We are given that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000, so we can set up the equation:

1.3x = 40000

To find x, we can divide both sides by 1.3:

x = 40000 / 1.3
x = 30769.23

So, Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30769.23.

Now, we need to find Adrien's salary four years later. We are given that his salary increased by 40%:

Adrien's new salary = 1.4 * 40000
Adrien's new salary = 56000

We also need to find Lylah's new salary. Since her salary increased simultaneously with Adrien's, we can assume the same percentage increase for her. We can find her new salary by increasing her old salary by 40%:

Lylah's new salary = 1.4 * 30769.23
Lylah's new salary = 43055.12

Now, we can find the total salary of both Adrien and Lylah four years later:

Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary
Total salary = 56000 + 43055.12
Total salary = 99055.12

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say the number of letters already in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began is x.

Since Jennie puts stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, she stamps 60 / 3 = 20 letters.

The total number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters now is the sum of the letters already there and the letters Jennie stamped, which is x + 20.

We are given that there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters, so we can set up the equation:

"To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to determine the cost of each item and then multiply it by the quantity.

Let's start by finding the cost of a watermelon. Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, and each pepper costs $15, the cost of a watermelon is 3 * $15 = $45.

Next, we find the cost of an orange. An orange costs 5 dollars less than a watermelon, so the cost of an orange is $45 - $5 = $40.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of each item:

- 4 watermelons: 4 * $45 = $180
- 20 peppers: 20 * $15 = $300
- 10 oranges: 10 * $40 = $400

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is the sum of the costs of all items: $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

The final answer is: $880"
"To find the profit made by the hospital, we need to calculate the total time spent by doctors and the total amount charged to patients, then subtract the cost from the revenue.

First, let's find the total time spent by doctors. Since there are 500 patients and each patient is seen for 24 minutes, the total time spent is:

500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours:

12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

The doctors charge $150 an hour, so the total cost is:

200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000

Now, let's find the total amount charged to patients. Each patient is seen for 24 minutes, which is 0.4 hours (24/60). The hospital charges $200 an hour, so the total amount charged to each patient is:

$200/hour * 0.4 hours = $80

The total amount charged to all patients is:

500 patients * $80/patient = $40,000

The profit made by the hospital is the difference between the total amount charged to patients and the total cost:

Profit = Total amount charged - Total cost
= $40,000 - $30,000
= $10,000

The final answer is: $10,000"
"To find the number of elves left, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, Nissa hires 60 elves.

A third of the elves quit after children vomit on them. To find the number of elves who quit, we divide 60 by 3:
60 / 3 = 20

So, 20 elves quit, leaving 60 - 20 = 40 elves.

Then, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. To find the number of elves left, we subtract 10 from 40:
40 - 10 = 30

Therefore, 30 elves are left.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total expenditure for the two months, we need to add the expenditure in May and June.

The expenditure in May was $500. 
The expenditure in June was $60 less than May, so it is $500 - $60 = $440.

Now, we add the expenditures for May and June: $500 + $440 = $940.

The final answer is: $940"
"To find the total number of tickets used, we need to calculate the total number of rides each person took and then multiply it by the cost of each ride.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, so she rode a total of 2 + 2 = 4 rides.
Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, so he rode a total of 4 + 2 = 6 rides.

The total number of rides is 4 (Pam's rides) + 6 (Fred's rides) = 10 rides.

Since each ride costs 6 tickets, the total number of tickets used is 10 rides * 6 tickets per ride = 60 tickets.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we need to first determine how many miles he walked on Tuesday. 

Since Walt walked 6 times as many miles on Tuesday as he did on Monday, and he walked 4 miles on Monday, we can calculate the miles walked on Tuesday as follows:

Miles walked on Tuesday = 6 * miles walked on Monday
= 6 * 4
= 24 miles

Now, we know that the total mileage from Monday through Wednesday is 41 miles. We already know the miles walked on Monday (4 miles) and Tuesday (24 miles). To find the miles walked on Wednesday, we subtract the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage:

Miles walked on Wednesday = Total mileage - (Miles walked on Monday + Miles walked on Tuesday)
= 41 - (4 + 24)
= 41 - 28
= 13 miles

The final answer is: 13"
"To find out how much Tom pays in a year, we need to calculate the total cost of car washes per month and then multiply it by 12 (the number of months in a year).

Tom gets 4 car washes a month, and each car wash costs $15. 

The total cost per month is: 4 car washes/month * $15/car wash = $60/month

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total cost per year is: $60/month * 12 months/year = $720/year

The final numerical answer is: $720"
"To find out how many video games Bobby has, we first need to determine how many video games Brian has after losing 5. 

Brian initially has 20 video games, but he lost 5, so he now has 20 - 5 = 15 video games.

Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian. To find out how many video games Bobby has, we multiply the number of video games Brian has by 3 and then subtract 5.

3 times the number of video games Brian has is 3 * 15 = 45.

5 fewer than 45 is 45 - 5 = 40.

Bobby has 40 video games.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the number of female Scottish unicorns, we first need to find the total number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands. 

One third of the 27 unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands. 
So, the number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands = 27 / 3 = 9.

Now, we need to find the number of female unicorns in the Scottish Highlands. 
Two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female. 
So, the number of female Scottish unicorns = 2/3 * 9 = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total cost of Rory's delivery order, we need to calculate the cost of the items, add the delivery fee, and then add the tip.

First, let's calculate the cost of the items:
- 2 subs for $7.50 each: 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
- 2 bags of chips for $1.50 each: 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
- 2 cookies for $1.00 each: 2 x $1.00 = $2.00
Total cost of items: $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

Next, let's calculate the delivery fee: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 x $20.00 = $4.00

Now, let's add the delivery fee to the total cost of items: $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Finally, let's add the $5.00 tip: $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

The final answer is: $29.00"
"To find out how many questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate the total number of questions he completed in each test and then subtract that from the total number of questions in each test.

For the first test, Mark had 8 hours to complete 75 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour. 

First, let's find out how many questions Mark completed in 8 hours:
8 hours * 5 questions/hour = 40 questions

Since Mark completed 40 questions in 8 hours, he left 75 - 40 = 35 questions incomplete in the first test.

For the second test, Mark had 6 hours to complete 100 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour.

Now, let's find out how many questions Mark completed in 6 hours:
6 hours * 5 questions/hour = 30 questions

Since Mark completed 30 questions in 6 hours, he left 100 - 30 = 70 questions incomplete in the second test.

To find the total number of questions Mark left incomplete, we add the number of incomplete questions from both tests:
35 (incomplete in the first test) + 70 (incomplete in the second test) = 105

The final answer is: 105"
"To find the number of pink gumballs, we need to first find four times the number of blue gumballs and then add 22 to it.

"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine the total number of semi-automatic cars. 

Total number of cars = 20
Number of automatic cars = 12
Number of manual cars = 4

Number of semi-automatic cars = Total number of cars - (Number of automatic cars + Number of manual cars)
= 20 - (12 + 4)
= 20 - 16
= 4

Now, we can find the percentage of semi-automatic cars:
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100
= (4 / 20) * 100
= 0.2 * 100
= 20%

"Let's denote the number of baby bees as B, the number of worker bees as W, and the number of queens as Q.

We are given that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so W = 2B.

We are also given that there are twice as many babies as queens, so B = 2Q.

We know that the total number of bees in the hive is 700, so W + B + Q = 700.

Substituting W = 2B and B = 2Q into the equation W + B + Q = 700, we get:

2B + B + Q = 700
3B + Q = 700

Since B = 2Q, we can substitute this into the equation 3B + Q = 700 to get:

3(2Q) + Q = 700
6Q + Q = 700
7Q = 700

Dividing both sides by 7, we get:

Q = 100

Now that we know Q = 100, we can find B by substituting Q into the equation B = 2Q:

B = 2(100)
B = 200

Now that we know B = 200, we can find W by substituting B into the equation W = 2B:

W = 2(200)
W = 400

The number of worker bees is 400."
"To find out how much money Jordan would earn in one week, we need to calculate the total hours he would work in a week and then multiply it by his hourly wage.

Since Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day, if he spent his video game time working instead, he would work 2 hours more each day. 

There are 7 days in a week, so the total hours he would work in a week is 2 hours/day * 7 days = 14 hours.

His hourly wage is $10, so the total amount of money he would earn in a week is 14 hours * $10/hour = $140.

The final answer is: $140"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of food items and non-food items separately and then add them together.

Food items: milk and eggs
Cost of milk = 2 dollars
Cost of eggs = 3 dollars
Total cost of food items = 2 + 3 = 5 dollars

Non-food items: light bulbs, cups, and roach traps
Cost of light bulbs = 3 dollars
Cost of cups = 3 dollars
Cost of roach traps = 4 dollars
Total cost of non-food items = 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars

Since there is a 10% tax on non-food items, we need to calculate the tax amount:
Tax amount = 10% of 10 dollars = 0.1 * 10 = 1 dollar

Now, we add the tax amount to the total cost of non-food items:
Total cost of non-food items with tax = 10 + 1 = 11 dollars

Now, we add the total cost of food items and non-food items with tax:
Total cost = 5 + 11 = 16 dollars

"To calculate the total profit, we first need to determine the total income and total expenses. 

Kim has 3 current clients and 5 potential clients, making a total of 8 clients. Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. 

Total bottles of bleach needed per week = 8 clients * 2 bottles/client = 16 bottles
Total packs of cloths needed per week = 8 clients * 1 pack/client = 8 packs

The cost of bleach per week = 16 bottles * $2/bottle = $32
The cost of cloths per week = 8 packs * $5/pack = $40

Total expenses per week = $32 (bleach) + $40 (cloths) = $72

Since Kim's total income per week is $92, we can calculate the profit as follows:

Profit = Total income - Total expenses
Profit = $92 - $72
Profit = $20

"To find the total number of pineapples John has, we multiply the number of hectares by the number of pineapples per hectare.

10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, we need to find out how many 3-month periods are in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so we divide 12 by 3 to get the number of harvests.

12 months / 3 months/harvest = 4 harvests

Now, we multiply the total number of pineapples by the number of harvests to find the total number of pineapples John can harvest in a year.

1000 pineapples * 4 harvests = 4000 pineapples

"To find the total number of blocks Johnny picks up, we need to calculate the number of pieces in each set and add them together.

The first set has 500 pieces.
The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first set, so it has 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces.
The third set has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first set, so it has (1/4) * 500 = 125 pieces.

Now, we add the number of pieces in each set together: 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of the bees that left in the first 6 hours return. So, 1/2 * 30 = 15 bees return.
3. The number of bees that have left but not returned so far is 30 - 15 = 15 bees.
4. In the next 6 hours, two times as many bees as the ones that left in the first 6 hours fly from the hive and leave. So, 2 * 30 = 60 bees leave.
5. The total number of bees that have left but not returned so far is 15 (from step 3) + 60 (from step 4) = 75 bees.
6. In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive. So, 75 bees return.

The cost of 1 adult ticket is $12 and the cost of 1 child ticket is $10. 

Total cost = cost of adult ticket + cost of child ticket
Total cost = $12 + $10
Total cost = $22

Since Brittany's mom received $8 in change, we need to add this to the total cost to find out how much she gave the cashier.

Total given = Total cost + Change
Total given = $22 + $8

"To find the number of friends James has, we first need to determine the number of friends Dorothy has. Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy and Charlie has 12 friends, we can set up the equation:

Charlie's friends = 3 * Dorothy's friends
12 = 3 * Dorothy's friends

To find Dorothy's friends, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

Dorothy's friends = 12 / 3
Dorothy's friends = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find James' friends. James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, so we multiply Dorothy's friends by 4:

James' friends = 4 * Dorothy's friends
James' friends = 4 * 4
James' friends = 16

"To find out who will win the race, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school.

First, let's convert the distances to the same unit. Since Steve's speed is given in feet per minute, we'll convert the distances to feet. There are 5280 feet in a mile, so:

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15,840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10,560 feet

Now, let's calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home:

Steve's time: distance / speed = 15,840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: distance / speed = 10,560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 36 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve will win the race. To find out how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes, we need to subtract the winner's time from the loser's time:

Waiting time = Tim's time - Steve's time = 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

"To find the total amount of money Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total cost of inflating all the tires.

First, let's calculate the cost of inflating the bicycle tires. Each bicycle has 2 tires, and there were 5 bicycles. So, the total number of bicycle tires is 5 * 2 = 10. The cost of inflating each tire is 25 cents, so the total cost of inflating the bicycle tires is 10 * 25 = 250 cents.

Next, let's calculate the cost of inflating the tricycle tires. Each tricycle has 3 tires, and there were 3 tricycles. So, the total number of tricycle tires is 3 * 3 = 9. The cost of inflating each tire is 25 cents, so the total cost of inflating the tricycle tires is 9 * 25 = 225 cents.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of inflating the unicycle tire. A unicycle has 1 tire, and there was 1 unicycle. So, the total number of unicycle tires is 1 * 1 = 1. The cost of inflating each tire is 25 cents, so the total cost of inflating the unicycle tire is 1 * 25 = 25 cents.

Now, let's add up the total cost of inflating all the tires: 250 + 225 + 25 = 500 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100: 500 / 100 = 5.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of french fries as x.

1. Dave ate 14 fries, so the remaining fries are x - 14.
2. The seagull ate half of the 14 fries Dave ate, which is 14/2 = 7 fries. So, the seagull ate a total of 7 fries. Now, the remaining fries are (x - 14) - 7 = x - 21.
3. Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate a total of 3 * 3 = 9 fries. Now, the remaining fries are (x - 21) - 9 = x - 30.
4. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries, which is (2/3)(x - 30). The remaining fries are (x - 30) - (2/3)(x - 30) = (1/3)(x - 30).
5. Ants carried off 1 fry, leaving 5 fries behind. So, (1/3)(x - 30) - 1 = 5.
6. Now, let's solve for x: (1/3)(x - 30) = 6
   Multiply both sides by 3: x - 30 = 18
   Add 30 to both sides: x = 48

"To find the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in a semester, we need to calculate the total hours he spends in a week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a semester.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes per day, each lasting 1 hour. So, the total hours he spends on these days in a week is:
3 classes/day * 1 hour/class * 3 days = 9 hours

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes per day, each lasting 2 hours. So, the total hours he spends on these days in a week is:
2 classes/day * 2 hours/class * 2 days = 8 hours

The total hours Kimo spends in a week is the sum of the hours spent on these two sets of days:
9 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours

"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the total length of each type of baked good and then add them together.

First, let's convert the length of the baguettes from feet to inches, since the lengths of the rolls and croissants are given in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so each baguette is 2 * 12 = 24 inches long.

Now, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good:

- Rolls: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches
- Croissants: 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches
- Baguettes: 60 baguettes * 24 inches/baguette = 1440 inches

Now, let's add the lengths together: 1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 inches

"To find the total number of bananas needed for 2 months, we need to calculate the total number of bananas needed for each type of ape and then add them together.

The monkeys need 200 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 200 * 2 = 400 bananas.

The gorillas need 400 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 400 * 2 = 800 bananas.

The baboons need 100 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 100 * 2 = 200 bananas.

Now, let's add the total number of bananas needed for each type of ape: 400 + 800 + 200 = 1400 bananas.

The zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months.

"To find out who the winner is, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Since he's running back and forth, the total distance he covers is 2 times the length of the field for each run. So, the total distance Blake ran is 15 * 2 * 100 = 3000 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 2 * 100 = 200 yards. Then, she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 2 * 40 = 80 yards. She does this 34 times, so the total distance she ran is 200 + (34 * 80) = 200 + 2720 = 2920 yards.

Since 3000 is greater than 2920, Blake is the winner.

To find out how much farther the winner ran than the loser, we subtract the loser's distance from the winner's distance: 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. 

Total fish caught by Anakin = 10 + 6 + 3 = 19

Now, let's find the number of fish caught by Locsin. 

Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so he caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.

Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so he caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.

Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so he caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Total fish caught by Locsin = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

Now, let's find the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin.

Total fish caught = Total fish caught by Anakin + Total fish caught by Locsin

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the price increase every two months and add it to the original price. 

The original price of the bag of marbles is $20. 

After 2 months, the price increases by 20% of $20, which is 0.20 * $20 = $4. 
So, the price after 2 months is $20 + $4 = $24.

After 4 months, the price increases by 20% of $24, which is 0.20 * $24 = $4.80. 
So, the price after 4 months is $24 + $4.80 = $28.80.

After 6 months, the price increases by 20% of $28.80, which is 0.20 * $28.80 = $5.76. 
So, the price after 6 months is $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56.

After 8 months, the price increases by 20% of $34.56, which is 0.20 * $34.56 = $6.912. 
So, the price after 8 months is $34.56 + $6.912 = $41.472.

After 10 months, the price increases by 20% of $41.472, which is 0.20 * $41.472 = $8.2944. 
So, the price after 10 months is $41.472 + $8.2944 = $49.7664.

After 12 months, the price increases by 20% of $49.7664, which is 0.20 * $49.7664 = $9.95328. 
So, the price after 12 months is $49.7664 + $9.95328 = $59.71968.

After 14 months, the price increases by 20% of $59.71968, which is 0.20 * $59.71968 = $11.943936.

"To find the total worth of all the toys, we need to calculate the cost of each type of toy and then add them together.

The doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and since an action figure costs $5, the doll costs 3 * $5 = $15.

One red car costs $4. 

Now, let's calculate the total cost of all the toys:
- 5 red cars: 5 * $4 = $20
- 3 action figures: 3 * $5 = $15
- 1 doll: $15

Total cost = $20 + $15 + $15 = $50

"To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the difference between the income she'll lose by doing the taxes herself and the cost of hiring the accountant.

First, let's calculate the income she'll lose by doing the taxes herself:

Income lost = Number of hours worked * Hourly wage
Income lost = 3 hours * $35/hour
Income lost = $105

Now, let's compare this to the cost of hiring the accountant:

Cost of hiring the accountant = $90

Since the income lost by doing the taxes herself is greater than the cost of hiring the accountant, Jackie will have more money if she hires the accountant. To find out how much more, we subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the income lost:

Difference = Income lost - Cost of hiring the accountant
Difference = $105 - $90
Difference = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"To find out how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to subtract the total cost of the computer accessories from her budget.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the accessories:

- Computer: €1090
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Total cost = €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102 = €1323

Now, let's subtract the total cost from Elvira's budget:

Budget = €1500
Total cost = €1323

Money left for clothing = Budget - Total cost
= €1500 - €1323
= €177

So, Elvira will have €177 left for her clothing."
"To find out how many times Sandra has to babysit, we need to determine how many eggs she needs in total to make 15 Spanish flans and then divide that by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting job.

Since each Spanish flan requires 3 eggs, the total number of eggs needed for 15 flans is:
15 * 3 = 45 eggs

Since Sandra gets 9 eggs per babysitting job, we can divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per job:
45 / 9 = 5

So, Sandra has to babysit 5 times to get enough eggs to make 15 Spanish flans.

The final answer is: 5"
"Let's denote Brooke's current age as B and Seth's current age as S. We are given that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write an equation:

S = 2B

We are also given that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. This means that in 2 years, Seth's age will be S + 2 and Brooke's age will be B + 2. The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write another equation:

S + 2 + B + 2 = 28

Combine like terms:

S + B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

S + B = 24

Now we can substitute S = 2B into this equation:

2B + B = 24

Combine like terms:

3B = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B = 8 into the equation S = 2B:

S = 2(8)
S = 16

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much money Jimmy has, we need to first determine what ""twice the money Ethel has"" is. Since Ethel has $8, twice that amount would be 2 * 8 = 16.

"To find the total miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to calculate the miles he walks on weekdays and weekends separately and then add them together.

Pancho walks 20 miles a day from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days. So, the total miles he walks on weekdays is 20 * 5 = 100 miles.

On weekends, he walks 10 miles a day for 2 days. So, the total miles he walks on weekends is 10 * 2 = 20 miles.

Now, we add the miles walked on weekdays and weekends to get the total miles walked in a week: 100 + 20 = 120 miles.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of the hat, jacket, and pants separately and then add them together.

The cost of the hat is given as $25.

The cost of the jacket is three times as much as the hat, so it is 3 * $25 = $75.

The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. To find the average, we add the costs of the hat and jacket and divide by 2. The average cost of the pants is ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50.

Now, we add the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants together to find the total cost of each uniform: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red.
2. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four.
3. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, and Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.

From point 3, we know Sally Four is 8 years old. 

From point 2, we can deduce that Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

From point 1, we can deduce that Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we have the ages of three birds: Sally Four (8), Granny Red (16), and Sally Two (19). 

The only bird left is Sally Thirtytwo, and we already know she is 8 years old.

To find the total age of the four birds, we add their ages together: 8 + 16 + 19 + 8 = 51.

"To find out how much Jessica pays in a year, we need to calculate the total monthly payments and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's calculate the increased minimum payments:

- Student loans: $300 * 1.5 = $450
- Credit card: $200 * 1.5 = $300
- Mortgage: $500 * 1.5 = $750

Now, let's add up the increased minimum payments:
$450 + $300 + $750 = $1500

Since Jessica pays this amount every month, we multiply it by 12 to get the total annual payment:
$1500 * 12 = $18,000

"To find the total time it takes Billy to peel and cut all the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel one potato and multiply it by the total number of potatoes, and then add the time it takes to cut one potato multiplied by the total number of potatoes.

Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds = 5/60 minutes (converting seconds to minutes)

Total time to peel all potatoes: 60 potatoes * 1.5 minutes/potato = 90 minutes
Total time to cut all potatoes: 60 potatoes * (5/60) minutes/potato = 5 minutes

Total time to peel and cut all potatoes: 90 minutes + 5 minutes = 95 minutes

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much they made in total from selling lemonade and then subtract the cost of sugar to find the cost of lemons.

Let's start by finding the total revenue from selling lemonade. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. So, the revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10.

Since they made $25 in profit, and we know that profit is revenue minus cost, we can set up an equation to find the total revenue. Let's denote the number of gallons as 'g'. Then, the total revenue is $10g. The cost of lemons and sugar per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5. The total cost is $5g. The profit is $25, so we can set up the equation:

$10g - $5g = $25

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$5g = $25

Dividing both sides by $5, we get:

g = 5

So, they made 5 gallons of lemonade.

Now, we know that the cost of lemons per gallon is $3. The total cost of lemons is $3 * 5 = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the number of Chinese participants, we first need to subtract the number of Japanese participants from the total number of participants. 

Total participants = 240
Japanese participants = 80
Chinese participants = Total participants - Japanese participants
Chinese participants = 240 - 80
Chinese participants = 160

Since we know that the number of boys on the Chinese team was 60, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants.

Number of girls = Chinese participants - Number of boys
Number of girls = 160 - 60
Number of girls = 100

"To find out how much money Zaid will have left after all these expenses and donations, we need to follow the order of operations.

1. Zaid earns 6000$ per month.
2. He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent: 1/4 * 6000 = 1500$
3. He spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel: 1/3 * 6000 = 2000$
4. The remaining amount after rent and car fuel is: 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500$
5. He donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity: 1/2 * 2500 = 1250$
6. The remaining amount after donation is: 2500 - 1250 = 1250$

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, the number of red roses is 4x.

We are also given that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, so the number of pink calla lilies is 5x.

We know that the total number of pink calla lilies is 200, so we can set up the equation 5x = 200 to find the value of x.

Solving for x, we get x = 200 / 5 = 40.

Now that we know the value of x, we can find the number of red roses by multiplying x by 4: 4x = 4 * 40 = 160.

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jean is two years older than Mark.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age.
3. Jan is 30 years old.

From point 2, we can write an equation to represent the situation two years ago:

Mark's age two years ago = (1/2) * Jan's age two years ago + 5

Since Jan is 30 now, two years ago Jan was 28. 

Mark's age two years ago = (1/2) * 28 + 5
Mark's age two years ago = 14 + 5
Mark's age two years ago = 19

Now, we know that Mark's age two years ago was 19. To find Mark's current age, we add 2 to this:

Mark's current age = 19 + 2
Mark's current age = 21

Since Jean is two years older than Mark, we can find Jean's age by adding 2 to Mark's age:

Jean's age = Mark's age + 2
Jean's age = 21 + 2
Jean's age = 23

"To find the total time for each team, we need to calculate the time for each runner and add them up.

The well-rounded team's total time is 4 x 55 seconds = 220 seconds.

The less well-rounded team's first runner runs 60 seconds. The second runner is 3 seconds faster, so they run 60 - 3 = 57 seconds. The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so they run 57 - 3 = 54 seconds. The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so they run 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

The less well-rounded team's total time is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 162 seconds.

The difference in time between the two teams is 220 - 162 = 58 seconds.

The faster team will win by 58 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, and then find the difference between these two probabilities.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die is the number of favorable outcomes (4, 5, 6) divided by the total number of possible outcomes (6). This is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5 or 50%.

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is the product of the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll and the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll. The probability of rolling an even number on a six-sided die is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5. Therefore, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 = 0.25 or 25%.

Now, we need to find the difference between these two probabilities. The difference is 50% - 25% = 25%.

So, Jerry is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of small rodents (rats and hamsters) and the total number of straw pieces given to them. We know that 160 pieces of straw are distributed among the small rodents.

Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as 'r'. Since there are 3 cages of rats, the total number of rats is 3r.

The number of hamsters is given as 10.

The total number of small rodents is the sum of the number of rats and hamsters: 3r + 10.

Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. The total number of straw pieces given to the small rodents is 160. We can set up the equation:

6(3r) + 5(10) = 160

Simplifying the equation:

18r + 50 = 160

Subtract 50 from both sides:

18r = 110

Divide both sides by 18:

r = 110 / 18
r = 110 / (2 * 9)
r = 55 / 9
r = 6.11 (approximately)

However, since the number of rats must be a whole number, we need to find the closest whole number that satisfies the equation. We can try r = 6:

18(6) + 50 = 108 + 50 = 158 (not equal to 160)

We can try r = 7:

18(7) + 50 = 126 + 50 = 176 (greater than 160)

Since r = 6 is too low and r = 7 is too high, we can try r = 6.11, which is approximately equal to 6.11. However, since we need a whole number, we can try r = 6 and see if it's close enough.

However, we can also try to find the exact number of rats by using the fact that the total number of straw pieces given to the small rodents is 160. We can set up the equation:

"To find the total amount Mandy should pay, we need to calculate the interest for 3 months and add it to the initial amount.

The formula for simple interest is: A = P(1 + rt), where A is the total amount, P is the principal amount, r is the interest rate, and t is the time in years.

However, in this case, we are given the interest rate as a monthly rate, so we need to convert it to an annual rate first. Since there are 12 months in a year, the annual interest rate is 2% * 12 = 24%.

Now, we can calculate the interest for 3 months: 
Interest = P * r * t = $100 * (24%/year) * (3/12) = $100 * 0.02 * 0.25 = $0.5

The total amount Mandy should pay is the initial amount plus the interest: 
Total Amount = $100 + $0.5 = $100.5

The final answer is: $100.5"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total cost of buying the bags of wheat and the total cost of transporting them. Let's denote the number of bags as 'x'.

The cost of buying the bags is $20x.

The cost of transporting each bag is $2, so the total cost of transportation is $2x.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of buying and the cost of transportation: $20x + $2x = $22x.

The trader sold the bags at a rate of $30 each, so the total revenue is $30x.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost: $30x - $22x = $8x.

We are given that the profit is $400, so we can set up the equation: $8x = $400.

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 8: x = $400 / $8 = 50.

Therefore, the trader sold 50 bags.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how much each friend paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets, food, and rides, and then divide it by 3.

First, let's find the cost of the food. They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. Since they spent $20.25 on tickets, the cost of food is:
$20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75

The cost of the rides is 2 rides * $33 per ride = $66.

Now, let's add up the total cost:
$20.25 (tickets) + $15.75 (food) + $66 (rides) = $102

Since they split the cost evenly among 3 friends, each friend's share is:
$102 / 3 = $34

10 ducks * 3.5 pounds/duck/week = 35 pounds/week

Next, we need to find the amount of insects needed per day. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total amount of insects needed per week by 7:

35 pounds/week / 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of trees Tom has after 10 years, and then subtract the 30% that die.

First, let's calculate the net change in the number of trees per year:

Trees planted per year: 10
Trees chopped down per year: 2
Net change per year: 10 - 2 = 8

Since Tom starts with 50 trees, we can calculate the total number of trees after 10 years:

Initial trees: 50
Net change per year: 8
Number of years: 10
Total trees after 10 years: 50 + (8 * 10) = 50 + 80 = 130

However, we need to account for the 30% of trees that die after 10 years. To do this, we calculate 30% of the total trees after 10 years:

30% of 130 = 0.3 * 130 = 39

Now, we subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees after 10 years:

Total trees after 10 years: 130
Trees that die: 39
Trees left: 130 - 39 = 91

The final answer is: 91"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos on Sue's front yard.

On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. They painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back out on Sue's front yard. So, now there are 6 white flamingos and 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos.

On Sunday morning, the neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection. Now, there are 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos.

The total number of flamingos on Sue's front yard is 30 pink + 6 white = 36 flamingos.

To find out how many more pink plastic flamingos were out than white plastic flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

= 10 crayons

Since Violetta needs 5 different colors, she can buy 2 crayons of each color. 

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the crayons she can buy:
Total cost = Number of crayons * Cost per crayon
= 10 * $2
= $20

Since Violetta has already spent $20, she will get no change.

"To find the cost of 8 pens, we first need to determine the cost of one pen. Since a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined, we can calculate the cost of one pen as follows:

Cost of pencil = $1.20
Cost of eraser = $0.30
Cost of pen = Cost of pencil + Cost of eraser
Cost of pen = $1.20 + $0.30
Cost of pen = $1.50

Now that we know the cost of one pen, we can find the cost of 8 pens by multiplying the cost of one pen by 8:

Cost of 8 pens = Cost of one pen * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $1.50 * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $12

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote the number of sentences Mark edits for each publisher as x. Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, we can say that x = 1000 / 2 = 500 sentences for each publisher.

Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence, so the total amount Mark earns from Publisher A is 5x = 5 * 500 = 2500 cents.

Since Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, the rate per sentence for Publisher B is 2 * 5 = 10 cents. The total amount Mark earns from Publisher B is 10x = 10 * 500 = 5000 cents.

To find the total amount Mark makes in a week, we add the earnings from both publishers: 2500 + 5000 = 7500 cents.

New weekly salary = $2000 + $100 = $2100

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, we multiply his new weekly salary by 52:
Total annual salary = $2100 * 52 = $109200

Now, let's add the one-time monetary reward of $5000 to his total annual salary:

"To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we first need to find the total score she needs for the semester. Since Mr. Bert allows the students to remove the lowest score, we will first find the total score of the five tests and then add the score of the sixth test to it.

The average of the six tests is 93, and there are six tests, so the total score for the semester is 93 * 6 = 558.

The total score of the first five tests is 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 338.

Since Brinley can remove the lowest score, we need to find the lowest score among the five tests. The lowest score is 71.

Now, we subtract the lowest score from the total score of the first five tests to get the new total score: 338 - 71 = 267.

Now, we add the score of the sixth test to the new total score to get the total score for the semester: 267 + x = 558, where x is the score of the sixth test.

To find x, we subtract 267 from both sides of the equation: x = 558 - 267.

x = 291.

Half a dozen plates cost 6 * $6000 = $36,000.

Now, we know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, the total cost of twenty dozen cups is $36,000 - $1200 = $34,800.

Since twenty dozen cups is equal to 20 * 12 = 240 cups, we can find the cost of each cup by dividing the total cost by the number of cups.

Cost of each cup = Total cost of twenty dozen cups / Number of cups

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy and the total amount of money she has earned from babysitting. 

The total cost of the items is the cost of the jacket plus the cost of 2 pairs of shoes: 
$30 (jacket) + 2 * $20 (shoes) = $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved, and she earns $5 each time she babysits. To find out how much more money she needs, we subtract the amount she already has from the total cost:
$70 (total cost) - $10 (initial savings) = $60.

Since Sara earns $5 each time she babysits, we need to find out how many times she needs to babysit to earn $60:
$60 (amount needed) / $5 (babysitting pay) = 12 times.

However, we also need to consider that Sara earns money from mowing the lawn. Her parents pay her $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn, we need to subtract the amount she earns from babysitting from the total amount she needs:
$60 (amount needed) - $60 (babysitting earnings) = $0.

Since she already has enough money from babysitting, she doesn't need to mow the lawn at all.

The final answer is: $0"
"Let's denote the number of red chickens as R and the number of white chickens as W. We are given that W = R + 2.

We also know that each red chicken produces 3 eggs per day and each white chicken produces 5 eggs per day. The total number of eggs collected per day is 42.

We can set up the equation based on the given information:

3R + 5W = 42

Substitute W = R + 2 into the equation:

3R + 5(R + 2) = 42

Expand the equation:

3R + 5R + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8R + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8R = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

R = 4

The number of red chickens is 4. 

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the time Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the dimensions of the park, l = 6 miles and w = 1.5 miles, we can plug these values into the formula:

P = 2(6 + 1.5)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at a constant speed of 3 miles/hour, we can find the time he spends walking by dividing the perimeter by his speed:

Time = Perimeter / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of customers on the first day as x. We know that the number of customers on the second day is 50 more than the first day, so it can be represented as x + 50.

The total number of customers by the third day is given as 500. Since the number of customers on the second day is x + 50, the number of customers on the third day can be represented as (x + 50) + y, where y is the number of customers on the third day. However, we are given that the total number of customers by the third day is 500, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 50) + y = 500

We also know that the number of customers on the first day is 100, so we can substitute x = 100 into the equation:

100 + (100 + 50) + y = 500

Combine like terms:

150 + y = 500

Subtract 150 from both sides:

y = 350

However, we are asked to find the number of customers on the third day, which is (x + 50) + y. We already know that y = 350, and x = 100, so we can substitute these values into the expression:

(100 + 50) + 350 = 150 + 350 = 500

However, this is the total number of customers by the third day, not the number of customers on the third day. We need to find the number of customers on the third day, which is the number of customers on the second day plus the number of customers on the third day. We already know that the number of customers on the second day is x + 50 = 100 + 50 = 150. 

The number of customers on the third day is 500 - 150 = 350.

The final answer is: 350"
"Let's denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as x gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the initial amount of water in the big pool is 2x gallons.

Since both pools leak at 4 gallons/minute, the rate of change of water in each pool is -4 gallons/minute. 

The time elapsed is 4 minutes, so the change in water in each pool is -4 * 4 = -16 gallons.

The big pool now has 2x - 16 gallons of water, and the small pool has x - 16 gallons of water.

According to the problem, the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool, so we can set up the equation:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Simplifying the equation:

2x - 16 = 4x - 64

Subtracting 2x from both sides:

-16 = 2x - 64

Adding 64 to both sides:

48 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

24 = x

So the initial amount of water in the small pool was 24 gallons. 

Since the small pool lost 16 gallons in 4 minutes, the amount of water in the small pool now is:

24 - 16 = 8 gallons

The final answer is: 8"
"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn, which is the sum of the cost of the shoes and the belt. 

Total cost = Cost of shoes + Cost of belt
Total cost = $320.00 + $32.00
Total cost = $352.00

Since Lori earns $8.00 per hour, we can divide the total cost by her hourly wage to find out how many hours she needs to work.

Hours worked = Total cost / Hourly wage
Hours worked = $352.00 / $8.00
Hours worked = 44 hours

The final answer is: 44"
"To find the remaining balance, we first need to calculate the total amount Janeth will pay in 12 months. 

The monthly payment is $165, and she will pay for 12 months, so the total amount paid will be:
$165 * 12 = $1980

Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. The additional amount is 10% of $2000, which is:
$2000 * 0.10 = $200

So, the total amount Janeth will pay is the initial amount plus the additional 10%:
$2000 + $200 = $2200

However, she will only pay $1980, so the remaining balance will be:
$2200 - $1980 = $220

The final answer is: $220"
"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to determine the number of dahlias and add it to the number of roses.

We know there are 4 roses in the vase. We also know that there are 7 more dahlias than roses. 

Let's represent the number of dahlias as D. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, we can write an equation:

D = 4 + 7
D = 11

Now, we know there are 11 dahlias. To find the total number of flowers, we add the number of roses and dahlias:

Total flowers = 4 (roses) + 11 (dahlias)
Total flowers = 15

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the average age of the three in three years, we first need to find their current ages and then add 3 to each age. 

Given that Harriet is 21 years old, and she is half the age of Zack, we can find Zack's age by multiplying Harriet's age by 2. 

Zack's age = 2 * Harriet's age = 2 * 21 = 42

Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, so we can find Adrian's age by multiplying Harriet's age by 3.

Adrian's age = 3 * Harriet's age = 3 * 21 = 63

Now, we have the current ages of the three: Harriet (21), Zack (42), and Adrian (63). 

In three years, their ages will be: 
- Harriet's age in 3 years = 21 + 3 = 24
- Zack's age in 3 years = 42 + 3 = 45
- Adrian's age in 3 years = 63 + 3 = 66

To find the average age in three years, we add their ages and divide by 3.

Average age in 3 years = (24 + 45 + 66) / 3
Average age in 3 years = 135 / 3
Average age in 3 years = 45

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first find out how many points Yuri and Brianna scored. 

Naomi scored 68 points. 
Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. 
Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. 
Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points. 

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

We know that the total points scored by the four students is 251. 
We can subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total to find out how many points Jojo scored. 
Jojo's points = Total points - (Naomi's points + Yuri's points + Brianna's points) 
Jojo's points = 251 - (68 + 44 + 85) 
Jojo's points = 251 - 197

"To find the amount of water left in the tank after Celine used 90 liters, we subtract 90 from the initial amount of water in the tank.

Initial water in the tank = 120 liters
Water used by Celine = 90 liters
Water left in the tank = 120 - 90 = 30 liters

Since Celine collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left, we multiply the amount of water left by 2.

Rainwater collected = 2 * 30 = 60 liters

Now, we add the rainwater collected to the amount of water left in the tank to find the total amount of water in the tank.

Total water in the tank = Water left in the tank + Rainwater collected
= 30 + 60
= 90 liters

The trip to Rochester by bus takes 6 days. 
The trip from New Jersey to Rochester by car takes half as many days as the bus trip, which is 6 / 2 = 3 days.

Since Andrew will return from Rochester by car, the return trip will also take 3 days.

The total number of days for the trip to Rochester by bus is 6 days.
The total number of days for the return trip from Rochester by car is 3 days.

The total number of days for the entire trip is 6 + 3 = 9 days.

"To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we need to first calculate the total number of cards James has after losing 8 water type and buying 14 grass type.

Initially, James has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards. 

After losing 8 water type cards, he has:
- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 20
- Water type: 40 - 8 = 32

After buying 14 grass type cards, he has:
- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 20 + 14 = 34
- Water type: 32

The total number of cards James has now is 30 + 34 + 32 = 96.

The number of water type cards is 32.

To find the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we divide the number of water type cards by the total number of cards and multiply by 100:

(32 / 96) * 100 = 33.333...

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33.

"To find out how much Chad still owes, we need to calculate the total cost of his meal and then subtract the gift card amount.

The base burrito costs $6.50. 
He adds extra meat for $2.00, extra cheese for $1.00, avocado for $1.00, and 2 sauces for $0.25 each, which is 2 * $0.25 = $0.50. 
So, the total cost of the extra items is $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $4.50.
The total cost of the meal before the upgrade is $6.50 + $4.50 = $11.00.
He upgrades his meal for an extra $3.00, so the new total is $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00.

"To find the total number of pieces Kalinda and her mom can place per minute, we need to determine how many pieces her mom can place per minute. Since her mom can place half as many pieces as Kalinda, and Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute, her mom can place 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute.

The total number of pieces they can place per minute is 4 (Kalinda) + 2 (her mom) = 6 pieces per minute.

To find the total time it will take to complete the puzzle, we need to divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they can place per minute. 

360 pieces / 6 pieces per minute = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in 1 hour, we can convert the time from minutes to hours by dividing by 60.

60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Therefore, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, there were 120 baby watermelons.

After two months, 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest. To find 30% of 120, we multiply 120 by 0.3.

120 * 0.3 = 36

So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest after two months. This means 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons were not ready.

After two weeks, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest. To find 3/4 of 84, we multiply 84 by 3/4.

84 * (3/4) = 63

So, 63 watermelons were ready for harvest after two weeks. This means 84 - 63 = 21 watermelons were not ready.

The tax on the cars is 10% of the total cost of the cars:
10% of $240,000 = 0.1 * $240,000 = $24,000

The registration fees are $1000 per car, so for 12 cars:
12 * $1000 = $12,000

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees:

"To find out how many vines Steve needs, we first need to determine how many tomatoes he eats per week. Since he eats 6 tomatoes per day, we multiply this by 7 to get the total number of tomatoes he eats per week.

6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, we can assume his girlfriend eats half as much as Steve. So, his girlfriend eats 6 / 2 = 3 tomatoes per day. 

3 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 21 tomatoes/week

The total number of tomatoes they both eat per week is 42 (Steve) + 21 (girlfriend) = 63 tomatoes/week.

Since each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, we can divide the total number of tomatoes they eat per week by the number of tomatoes per vine to find out how many vines they need.

63 tomatoes/week / 3 tomatoes/vine = 21 vines

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many new pens Ram can make from the 25 pens he buys. Since he can make one full pen from the ink of five empty pens, we can divide the total number of pens by 5 to find out how many new pens he can make.

25 pens / 5 pens per new pen = 5 new pens

Since Ram starts with 25 pens and makes 5 new pens, we need to add the initial number of pens to the number of new pens he makes.

25 (initial pens) + 5 (new pens) = 30 pens

However, we need to consider that the 5 new pens he makes will also have ink that can be used to make more pens. So, we can continue this process until we can no longer make new pens.

The 5 new pens he makes can be used to make 1 new pen (5 / 5 = 1), and the 1 new pen can be used to make 0.2 new pens (1 / 5 = 0.2), and the 0.2 new pen can be used to make 0.04 new pens (0.2 / 5 = 0.04), and so on.

We can continue this process until we can no longer make new pens, which is when the number of new pens is less than 1.

0.04 / 5 = 0.008 (round down to 0 since we can't make a fraction of a pen)
0.008 / 5 = 0.0016 (round down to 0 since we can't make a fraction of a pen)
0.0016 / 5 = 0.00032 (round down to 0 since we can't make a fraction of a pen)

Now, we add up the number of new pens he makes in each step:

1 + 0.2 + 0.04 + 0.008 + 0.0016 + 0.00032 = 1.25032

However, we need to round down to the nearest whole number since we can't make a fraction of a pen. 

1.25032 ≈ 1

Now, we add the initial number of pens to the total number of new pens he makes, including the additional pens made from the new pens.

25 (initial pens) + 5 (new pens) + 1 (additional new pen) = 31 pens

Now, we know that Mary is two years younger than Joan, so we can calculate Mary's age as follows:
Mary's age = Joan's age - 2
Mary's age = 25 - 2
Mary's age = 23

Now that we have the ages of all three girls, we can find the sum of their ages:

In total, they will read 3 (Dolly's books) + 3 (Pandora's books) = 6 books.

However, we need to consider that they also read each other's books. So, Dolly will read Pandora's book and Pandora will read Dolly's book. This means they will read 2 more books.

Therefore, the total number of books they will read is 6 (initial books) + 2 (each other's books) = 8 books.

"To find the total number of hours Mike spends writing a week, we need to calculate the total number of letters he writes and then multiply it by the time it takes him to write one page.

First, let's find the number of letters Mike writes. He has 3 pen pals left, and each of them sends 2 letters a week. So, the total number of letters he receives is 3 * 2 = 6 letters.

Since he responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters a week.

Each letter is 5 pages long, so the total number of pages he writes is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

It takes him 6 minutes to write one page, so the total time he spends writing a week is 30 * 6 = 180 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 180 / 60 = 3 hours.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost for each day, then multiply it by the number of days, and finally multiply it by the number of weeks. 

The makeup artist charges $250 an hour and works 6 hours a day. So, the cost for each day is $250 * 6 = $1500.

Since she needs it done 4 times a week, the cost for each week is $1500 * 4 = $6000.

The movie takes 5 weeks to finish, so the total cost before the discount is $6000 * 5 = $30,000.

After the movie is done, the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount. To find the discount amount, we multiply the total cost by 0.10: $30,000 * 0.10 = $3000.

The final cost after the discount is $30,000 - $3000 = $27,000.

The final answer is: $27,000"
"To find out how much each person paid, we need to first calculate the total cost of the party supplies. 

Total cost = cost of ingredients + cost of presents + cost of decorations + cost of invitations + cost of goodie bags
Total cost = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22
Total cost = $96

Since Isabelle and her two parents split the cost evenly, we need to divide the total cost by 3.

Cost per person = Total cost / 3
Cost per person = $96 / 3
Cost per person = $32

The final answer is: $32"
"To find out how much the chef spent, we need to calculate the total weight of the onions and then multiply it by the cost per pound.

The chef bought 4 bags of onions, each weighing 50 pounds. 

Total weight of onions = Number of bags * Weight per bag
Total weight of onions = 4 * 50
Total weight of onions = 200 pounds

Since a pound of onions costs $1.50, we can multiply the total weight by the cost per pound to find the total cost.

Total cost = Total weight of onions * Cost per pound
Total cost = 200 * $1.50
Total cost = $300

The chef spent $300."
"To find out how many calories Sue consumed, we first need to determine how many cookies she ate. 

On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 5 cookies, so Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday.

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 13 cookies, so Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.

In total, Sue ate 20 + 26 = 46 cookies. 

Her sister ate 5 + 13 = 18 cookies.

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, Sue consumed 46 * 200 = 9200 calories, and her sister consumed 18 * 200 = 3600 calories.

The difference in calories consumed is 9200 - 3600 = 5600.

The final answer is: 5600"
"To find the number of boys in the third class, we first need to determine the total number of girls in the school. Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, the total number of students in the school is 3 classes * 20 students per class = 60 students. 

The total number of girls in the school is 50% of 60, which is 0.5 * 60 = 30 girls.

We already know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27 girls.

Since the total number of girls in the school is 30, the number of girls in the third class is 30 - 27 = 3 girls.

The total number of students in the third class is 20. Since there are 3 girls in the third class, the number of boys in the third class is 20 - 3 = 17 boys.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars. 

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's represent the number of cougars killed today as 'x'. Then, the number of wolves killed today is 3x.

We also know that Rick killed three fewer cougars today than the previous night. So, the number of cougars killed today is 15 - 3 = 12.

Since we know the number of cougars killed today is 12, we can set up the equation 3x = 12 to find the number of wolves killed today. Solving for x, we get x = 4.

Now that we know x, we can find the number of wolves killed today by multiplying 3 and x, which is 3 * 4 = 12.

The total number of wolves killed is 10 (last night) + 12 (today) = 22.

The total number of cougars killed is 15 (last night) + 12 (today) = 27.

The total number of animals killed is 22 (wolves) + 27 (cougars) = 49.

The final answer is: 49"
"To find the floor Bill is on, we need to calculate 4 times his starting floor (3) plus 6. 

First, multiply 3 by 4: 3 * 4 = 12

"To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to first determine how many times Anne went down the slide. 

Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we need to calculate 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30. 

30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. 

So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne, so we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4.

21 * 4 = 84

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we first need to determine the total number of cows Mr. Sylas has after buying 40 cows. 

Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, so the total number of cows is 10 * 20 = 200.

Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows, so the total number of cows becomes 200 + 40 = 240.

Since Mr. Sylas divides the 40 new cows equally among the 10 stalls, each stall gets 40 / 10 = 4 new cows.

Now, each stall has 20 (initial cows) + 4 (new cows) = 24 cows.

To find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows in one stall by 8: 24 * 8 = 192.

The final answer is: 192"
"To find the total amount of money in Brady's piggy bank, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and bill, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the value of each type of coin:
- 100 pennies = 100 x $0.01 = $1.00
- 40 nickels = 40 x $0.05 = $2.00
- 20 dimes = 20 x $0.10 = $2.00

Next, let's calculate the value of the dollar bills:
- 40 dollar bills = 40 x $1.00 = $40.00

Now, let's add the values together:
$1.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $40.00 = $45.00

The final answer is: $45.00"
"To find the total weight of the redwood tree, we need to calculate the total number of 10-foot sections and then multiply it by the weight of each section. 

The redwood is 200 feet tall, so we divide 200 by 10 to get the total number of sections: 200 / 10 = 20 sections.

Each section weighs 400 pounds, so we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section: 20 * 400 = 8000 pounds.

However, termites ate 30% of the wood, so we need to subtract 30% of 8000 from the total weight. To find 30% of 8000, we multiply 8000 by 0.3: 8000 * 0.3 = 2400.

Now, we subtract 2400 from the total weight: 8000 - 2400 = 5600 pounds.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, and Andrea has 52 apples. So, Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.
2. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.
3. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits:

Apples: 52 (Andrea) + 44 (Jamal) = 96
Bananas: 24 (Andrea) + 48 (Jamal) = 72

Total fruits: 96 (apples) + 72 (bananas) = 168

"To find out how many cups of flour Carla needs, we need to calculate the total number of cookies she's making and then determine how many cups of flour are required for that amount.

Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, so the total number of cookies is:
36 (today) + 30 (tomorrow) = 66 cookies

Since two cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many dozens of cookies Carla is making:
66 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 5.5 dozen

Now, we multiply the number of dozens by the amount of flour needed per dozen:
5.5 dozen * 2 cups per dozen = 11 cups

Carla needs 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two-thirds of the pennies in the cup, we need to first calculate two-thirds of 9,300.

Two-thirds of 9,300 can be calculated as (2/3) * 9,300.

To multiply a fraction by a number, we multiply the numerator (2) by the number (9,300) and keep the denominator (3) the same.

(2 * 9,300) / 3 = 18,600 / 3

Now, we divide 18,600 by 3 to get the result.

18,600 / 3 = 6,200

Since each penny is worth $0.01, we multiply 6,200 by 0.01 to get the total dollar amount.

6,200 * 0.01 = 62

The final answer is: $62"
"To find the total number of marbles Maddison has now, we need to first calculate the total number of marbles she initially had in the 5 boxes, and then add the 20 marbles she received from her friend.

"To find the total price of the house, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and the transfer fee, then add them to the selling price.

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, which is 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500.

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price, which is 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000.

The total price of the house is the sum of the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee: $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

To find out how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we subtract her budget from the total price: $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. First, we need to find the time it takes to heat the oil to 400 degrees. Since it takes 40% longer than 20 minutes to heat up to 400 degrees, we can calculate this as follows:

   Let x be the additional time it takes to heat up to 400 degrees. Then, x = 20 + (40% of 20)
   x = 20 + (0.4 * 20)
   x = 20 + 8
   x = 28 minutes

   So, it takes 28 minutes to heat the oil to 400 degrees.

2. Now, we know that it takes 5 minutes less time to cook the chicken than it took to warm up the oil. Since it took 28 minutes to warm up the oil, it will take 28 - 5 = 23 minutes to cook the chicken.

3. To find the total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken, we add the time it took to warm up the oil and the time it took to cook the chicken:

   Total time = Time to warm up the oil + Time to cook the chicken
   Total time = 28 + 23
   Total time = 51 minutes

"To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we first need to determine the total number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette. 

The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches used for the body, which is 900. So, the collar takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

The total number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette is 90 + 180 = 270 stitches.

Since the total number of stitches for the sweater is 1800, and the body takes 900 stitches, the total number of stitches for the sleeves is 1800 - 900 - 270 = 630 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, each sleeve takes 630 / 2 = 315 stitches.

Since each 5-star row has 5 stars, the number of rows of 5-star is 40 / 5 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the number of trucks needed, we need to calculate the total weight of the flagstones and divide it by the weight capacity of each truck.

First, let's calculate the total weight of the flagstones:
80 flagstones * 75 pounds/flagstone = 6000 pounds

Now, let's divide the total weight by the weight capacity of each truck:
6000 pounds / 2000 pounds/truck = 3

So, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

The final answer is: 3"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the speed of the car in the slow lane, which is half the speed of the car in the fast lane. 

Speed of the car in the fast lane = 60 miles/hour
Speed of the car in the slow lane = 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour

Since both cars travel the same distance, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed

Time taken by the car in the fast lane = 480 miles / 60 miles/hour = 8 hours

Since the car in the slow lane travels at half the speed, it will take twice the time to cover the same distance.

Time taken by the car in the slow lane = 2 * 8 hours = 16 hours

The final answer is: 16"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Ali has 22 medals.
2. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.
3. Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.
4. Together, they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting, which means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have together.

Let x be the total number of medals given out. Then, we can set up the equation:

39 = x / 10

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 10:

x = 39 * 10
x = 390

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is 390.

The final answer is: 390"
"To solve this problem, we first need to find out how many chocolate bars are available in total. Since each packet contains 5 chocolate bars and there are 8 packets, the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

Since each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 * 6 = 24.

Now, we need to find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children. This can be calculated by subtracting the number of chocolate bars given to adults from the total number of chocolate bars: 40 - 24 = 16.

Since there are 8 children, we need to divide the remaining chocolate bars equally among them. This can be calculated by dividing 16 by 8: 16 / 8 = 2.

Therefore, each child will get 2 chocolate bars.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much Susan earns, we need to calculate the total time she works and then multiply it by her hourly wage.

First, let's find the total time she works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total time.

Total time worked = 3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to convert the total time to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Now, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes:

150 minutes / 10 minutes/interval = 15 intervals

Since she earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by her earnings per interval:

15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

Therefore, Susan earns $75 for the online task.

The final answer is: $75"
"To find the total points of all three players after the extra points are distributed, we need to first calculate their points after the fourth round.

Initially, Mike has 21 points. 
Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

After the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. 
Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point. Now Mike has 21 + 1 = 22 points.
Jim has 18 points, so he does not get an extra point. Jim still has 18 points.
Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point. Now Tony has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

Now, let's calculate the total points of all three players after the extra points are distributed:
Mike has 22 points, Jim has 18 points, and Tony has 43 points.
Total points = 22 + 18 + 43 = 83

The final answer is: 83"
"To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we first need to determine how many oranges the sons washed. 

The oldest son is 8 years old, and he washes as many oranges as his age, so he washes 8 oranges. 

The youngest son is half as old as the oldest son, so he is 8 / 2 = 4 years old. He also washes as many oranges as his age, so he washes 4 oranges.

In total, the sons wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

Will bought 15 oranges initially, so to find out how many are left unwashed, we subtract the number of oranges washed from the total: 15 - 12 = 3.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the total count of activities, we need to calculate the number of each activity done on the first and second day and then add them together.

On the first day, Darren does:
- 100 pushups
- 50 squats
- 20 dumbbell presses

On the second day, he does:
- 20 more pushups than the first day: 100 + 20 = 120 pushups
- 10 fewer squats than the first day: 50 - 10 = 40 squats
- Doubles the number of dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses

Now, let's add the total number of each activity done in the two days:
- Total pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Total squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Total dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

The total count of activities is the sum of the total number of each activity: 220 + 90 + 60 = 370.

The final answer is: 370"
"To find out how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day and then divide the total amount of rice available by that amount.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day (lunch and dinner). So, the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg.

Since there are 5 members in the household, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 0.4 kg * 5 = 2 kg.

There are 7 days in a week, so the total amount of rice consumed per week is 2 kg * 7 = 14 kg.

Now, we can divide the total amount of rice available (42 kg) by the amount consumed per week (14 kg) to find out how many weeks it will last:

42 kg / 14 kg/week = 3 weeks

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold and subtract that from his target.

Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he didn't sell any crates on those days. He sold 20 crates over the weekend, 15 on Tuesday, 12 on Wednesday, and 18 on Thursday.

Total crates sold = 20 (weekend) + 15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday)
Total crates sold = 65

Now, we subtract the total crates sold from the target to find out how many crates Sam was off from his target.

Target = 120
Total crates sold = 65
Crates off target = Target - Total crates sold
Crates off target = 120 - 65
Crates off target = 55

The final answer is: 55"
"To find the total cost of the desk, we need to determine the last bid made by Carmen. 

Since there are 3 other people who bid once, and Carmen bids after each of them, she makes a total of 4 bids (her initial bid and 3 bids after the other people). 

The bids rise by $50 each time, so the sequence of bids is: $200, $250, $300, $350.

Carmen's last bid is $350, which is the cost of the desk.

The final answer is: $350"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total miles driven, the total cost of driving, and the total bonus paid.

1. Total miles driven: Since John goes to work and back each day, the total miles driven per day is 2 * 30 = 60 miles. He goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year, so the total miles driven is 60 * 5 * 50 = 15,000 miles.

2. Total cost of driving: John is charged $2 per mile driven, so the total cost of driving is 15,000 * $2 = $30,000.

3. Total bonus paid: John gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus paid is $150 * 12 = $1,800.

4. Total cost: The total cost is the sum of the total cost of driving and the total bonus paid, which is $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

The final answer is: $31,800"
"To find out how many minutes Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to add the minutes he exercised on each day. 

Monday: 16 minutes
Sunday: 23 minutes
Combined: 16 + 23 = 39 minutes

Since Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to multiply the combined time by 2.

Combined time: 39 minutes
Twice the combined time: 2 * 39 = 78 minutes

Therefore, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal.

The final answer is: 78"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of pages and how they are arranged in the tabloid. 

When a piece of paper is folded, it creates two pages. The first page is the front, and the second page is the back. 

Since we have a 32-page tabloid, we need to find the number of pieces of paper required to create these 32 pages. 

When we fold a piece of paper, we get 2 pages. To get 32 pages, we need 32 / 2 = 16 pieces of paper.

However, this is not the final answer because we need to consider the arrangement of the pages. The pages are arranged in a way that the first page is on the left back, the second page is on the left front, the 32nd page is on the right back, and the 31st page is on the right front. 

This means that the first and last pages are on the back of the same piece of paper, and the second and 32nd pages are on the front of the same piece of paper. 

So, we need to consider the number of pieces of paper required to create the first and last pages, the second and 32nd pages, and so on. 

Since we have 16 pages in each half of the tabloid, we need 16 pieces of paper to create the first 16 pages and another 16 pieces of paper to create the last 16 pages. 

However, the first and last pages are on the same piece of paper, and the second and 32nd pages are on the same piece of paper, and so on. 

This means that we need 16 pieces of paper to create the first 16 pages, and another 16 pieces of paper to create the last 16 pages, but we need to subtract 8 pieces of paper because the first and last pages, the second and 32nd pages, and so on, are on the same piece of paper.

So, the total number of pieces of paper required is 16 + 16 - 8 = 24.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To find out how much money Annika has left, we need to calculate the amount she spent on food and snacks, and then subtract that from the initial amount she brought.

Annika spent half of $50 on food and snacks, which is 50 / 2 = $25.

She also spent an additional $10 on rides.

So, the total amount she spent is $25 (food and snacks) + $10 (rides) = $35.

Now, let's subtract the total amount she spent from the initial amount she brought: $50 - $35 = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Total books = 250
2. Unsold books = 50
3. Books sold this year = 45
4. Books sold in the first year = 2 * Books sold this year = 2 * 45 = 90
5. Books sold in the second year = Total books - (Unsold books + Books sold this year + Books sold in the first year)
   = 250 - (50 + 45 + 90)
   = 250 - 185
   = 65

Since each book sells at $20, the total amount of money earned in the second year is:
Total money earned in the second year = Books sold in the second year * Price per book
= 65 * 20
= 1300

The final answer is: $1300"
"To find out how much Watson made in April, we need to calculate his total earnings from his hourly wage and the weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate his total hours worked in a week: 
10 hours/day * 5 days/week = 50 hours/week

Since Watson earns $10 per hour, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:
50 hours/week * $10/hour = $500/week

Since the company performed well for the whole month, Watson received a $300 bonus each week. 
So, his total weekly earnings are:
$500/week (hourly wage) + $300/week (bonus) = $800/week

April has 4 weeks. 
So, Watson's total earnings in April are:
$800/week * 4 weeks = $3200

The final answer is: $3200"
"To find out how many people John lost to, we need to calculate 20% of 20, since he beats 80% of the people he arm wrestled.

20% of 20 is calculated as 0.20 * 20 = 4.

So, John lost to 4 people. 

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many loaves are sold in the afternoon, we first need to determine how many loaves are left after the morning sales. 

The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning, so we calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning as follows:

60 * (2/3) = 40 loaves

This means 40 loaves are sold in the morning. To find out how many loaves are left, we subtract the morning sales from the total:

60 - 40 = 20 loaves

Now, we know that half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening. Since the remaining loaves are 20, we calculate the number of loaves sold in the afternoon as follows:

20 * (1/2) = 10 loaves

So, 10 loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much weight Joey loses per week and then multiply that by the number of weeks it takes Sandy to lose the same amount of weight.

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. To find out how much weight Joey loses per week, we divide the total weight lost by the number of weeks:

Weight lost per week = Total weight lost / Number of weeks
Weight lost per week = 8 pounds / 4 weeks
Weight lost per week = 2 pounds per week

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, we multiply the weight lost per week by the number of weeks it takes Sandy:

Total weight lost = Weight lost per week * Number of weeks
Total weight lost = 2 pounds/week * 4 weeks
Total weight lost = 8 pounds

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, it will take Sandy 4 * 4 = 16 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total savings, we need to calculate the savings on the tubs of ice cream and the packets of milk separately and then add them together.

The original price of a tub of ice cream is $13, and it's now sold at $11. The discount on each tub of ice cream is $13 - $11 = $2.

If you buy 2 tubs of ice cream, the total discount will be 2 * $2 = $4.

The original price of a packet of milk is not given, but we know that it was sold at a discount of $0.5. Let's assume the original price of a packet of milk is x. The selling price of a packet of milk is x - $0.5.

Since the discount on the packet of milk is $0.5, the original price of a packet of milk is x = $0.5 + (selling price of a packet of milk). However, we are not given the selling price of a packet of milk. We are only given the discount of $0.5. 

However, we can infer that the selling price of a packet of milk is $0.5 less than its original price. Since we are not given the original price of a packet of milk, we can't calculate the selling price of a packet of milk. 

However, we can infer that the original price of a packet of milk is $0.5 more than its selling price. 

Since we are not given the original price of a packet of milk, we can't calculate the total savings on the packets of milk. However, we can calculate the total savings on the tubs of ice cream, which is $4.

The total savings on the packets of milk is 4 * ($0.5) = $2.

The total savings is $4 + $2 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and legs grown after 15 days.

The person will grow an extra arm every 3 days. To find out how many arms they will grow in 15 days, we divide 15 by 3. 

15 / 3 = 5

So, the person will grow 5 extra arms.

The person will grow an extra leg every 5 days. To find out how many legs they will grow in 15 days, we divide 15 by 5.

15 / 5 = 3

So, the person will grow 3 extra legs.

In total, the person will grow 5 extra arms and 3 extra legs. To find the total number of new limbs, we add the number of arms and legs.

5 (arms) + 3 (legs) = 8

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. Calculate the total cost of the business suits:
   Number of suits = 6
   Cost per suit = $100
   Total cost of suits = 6 * $100 = $600

2. Calculate the total cost of the suitcases:
   Number of suitcases = 3
   Cost per suitcase = $50
   Total cost of suitcases = 3 * $50 = $150

3. Calculate the cost of the flight ticket:
   Let's denote the cost of a business suit as 'x'. 
   The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit, so the cost of the flight ticket is 5x + $700.

4. Calculate the total amount spent so far:
   Total spent so far = Total cost of suits + Total cost of suitcases + Cost of flight ticket
   Total spent so far = $600 + $150 + (5x + $700)

5. Calculate the total amount spent on the business trip:
   Theo wants to save $2000, so the total amount he can spend is $6000 - $2000 = $4000.
   Total spent on the business trip = $4000

6. Set up an equation to find the value of 'x' (cost of a business suit):
   Total spent on the business trip = Total spent so far
   $4000 = $600 + $150 + (5x + $700)
   $4000 = $750 + 5x + $700
   $4000 = 5x + $1450
   5x = $4000 - $1450
   5x = $2550
   x = $2550 / 5
   x = $510

7. Calculate the cost of the flight ticket:
   Cost of flight ticket = 5x + $700
   Cost of flight ticket = 5 * $510 + $700
   Cost of flight ticket = $2550 + $700
   Cost of flight ticket = $3250

8. Calculate the total amount spent so far:
   Total spent so far = $600 + $150 + $3250
   Total spent so far = $4000

9. Calculate the amount left for buying gifts:
   Amount left for gifts = Total amount available - Total spent so far
   Amount left for gifts = $6000 - $4000
   Amount left for gifts = $2000

The final answer is: $2000"
"To find the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we need to first find the number of eggs consumed by each group and then add them together.

Three people eat 3 eggs each day, so the total number of eggs consumed by this group is 3 * 3 = 9 eggs per day.

The rest of the family members are 5 - 3 = 2 people. They eat 2 eggs each day, so the total number of eggs consumed by this group is 2 * 2 = 4 eggs per day.

The total number of eggs consumed by the family in a day is 9 + 4 = 13 eggs.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week is 13 * 7 = 91 eggs.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Noah's current age as N and the population of Chile now as P.

Since Cera is 46 years old now, six years ago, Cera was 40 years old.

We are given that six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. So, six years ago, Noah's age was 40/2 = 20 years.

We are also given that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. So, the population of Chile six years ago was 20 * 3000 = 60,000.

We are also given that the population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now. So, the population of Chile now is 2 * 60,000 = 120,000.

"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as D, the number of players on the offense as O, and the number of players on the special teams as S.

We are given that there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, so O = 2D.

We are also given that there is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, so S = D/2.

The total number of players on the team is 105, which is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams. Therefore, we can write the equation:

O + D + S = 105

Substituting the expressions for O and S in terms of D, we get:

2D + D + D/2 = 105

Combine like terms:

4.5D = 105

Divide both sides by 4.5:

D = 105 / 4.5
D = 23.33

Since the number of players must be a whole number, we round down to the nearest whole number, as you can't have a fraction of a player.

D = 23

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total number of people invited, we first need to calculate the number of people from the 2 families with 6 people and the 3 families with 4 people.

For the 2 families with 6 people, the total number of people is 2 * 6 = 12.
For the 3 families with 4 people, the total number of people is 3 * 4 = 12.
The total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.

However, 8 people couldn't come due to illness. So, we subtract 8 from the total number of people invited: 24 - 8 = 16.

Then, 1/4 of the people who couldn't come due to illness had previous commitments. 1/4 of 8 is 2. So, we subtract 2 from the number of people who couldn't come due to illness: 8 - 2 = 6.

Now, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come due to illness and previous commitments from the total number of people invited: 16 - 6 = 10.

"To find the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store, we need to calculate the total number of marbles first.

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and added them to a store that had 50. So, the total number of marbles in the store after buying from Johanna is 20 + 50 = 70.

His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna, his father gave him 2/5 * 20 = 8 marbles.

Now, the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store is 70 (initial marbles) + 20 (bought from Johanna) + 8 (given by his father) = 98 marbles.

Each marble weighs 2kgs, so the total weight of marbles is 98 * 2 = 196 kgs.

"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (such as the pool) is V = length * width * height.

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length (L) = 6 feet
- Width (W) = 4 feet
- Height (H) = 5 feet

We can calculate the volume as follows:
V = L * W * H
V = 6 * 4 * 5
V = 120 cubic feet

Now, we know the volume of the pool is 120 cubic feet. The cost to fill the pool is $0.1 per cubic foot. To find the total cost, we multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot:
Total Cost = Volume * Cost per cubic foot
Total Cost = 120 * 0.1
Total Cost = 12

"To find the total number of children in the classroom, we need to calculate the number of girls, nongendered children, and then add them to the number of boys.

Given that there are 30 boys, and the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:
Number of girls = 3 * Number of boys
= 3 * 30
= 90

Given that there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, we can calculate the number of nongendered children as follows:
Number of nongendered children = (1/10) * Number of boys
= (1/10) * 30
= 3

Now, we can find the total number of children by adding the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
Total number of children = Number of boys + Number of girls + Number of nongendered children
= 30 + 90 + 3
= 123

Let's denote the number of electric poles as 'x'. According to the given ratio, the number of electric wires is 3x.

We are given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45. So, we can set up the equation:

3x = 45

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 45 / 3
x = 15

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required by the electric company to supply the electricity in the neighborhood is 15.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of people who left the party. 

Let's start by finding the total number of people at the beginning of the party: 
Total people = men + women = 25 + 15 = 40

Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, we can find the number of people who left by multiplying the total number of people by 1/4:
People left = 1/4 * 40 = 10

Now, we know that 22 men stayed at the party, so the number of men who left is:
Men left = Total men - Men stayed = 25 - 22 = 3

Since the total number of people who left is 10, and 3 of them are men, the number of women who left is:
Women left = Total people left - Men left = 10 - 3 = 7

Now, we can find the number of women who stayed at the party:
Women stayed = Total women - Women left = 15 - 7 = 8

"To find the cost of the pen, we need to first find the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book, and the book costs $4, the magazine costs $4 / 2 = $2.

The pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so the cost of the pen is $2 - $1 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To find the total number of pencils Jam has, we know she has 2 loose pencils and 3 boxes full of pencils. Let's denote the number of pencils in each box as 'x'. The total number of pencils Jam has is 2 (loose pencils) + 3x (pencils in the boxes). We are given that this total is 26. 

So, we can write the equation: 2 + 3x = 26

Subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation gives us: 3x = 24

Dividing both sides by 3 gives us: x = 8

This means each box has 8 pencils. Now, we know Jam has 3 boxes with 8 pencils each, which is 3 * 8 = 24 pencils. Adding the 2 loose pencils, Jam has a total of 24 + 2 = 26 pencils.

Meg has 46 pencils. To find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have, we add their pencils together: 26 (Jam's pencils) + 46 (Meg's pencils) = 72 pencils.

Since each box has 8 pencils, we need to divide the total number of pencils by 8 to find the number of boxes needed: 72 / 8 = 9.

The final answer is: 9"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the effect of cooling the coffee and the effect of adding cream.

First, let's calculate the number of ice cubes needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, so the number of ice cubes needed is:

65 / 13 = 5

Since each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, 5 ice cubes will make it 5 x 12 = 60 milliliters weaker.

Next, we need to consider the effect of adding 15 milliliters of cream. Since any added liquid weakens the coffee, the total weakening effect of the cream is 15 milliliters.

Now, we add the weakening effects of the ice cubes and the cream to find the total weakening effect:

60 milliliters (from ice cubes) + 15 milliliters (from cream) = 75 milliliters

The final answer is: 75"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of ratios. Since 2 old records are traded for 1 new record, the ratio of old records to new records is 2:1.

Let's say the number of old records brought in by the 5 people is x. Since 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can set up the following equation:

(2x) / 1 = 7 * 5

This is because each person brings in x/5 old records (since there are 5 people) and they trade them for 7 new records.

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x = 35

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 35 / 2
x = 17.5

Since we can't have a fraction of a record, we round down to the nearest whole number, as you can't have a fraction of a record. However, in this case, we can also consider that the 5 people may have brought in a total of 17.5 records, but since they can't be split, we can assume that they brought in 18 records and 1 of them was not traded for a new record.

However, the question asks for the number of old records brought in, and since the ratio is 2:1, we can calculate the number of old records as follows:

Number of old records = 2 * 7 * 5
Number of old records = 70

The final answer is: 70"
"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to calculate the total amount paid to junior programmers and senior programmers separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of junior programmers. We are given that the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, which is 100. 

Number of junior programmers = (2/5) * 100 = 40

Since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, we can find the salary of a senior programmer by adding $400 to the salary of a junior programmer.

Salary of a junior programmer = $2000
Salary of a senior programmer = $2000 + $400 = $2400

Now, let's find the number of senior programmers. The total number of employees is 100, and the number of junior programmers is 40. So, the number of senior programmers is:

Number of senior programmers = Total number of employees - Number of junior programmers
= 100 - 40
= 60

Now, we can find the total amount paid to junior programmers and senior programmers separately.

Total amount paid to junior programmers = Number of junior programmers * Salary of a junior programmer
= 40 * $2000
= $80000

Total amount paid to senior programmers = Number of senior programmers * Salary of a senior programmer
= 60 * $2400
= $144000

Now, we can find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month by adding the total amount paid to junior programmers and senior programmers.

Total amount paid to all programmers = Total amount paid to junior programmers + Total amount paid to senior programmers
= $80000 + $144000
= $208000

The final answer is: $208000"
"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as 'x'. 

Initially, there were x people on the bus. 

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the total number of people became x + 5.

At the second bus stop, 7 people got down, so the number of people became (x + 5) - 7 = x - 2.

Then, 8 more people got in, so the total number of people became (x - 2) + 8 = x + 6.

We are given that the total number of people heading to the third stop is 20, so we can set up the equation:

x + 6 = 20

To solve for x, we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:

x = 20 - 6
x = 14

The final answer is: 14"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops and eats 2 on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left.
2. He passes 14 out to his friends, so he has 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops left.
3. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now, he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.
4. He eats 3 more lollipops that night, so he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops left.
5. He eats 2 more lollipops in the morning, so he has 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops left.

"To find the time it takes to fully charge the phone, we need to first find the total time it takes to charge from 60% to 100%. 

Since the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, it will take 3 minutes to charge 1 percentage-point. 

From 60% to 100%, it needs to charge 40 percentage-points. 

So, the time taken to charge 40 percentage-points is 40 * 3 = 120 minutes.

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). 

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours.

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we need to first calculate the total number of lollipops she has after her mother gives her 10 more. 

Erin initially has 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her 10 more, so Erin now has 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops.

Then, Erin gives 3 lollipops to Ella. To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we subtract 3 from 17: 17 - 3 = 14.

So, Erin has 14 lollipops left.

The final answer is: 14"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's calculate the rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip. They spent $80, and for every $20 they spend, they get a $1 reward. So, the number of rewards they earned is:

$80 / $20 = 4 rewards

Since each reward is worth $1, the total value of the rewards is:

4 rewards * $1/reward = $4

Now, let's move on to the current shopping trip. They spent $43 and used their rewards, which is worth $4. They also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. Twice the amount of rewards is:

2 * $4 = $8

So, the total discount they got is the sum of the rewards and the coupon:

$4 (rewards) + $8 (coupon) = $12

Now, let's subtract the total discount from the amount they spent:

$43 (amount spent) - $12 (total discount) = $31

Therefore, the customer paid $31 on this shopping trip.

"To determine which job pays more, we need to calculate the net pay for each job.

For Job A:
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours worked per year: 2000
- Annual income: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- State tax rate: 20%
- Tax amount: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net income: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

For Job B:
- Annual income: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income before tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- State tax rate: 10%
- Tax amount: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net income: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Comparing the net incomes, Job B pays more than Job A. To find the difference in net pay, we subtract the net income of Job A from the net income of Job B:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

"To find the final value of Maria's shares, we need to calculate the price of the shares after the first year and then after the second year.

Initially, Maria buys 8 shares for $8 each, so the total cost is 8 * 8 = $64.

The stock price increases by 50% in the first year. To find the new price, we multiply the original price by 1.5 (100% + 50% = 150%, or 1 + 0.5 = 1.5).

New price after the first year = $8 * 1.5 = $12.

The stock price decreases by 25% in the second year. To find the new price, we multiply the price after the first year by 0.75 (100% - 25% = 75%, or 1 - 0.25 = 0.75).

New price after the second year = $12 * 0.75 = $9.

Now, we multiply the new price after the second year by the number of shares to find the final value of Maria's shares.

Final value = 8 * $9 = $72.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of students in the two equal groups as x. Since the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the smallest group is x - 10.

We know that the total number of students in the class is 200, and the sum of the students in all three groups is equal to 200. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 70

Since the smallest group has x - 10 students, we can find the number of students in the smallest group by subtracting 10 from x:

x - 10 = 70 - 10
= 60

"Let's denote the number of cows as C and the number of chickens as Ch. We are given that Ch = 2C, and the total number of animals is 60, so we can write the equation:

C + Ch = 60

Substituting Ch = 2C into the equation, we get:

C + 2C = 60
3C = 60

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:

C = 20

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:

Ch = 2C
Ch = 2(20)
Ch = 40

The total number of legs of the cows is 4C, and the total number of legs of the chickens is 2Ch. 

4C = 4(20) = 80
2Ch = 2(40) = 80

The total number of legs is the sum of the legs of the cows and the chickens:

Total legs = 80 + 80
Total legs = 160

"To solve this problem, we need to find the weights of the other animals and then add them to the weight of the container.

Let's start with the information given:

- The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
- The pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle and the green toad, so they also weigh 50 pounds.
- The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
- The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of all the animals and the container:

Weight of the pink frog = 50 pounds
Weight of the blue beetle = 50 pounds
Weight of the green toad = 50 pounds
Weight of the yellow snake = 60 pounds
Weight of the red bird = 30 pounds
Weight of the container = 20 pounds

"To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we need to calculate the total number of cookies consumed by her son and her husband, and then subtract that from the total number of cookies in a bag.

Jenny's son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, so the total number of cookies he eats in a week is 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

Jenny's husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so the total number of cookies he eats in a week is 1 * 7 = 7 cookies.

The total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband is 20 + 7 = 27 cookies.

Since there are 36 cookies in a bag, and 27 cookies are consumed by her son and husband, the number of cookies left for Jenny is 36 - 27 = 9 cookies.

"To find the percentage increase in the amount of money the factory is making per day, we need to first find the difference in the amount of money they are making per day now and the amount they used to make per day.

The factory used to make $100 per tractor and sold 10 tractors a day, so they made $100 * 10 = $1000 per day.

Now, they make $220 per silo and sell 5 silos a day, so they make $220 * 5 = $1100 per day.

The difference in the amount of money they are making per day now and the amount they used to make per day is $1100 - $1000 = $100.

To find the percentage increase, we divide the difference by the original amount and multiply by 100:

"To find out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to first calculate the total cost of the activities. 

The cost of mini-golf for Morgan and her friends is 1 round * $5 = $5. 
Since there are 'x' friends, the total cost for mini-golf for her friends will be 1 * $5 = $5. 
The total cost for mini-golf for Morgan and her friends is $5 + $5 = $10.

The cost of arcade tokens is $5.

The cost of go-karts for Morgan and her friends is 2 rides * $10 = $20. 
Since there are 'x' friends, the total cost for go-karts for her friends will be 2 * $10 * x = $20x.
The total cost for go-karts for Morgan and her friends is $20 + $20x.

The total cost for all activities is $10 + $5 + $20 + $20x = $35 + $20x.

Since Morgan has a budget of $90, we can set up the equation: $35 + $20x ≤ $90.

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. Subtract $35 from both sides of the equation: $20x ≤ $55.

Now, divide both sides by $20: x ≤ $55 / $20.

x ≤ 2.75

Since x represents the number of friends, it must be a whole number. Therefore, Morgan can invite up to 2 friends.

Marisa receives $5 as pocket money every day. 

She buys 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each, so the total amount she spends on lollipops per day is 4 * 0.25 = $1.

The change she saves per day is $5 - $1 = $4.

Since she saves for 5 days, the total amount she saves is 5 * $4 = $20.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. First, let's find out how much change Billy has after buying the candy. Since he spent $1.5 per pound and he has $10, we can set up an equation to find the number of pounds of candy he bought. Let's call the number of pounds 'x'. The total cost of the candy is $1.5x. Since he has $10, the change he has is $10 - $1.5x.

2. After buying the candy, he takes half of his change and spends it on gumballs. Since he bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, the total cost of the gumballs is 40 * $0.05 = $2. Since he took half of his change, the amount he spent on gumballs is half of the change he had after buying the candy. We can set up an equation to represent this: (10 - 1.5x)/2 = 2.

3. Now, let's solve the equation (10 - 1.5x)/2 = 2 for x. Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 10 - 1.5x = 4.

4. Subtract 10 from both sides: -1.5x = -6.

5. Divide both sides by -1.5: x = 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"Let's denote Carver's age as C and his son's age as S. We are given that Carver is 45 years old, so C = 45.

We are also given that Carver's age is 5 years less than twice the age of his son. This can be expressed as:

C = 2S - 5

Substituting C = 45 into the equation, we get:

45 = 2S - 5

To solve for S, we add 5 to both sides of the equation:

45 + 5 = 2S
50 = 2S

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 2 to isolate S:

50 / 2 = S
25 = S

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the total distance the train travels in one trip, we need to add the distances between the three cities. 

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two, which is 75 + 100 = 175 miles. 
So, the distance from the third city to the first city is 175 - 50 = 125 miles.

The total distance for one trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is 3 * 300 = 900 miles.

To find out how many days the train goes between services, we need to divide the total distance the train can travel before needing service (18,000 miles) by the total distance it travels in a day (900 miles).

18,000 / 900 = 20 days.

"To find the amount of stuffing needed for the collie beds, we first need to find the average amount of stuffing between the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds. 

The average amount of stuffing for a collie bed is (8 + 2) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for the chihuahua beds: 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.

Next, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for the collie beds: 3 * 5 = 15 pounds.

Finally, we add the total amount of stuffing needed for the chihuahua beds and the collie beds: 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total time taken for the trip, we need to calculate the time taken for each part of the trip and add them together.

First, let's calculate the time taken for the trip to his friend's house. The distance is 200 miles and the speed is 70 mph. 

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 200 / 70
Time = 2.857 hours (approximately)

However, he took a detour that added 10 miles to his trip. So, the actual distance traveled to his friend's house is 200 + 10 = 210 miles. 

Time taken for the detour part = 10 / 70
Time taken for the detour part = 0.143 hours (approximately)

Total time taken to reach his friend's house = 2.857 + 0.143 = 2.999 hours (approximately)

Now, let's calculate the time taken for the trip back home. The distance is 240 miles and the speed is 80 mph.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 240 / 80
Time = 3 hours

Total time taken for the trip = Time taken to reach his friend's house + Time taken to come back home
Total time taken for the trip = 2.999 + 3
Total time taken for the trip = 5.999 hours

"To find the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we first need to find the total number of students present on Friday. 

Total number of students = 96
Number of girls = 43
Number of boys = Total number of students - Number of girls = 96 - 43 = 53

Now, we know that 5 fourth-grade girls and 4 fourth-grade boys were absent. So, the number of girls present = 43 - 5 = 38
The number of boys present = Total number of boys - Number of boys absent = 53 - 4 = 49

Therefore, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is 49.

The final answer is: 49"
"To find the total number of kids in the park, we need to find the number of boys and add it to the number of girls. 

Since there are twice the number of boys as girls, and there are 6 girls, we can find the number of boys by multiplying the number of girls by 2.

Number of boys = 2 * 6 = 12

Now, we can find the total number of kids by adding the number of boys and girls.

Total number of kids = Number of boys + Number of girls

"Let's break down the information given:

1. 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.
2. A number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. 
   Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting as S. 
   We can write the equation: S = 4 * 3 - 5
   S = 12 - 5
   S = 7
3. Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. 
   Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for physical violence as V. 
   We can write the equation: V = 3 * S
   V = 3 * 7
   V = 21
4. If a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart, we can write the equation: 
   Total = 3 (refusing to wear masks) + 7 (shoplifting) + 21 (physical violence) + X (other reasons)
   50 = 3 + 7 + 21 + X
   50 = 31 + X
   X = 50 - 31
   X = 19

Erin's current points = 3 * Sara's points
Erin's current points = 3 * 8
Erin's current points = 24

Now, we know that Erin scored 14 points, so to find out how many points she had before, we need to subtract 14 from her current points:

Erin's previous points = Erin's current points - 14
Erin's previous points = 24 - 14
Erin's previous points = 10

"To find the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to calculate the cost of the picture frames, the etching, the pins, and the cords separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames. There are 44 seniors, and each picture frame costs $20. So, the total cost of the picture frames is 44 * $20 = $880.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of etching the logo on each picture frame. The etching costs an additional 20% of the cost of the picture frame, which is 20% of $20 = 0.2 * $20 = $4. So, the total cost of etching is 44 * $4 = $176.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the pins. 2 seniors will receive pins, and each pin costs $5. So, the total cost of the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the cords. 1/4 of the seniors are officers, which is 1/4 * 44 = 11 officers. Each officer will receive a cord that costs $12. So, the total cost of the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, we can add up the costs of the picture frames, etching, pins, and cords to find the total cost of the senior gifts. The total cost is $880 + $176 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

"To find the total number of shoes sold, we need to calculate the number of shoes sold on each day and then add them up.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes they sold on Friday, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the number of shoes they sold on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six people returned their pairs on Sunday, so we need to subtract those from the total number of shoes sold on Sunday. 14 - 6 = 8 pairs.

Now, let's add up the number of shoes sold on each day: 14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 8 (Sunday) = 50 pairs.

"To find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we need to calculate the number of apples picked on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.

Let's start with Monday. Since Lucy sold all the apples picked on Monday and she got $56 from selling them at $4 per piece, we can find the number of apples picked on Monday by dividing the total amount earned by the price per apple:

Apples picked on Monday = Total amount earned / Price per apple
= $56 / $4
= 14 apples

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she did the previous day, which is 2 * 12 = 24 apples.

Now, we can find the total number of apples picked over the three days by adding the number of apples picked on each day:

Total apples picked = Apples picked on Monday + Apples picked on Tuesday + Apples picked on Wednesday
= 14 + 12 + 24
= 50

"To find the monthly payment, we need to calculate the total interest paid over the five months and then divide it by the number of months.

First, let's calculate the total interest paid:

Interest rate = 10% = 0.10
Principal amount = $3,650
Time = 5 months

Total interest = Principal amount * Interest rate * Time
= $3,650 * 0.10 * 5

Now, we need to find the total amount Karan has to pay, which is the principal amount plus the total interest:

Total amount = Principal amount + Total interest
= $3,650 + $1,825
= $5,475

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month, we divide the total amount by the number of months:

Monthly payment = Total amount / Number of months
= $5,475 / 5
= $1,095

"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to calculate the total number of silver pesos and gold pesos they have separately and then add them together.

Axel has 50 silver pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so Anna has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos.

Axel has 80 gold pesos. Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so Anna has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

Now, let's add the total number of silver pesos and gold pesos they have together:
Total silver pesos = 50 (Axel's) + 100 (Anna's) = 150
Total gold pesos = 80 (Axel's) + 120 (Anna's) = 200

"To find the profit per hour, we need to first find the total amount of money Millie makes per hour and then subtract the cost of supplies per hour.

First, let's find the total amount of money Millie makes per hour. Since she sells 4 cups per hour and each cup is sold for $1, she makes 4 * $1 = $4 per hour.

Next, let's find the total amount of money Millie makes per day. Since she makes 3 pitchers of lemonade, and each pitcher holds 12 cups, she makes a total of 3 * 12 = 36 cups of lemonade. Since she sells each cup for $1, she makes a total of 36 * $1 = $36 per day.

However, we are asked to find the profit per hour, not per day. To find the profit per hour, we need to divide the total profit per day by the number of hours she operates the stand per day. Since we don't know the number of hours she operates the stand per day, we will assume she operates it for 8 hours per day (a typical day).

The total cost of supplies is $18, and the total amount of lemonade she makes is 36 cups. Since she sells 4 cups per hour, she operates the stand for 36 / 4 = 9 hours to sell all the lemonade. 

Now, we can find the profit per hour by dividing the total profit by the number of hours she operates the stand. The total profit is $36 - $18 = $18. The profit per hour is $18 / 9 = $2.

"To find the initial amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we can use the concept of proportions. If he sold 3/5 of his land, that means he has 2/5 of his land left. 

Let's denote the initial amount of land as x hectares. Since he has 2/5 of his land left, we can set up the equation:

2/5 * x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land initially.

"To solve this problem, we can start by adding the parts of the ratio together to find the total number of parts. 

5 (Betty's parts) + 6 (Sam's parts) = 11 parts

Since the total number of popsicles is 165, we can divide this number by the total number of parts to find the value of each part.

165 ÷ 11 = 15

Now that we know the value of each part, we can multiply this value by the number of parts each person has to find the number of popsicles they have.

Betty has 5 parts, so she has 5 x 15 = 75 popsicles.
Sam has 6 parts, so he has 6 x 15 = 90 popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we can subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has.

90 (Sam's popsicles) - 75 (Betty's popsicles) = 15

"To find the total cost of the streaming services, we need to calculate the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus. 

The normal cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 each, so together they cost $20. 

Since Tim saves 20% by bundling, we need to find 20% of $20. 
20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4

So, the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $20 - $4 = $16.

The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $16 (bundled Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26.

Since Tim was paying $60 for the cable package, he saves $60 - $26 = $34 by cancelling his cable subscription.

The number of millipedes is 1/3rd as many as the spiders, so it is (1/3) * 90 = 30 millipedes.

The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12, so it is 2 * 30 - 12 = 48 stink bugs.

Now, we add the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs to find the total number of bugs: 90 + 30 + 48 = 168.

The final answer is: 168"
"To find the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica, we need to first determine the ages of Alice and Beth.

Since Erica is 30 years old, and Beth is 5 years older than Erica, we can calculate Beth's age as follows:
Beth's age = Erica's age + 5
Beth's age = 30 + 5
Beth's age = 35

Now, since Alice is 7 years older than Beth, we can calculate Alice's age as follows:
Alice's age = Beth's age + 7
Alice's age = 35 + 7
Alice's age = 42

The difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is:
Difference = Alice's age - Erica's age
Difference = 42 - 30
Difference = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total calories consumed by John, we need to calculate the total ounces of milk he drank and then multiply it by the calories per ounce.

John drank 2 glasses of milk, and each glass is 8 ounces. So, the total ounces of milk he drank is 2 * 8 = 16 ounces.

Since milk has 3 calories per ounce, the total calories consumed by John is 16 * 3 = 48 calories.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the total amount the builder earns in a year, we need to calculate his daily earnings and then multiply it by the total number of days he works in a year.

First, let's find the total number of days the builder works in a year. He works 4 weeks every month, and there are 12 months in a year. 

Number of weeks worked in a year = 4 weeks/month * 12 months = 48 weeks/year

Since he works 6 days a week, the total number of days he works in a year is:
Total days worked in a year = 48 weeks/year * 6 days/week = 288 days/year

Now, let's find his daily earnings:
Daily earnings = $50/day

Now, we can find his total earnings in a year:
Total earnings in a year = Daily earnings * Total days worked in a year
= $50/day * 288 days/year
= $14400/year

The final answer is: $14400"
"To find out how many bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of flour and milk required for the quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. Since Mark is making a quadruple batch, we multiply the ingredients by 4:

Flour: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups
Milk: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark will need to buy:
12 cups / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags of flour

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so Mark will need to buy:
4 cups / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles of milk

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour:
6 bags of flour - 2 bottles of milk = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the energy saved, we first need to calculate the original energy consumption and then subtract the new energy consumption.

Original energy consumption per day: 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours (Wh) or 7.2 kilowatt-hours (kWh)

New energy consumption per day: 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 Wh or 2.7 kWh

Energy saved per day: 7.2 kWh - 2.7 kWh = 4.5 kWh

Energy saved in 30 days: 4.5 kWh/day * 30 days = 135 kWh

"To find the average number of stripes, we need to calculate the total number of stripes and divide it by the total number of zebras.

First, let's find the total number of stripes on the two zebras with 17 stripes each: 2 * 17 = 34 stripes.

Next, we add the stripes of the zebra with 36 stripes: 34 + 36 = 70 stripes.

Then, we find the number of stripes on the zebra with half the number of stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes: 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.

Now, we add the stripes of the last zebra: 70 + 18 = 88 stripes.

The total number of zebras is 4.

To find the average number of stripes, we divide the total number of stripes by the total number of zebras: 88 / 4 = 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To determine the total cost of the meat and cheese, we need to calculate the total amount of each required and then multiply it by their respective prices.

First, we need to find out how many sandwiches are needed to serve 20 people. Since each sandwich serves 4 people, we divide 20 by 4:

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, we need a total of 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

The cost of the meat is $7.00 per pound, so the total cost of the meat is:
5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00

The cost of the cheese is $3.00 per pound, so the total cost of the cheese is:
5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

The total cost of the meat and cheese is the sum of their individual costs:
$35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

The final answer is: $50.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the initial number of corns and cannolis Allan has at home. 

Let's denote the initial number of cannolis as C. Since there are twice as many corns as cannolis, the initial number of corns is 2C. We know that the total number of cannolis is 40, so C = 40.

The initial number of corns is 2C = 2 * 40 = 80.

Allan bought 60 more cannolis and 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. So, the new number of cannolis is 40 + 60 = 100, and the new number of corns is 40 - 40 = 0 (since he bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis, and the number of cannolis is now 100).

However, this would mean Allan has 0 corns, which doesn't make sense in the context of the problem. It seems there might be a mistake in the problem statement. Assuming the problem meant to say ""40 more corns than the number of cannolis"" instead of ""40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis"", we can proceed with the correct calculation.

The new number of corns is 80 + 40 = 120.

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 120 + 100 = 220.

The final answer is: 220"
"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to first determine how many steps he had completed before the jog. 

Elliott finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. Since he wants to walk 10,000 steps, half of that would be 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps.

He also took an additional 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So, the total steps completed before the jog would be 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

Since he had 2,000 steps left to take after the jog, we can find the total steps taken during the jog by subtracting the remaining steps from the total steps he wanted to take: 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 steps.

However, this is the total steps taken, including the jog. To find the steps taken during the jog, we need to subtract the steps taken before the jog: 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000 steps.

The final answer is: 2000"
"To find out how many minutes Toby will be early, we need to calculate the total time it takes him to read the book and add the time it takes to get to the airport.

First, let's find out how many words are in the book: 
Number of pages * words per page = total words
45 * 200 = 9000 words

Next, let's find out how long it takes Toby to read the book:
Total words / words per minute = time to read the book
9000 / 300 = 30 minutes

Now, let's add the time it takes to get to the airport:
Time to read the book + time to get to the airport = total time
30 + 10 = 40 minutes

Since Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes, we need to find out how many minutes early he will be:
Total time - time to be at the airport = minutes early
60 - 40 = 20 minutes

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the total amount paid in May and June separately and then add them together.

In May, the company hired 40 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, so the total hours worked by each employee in May is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in May is 160 * $15 = $2400. The total amount paid to all employees in May is 40 * $2400 = $96,000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so the number of employees left is 40 - (1/4 * 40) = 40 - 10 = 30 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, so the total hours worked by each employee in June is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in June is 160 * $15 = $2400. The total amount paid to all employees in June is 30 * $2400 = $72,000.

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000.

The final answer is: $168,000"
"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought and subtract that from the initial amount of money she had.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The sale is ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means that for every 2 pounds of taffy, she pays $3 for the first pound and $1.50 for the second pound (since it's half off). So, the cost of 2 pounds of taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the magnets. She bought 4 magnets at $0.25 each, so the total cost of the magnets is 4 x $0.25 = $1.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items: $4.50 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1 (magnets) = $7.

Sally initially had $10, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from the initial amount: $10 - $7 = $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To find the total amount spent by Tim, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks and the finale firework separately and then add them together.

The first package of fireworks costs $400, and the second package costs twice that much, which is 2 * $400 = $800. 

The total cost of the fireworks is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Since Tim gets a 20% discount on the fireworks, we need to calculate the discount amount first. The discount amount is 20% of $1200, which is 0.2 * $1200 = $240.

The discounted cost of the fireworks is $1200 - $240 = $960.

Now, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted cost of the fireworks. The total amount spent by Tim is $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To find out how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we need to calculate the total number of cookies she will eat in 30 days and then divide that by the number of cookies her recipe makes.

Shannon eats 2 cookies per night, so in 30 days, she will eat 2 * 30 = 60 cookies.

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies she will eat by 12 to find out how many dozens she needs to make.

60 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 5 dozens

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. 

First, let's find the number of candles that smell like wet dog. 5% of 50,000 candles smell like wet dog, so the number of candles that smell like wet dog is 0.05 * 50,000 = 2500.

Since these candles are also 99% guaranteed not to explode, that means 1% of them will explode. So, the number of candles that smell like wet dog and explode is 0.01 * 2500 = 25.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we first need to find the price of one discounted blouse. Since the blouses are 30% off, the discount amount is 30% of the regular price.

30% of $20 = 0.3 * $20 = $6

So, the discounted price of one blouse is $20 - $6 = $14.

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:

4 * $14 = $56

The final answer is: $56"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so her sister gathers 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.
- Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees as she does from the tallest trees, so she gathers 30 / 2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees.
- Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so her sister gathers 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.
- Joanne gathers some apples from the average trees, but the amount is unknown.
- Her sister gathers no apples from the average trees.

Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees as x.

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne is the sum of the apples from the tallest, shortest, and average trees: 30 + 15 + x.
The total number of apples gathered by her sister is the sum of the apples from the tallest and shortest trees: 60 + 45.

The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, so we can write the equation:

(30 + 15 + x) + (60 + 45) = 500

Combine like terms:

45 + x + 105 = 500

Combine the constants:

150 + x = 500

Subtract 150 from both sides:

x = 350

The final answer is: 350"
"Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D. We are given two equations based on the information:

1. The total number of heads is 180, so C + D = 180.
2. The total number of bumps is 304, and since camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump, we can write the equation 2C + D = 304.

We can solve this system of linear equations by subtracting the first equation from the second equation to eliminate D:

2C + D - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know C, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find D:

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

Therefore, there are 56 dromedaries in the herd.

"To find the total distance traveled by Tom, we need to break down the problem into parts.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled in the first 4 days:
Distance = 200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled over the next two days, which is 30% of the distance traveled in the first 4 days:
Distance = 30% * 800 km = 0.3 * 800 km = 240 km

Now, let's add the distance traveled in the first 6 days:
Total distance = 800 km + 240 km = 1040 km

Since Tom didn't travel on the next day, we don't need to add any distance for that day.

Finally, let's calculate the distance traveled during the second week:
Distance = 300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Now, let's add the distance traveled in the first 7 days and the second week:
Total distance = 1040 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, and Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, we can find Zack's locker size by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4.

Zack's locker size = 5 * 4 = 20 cubic inches

Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can find Timothy's locker size by multiplying Zack's locker size by 2.

Timothy's locker size = 20 * 2 = 40 cubic inches

1. Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock.
2. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each. So, the total number of cats taken away is 4 * 5 = 20.
3. The remaining cats on the rock are 50 - 20 = 30.
4. 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find the number of cats that ran, we multiply 3/5 by 30: (3/5) * 30 = 18.
5. The number of cats left on the rock is the remaining cats minus the cats that ran after the mouse: 30 - 18 = 12.

"To find the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into the different periods and calculate the cost for each period.

1. The first 6 months were $8 a month, so the cost for this period is:
6 months * $8/month = $48

2. The next 8 months were $12 a month, so the cost for this period is:
8 months * $12/month = $96

3. The remaining months (24 - 6 - 8 = 10 months) were $14 a month, so the cost for this period is:
10 months * $14/month = $140

Now, let's add up the costs for each period to find the total cost for 2 years:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let the cost of the jogger jeans be x. Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, we can write an equation:

x = 28 - 6
x = 22

So, the jogger jeans cost $22.

The total savings is $6, and Cole saved 1/3 of this amount from the jogger jeans. Let's find the amount saved from the jogger jeans:

1/3 of the total savings = 1/3 * 6 = 2

The amount saved from the jogger jeans is $2.

Since the total savings is $6, the amount saved from the tattered jeans is:

6 - 2 = 4

The cost of the tattered jeans is $28, and the amount saved from them is $4. To find the original price of the tattered jeans, we subtract the savings from the cost:

Original price of tattered jeans = 28 + 4 = 32

Now, we need to find how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans:

Difference in cost = Original price of jogger jeans - Original price of tattered jeans
= 22 - 32
= -10

The jogger jeans originally cost $10 less than the tattered jeans.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of birds that visit the bird feeders each day. 

First, let's find the number of birds that visit the store-bought bird feeders. Since there are 3 store-bought bird feeders and each attracts 20 birds, the total number of birds visiting the store-bought bird feeders is 3 * 20 = 60.

Next, let's find the number of birds that visit the bird feeders made by Lillian. Since there are 3 bird feeders made by Lillian and each attracts 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, the number of birds visiting each of Lillian's bird feeders is 20 + 10 = 30. The total number of birds visiting Lillian's bird feeders is 3 * 30 = 90.

Now, we add the number of birds visiting the store-bought bird feeders and the number of birds visiting Lillian's bird feeders to find the total number of birds that visit the garden each day. The total number of birds is 60 + 90 = 150.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cards Kenny sold to get the remaining $50. Since he sold the cards for $1.5 each, we can set up an equation to represent the situation.

Let's say Kenny started with x cards. He kept 1/3 of them, so he sold 2/3 of them. The amount of money he got from selling the cards is equal to the number of cards he sold multiplied by the price per card.

We know that he got $50 from selling the cards, so we can set up the equation:

(2/3)x * 1.5 = 50

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3/2 to get:

x = 50 * (3/2) / 1.5

x = 50 * 3 / 2 * 2 / 3

x = 50 * 2

x = 100

However, this is the number of cards he sold. Since he kept 1/3 of the cards, we need to multiply this number by 3/2 to get the total number of cards he started with:

x = 100 * (3/2)

x = 150

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, the caterer prepared enough hot dogs for half of the guests to have two hot dogs. Since there are 36 guests, half of them would be 36 / 2 = 18. So, the caterer prepared enough hot dogs for 18 guests to have two hot dogs each.

This means the caterer prepared 18 * 2 = 36 hot dogs for the first 18 guests. However, since 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hot dog, the caterer had to give out the remaining hot dogs to the additional 22 guests (40 - 18 = 22).

Since the caterer had already prepared 36 hot dogs, and 40 guests showed up, there were not enough hot dogs for everyone to have a second hot dog. The 22 guests who showed up after the initial 18 would not get a second hot dog.

Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hot dog is 22.

"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the total cost of the items before the discount and then apply the 20% discount.

The cost of the pot and pans is $120.00.
The cost of the mixing bowls is $20.00.
The cost of the 5 separate utensils is 5 x $5.00 = $25.00.

The total cost of the items before the discount is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

To apply the 20% discount, we need to find 20% of $165.00, which is 0.20 x $165.00 = $33.00.

The discount amount is $33.00, so we subtract this from the total cost: $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

The final cost of Charlotte's order is $132.00.

x - 5 = 0.01x

To solve for x, we can add 5 to both sides of the equation:

x = 5 / (1 - 0.01)
x = 5 / 0.99
x = 5.05

So, George initially had $5.05.

Now, let's find out how much he spent on chips. He bought 3 bags of chips for 40 cents each, so the total amount spent on chips is:

3 * 0.40 = $1.20

Since he spent $5 in total, the amount spent on candy bars is:

5 - 1.20 = $3.80

Now, we can find out how many candy bars he bought by dividing the total amount spent on candy bars by the cost of each candy bar:

3.80 / 0.75 = 5.07

Since we can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can see that 5 candy bars would cost 3.75, and 6 candy bars would cost 4.50, so the amount spent on candy bars is between 5 and 6. Therefore, George must have bought 5 candy bars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To find out how many lollipops each of Ray's friends received, we need to first determine how many lollipops he shared with his friends. 

Ray had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself, so the number of lollipops he shared is 25 - 5 = 20.

Since he shared the lollipops equally among his 4 friends, we divide the number of lollipops shared by the number of friends: 20 / 4 = 5.

So, each of his friends received 5 lollipops.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the weight of the remaining cake, we first need to find the weight of each piece. 

The total weight of the cake is 20 ounces, and it's cut into 8 pieces. 

Weight of each piece = Total weight of cake / Number of pieces
Weight of each piece = 20 ounces / 8
Weight of each piece = 2.5 ounces

Rory and her mom each have a piece, so they have 2 pieces in total.

Weight of the pieces taken by Rory and her mom = 2 * Weight of each piece
Weight of the pieces taken by Rory and her mom = 2 * 2.5 ounces
Weight of the pieces taken by Rory and her mom = 5 ounces

Now, we subtract the weight of the pieces taken by Rory and her mom from the total weight of the cake to find the weight of the remaining cake.

Weight of the remaining cake = Total weight of cake - Weight of the pieces taken by Rory and her mom
Weight of the remaining cake = 20 ounces - 5 ounces
Weight of the remaining cake = 15 ounces

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how many oranges each person will get, we need to first find the total number of oranges they have together. 

Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges. 

Total oranges = 34 + 22 = 56

They are sharing the oranges with 6 other friends, so the total number of people sharing the oranges is 8 (Sitti, Juris, and 6 friends).

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people.

Oranges per person = Total oranges / Total people
= 56 / 8
= 7

So, everyone will get 7 oranges. 

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the cost per serving, we need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients and divide it by the number of servings.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the onions. Antoine wants to double the amount of onions, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The cost of onions is $2.00 per pound, so the total cost of onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the beef stock. Antoine needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box costs $2.00, so the total cost of beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is the sum of the cost of onions and beef stock, which is $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

Since the soup serves 6 people, the cost per serving is the total cost divided by the number of servings: $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how long it takes Bernadette to get to the theater and then add 5 minutes to that time to determine how early she needs to leave.

Since it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, and Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's, we can multiply Wayne's time by 4 to find Bernadette's time.

Bernadette's time = 4 * 4 = 16 minutes

Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, we need to add 5 minutes to Bernadette's time.

Time difference = 16 + 5 = 21 minutes

So Bernadette should leave 21 minutes earlier than Wayne to get to the theater first.

The final answer is: 21"
"To find the perimeter of the room, we first need to find the width of the room. Since the area of the room is given as 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards, we need to convert the length to feet. There are 3 feet in a yard, so the length in feet is 3 * 3 = 9 feet.

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is length times width (A = lw). We can rearrange this formula to solve for the width: w = A / l. Plugging in the values, we get w = 360 / 9 = 40 feet.

Now that we have the width, we can find the perimeter of the room using the formula P = 2(l + w). Plugging in the values, we get P = 2(9 + 40) = 2 * 49 = 98 feet.

The final answer is: 98"
"To find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we need to calculate the total number of beads each sister has.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
1 pack of red beads = 1 x 20 = 20 beads
2 packs of clear beads = 2 x 20 = 40 beads
Total beads Elizabeth has = 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
3 packs of blue beads = 3 x 20 = 60 beads
4 packs of red beads = 4 x 20 = 80 beads
Total beads Margareth has = 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, we need to find the difference between the total number of beads each sister has:
Difference = Total beads Margareth has - Total beads Elizabeth has
= 140 - 60
= 80

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the final temperature of the house, we need to calculate the temperature increase due to the oven and the temperature decrease due to the open window.

First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to the oven:

The oven is on for 3 hours, and it raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. So, the total temperature increase is:
3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees

Now, let's calculate the temperature decrease due to the open window:

The window is open for 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open, so for 30 minutes, it cools down:
(30 minutes / 10 minutes) * 2 degrees = 6 degrees

Now, let's calculate the final temperature of the house:
Initial temperature = 40 degrees
Temperature increase due to oven = 15 degrees
Temperature decrease due to window = 6 degrees
Final temperature = Initial temperature + Temperature increase - Temperature decrease
= 40 + 15 - 6
= 49 degrees

The final answer is: 49"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total time it took Jon to complete the triathlon. 

Jon's total time = 40 minutes (swim) + 80 minutes (bike ride) + 50 minutes (run) = 170 minutes.

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James' total time is 170 minutes - 10 minutes = 160 minutes.

We know that James finished the swim 10% faster than Jon. 10% of 40 minutes is 0.1 * 40 = 4 minutes. So, James' swim time is 40 minutes - 4 minutes = 36 minutes.

We also know that James took 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. Jon's bike time is 80 minutes, so James' bike time is 80 minutes + 5 minutes = 85 minutes.

Now, we can find James' run time by subtracting his swim and bike times from his total time. James' run time = 160 minutes - 36 minutes - 85 minutes = 39 minutes.

The final answer is: 39"
"To find the length of Movie A, we need to first find the length of Movie B and then calculate one-fourth of that length.

Movie C is 1.25 hours, which is equal to 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes.

Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so Movie B is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes.

Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, so Movie A is 80 / 4 = 20 minutes.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay, we need to calculate the total cost of the hay and subtract it from the amount of money he has.

First, let's find out how many miles the horse runs in 30 minutes. Since the horse runs at 32MPH, we can use the formula:

Distance = Speed * Time

However, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

30 minutes / 60 = 0.5 hours

Now, we can calculate the distance:

Distance = 32MPH * 0.5 hours = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile, it will eat:

16 miles * 1/2 bail/mile = 8 bails of hay

Each bail costs $3, so the total cost of the hay is:

8 bails * $3/bail = $24

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of:

6 * $5 = $30

Now, we can find out how much change he has after buying the hay:

Change = Total money - Total cost of hay
= $30 - $24
= $6

The final answer is: $6"
"To find out how many trays Rozanne can put out, we first need to determine the total number of eggs she has. 

Rozanne uses 4 dozen eggs from cases. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 4 dozen eggs would be 4 * 12 = 48 eggs.

She also uses 2 loose eggs from the cupboard. 

So, the total number of eggs is 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Each glass of eggnog needs 5 eggs, so the total number of glasses she can make is 50 / 5 = 10 glasses.

Each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog, so the total number of trays she can put out is 10 / 5 = 2 trays.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many points Joey is winning by, we need to calculate the difference between his final score and Marcy's final score.

Joey's final score: 214 (initial points) + 26 (points scored) = 240 points
Marcy's final score: 225 (initial points) + 10 (points scored) = 235 points

Now, let's find the difference between their scores: 240 (Joey's score) - 235 (Marcy's score) = 5 points

Joey is winning by 5 points."
"To find the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total revenue from the sale of the sneakers and subtract the initial cost.

First, let's calculate the revenue from the flash sale on Monday:

17 sneakers were sold for $20 each, so the revenue from the flash sale is:
17 x $20 = $340

Next, let's calculate the revenue from the sale to the department store:

The salesman had 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers left to sell to the department store.
Each sneaker was sold for $25, so the revenue from the department store sale is:
31 x $25 = $775

The total revenue from both sales is:
$340 + $775 = $1115

The initial cost of the case of sneakers was $576. To find the profit, we subtract the initial cost from the total revenue:
$1115 - $576 = $539

The salesman's profit is $539.

The final answer is: $539"
"To find the total number of crayons Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the total number of crayons in the six packets with 8 pieces each and the four packets with 16 pieces each.

First, let's calculate the total number of crayons in the six packets with 8 pieces each:
6 packets * 8 crayons/packet = 48 crayons

Next, let's calculate the total number of crayons in the four packets with 16 pieces each:
4 packets * 16 crayons/packet = 64 crayons

Now, we add the total number of crayons from both types of packets to find the overall total:
48 crayons + 64 crayons = 112 crayons

The final answer is: 112"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The super ticket costs $20 and includes a soda and popcorn for $1 extra.
2. The regular price of a soda is $3.
3. If you buy a regular ticket and didn't buy the super ticket, you saved $2.

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, it means the extra $1 for popcorn and soda in the super ticket is actually a discount. This implies that the regular price of popcorn and soda together is $1 more than the discount you got, which is $2. 

So, the regular price of popcorn and soda together is $2 + $1 = $3.

However, we know the soda costs $3, so the price of popcorn is $3 (total) - $3 (soda) = $0.

This seems incorrect, so let's re-evaluate the information. If the super ticket costs $20 and includes a soda and popcorn for $1 extra, and you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, it means the regular ticket price is $20 - $2 = $18.

The regular ticket price is $18, and you also need to buy a soda for $3. So, the total cost of a regular ticket and a soda is $18 + $3 = $21.

Since the super ticket includes a soda and popcorn for $1 extra, the total cost of the super ticket is $20. This means the regular price of popcorn is $20 (super ticket) - $18 (regular ticket) - $3 (soda) = -$1.

However, the price can't be negative, so let's re-evaluate the information again. If the super ticket costs $20 and includes a soda and popcorn for $1 extra, and you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, it means the regular ticket price is $20 - $2 = $18.

The regular ticket price is $18, and you also need to buy a soda for $3. So, the total cost of a regular ticket and a soda is $18 + $3 = $21.

The super ticket costs $20, which is $1 less than the total cost of a regular ticket and a soda. This means the $1 extra in the super ticket is actually a discount on the regular ticket and soda.

Let's denote the original cost of filling one balloon as x. Since the total cost of filling 20 balloons was $900, we can set up the equation:

20x = 900

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 20:

x = 900 / 20
x = 45

So, the original cost of filling one balloon was $45.

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20, so the new cost of filling one balloon is:

New cost = Original cost + Increase
New cost = 45 + 20
New cost = 65

Now, we need to find the total cost of filling 170 balloons at the new cost. 

Total cost = New cost * Number of balloons
Total cost = 65 * 170
Total cost = 11050

The final answer is: $11050"
"To find the average speed of the car during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled at 60 mph for 2 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time = 60 mph x 2 hours = 120 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled at 30 mph for 1 hour:
Distance = Speed x Time = 30 mph x 1 hour = 30 miles

Now, let's find the total distance traveled:
Total Distance = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles

The total time taken is the sum of the time taken at 60 mph and 30 mph:
Total Time = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

Finally, we can calculate the average speed:
Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time = 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total value of Jenna's jewels, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires she has left and the value of the rubies she received in the trade.

Initially, Jenna has 8 sapphires. She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. So, she is left with 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires.

The value of 5 sapphires is 5 * $800 = $4000.

The value of 2 rubies is 2 * $1200 = $2400.

The total value of her jewels is $4000 + $2400 = $6400.

The final answer is: $6400"
"To find the total number of apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of apples they eat per day and then multiply it by 30.

Marin and Nancy each eat 4 apples a day, so together they eat 4 + 4 = 8 apples per day.

Now, we multiply the total number of apples they eat per day by 30:

8 apples/day * 30 days = 240 apples

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the total volume of soil needed, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed and then multiply it by the number of beds.

The volume of one raised bed is calculated as length * width * height = 8 * 2 * 2 = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is 32 * 10 = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil, so the number of bags needed is 320 / 2 = 160 bags.

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is 160 * 12 = $1920.

The final answer is: $1920"
"To find the total number of cards, we first need to determine the number of green cards. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:

Number of red cards = 15
60% of 15 = 0.6 * 15 = 9
Number of green cards = 15 + 9 = 24

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards:
Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
= 15 + 24
= 39

To find the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards:
Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
= 15 + 24 + 39
= 78

The final answer is: 78"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies.

After 20 minutes, one of her friends saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the fairies that were there. This means that her friend saw 50/2 = 25 fairies. So, the total number of fairies now is 50 + 25 = 75.

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. To find the remaining number of fairies, we subtract 30 from 75: 75 - 30 = 45.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the total number of puppies, we need to add the number of puppies Jennifer's dog has to the number of puppies Brandon's dog has. 

Total puppies = 8 (Jennifer's puppies) + 12 (Brandon's puppies) = 20

Next, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots. 

Puppies with spots = 3 (Jennifer's puppies with spots) + 4 (Brandon's puppies with spots) = 7

Now, we can find the percentage of puppies with spots by dividing the number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

The final answer is: 35"
"To find the total number of trips the farmer needs to make, we need to calculate the total weight of all the feed and divide it by the capacity of the farm truck.

First, let's calculate the total weight of each type of feed:

- Sugar cubes: 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
- Carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
- Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
- Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Now, let's add up the total weight of all the feed:
2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3400 pounds

Since the farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, we need to divide the total weight by the capacity of the truck to find the number of trips:
3400 / 2250 = 1.511 (round up to the nearest whole number since we can't make a fraction of a trip)

So, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To find out how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate the total amount she earns from aluminum cans and plastic bottles separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the amount she earns from aluminum cans:

Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans a week. Each can is worth 2 cents. So, she earns 3 * 2 = 6 cents from aluminum cans per week.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, she earns 6 * 4 = 24 cents from aluminum cans in a month.

Next, let's calculate the amount she earns from plastic bottles:

Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles a week. Each bottle is worth 3 cents. So, she earns 5 * 3 = 15 cents from plastic bottles per week.

In a month, she earns 15 * 4 = 60 cents from plastic bottles.

Now, let's add the amount she earns from aluminum cans and plastic bottles to find the total amount she earns in a month:

24 cents (aluminum cans) + 60 cents (plastic bottles) = 84 cents

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the number of plants Shondra has, we need to first determine the number of plants Toni has, and then subtract 7 from that number.

Since Frederick has 10 plants, and Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, we can calculate the number of plants Toni has as follows:

Toni's plants = Frederick's plants + (60% of Frederick's plants)
= 10 + (0.6 * 10)
= 10 + 6
= 16

Now that we know Toni has 16 plants, we can find the number of plants Shondra has by subtracting 7 from Toni's total:

Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
= 16 - 7
= 9

The final answer is: 9"

"To find the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man, we need to first find the tip amount, which is 1/5 of the cost of the pizza. 

The cost of the pizza is $15. 

Tip amount = 1/5 * $15
Tip amount = $15 / 5
Tip amount = $3

Now, we need to add the tip to the cost of the pizza to find the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man.

Total amount = Cost of pizza + Tip amount
Total amount = $15 + $3
Total amount = $18

"To find out how many students Miss Maria has, we first need to calculate the total number of cards she has. 

She has 6 decks of basketball cards with 25 cards in each deck, so the total number of basketball cards is 6 * 25 = 150.

She has 5 boxes of baseball cards with 40 cards in each box, so the total number of baseball cards is 5 * 40 = 200.

The total number of cards is the sum of basketball and baseball cards, which is 150 + 200 = 350.

Since Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, the number of cards she gives to her students is 350 - 50 = 300.

Each student gets 10 cards, so the number of students is 300 / 10 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples for both of them.

Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each and received a $1 discount. 
First, we calculate the total cost of the apples for Becky: 
20 apples * 45 cents/apple = 900 cents
Since Becky received a $1 discount, we subtract 100 cents (1 dollar) from the total cost: 
900 cents - 100 cents = 800 cents
To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100: 
800 cents / 100 = $8

Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each and received a 10 percent discount. 
First, we calculate the total cost of the apples for Kelly: 
20 apples * 50 cents/apple = 1000 cents
To find the discount, we multiply the total cost by 10 percent (0.1): 
1000 cents * 0.1 = 100 cents
We subtract the discount from the total cost: 
1000 cents - 100 cents = 900 cents
To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100: 
900 cents / 100 = $9

Now, we compare the total cost of the apples for Kelly and Becky: 
Kelly paid $9 and Becky paid $8. 
To find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we subtract Becky's cost from Kelly's cost: 
$9 - $8 = $1

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of shoes Fireman Frank has at the end of the week.

Initially, Fireman Frank has 200 shoes.

On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes. Since each pair has 2 shoes, he gets 5 * 2 = 10 shoes.

By Wednesday, he gains 15 new pairs of shoes, which is 15 * 2 = 30 shoes.

By Friday, he gains 30 new pairs of shoes, which is 30 * 2 = 60 shoes.

So, the total number of shoes he has by Friday is 200 + 10 + 30 + 60 = 300 shoes.

On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes.

Therefore, the total number of shoes he has on Sunday is 300 - 180 = 120 shoes.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as 'x'. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:

Number of cookies = (1/2)x + 2

We are given that Matt wants to eat five cookies in total. So, we can set up the equation:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate the variable. First, subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

Therefore, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks to get 5 cookies.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the combined length of the remoras, we need to convert the length of the shark and the remoras to the same unit. Since the shark's length is given in feet, we'll convert the remoras' length from inches to feet. 

There are 12 inches in a foot, so the length of each remora is 6 inches / 12 = 0.5 feet. 

Since there are 2 remoras, the combined length of the remoras is 2 * 0.5 = 1 foot.

Now, we need to find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents. 

The percentage is calculated as (combined length of remoras / length of shark) * 100. 

So, the percentage is (1 / 10) * 100 = 10%.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of students, we can start by determining the fraction of students who do not have a desktop computer. Since three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer, one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer.

Let's denote the total number of students as 'x'. The number of students without a desktop computer is given as 20. We can set up the equation:

(1/4)x = 20

To solve for 'x', we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4:

x = 20 * 4
x = 80

Therefore, there are 80 students at that grade level.

"To find out how long Jason has to spend walking each day, we need to first calculate the total number of minutes he has available to walk in three weeks. 

There are 7 days in a week, so in three weeks, there are 3 * 7 = 21 days. 

Since Jason can walk 4 days a week, the total number of days he can walk in three weeks is 21 * 4 = 84 days.

Now, we need to find out how many minutes he needs to walk each day to break in the shoes in 84 days. 

The total number of minutes he needs to walk is 240 minutes. 

To find the number of minutes he needs to walk each day, we divide the total number of minutes by the total number of days: 240 / 84 = 2.857 (approximately).

So, Jason needs to spend approximately 2.86 minutes walking each day to break in the new shoes in three weeks.

"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we need to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. 

First, let's find the total number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts. This is the sum of kids allergic to dairy and kids allergic to peanuts, minus the kids allergic to both (to avoid double-counting).

Number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts = Number of kids allergic to dairy + Number of kids allergic to peanuts - Number of kids allergic to both
= 9 + 6 - 3
= 12

Now, we know that there are 32 kids in the class. To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts from the total number of kids.

Number of kids not allergic to anything = Total number of kids - Number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts

"To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we first need to find the weight of the 2010 penny. 

Since the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can set up an equation to find its weight. Let's denote the weight of the 2010 penny as x. 

The equation is: x = (3/4) * 48

To solve for x, we multiply 48 by 3 and then divide by 4: 
x = (3 * 48) / 4
x = 144 / 4
x = 36

Now that we know the weight of the 2010 penny is 36 grains, we can find the combined weight of the two pennies by adding their weights:

"To find the total number of bags of oats needed, we need to calculate the total amount of oats consumed by the horses in five days.

First, let's find the total amount of oats consumed per day:

Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and there are 2 meals per day, so each horse consumes 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of oats per day.

Since there are 4 horses, the total amount of oats consumed per day is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

To find the total amount of oats consumed in five days, we multiply the daily consumption by 5:

40 * 5 = 200 pounds

Since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, we need to divide the total amount of oats consumed in five days by the weight of one bag:

200 / 50 = 4

So, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days.

The 3 girls on top of the 4 are also 64"" tall each, so their total height is 3 * 64 = 192"".

The 2 girls on top of the 3 are also 64"" tall each, so their total height is 2 * 64 = 128"".

The shortest girl at the top is 60"" tall.

Now, we add up the heights of all the levels: 256"" + 192"" + 128"" + 60"" = 536"".

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches): 536"" / 12 = 44.67 feet.

The final answer is: 44.67"
"To find the total number of minutes Charisma walked, we need to calculate the total number of 5-minute breaks she took in a day and then multiply it by the number of days she worked.

Charisma works 8 hours a day, and she takes a 5-minute break every hour. So, the total number of 5-minute breaks in a day is 8 hours * 1 break per hour = 8 breaks per day.

Since each break is 5 minutes long, the total number of minutes she walked in a day is 8 breaks * 5 minutes per break = 40 minutes per day.

Charisma worked for 5 days, so the total number of minutes she walked is 40 minutes per day * 5 days = 200 minutes.

The final answer is: 200"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let Angela's current age be x.

In four years, Angela's age will be x + 4.

According to the problem, in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. Since Brett is 14 years old now, in four years, he will be 14 + 4 = 18 years old.

So, we can set up the equation: x + 4 = 3(14)

Simplifying the equation, we get: x + 4 = 42

Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get: x = 38

Therefore, Angela's current age is 38 years old.

The final answer is: 38"
"To find the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car, we need to calculate the cost of the morning rides and the cost of the afternoon rides separately, and then add them together.

The cost of the morning rides is the cost per ride multiplied by the number of rides: $6/ride * 14 rides = $84.

The cost of the afternoon rides is the cost per ride multiplied by the number of rides: $2/ride * 14 rides = $28.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the morning rides and the cost of the afternoon rides: $84 + $28 = $112.

The final answer is: $112"
"To find out how many Greek orange pies Brianne and Ashley can make, we need to calculate the total number of oranges they have and then divide that by the number of oranges needed for one pie.

Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so she has 5 x 10 = 50 oranges.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so she has 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

In total, they have 50 + 70 = 120 oranges.

Since one Greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, the number of pies they can make is 120 / 3 = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'. 

For the first venue, the total cost is the flat fee of $200 plus the cost of food for each guest, which is $5x. So, the total cost for the first venue is 200 + 5x.

For the second venue, the total cost is the cost per guest, which is $25x.

To find the number of guests for which the two venues are equal in cost, we set the two expressions equal to each other:

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtracting 5x from both sides gives us:

200 = 20x

Dividing both sides by 20 gives us:

10 = x

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's denote the number of insects found by Bodhi as B, David as D, and Lily as L. 

We are given that Lily found 7 more than David, so we can write an equation: L = D + 7.

We are also given that David found half of what Bodhi found, so we can write another equation: D = B/2.

We are also given that together they collected 43 insects, so we can write the equation: L + D + B = 43.

Now we can substitute the first equation into the third equation: (D + 7) + D + B = 43.

Combine like terms: 2D + B + 7 = 43.

Subtract 7 from both sides: 2D + B = 36.

Now substitute the second equation into the result: 2(D) + B = 36 becomes 2(B/2) + B = 36.

Simplify the equation: B + B/2 = 36.

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction: 2B + B = 72.

Combine like terms: 3B = 72.

Divide both sides by 3: B = 24.

Now that we know B, we can find D: D = B/2 = 24/2 = 12.

Now that we know D, we can find L: L = D + 7 = 12 + 7 = 19.

The final answer is: 19"
"To find the total yards of yarn used, we need to calculate the yards used by Mariah and her grandma separately and then add them together.

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, and there are 364 yards in a skein. To find the yards used by Mariah, we multiply 364 yards by 1/4:

364 yards * 1/4 = 364 yards * 0.25 = 91 yards

Her grandma used 1/2 of a skein, so we multiply 364 yards by 1/2:

364 yards * 1/2 = 364 yards * 0.5 = 182 yards

Now, we add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma:

91 yards + 182 yards = 273 yards

The final answer is: 273"
"To find the total number of gifts Cherrie bought, we need to calculate the number of gifts for her friends and add the 10 random gifts.

First, let's calculate the number of gifts for her friends. 2 friends want 5 gifts each, so the total number of gifts for these friends is 2 x 5 = 10. The other 3 friends want 2 gifts each, so the total number of gifts for these friends is 3 x 2 = 6. 

Now, we add the number of gifts for the first 2 friends (10) and the number of gifts for the other 3 friends (6), which gives us 10 + 6 = 16. 

Finally, we add the 10 random gifts to the total number of gifts for her friends, which gives us 16 + 10 = 26.

The final answer is: 26"
"To find the length of the couch, we first need to find the width of the rug. Since the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, and the chair is 3 feet wide, the rug's width is 3 + 5 = 8 feet.

The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Twice the width of the rug is 2 * 8 = 16 feet. Adding 2 feet to this gives us the length of the couch: 16 + 2 = 18 feet.

The final answer is: 18"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Suzie bought 4 packs of gum in total.
- 2 packs are strawberry gum.
- 1 pack is grape gum, which costs $2.
- 1 pack is green apple gum, which costs half as much as the grape gum, so it costs $2 / 2 = $1.
- The total cost of all 4 packs is $7.

We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

Let S be the cost of each pack of strawberry gum.

The total cost of all 4 packs is the sum of the costs of each individual pack:
2S (strawberry) + 2 (grape) + 1 (green apple) = 7

Combine like terms:
2S + 3 = 7

Subtract 3 from both sides:
2S = 4

Divide both sides by 2:
S = 2

The cost of each pack of strawberry gum is $2. 

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to determine which type of wood gives him the most sticks per dollar spent. 

Let's calculate the cost per stick for each type of wood:

For a 2 x 4 piece of wood, Frederick can get 200 sticks for $4. 
Cost per stick = $4 / 200 sticks = $0.02 per stick

For a 2 x 8 piece of wood, Frederick can get 400 sticks for $6.
Cost per stick = $6 / 400 sticks = $0.015 per stick

Since the 2 x 8 piece of wood gives him the most sticks per dollar, we will use this type of wood. 

Now, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces of wood Frederick can buy with his $24:
Number of 2 x 8 pieces = $24 / $6 = 4

Since each 2 x 8 piece of wood gives him 400 sticks, the total number of sticks he can make is:
Total sticks = 4 * 400 = 1600

The final answer is: 1600"
"To find the total cost of snowshoes for Mario's dogs, we need to first determine the total number of snowshoes required. Since each dog has 4 legs and Mario has 6 dogs, the total number of legs is 6 * 4 = 24.

Since each dog needs a pair of snowshoes, the total number of snowshoes required is also 24. However, since snowshoes come in pairs, we need to divide the total number of snowshoes by 2 to get the number of pairs. 

24 / 2 = 12 pairs of snowshoes.

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of pairs by the cost per pair. 

12 pairs * $12.00 per pair = $144.00

The final answer is: $144.00"
"To find out how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips for a week and then subtract the cost of the weekly pass.

Janet takes two bus trips per day, five days a week. So, the total number of bus trips per week is 2 * 5 = 10.

Each bus trip costs $2.20, so the total cost of her bus trips for a week is 10 * $2.20 = $22.

The weekly bus pass costs $20. To find out how much Janet would save, we subtract the cost of the pass from the total cost of her bus trips: $22 - $20 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The farm has 30 cows.
2. The zoo has 20 sheep.
3. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does. This means the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.
4. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does. Since the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals in the farm and the zoo:

Farm: 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals
Zoo: 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals

Total number of animals in the farm and the zoo combined: 40 + 80 = 120

The final answer is: 120"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many items Sophia bought. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of items Sophia bought, we can let the number of items Sophia bought be x. 

We know that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, which is a total of 16 items. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of items Sophia bought, we can set up the equation:

4x = 16

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 4:

x = 16 / 4
x = 4

So Sophia bought 4 items in total. Since we don't know whether the 4 items are onions or potatoes, we can assume that the 4 items are a combination of both. However, we can say that Sophia bought 4 items in total.

The total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is 4.

"To find the number of days Andy has to lose the weight, we need to calculate the difference between his birthday and today's date. 

December has 31 days, and his birthday is on the 19th of July, which is the 7th month. So, we need to calculate the days from December 31st to July 19th.

December has 31 days, so from December 31st to December 31st is 0 days. 
January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. 
February has 28 days (assuming a non-leap year), so from February 1st to February 28th is 28 days. 
March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 31st is 31 days. 
April has 30 days, so from April 1st to April 30th is 30 days. 
May has 31 days, so from May 1st to May 31st is 31 days. 
June has 30 days, so from June 1st to June 30th is 30 days. 
July has 19 days, so from July 1st to July 19th is 19 days.

Total days = 0 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 180 days

Now, we need to find the total number of calories Andy needs to burn to lose 30 pounds. Since he needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound, he needs to burn 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories.

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories by the number of days: 105,000 / 180 ≈ 583.33 calories.

The final answer is: 583.33"

Now, let's subtract the amount spent on clothes from the initial amount: $500 - $100 = $400.

Next, let's calculate the amount she spent on CDs: 25% of $400 is 0.25 x $400 = $100.

Now, let's subtract the amount spent on CDs from the remaining amount: $400 - $100 = $300.

"Let's denote the cost of the lot as x. Since the house cost three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can set up the equation:

x + 3x = 120,000

Combine like terms:

4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 30,000

Since the cost of the house is 3x, we can find the cost of the house by multiplying x by 3:

Cost of the house = 3x = 3(30,000) = 90,000

The final answer is: $90,000"
"To find the profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue.

The total cost is the cost of the canvas bags, which is 8 packs * 5 bags per pack * $4 per bag = 8 * 5 * 4 = $160.

The total revenue is the selling price of the bags, which is 8 bags * $8 per bag = 8 * 8 = $64.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $64 - $160 = -$96.

However, since profit cannot be negative, it seems there is an error in the problem. The selling price of $8 per bag is less than the cost price of $4 per bag, which is not possible. 

Assuming the selling price is actually higher than the cost price, let's recalculate the profit. 

The total cost is still $160. 

The total revenue is 8 bags * $8 per bag = 8 * 8 = $64. However, this is not possible as the bags were sold at a loss. 

Let's assume the selling price is actually $12 per bag. 

The total revenue is 8 bags * $12 per bag = 8 * 12 = $96.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $96 - $160 = -$64. 

However, this is still a loss. 

Let's assume the selling price is actually $16 per bag. 

The total revenue is 8 bags * $16 per bag = 8 * 16 = $128.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $128 - $160 = -$32. 

However, this is still a loss. 

Let's assume the selling price is actually $20 per bag. 

The total revenue is 8 bags * $20 per bag = 8 * 20 = $160.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $160 - $160 = $0.

However, this is not a profit. 

Let's assume the selling price is actually $24 per bag. 

The total revenue is 8 bags * $24 per bag = 8 * 24 = $192.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $192 - $160 = $32.

"To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to first determine how many cups of raisins she has available for the oatmeal cookies. 

Since she divides the bag of raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, each of these will get 27 / 3 = 9 cups of raisins.

However, the question asks how many batches of oatmeal cookies she can make, and each batch takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins. To find out how many batches she can make, we need to divide the total raisins available for oatmeal cookies by the amount needed per batch.

Since she has 9 cups of raisins for oatmeal cookies, we can calculate the number of batches as follows:

Number of batches = Total raisins available for oatmeal cookies / Raisins per batch
= 9 / (3/4)

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we first need to calculate her daily and weekly consumption before and after adding the new device.

Before adding the new device, Ada's daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. Since there are 24 hours in a day, her daily consumption is 12 * 24 = 288 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per day.

After adding the new device, her daily consumption will be 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour. So, her daily consumption will be 14 * 24 = 336 kWh per day.

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7. 

Before adding the new device, Ada's weekly consumption is 288 * 7 = 2016 kWh.
After adding the new device, her weekly consumption is 336 * 7 = 2352 kWh.

The cost of electricity is $1.50 per kWh. So, the weekly cost before adding the new device is 2016 * $1.50 = $3024.
The weekly cost after adding the new device is 2352 * $1.50 = $3528.

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is $3528 - $3024 = $504.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how long it would take one person to paint a whole house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take them twice as long to paint a whole house, which is 10 days.

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can calculate the total hours it would take one person to paint a whole house:

10 days * 24 hours/day = 240 hours

Now, if 5 people are painting a whole house, we can divide the total hours it would take one person by 5 to find the total hours it would take 5 people:

240 hours / 5 people = 48 hours

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Ophelia has 20 sofas.
2. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so she has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.
4. Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Now, let's calculate the total number of sofas and chairs they have:
Ophelia has 20 sofas and 22 chairs, so she has 20 + 22 = 42 pieces of furniture.
Jenna has 64 sofas and 66 chairs, so she has 64 + 66 = 130 pieces of furniture.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money Tom spent on the headphone set. 

Let's subtract the cost of the CD from the total amount Tom paid: 
$48 (total) - $4 (CD) = $44 (headphone set)

Now, we know that Tom spent $44 on the headphone set. If he had not bought the headphone set, he would have had $44 more to spend on CDs. 

Since each CD costs $4, we can find out how many CDs he could have bought with the $44 by dividing $44 by $4:
$44 / $4 = 11

So, Tom would have been able to buy 11 more CDs if he had decided not to buy the headphone set.

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (which is 8) get into the bus. So, 5 * 8 = 40 people get in. Now, the total number of people on the bus is:
40 (remaining) + 40 (new passengers) = 80

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off. So, the number of people left on the bus is:
80 - 21 = 59

Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on. Since 21 got off, 3 times fewer would be 21 / 3 = 7. So, 7 passengers get in. Now, the total number of people on the bus is:
59 (remaining) + 7 (new passengers) = 66

The final number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop is 66."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let Jame's current age be x.

In 5 years, Jame will be x + 5 years old.

In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be (x + 5 + 8) = x + 13 years old.

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 13 = 2(x + 5 + 8) - 5

Simplifying the equation:

x + 13 = 2x + 10 + 16 - 5
x + 13 = 2x + 21
x = 8

So, Jame's current age is 8 years.

In 5 years, Jame will be 8 + 5 = 13 years old.

In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 8 + 13 = 21 years old.

The age difference between Jame and his cousin now is 8 - 0 = 8 years.

The final answer is: 8"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer = $2,400
2. Cost of the computer = $1,100
3. The printer cost $400 less than the computer.

First, we need to find the cost of the printer. Since the printer cost $400 less than the computer, we subtract $400 from the cost of the computer:

Cost of the printer = Cost of the computer - $400
= $1,100 - $400
= $700

Now, we know the total cost of the computer, the printer, and 2 monitors is $2,400. We can subtract the cost of the computer and the printer from the total to find the cost of the 2 monitors:

Cost of 2 monitors = Total cost - (Cost of the computer + Cost of the printer)
= $2,400 - ($1,100 + $700)
= $2,400 - $1,800
= $600

Since there are 2 monitors, we need to find the cost of one monitor by dividing the total cost of the 2 monitors by 2:

Cost of one monitor = Cost of 2 monitors / 2
= $600 / 2
= $300

The final answer is: $300"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many shells the boys brought in total. Since there are 10 boys (half of 20 kids), and each boy brought 60 shells, the total number of shells brought by the boys is 10 * 60 = 600.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 600 + 4 * 60 shells. 

First, we calculate 4 times the number of shells brought by the boys: 4 * 60 = 240.

Then, we add this to the number of shells brought by the boys: 600 + 240 = 840.

Since there are 10 girls (half of 20 kids), and they brought a total of 840 shells, we can find out how many shells each girl brought by dividing the total number of shells by the number of girls: 840 / 10 = 84.

The final answer is: 84"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's assume the number of candies George had initially is x. Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, Nick had 2x candies initially.

George ate 5 candies, so the number of candies George has left is x - 5.

We are given that George has 3 candies left, so we can set up the equation:

x - 5 = 3

To solve for x, we add 5 to both sides of the equation:

x = 3 + 5
x = 8

Now that we know George had 8 candies initially, we can find the number of candies Nick had initially:

Nick had 2x candies, so Nick had 2(8) = 16 candies.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find Anne's age, we first need to find Alyana's age. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, we can calculate Alyana's age as follows:

Alyana's age = Chenny's age - 4
Alyana's age = 10 - 4
Alyana's age = 6

Now that we know Alyana's age, we can find Anne's age. Since Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, we can calculate Anne's age as follows:

Anne's age = Alyana's age + 2
Anne's age = 6 + 2
Anne's age = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book and then add them together.

The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 * 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add the thickness of all four books together:
31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188

"To find out how many vlogs Emma needs to make to complete 72 vlogs per month, we need to subtract the total number of vlogs she has already made from the target number of vlogs.

Emma made 18 vlogs in the first week, 21 vlogs in the second week, and 15 vlogs in the third week. 

Total vlogs made = 18 + 21 + 15 = 54

Since Emma's target is 72 vlogs per month, we subtract the total vlogs made from the target:

72 - 54 = 18

Emma should make 18 more vlogs to complete 72 vlogs per month.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the total amount you paid, we need to calculate the tip first. 

The tip is 20% of the dinner bill, which is $50. 

20% of $50 = 0.20 * $50 = $10

Now, we add the tip to the dinner bill to get the total amount you paid.

Total amount = dinner bill + tip
Total amount = $50 + $10
Total amount = $60

Since your wife wants to split the check evenly, you will pay half of the total amount.

Your share = Total amount / 2
Your share = $60 / 2
Your share = $30

The final answer is: $30"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. The eldest boy's initial share is $18 / 3 = $6.
2. He added $5 to his share, so he had $6 + $5 = $11.
3. He added another $10, so he had $11 + $10 = $21.
4. He spent $8, so he had $21 - $8 = $13.
5. He tripled the amount he had left after spending the $8, so he had 3 * $13 = $39.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much Elvis needs to save in the first half of the month. 

Let's assume the number of days in the first half of the month is x. Then, the number of days in the second half of the month is also x (since the month has 30 days, the first half has 15 days and the second half has 15 days).

Let's denote the daily savings in the first half as y. Then, the total savings in the first half is xy.

Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half as in the first half, the daily savings in the second half is 2y.

The total savings in the second half is 2yx.

The total savings in the month is the sum of the savings in the first and second half, which is equal to the target savings of $1125. 

So, we can write the equation: xy + 2yx = 1125

Combine like terms: 3yx = 1125

Divide both sides by 3x: y = 1125 / 3x

Since x is 15, y is 1125 / 3 * 15 = 562.5

Now, we need to find the daily savings in the second half, which is 2y. 

2y = 2 * 562.5 = 1125

The final answer is: $1125"

"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as x. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, the amount of money Jeff gets is 4x.

We know that the total amount of money they are dividing is $100. So, the sum of the money Jeff and Brad get is equal to $100. We can write this as an equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms:

5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 20

Since x is the amount of money Brad gets, and Jeff gets 4 times as much, Jeff gets 4x = 4(20) = 80 dollars.

The final answer is: $80"
"To find the total distance Jeff walks in a week, we need to calculate the total distance he walks each day and then multiply it by the number of days he works.

Since Jeff walks 3 miles to work and 3 miles back home, the total distance he walks each day is 3 + 3 = 6 miles.

If he works 5 times a week, the total distance he walks in a week is 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week.

"To find the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to break down the process step by step.

1. Elise writes the alphabet in full twice, which means she writes 26 letters each time. So, in total, she writes 2 * 26 = 52 letters.

2. Then, she writes half of the alphabet once. Half of the alphabet is 26 / 2 = 13 letters.

3. So, in total, she has written 52 + 13 = 65 letters so far.

4. Finally, she re-writes everything she has already written. This means she re-writes 65 letters.

5. To find the total number of letters Elise has written, we add the number of letters she wrote initially (65) to the number of letters she re-wrote (65). 

Total letters = 65 + 65 = 130

In the third round, each of the 9 families notifies 3 other families, resulting in 9 * 3 = 27 new families notified. 

In the fourth round, each of the 27 families notifies 3 other families, resulting in 27 * 3 = 81 new families notified.

The total number of families notified in the fourth round is 81."
"To find Mark's initial weight, we need to calculate the total weight he lost during the 3 months and then add that to his final weight.

Weight lost per month = 10 pounds
Number of months = 3

Total weight lost = Weight lost per month * Number of months
Total weight lost = 10 * 3
Total weight lost = 30 pounds

Since Mark's final weight was 70 pounds, we can find his initial weight by adding the total weight lost to his final weight.

Initial weight = Final weight + Total weight lost
Initial weight = 70 + 30
Initial weight = 100 pounds

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many toys Jonathan needs to have a play set five times larger than James's. Since James's play set has 80 toys, a play set five times larger would have 5 * 80 = 400 toys.

Since Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have enough toys to make a play set five times larger than James's, let's denote the number of toys Jonathan currently has as x. Then, the equation can be set up as x + 2 = 400.

To find the number of toys Jonathan currently has, we need to solve for x. Subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation gives us x = 400 - 2.

x = 398

"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we need to break down her sales into two parts: the first $1000 and the sales above $1000.

For the first $1000, she earns a 30% commission:
Commission on the first $1000 = 0.3 * $1000 = $300

For the sales above $1000, which is $2500 - $1000 = $1500, she earns an additional 10% commission:
Commission on the sales above $1000 = 0.1 * $1500 = $150

Total commission = Commission on the first $1000 + Commission on the sales above $1000
Total commission = $300 + $150
Total commission = $450

Therefore, Antonella earned $450.

Bill has 2 cases of water with 24 bottles each, so he has a total of 2 x 24 = 48 bottles.

Since he wants 2 bottles of water for each of the 70 guests, he needs a total of 70 x 2 = 140 bottles.

To find out how many additional bottles he needs, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles he needs: 140 - 48 = 92.

Therefore, Bill needs to buy 92 additional bottles of water.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. 

Let's denote the time it takes to swim a mile in cold water as C = 16 minutes. 

The time it takes to swim a mile in warm water is 2 minutes more than twice as long as in cold water. So, the time in warm water is 2 * C + 2 = 2 * 16 + 2 = 34 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in cold and warm water.

In cold water, it takes Ray 3 * C = 3 * 16 = 48 minutes to swim 3 miles.

In warm water, it takes Ray 3 * (2 * C + 2) = 3 * (2 * 16 + 2) = 3 * 34 = 102 minutes to swim 3 miles.

The difference in time is 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee. Let's assume the daily recommended cups of coffee is x. Then, Octavia drinks x/2 cups of coffee.

2. Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks. So, Juan drinks 10 * (x/2) = 5x cups of coffee.

3. Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. To find out how many cups Juan must reduce, we need to subtract the recommended amount from his current intake: 5x - 4.

However, we don't know the value of x, the daily recommended cups of coffee. To find the answer, we need to make an assumption or get more information. Let's assume the daily recommended cups of coffee is 8 (this is a common recommendation). 

If the daily recommended cups of coffee is 8, then:
- Octavia drinks 8/2 = 4 cups of coffee.
- Juan drinks 10 * 4 = 40 cups of coffee.

To find out how many cups Juan must reduce, we subtract the recommended amount from his current intake: 40 - 4 = 36.

"To find out how many packs of candles James needs to buy, we first need to determine the total number of candles required. Since each son needs candles for their birthday, we need to calculate the total number of candles needed.

The older son is 12 years old, and the younger son is 4 years younger, so the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

The number of candles needed for each son is equal to their age. Therefore, the older son needs 12 candles, and the younger son needs 8 candles.

In total, James needs 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we need to find out how many packs James needs to buy. To do this, we divide the total number of candles needed by the number of candles in each pack: 20 / 5 = 4.

Since James needs 4 packs of candles, and each pack costs $3, the total amount James spends on candles is 4 * 3 = $12.

"To find out how many pages Judy read in the first week, we need to calculate the total minutes she read in the first week and then convert that to pages. 

In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night. Since there are 7 nights in a week, she read for a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes.

Given that she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we can find out how many pages she read in 105 minutes. First, let's find out how many 1.5 minute intervals are in 105 minutes. 

105 minutes / 1.5 minutes per interval = 70 intervals

Now, we can find out how many pages she read in 70 intervals. 

2 pages per interval * 70 intervals = 140 pages

So, in the first week, Judy read 140 pages.

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages.

To find the total number of pages she read in two weeks, we add the pages read in the first week and the second week.

"To find the total number of goals scored by the three teenagers, we need to find the number of goals scored by Mark and Anna first.

Let's denote the number of goals scored by Anna as A. Since Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, the number of goals scored by Richie is A + 45.

We are given that Richie scored 80 goals, so we can set up the equation:

A + 45 = 80

Subtracting 45 from both sides of the equation gives us:

A = 35

Now that we know Anna scored 35 goals, we can find the number of goals scored by Mark. Since Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, the number of goals scored by Mark is (A + 20) = 35 + 20 = 55.

Now that we know the number of goals scored by each teenager, we can find the total number of goals scored by adding the goals scored by Anna, Mark, and Richie:

Total goals = A + (A + 20) + (A + 45)
Total goals = 35 + 55 + 80
Total goals = 170

"To find the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate the number of wooden and plastic action figures he can buy.

First, let's calculate the amount of money Peter spent on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday. Since he spent an equal amount each day, we can divide the total amount of money he has ($70) by 7 (the number of days in a week) to find the daily amount he can spend. 

Daily amount = $70 / 7 = $10

Since the wooden action figures cost $5 each, we can divide the daily amount by the cost of a wooden action figure to find the number of wooden action figures he can buy each day.

Number of wooden action figures per day = $10 / $5 = 2

From Sunday through Wednesday, Peter can buy 2 wooden action figures each day for 4 days. 

Total wooden action figures = 2 * 4 = 8

Now, let's calculate the amount of money Peter has left after buying the wooden action figures. 

Money left = $70 - ($5 * 8) = $70 - $40 = $30

Since Peter will buy plastic action figures for the rest of the week (Thursday, Friday, Saturday), we can divide the money left by the cost of a plastic action figure to find the number of plastic action figures he can buy each day.

Number of plastic action figures per day = $30 / $2 = 15

For the remaining 3 days (Thursday, Friday, Saturday), Peter can buy 15 plastic action figures each day.

Total plastic action figures = 15 * 3 = 45

Now, we can find the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week by adding the total number of wooden and plastic action figures.

Total action figures = 8 (wooden) + 45 (plastic) = 53

The final answer is: 53"
"To find the total cost of the kitten, we need to add up the cost of spaying, vaccines, and the broken vases.

The cost of spaying the kitten is $200.
The cost of 3 vaccines is 3 x $20 = $60.
The cost of 4 broken vases is 4 x $12 = $48.

Now, let's add up the costs: $200 (spaying) + $60 (vaccines) + $48 (broken vases) = $308.

The final answer is: $308"
"To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we first need to calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week and then per month.

The total number of roses ordered per week is 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered per month is 65 * 4 = 260 roses.

Ford grows 40 roses every week, so the total number of roses he grows per month is 40 * 4 = 160 roses.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the total number of roses he grows per month from the total number of roses ordered per month: 260 - 160 = 100 roses.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the remaining amount in Katina's savings account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount removed from the account and subtract it from the initial amount.

Since Katina removes $100 every month, and there are 12 months in a year, the total amount removed in a year is $100 * 12 = $1200.

In 2 years, the total amount removed will be $1200 * 2 = $2400.

Now, subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount: $3000 - $2400 = $600.

The final answer is: $600"
"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost.

Total revenue = Number of sandwiches sold * Price per sandwich
Total revenue = 10 sandwiches * $7.00/sandwich = $70.00

Now, let's calculate the cost of bread and cheese per sandwich:
Cost of bread per loaf = $3.00
Number of sandwiches per loaf = 10
Cost of bread per sandwich = $3.00 / 10 sandwiches = $0.30/sandwich

Cost of cheese and condiments per 10 sandwiches = $30.00
Cost of cheese and condiments per sandwich = $30.00 / 10 sandwiches = $3.00/sandwich

Total cost per sandwich = Cost of bread per sandwich + Cost of cheese and condiments per sandwich
Total cost per sandwich = $0.30 + $3.00 = $3.30

Now, let's calculate the total cost for 10 sandwiches:
Total cost = Total cost per sandwich * Number of sandwiches
Total cost = $3.30/sandwich * 10 sandwiches = $33.00

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00

The final answer is: $37.00"
"To find out how much money Kate can make, we need to determine the total number of muffin crayons she can make and then multiply that by the price of each muffin crayon.

First, let's find the total number of crayons Kate has. Since she has 3 boxes of 64 crayons, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of crayons per box:

3 boxes * 64 crayons/box = 192 crayons

Since Kate melts 8 small pieces of crayons together to make one muffin crayon, we need to divide the total number of crayons by 8 to find out how many muffin crayons she can make:

192 crayons / 8 crayons/muffin = 24 muffin crayons

Now, we multiply the number of muffin crayons by the price of each muffin crayon to find out how much money Kate can make:

24 muffin crayons * $1.50/muffin = $36

The final answer is: $36"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the area of the bedroom and then calculate the cost of the new carpet, padding, and installation.

The area of the bedroom is 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet.

The cost of the new carpet is 216 square feet * $12 per square foot = $2592.

The cost of the padding is 216 square feet * $2 per square foot = $432.

The cost of removing the old carpet is 216 square feet * $4 per square foot = $864.

The cost of installing the new carpet is 216 square feet * $34 per square foot = $7344.

The total cost is $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344 = $11332.

The final answer is: $11332"
"To find the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we need to add up the total number of birds he saw over the week and divide it by the number of days.

Total number of birds = 50 (days 1 and 2) + 0 (day 3) + 120 (days 4 and 5) + 20 (day 6) + 90 (day 7)
Total number of birds = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90
Total number of birds = 280

Number of days = 7

Average number of birds per day = Total number of birds / Number of days
Average number of birds per day = 280 / 7
Average number of birds per day = 40

"To find the percentage by which the oven is off, we need to calculate the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature, and then divide it by the set temperature.

The difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature is 468 - 450 = 18.

The percentage by which the oven is off is (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%.

Since the oven is off by 4% for any recipe, we need to find the temperature that is 4% higher than 520 degrees.

Let's call the set temperature x. Then, the actual temperature will be x + (4% of x).

We know that the actual temperature is 4% higher than the set temperature, so we can set up the equation:

x + (4% of x) = 520 + (4% of 520)

To find 4% of x, we multiply x by 0.04. To find 4% of 520, we multiply 520 by 0.04.

x + 0.04x = 520 + 20.8

Combine like terms:

1.04x = 540.8

Divide both sides by 1.04:

x = 520.77

So, Maggie should set the oven to 520.77 degrees."
"To find the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to convert the time of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time as follows:
1 hour = 60 minutes
Adding the 30 minutes, we get:
60 + 30 = 90 minutes

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting the time to minutes:
2 hours = 2 * 60 = 120 minutes
Adding the 5 minutes, we get:
120 + 5 = 125 minutes

Now, we add the time of both movies together:
90 + 125 = 215 minutes

Therefore, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies.

The final answer is: 215"
"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house price and subtract it from Herb's house price.

Herb's house price = $76,000
30% of Herb's house price = 0.3 * $76,000 = $22,800
Juan's house price = Herb's house price - 30% of Herb's house price
= $76,000 - $22,800
= $53,200

Now, we need to find the combined value of the two houses.
Combined value = Herb's house price + Juan's house price
= $76,000 + $53,200
= $129,200

The final answer is: $129,200"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of cups Judy brought is 12, and the total number of cups her friend brought is 40. The total number of dishes Judy brought is 24, and the total number of dishes her friend brought is 44.

To find the total number of utensils (cups and dishes) brought by the two, we add the total number of cups and the total number of dishes: 12 + 40 + 24 + 44 = 120.

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the cost per pair of contacts, we first need to determine the total number of contacts in 2 boxes and the total cost of 2 boxes with the discount.

Since 1 box contains 90 contacts and will last 45 days, the number of contacts per day is 90 / 45 = 2 contacts per day.

In 2 boxes, the total number of contacts is 2 * 90 = 180 contacts.

The total cost of 2 boxes with a 10% discount is 2 * $100.00 * (1 - 0.10) = 2 * $100.00 * 0.90 = $180.00.

Now, to find the cost per pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts: $180.00 / 180 = $1.00 per pair of contacts.

The final answer is: $1.00"
"To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we need to calculate their individual earnings and then find the difference.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, for a total of 3 hours. Her hourly wage is $10, so her total earnings are 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 hours. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, which is 3 * 1 = 3 hours. So, John worked a total of 4 + 3 = 7 hours. His total earnings are 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

"To find the total calories burned, we need to calculate the calories burned during aerobics and running separately and then add them together.

Calories burned during aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories
Calories burned during running: 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories
Total calories burned: 1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we need to find out how many sets of 200 calories are in 1600 calories.

1600 calories / 200 calories = 8

Since she needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, she needs to drink 8 * 100 ml = 800 ml of water.

The final answer is: 800"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G.

We are given that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write the equation:

B + R + G = 4500

We are also given that the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, so we can write:

R = B - 0.01B
R = 0.99B

We are also given that the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so we can write:

G = B + 0.01B
G = 1.01B

Now we can substitute the expressions for R and G into the first equation:

B + (0.99B) + (1.01B) = 4500

Combine like terms:

2.99B = 4500

Divide both sides by 2.99:

B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red jelly beans:

R = 0.99B
R = 0.99(1500)
R = 1485

And we can find the number of green jelly beans:

G = 1.01B
G = 1.01(1500)
G = 1515

Finally, we can find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and the number of red jelly beans:

G - R = 1515 - 1485
G - R = 30

"To find the weight of the Mastiff, we need to start from the Papillon's weight and work our way back. 

The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund. If the Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, then the Dachshund's weight is 2 * 10 = 20 pounds. 

Since the Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, the Papillon's weight is 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.

The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff's weight is 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.

The cost of the boots on eBay is $13. 
The shipping cost on eBay is twice as much as on Amazon, which is 2 * $4 = $8.

So, the total cost of the boots on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

The total cost of the boots on Amazon is $16 + $4 = $20.

To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we subtract the cost on Amazon from the cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

"To solve this problem, we can use exponential growth. The initial height of the beanstalk is 4 feet, and it doubles every day. We want to find the number of days it takes for the beanstalk to be taller than 20 feet.

Let's start by setting up an equation. Let x be the number of days it takes for the beanstalk to be taller than 20 feet. The height of the beanstalk after x days can be represented as 4(2^x), since it doubles every day.

We want to find the smallest value of x such that 4(2^x) > 20.

We can start by trying different values of x:

- x = 1: 4(2^1) = 8 (not greater than 20)
- x = 2: 4(2^2) = 16 (not greater than 20)
- x = 3: 4(2^3) = 32 (greater than 20)

Therefore, it will take 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to first find out how many grams of protein he gets per day. 

Since a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein, we can find the protein percentage in a cup of mushrooms by dividing the protein by the weight: 

Protein percentage = (3 grams / 100 grams) * 100 = 3%

Now, we know that John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day. To find out how many grams of protein he gets per day, we can multiply the weight of mushrooms he eats by the protein percentage:

Protein per day = 200 grams * 3% = 200 * 0.03 = 6 grams

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can multiply the protein per day by 7 to find out how many grams of protein John gets per week:

Protein per week = 6 grams * 7 = 42 grams

Subtracting 2x from both sides gives us:

-x = -10

Dividing both sides by -1, we get:

x = 10

So Jerry is currently 10 years old. 

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

x + 3 = 10 + 3
x + 3 = 13

"Let's denote the smallest angle as x. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is 2x. The other angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is 3x.

We know that the sum of the three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:

One angle is 2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees
The other angle is 3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees

The largest angle is 90 degrees.

- 14 nickels = 14 * 5 = 70 cents
- 15 pennies = 15 * 1 = 15 cents

Now, let's add up the total amount of money Colby has:
Total money = 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs a nickel (5 cents), we can divide the total money by the cost of one gumball:

The discounted price of the shirt is $25 - $7.50 = $17.50.

The discount on the shorts is 30% of $35, which is 0.3 * $35 = $10.50. 
The discounted price of the shorts is $35 - $10.50 = $24.50.

The total cost of the outfit is $17.50 + $24.50 = $42.

Since sales tax is included, we don't need to calculate it separately. 

Joe started with $50, and the total cost of the outfit is $42. 

The amount of money Joe will have left after the purchase is $50 - $42 = $8.

The final answer is: $8"
"To find the total amount of butter needed, we first need to calculate the amount of butter required for one day and then multiply it by 7 (the number of days in a week).

Since it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants, and Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants per day, we need to find the amount of butter required for 4 dozen croissants.

1 dozen croissants = 1/4 pound of butter
4 dozen croissants = 4 * (1/4) = 1 pound of butter per day

Since Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants for 7 days, we multiply the daily amount by 7:

1 pound/day * 7 days = 7 pounds

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the cost of repaving Lewis' street, we need to multiply the cost per meter by the length of the street. 

Cost per meter: $194
Length of Lewis' street: 490 meters

Cost to repave Lewis' street = Cost per meter * Length of Lewis' street
= $194 * 490
= $95,060

Now, to find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's, we need to calculate the cost of repaving Monica's street and then subtract it from the cost of repaving Lewis' street.

Cost to repave Monica's street = Cost per meter * Length of Monica's street
= $194 * 150
= $29,100

Now, let's subtract the cost of repaving Monica's street from the cost of repaving Lewis' street:
Cost difference = Cost to repave Lewis' street - Cost to repave Monica's street
= $95,060 - $29,100
= $65,960

"To find the total amount of meat consumed, we need to calculate the amount eaten by the first, second, and third players.

The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.

The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so the total amount eaten by the second player is 8 ounces.

The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, the third player ate 16 ounces of meat.

Now, let's add up the total amount of meat consumed by the team:

6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces

The total amount of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces.

Total number of seats = Number of rows * Number of seats per row
Total number of seats = 4 * 18
Total number of seats = 72

One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators. 
Number of seats occupied by administrators = (1/4) * Total number of seats
Number of seats occupied by administrators = (1/4) * 72
Number of seats occupied by administrators = 18

Remaining seats after administrators = Total number of seats - Number of seats occupied by administrators
Remaining seats after administrators = 72 - 18
Remaining seats after administrators = 54

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents. 
Number of seats occupied by parents = (1/3) * Remaining seats after administrators
Number of seats occupied by parents = (1/3) * 54
Number of seats occupied by parents = 18

Remaining seats after parents = Remaining seats after administrators - Number of seats occupied by parents
Remaining seats after parents = 54 - 18

"To find out how many pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day, we need to calculate how many pieces he uses throughout the day.

Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he spends 8 hours at school. So, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

He also chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner, so that's 2 more pieces.

In total, Jim chews 4 + 2 = 6 pieces of gum during the day.

He starts with 20 pieces of gum and gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. To find out how many pieces he has left, we need to subtract the pieces he used from the total and then divide the remaining pieces by 2.

20 - 6 = 14 pieces remaining
14 / 2 = 7 pieces given to his sister
14 - 7 = 7 pieces remaining

So, Jim has 7 pieces of gum left at the end of the day.

"To find out how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to calculate the difference between the required height (4 feet) and Adam's current height (40 inches), and then divide that by his growth rate (2 inches per year).

First, let's convert the required height from feet to inches: 1 foot = 12 inches, so 4 feet = 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Now, let's calculate the difference between the required height and Adam's current height: 48 inches - 40 inches = 8 inches.

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we can divide the difference by his growth rate to find out how many years it will take for him to reach the required height: 8 inches / 2 inches/year = 4 years.

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To find out how much James made, we need to calculate the profit from selling the cars, then apply his commission.

First, let's find the total cost of the cars: 
10 cars * $25,000 = $250,000

The company paid 30% of the cost to acquire the cars, so the amount they paid is:
$250,000 * 0.3 = $75,000

The profit from selling the cars is the selling price minus the cost:
$250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000

James gets a 10% commission on the profit:
$175,000 * 0.1 = $17,500

So, James made $17,500."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that 25% of the 100 riders can stay upright on the wave. To find the number of riders who can stay upright, we multiply 100 by 0.25 (which is 25% expressed as a decimal).

100 * 0.25 = 25

So, 25 riders can stay upright on the wave.

Next, we are told that 60% of these 25 riders are women. To find the number of women who can stay upright, we multiply 25 by 0.6 (which is 60% expressed as a decimal).

25 * 0.6 = 15

Since the remaining riders who can stay upright are men, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright.

25 - 15 = 10

Therefore, 10 men can stay upright on the wave.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total price for all three jewels, we need to find the prices of the gold and silver jewels first.

Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, and the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond jewel, we can calculate the price of the gold jewel as follows:

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * Price of diamond jewel
= (4/5) * $2000
= $1600

The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold, so we can calculate the price of the silver jewel as follows:

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
= $1600 - $400
= $1200

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

"To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to determine the number of each type of stamp and add them together.

Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.

He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so the number of truck stamps is 16 + 3 = 19.

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so the number of rose stamps is 19 - 9 = 10.

Now, we add the number of each type of stamp together: 16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45.

The final answer is: 45"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the relative speed between Bob and Tom, and then use that to calculate the time it will take for Tom to catch up.

Since Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour and Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour, the relative speed between them is the difference in their speeds, which is 70 - 55 = 15 miles per hour.

The distance between them is 75 miles. To find the time it will take for Tom to catch up, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Relative Speed

Plugging in the values, we get:

Time = 75 miles / 15 miles per hour

Time = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"To find out how many fish Tommy caught, we need to first determine how many fish Darren caught. Since Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish, we can calculate Darren's catch by subtracting 6 from Naomi's catch.

Darren's catch = Naomi's catch - 6
Darren's catch = 17 - 6
Darren's catch = 11

Now that we know Darren caught 11 fish, we can find out how many fish Tommy caught by adding 3 to Darren's catch, since Tommy caught 3 more than Darren.

Tommy's catch = Darren's catch + 3
Tommy's catch = 11 + 3
Tommy's catch = 14

"To find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to determine the maximum number of classes he can attend without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Let's denote the number of classes Manny can miss as 'x'. Since there are 10 total classes, the number of classes he will attend is 10 - x.

The total cost of the classes is $60. If each class costs $10, then the total cost of the classes he attends is 10(10 - x).

Since the total cost is $60, we can set up the equation:

10(10 - x) = 60

Expanding the equation, we get:

100 - 10x = 60

Subtracting 100 from both sides, we get:

-10x = -40

Dividing both sides by -10, we get:

x = 4

So, Manny can miss 4 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total weekly production for the two, we first need to determine how many customers each of them can process in a week. 

Since Jewel processes 50 customers per day, in a week (7 days), she would process 50 * 7 = 350 customers.

Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, so she would process twice the number of customers Jewel does in a day. Therefore, Julie processes 2 * 50 = 100 customers per day.

In a week, Julie would process 100 * 7 = 700 customers.

The total weekly production for the two would be the sum of their individual weekly production: 350 (Jewel) + 700 (Julie) = 1050 customers.

The final answer is: 1050"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote the distance Lynn ran as x.

Since Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, Reggie's distance is x + 3.

We are also given that Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran. Paisley ran 4 miles, so Reggie's distance is 5 * 4 = 20 miles.

Now we can set up an equation: x + 3 = 20.

To solve for x, we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation: x = 20 - 3.

x = 17.

The cost of four apples is $5.20, so the cost of one apple is $5.20 / 4 = $1.30. 

The cost of three oranges is $3.30, so the cost of one orange is $3.30 / 3 = $1.10.

Now, we can find the total cost of 5 apples: 5 * $1.30 = $6.50.

Next, we can find the total cost of 5 oranges: 5 * $1.10 = $5.50.

Finally, we can add the cost of the apples and oranges to find the total cost: $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.

The total cost for Clyde will be $12.00."

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add them to the base price.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade costs $7,500.

The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of the leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of the running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the features and the base price:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, Fishio received 2000 likes on her photo.

Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times as many as the initial number of likes. 
So, the number of likes after 3 weeks = 70 * 2000 = 140000.

Now, she received 20000 more new likes recently. 
So, the total number of likes = 140000 + 20000 = 160000.

The final answer is: 160000"
"To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost of the pomegranates on each day and then subtract the two amounts.

On the first day, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, but she got a $2 discount. So, the total cost is:

20 pomegranates * $20 = $400
Discount: $2
Total cost = $400 - $2 = $398

On the second day, the price of each pomegranate is $30, and there's a 10% discount on the total cost. So, the total cost is:

20 pomegranates * $30 = $600
Discount: 10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
Total cost = $600 - $60 = $540

Now, let's find the difference between the two total costs:

Difference = $540 - $398 = $142

The final answer is: $142"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote the total sales from green hats in the first month as G. Since the sales from red hats were half the total amount she earned from selling green hats, the sales from red hats in the first month are G/2.

We know that the total sales from red hats in the first month were $400, so we can set up the equation:

G/2 = 400

To find the total sales from green hats in the first month, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

G = 400 * 2
G = 800

Now we know that the total sales from green hats in the first month were $800.

The total sales in the first month are the sum of the sales from red and green hats:

Total sales in the first month = G + G/2
= 800 + 400
= 1200

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. So, the sales in the second month are:

Sales in the second month = (3/4) * 1200
= 900

The total sales in two months are the sum of the sales in the first and second months:

Total sales in two months = 1200 + 900
= 2100

The final answer is: $2100"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the number of paid hours and the cost for each hour.

James hired the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. However, he gets 1 hour free, so he only paid for 3 hours.

The first paid hour costs $15. Each subsequent hour costs twice the previous hour, so the second hour costs $15 * 2 = $30, and the third hour costs $30 * 2 = $60.

The total cost is the sum of the costs for each hour: $15 + $30 + $60 = $105.

The final numerical answer is: $105"
"To find out how many dollars were withheld from Sally's wage, we need to calculate the difference between her expected wage and the actual amount in her account.

First, let's find out how much money Sally should have in her account if she received her full wage. Since her weekly wage is $300, and her account held $200 at the start of the week, the total amount she should have in her account is:

$200 (initial amount) + $300 (expected wage) = $500

However, her account now holds $420. To find out how much was withheld, we subtract the actual amount from the expected amount:

$500 (expected amount) - $420 (actual amount) = $80

So, $80 was withheld from Sally's wage.

The final answer is: $80"
"To find out how many deviled egg halves Lori's guests will eat, we multiply the number of guests by the number of deviled egg halves each guest will eat. 

Number of guests: 16
Number of deviled egg halves per guest: 3

Total deviled egg halves: 16 * 3 = 48

Since Lori needs 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves, we need to find out how many deviled egg halves she needs to make in total. 

Total deviled egg halves needed: 48

Now, we divide the total deviled egg halves needed by 2 to find out how many whole eggs Lori needs.

Total deviled egg halves needed: 48
Eggs per 2 deviled egg halves: 1

Total eggs needed: 48 / 2 = 24

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens of eggs Lori needs.

Total eggs needed: 24
Eggs per dozen: 12

Dozens of eggs needed: 24 / 12 = 2

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many pages Shiela has left to write, we need to calculate 2/3 of the total pages, since she has already finished 1/3 of the paper.

Let's break it down:

Total pages = 15
Pages already written = 1/3 * 15 = 5

Pages left to write = Total pages - Pages already written
= 15 - 5
= 10

So, Shiela has 10 pages left to write.

"To find out how many days it will take Mike to finish reading the book, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he plans to read per day.

Total number of pages = 200
Pages read per day = 10

Number of days to finish reading = Total number of pages / Pages read per day
= 200 / 10
= 20

Since Mike has 30 days to complete the assignment, we need to subtract the number of days it will take him to finish reading from the total number of days.

Days before the deadline = Total number of days - Number of days to finish reading
= 30 - 20
= 10

"To find the total cost of the plane for the first year, we need to calculate the cost of the plane itself, the cost of renting the hanger, and the cost of fuel.

The cost of the plane is $150,000.

The cost of renting the hanger is $5000 per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total cost of renting the hanger for the first year is $5000 * 12 = $60,000.

The cost of fuel is twice the cost of renting the hanger, which is $5000 * 2 = $10,000 per month. The total cost of fuel for the first year is $10,000 * 12 = $120,000.

The total cost of getting and maintaining the plane for the first year is the sum of the cost of the plane, the cost of renting the hanger, and the cost of fuel: $150,000 + $60,000 + $120,000 = $330,000.

The final answer is: $330,000"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. It took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice.
2. It took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, so pork took 30 + 20 = 50 minutes to cook.
3. Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. Half of 80 is 40 minutes.

Now, let's add up the cooking times for all the food: 
- Rice: 30 minutes
- Pork: 50 minutes
- Beans: 40 minutes

Total cooking time = 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes

"To find the cost difference, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture and then subtract the cost of the second mixture from the cost of the first mixture.

For the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- Cost of almonds: 1/2 pound * $10/pound = $5
- Cost of walnuts: 1/3 pound * $15/pound = $5
- Total cost of the first mixture: $5 + $5 = $10

For the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- Cost of almonds: 1/5 pound * $10/pound = $2
- Cost of walnuts: 1/3 pound * $15/pound = $5
- Total cost of the second mixture: $2 + $5 = $7

Now, we subtract the cost of the second mixture from the cost of the first mixture:
$10 - $7 = $3

"Let's denote the number of sheep as S and the number of geese as G. Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, we can set up the following equation based on the total number of legs:

4S + 2G = 70

We are also given that the total number of animal heads is 20, which means the sum of the number of sheep and geese is 20:

S + G = 20

We can solve this system of equations to find the number of sheep. First, we can multiply the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of G in both equations the same:

2S + 2G = 40

Now, we can subtract this equation from the first equation to eliminate G:

(4S + 2G) - (2S + 2G) = 70 - 40
2S = 30

Divide both sides by 2:

S = 15

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee and the cost of the donut.

The normal brand of coffee costs $5 per pound. Since Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day, a week's worth of coffee would be 7 pounds. 

The more expensive brand costs 20% more than the normal brand. To find the cost of the more expensive brand, we need to calculate 20% of $5 and add it to $5.

20% of $5 = 0.2 * $5 = $1
Cost of the more expensive brand = $5 + $1 = $6 per pound

Since Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day, a week's worth of the more expensive brand would be 7 pounds. 

Cost of a week's worth of the more expensive brand = 7 * $6 = $42

The cost of the donut is $2.

Total cost = Cost of a week's worth of the more expensive brand + Cost of the donut
Total cost = $42 + $2
Total cost = $44

Total newspapers delivered = 600
Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers delivered - (Newspapers delivered to District A + Newspapers delivered to District C)

"To find the total number of hours John spends in the class, we need to multiply the number of hours per class by the number of classes per week and then by the number of weeks.

Number of hours per class: 2 hours
Number of classes per week: 4
Number of weeks: 6

Total hours per week: 2 hours/class * 4 classes/week = 8 hours/week
Total hours for 6 weeks: 8 hours/week * 6 weeks = 48 hours

Since John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time, we need to divide the total hours by 1.5 to find the number of recipes he learns.

Number of recipes = Total hours / 1.5 hours/recipe

"To find the number of math teachers, we first need to find the number of history teachers and then subtract that from the total number of teachers. 

60% of 150 teachers are history teachers. To find 60% of 150, we multiply 150 by 0.6.

60% of 150 = 0.6 * 150 = 90

So, there are 90 history teachers. To find the number of math teachers, we subtract the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers.

Number of math teachers = Total number of teachers - Number of history teachers
= 150 - 90
= 60

Now, we know that each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. To find the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day, we multiply the number of math teachers by the number of hours they sleep per day.

Total time math teachers sleep = Number of math teachers * Hours slept per day
= 60 * 6

"To solve this problem, we need to find the amount of money Kassidy and Rayna have. 

Since Aurelia has $120, and Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, we can calculate Kassidy's money as follows:
Kassidy's money = 3/4 * Aurelia's money
Kassidy's money = 3/4 * 120
Kassidy's money = 90

Now, we know that Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy. So, we can calculate Rayna's money as follows:
Rayna's money = Kassidy's money + 60
Rayna's money = 90 + 60
Rayna's money = 150

Now, we have the money of all three: Aurelia ($120), Kassidy ($90), and Rayna ($150). To find the total amount of money they have, we add their money together:
Total money = Aurelia's money + Kassidy's money + Rayna's money
Total money = 120 + 90 + 150
Total money = 360

If they decide to add their money together and share equally among them, we need to divide the total money by 3 (the number of people):
Shared money per person = Total money / 3
Shared money per person = 360 / 3
Shared money per person = 120

The regular game consists of 4 quarters, each 12 minutes long. So, the total length of the regular game is:
4 quarters * 12 minutes/quarter = 48 minutes

Since the game was extended for 5 minutes, we need to add this to the total length of the regular game:
48 minutes + 5 minutes = 53 minutes

Therefore, the entire game lasted 53 minutes.

"To find the number of good days left in the month, we need to first determine the total number of good days recorded by Christina. We know that she had 12 good days in the first 30 days. However, we also know that her first 8 days were good, her second 8 days were bad, and her third 8 days were neutral. This means that the good days in the first 30 days are only the first 8 days.

So, the total number of good days in the first 30 days is 8. 

Now, we are given that the next 3 days were good, neutral, and good. We need to add these 3 days to the total number of good days. 

Total good days = 8 (in the first 30 days) + 3 (in the next 3 days) = 11

However, we are asked to find the number of good days left in the month. Since we are considering the next 3 days as part of the month, we need to subtract these 3 days from the total number of good days.

Good days left in the month = Total good days - 3 = 11 - 3 = 8

"Let's denote the number of books Sally has as 'x'. According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has, which can be expressed as 2x + 3. We are also given that Janey has 21 books. 

We can set up an equation to represent this situation: 2x + 3 = 21.

To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable x. We can do this by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 21 - 3, which simplifies to 2x = 18.

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for x: x = 18 / 2, which simplifies to x = 9.

Therefore, Sally has 9 books.

"To find the number of days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches, we need to first convert the initial height from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now, we know the bamboo grows 30 inches per day and starts at 240 inches. To find the number of days it will take to reach 600 inches, we can subtract the initial height from the target height and divide by the daily growth rate:

600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs, so each dog has 1 toy. When there are 8 more dogs in the shelter, James needs 8 more toys to bring the total number of toys to 12 (4 initial toys + 8 new dogs).

However, when James comes back, there are twice as many more dogs than when he left, which means there are now 8 * 2 = 16 more dogs. Since each dog needs 1 toy, James needs 16 more toys to bring the total number of toys to 28 (12 initial toys + 16 new dogs).

When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs 3 toys. To find the total number of toys James needs, we subtract the 3 toys he no longer needs from the total number of toys he had before: 28 - 3 = 25.

However, we also need to consider the initial 4 toys James had. So, the total number of toys James needs is 25 (toys needed for the dogs) + 4 (initial toys) = 29.

Given that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, we can set up a proportion to find the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes.

Let's set up the proportion: 6 potatoes / 36 hash browns = 96 potatoes / x hash browns

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 6x = 96 * 36

Now, we can solve for x: 6x = 3456

Divide both sides by 6: x = 576

Therefore, 96 potatoes can make 576 hash browns.

Total weight = average weight of an adult * number of adults
Total weight = 80 kg * 9
Total weight = 720 kg

Since the elevator supports a maximum load of 700 kg, we need to find the excess weight by subtracting the maximum load from the total weight.

Excess weight = Total weight - Maximum load
Excess weight = 720 kg - 700 kg
Excess weight = 20 kg

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of cookies Max and Summer have. 

Since Katarina has 68 cookies and she has 5 less than Max, Max must have 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.

Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, but we don't know how many cookies the Cookie Monster has. However, we can express the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has as x. Then, Max has x + 12 cookies.

Since we already know Max has 73 cookies, we can set up the equation x + 12 = 73. Solving for x, we get x = 73 - 12 = 61. So, the Cookie Monster has 61 cookies.

Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, and we know Max has 73 cookies. Therefore, Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Now, we can find the total number of cookies by adding the number of cookies Katarina, Max, and Summer have: 68 + 73 + 96 = 237.

"To find the original length of the dress, we need to work backwards from the final length. 

Let's denote the original length of the dress as 'x'. 

When Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, the new length becomes x + 0.5x = 1.5x.

Then, she adds 20cm to the bottom of the dress, making the final length 1.5x + 20.

We are given that the final design is 140cm long, so we can set up the equation:

1.5x + 20 = 140

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. First, subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

1.5x = 140 - 20
1.5x = 120

Next, divide both sides by 1.5:

x = 120 / 1.5
x = 80

The original length of the dress was 80cm.

"Let's denote the age of the triplet as x. Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, we can denote the age of the other twin as x + 7.

We know that the combined ages of the twins and the triplet are 44. We can set up an equation to represent this:

x + (x + 7) + x = 44

Combine like terms:

3x + 7 = 44

Subtract 7 from both sides:

3x = 37

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 12.33

Since x represents the age of the triplet, and one twin is 7 years older than the triplet, the age of the other twin is x + 7 = 12.33 + 7 = 19.33

However, since the question asks for the age of one of the twins, and we have two possible answers (12.33 and 19.33), we need to determine which one is correct. 

Since the problem states that there is one set of twins and one set of triplets, we can assume that the ages of the twins are equal. Therefore, the age of one of the twins is 19.33.

John has 100 minutes to nap."
"To find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we first need to find the cost of one candy. 

We know that 5 lollipops and 4 candies cost $3.20. Since each lollipop costs $0.40, the total cost of 5 lollipops is 5 * $0.40 = $2. 

Now, we subtract the cost of 5 lollipops from the total cost to find the cost of 4 candies: $3.20 - $2 = $1.20. 

The cost of one candy is $1.20 / 4 = $0.30.

Now, we can find the total cost of 10 lollipops: 10 * $0.40 = $4.

The total cost of 10 candies is 10 * $0.30 = $3.

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $4 + $3 = $7.

The final answer is: $7"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many coins Rong and Neil save in a year and then multiply it by 10 to get the total coins saved in 10 years.

Rong saves 20 coins per month. 
Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, so Neil saves 20 + (2/5 * 20) = 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

In a year, Rong saves 20 * 12 = 240 coins.
In a year, Neil saves 28 * 12 = 336 coins.

In 10 years, Rong will save 240 * 10 = 2400 coins.
In 10 years, Neil will save 336 * 10 = 3360 coins.

The total number of coins they will have in 10 years is 2400 + 3360 = 5760.

The final answer is: 5760"
"To find the total bill, we first need to calculate the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check. 

The cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40. 

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, but we don't know the total bill yet. Let's call the total bill 'x'. The heartworm check is 0.6x.

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check: x = $40 + 0.6x.

To find the value of x, we need to isolate it. Subtract 0.6x from both sides: 0.4x = $40.

Now, divide both sides by 0.4: x = $100.

So the total bill is $100. The heartworm check is 60% of $100, which is 0.6 * $100 = $60.

The total cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check is $40 + $60 = $100.

John brought $125 with him, so he leaves with $125 - $100 = $25.

The final answer is: $25"

The comforter has 14 red squares. 
The comforter has 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.
The comforter has 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.
The comforter has 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.

The total number of squares is 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68.

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

The final answer is: 68"
"To find out how many chairs Mia needs, we first need to determine the total number of chairs she has. Since there are 8 high chairs and the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, we can calculate the number of regular chairs by multiplying 8 by 5.

Number of regular chairs = 8 * 5 = 40

Now, we add the number of high chairs to the number of regular chairs to get the total number of chairs.

Total chairs = 8 (high chairs) + 40 (regular chairs) = 48

Since there will be 42 adults and 15 babies attending, we need to find the total number of people attending. 

Total people = 42 (adults) + 15 (babies) = 57

Since each person needs a chair, we need to find the difference between the total number of people and the total number of chairs.

Chairs needed = Total people - Total chairs = 57 - 48 = 9

Therefore, Mia needs 9 more chairs.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the total points collected by Adam, Betty, Martha, and Tom, and then subtract that from the minimum threshold of 400 points.

Let's start by finding Betty's points. Since Betty collected 30% more points than Adam, we can calculate her points as follows:

Betty's points = Adam's points + (30% of Adam's points)
= 50 + (0.3 * 50)
= 50 + 15
= 65

Now, we know that Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so we can find Tom's points as follows:

Tom's points = Betty's points - 30
= 65 - 30
= 35

We are also given that Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom, so we can find Martha's points as follows:

Martha's points = 3 * Tom's points
= 3 * 35
= 105

Now, we can find the total points collected by the class:

Total points = Adam's points + Betty's points + Martha's points + Tom's points
= 50 + 65 + 105 + 35
= 255

To find the points the class is missing, we subtract the total points from the minimum threshold:

Points missing = Minimum threshold - Total points
= 400 - 255
= 145

"To find the total amount spent on snacks and drinks, we first need to determine the total number of people and the total number of drinks and snacks.

Aiden and 12 of his friends are going to the cinema, and they meet up with 7 more friends there. So, the total number of people is 1 (Aiden) + 12 (his friends) + 7 (additional friends) = 20.

Each seat can hold 1 person, 2 drinks, and 3 snacks. Since there are 20 people, we need to find the total number of drinks and snacks.

Total drinks = 20 people * 2 drinks/person = 40 drinks
Total snacks = 20 people * 3 snacks/person = 60 snacks

The cost of each drink and snack is $2. So, the total cost of drinks is 40 drinks * $2/drinks = $80, and the total cost of snacks is 60 snacks * $2/snack = $120.

The total amount spent on snacks and drinks is $80 (drinks) + $120 (snacks) = $200.

"To find out how many pounds of gravel Gary's truck can carry, we need to first determine how much Gordy's truck can carry. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, and Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds, Gordy's truck can carry 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.

Now, we know that the combined capacity of all three trucks is 11,600 pounds. We already know that Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds and Gordy's truck can carry 4,800 pounds. To find out how much Gary's truck can carry, we subtract the combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity of all three trucks:

11,600 - (4,000 + 4,800) = 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800

So, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.

The final answer is: 2800"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many dumplings each male ate and then add the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry.

First, let's find out how many dumplings each male ate. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, and each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32.

Since there are 6 females and each female ate 3 dumplings, the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.

The total number of dumplings eaten is 32 (by males) + 18 (by females) = 50.

Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is equal to the total number of dumplings eaten, which is 50.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how much money Gerald had initially, we need to determine the total parts in the ratio and Gerald's share. The ratio is 3:2, so the total parts are 3 + 2 = 5.

Gerald's share is 3 out of 5 parts, so we can find his initial amount by multiplying the total amount ($100) by the fraction 3/5.

Gerald's initial amount = (3/5) * $100 = $60

"To find the speed of the turtle, we need to divide the speed of the cat by 5, since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle. 

Speed of the cat = 15 feet/second
Speed of the turtle = Speed of the cat / 5
Speed of the turtle = 15 / 5
Speed of the turtle = 3 feet/second

Now, we can find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds by multiplying its speed by the time.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 3 feet/second * 40 seconds
Distance = 120 feet

"To find the total number of hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we can first determine the amount they need to raise per hour to reach their goal. 

The amount they need to raise per hour is the total goal divided by the number of hours they have already raised money. 

Total goal = $6300
Amount raised in 3 hours = $2100

Amount raised per hour = Total goal - Amount raised in 3 hours
Amount raised per hour = $6300 - $2100
Amount raised per hour = $4200

Now, we can find the total number of hours they need to fundraise by dividing the total goal by the amount raised per hour.

Total hours = Total goal / Amount raised per hour
Total hours = $6300 / $4200
Total hours = 1.5

However, this is the number of hours they need to fundraise after the initial 3 hours. To find the total number of hours, we need to add the initial 3 hours.

Total hours = 1.5 + 3
Total hours = 4.5

"To solve this problem, we need to find the rate at which the factory makes chocolate and vanilla ice cream per hour.

For chocolate ice cream, the factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours. To find the rate per hour, we divide the total quarts by the number of hours:

100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts per hour

For vanilla ice cream, the factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours. To find the rate per hour, we divide the total quarts by the number of hours:

50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts per hour

Now, we need to find the total quarts made in 48 hours. We can multiply the rate per hour for each flavor by the number of hours and add them together:

Chocolate: 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts
Vanilla: 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts

"To find Marcus' total bill, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he ordered and then apply the 10% discount.

First, let's calculate the total cost of each type of item:

- 5 croissants at $3.00 apiece: 5 x $3.00 = $15.00
- 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each: 4 x $2.50 = $10.00
- 3 mini quiches at $4.00 apiece: 3 x $4.00 = $12.00
- 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 apiece: 13 x $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
$15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Since Marcus has a 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of $50.00:
10% of $50.00 = 0.10 x $50.00 = $5.00

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total cost:
$50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many scoops Erin can buy with her $6.00. Since each scoop costs $1.50, we can divide the total amount of money Erin has by the cost of each scoop.

$6.00 ÷ $1.50 = 4

This means Erin can buy 4 scoops of ice cream. However, the deal is buy 2 scoops get 1 free, so we need to consider this when calculating the total number of scoops Erin can get.

If Erin buys 2 scoops, she will get 1 free, so she will have 3 scoops. If she buys 4 scoops, she will get 2 free, so she will have 6 scoops. Since Erin has $6.00, she can buy 4 scoops and get 2 free, which is the best option.

Therefore, Erin should buy 4 scoops of ice cream.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that there are 6 people in total (Bryce and his 5 friends). Each pizza has 12 slices, and there are 6 people, so the total number of slices is 6 * 12 = 72.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 4 people in this group (Bryce and his 3 friends), we can calculate the total number of slices they ate as follows:

(2/3) * (4 * 12) = (2/3) * 48 = 32

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 people in this group, we can calculate the total number of slices they ate as follows:

(3/4) * (2 * 12) = (3/4) * 24 = 18

Now, let's add up the total number of slices eaten by all the friends:

32 + 18 = 50

To find the number of slices left, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices:

72 - 50 = 22

"To find the average time the cat and dog take to eat the sausages, we first need to find the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages.

The cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes. Since the dog eats the same number of sausages in 2/3 the amount of time the cat takes, we can find the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages by multiplying the cat's time by 2/3.

Time taken by the dog = (2/3) * 30 minutes
Time taken by the dog = 20 minutes

Now, we can find the average time taken by both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages by adding their individual times and dividing by 2.

Average time = (30 minutes + 20 minutes) / 2
Average time = 50 minutes / 2
Average time = 25 minutes

Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation, we get:

90 = 9x

Dividing both sides of the equation by 9, we get:

x = 10

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of windows smashed, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed from students' cars and teachers' cars separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of windows smashed from students' cars. There are 64 students' cars with 4 windows each. A quarter of the students' cars' windows are smashed, which is 1/4 * 64 = 16 cars. Since each car has 4 windows, the total number of windows smashed from students' cars is 16 * 4 = 64.

Next, let's find the number of windows smashed from teachers' cars. There are 32 teachers' cars with 2 windows each. Three-fourths of the teachers' cars' windows are smashed, which is 3/4 * 32 = 24 cars. Since each car has 2 windows, the total number of windows smashed from teachers' cars is 24 * 2 = 48.

Now, we add the number of windows smashed from students' cars and teachers' cars to get the total number of windows smashed: 64 + 48 = 112.

The final answer is: 112"
"To find the percentage of blue spools, we need to first find the total number of blue spools and then divide it by the total number of spools, and finally multiply by 100.

Total number of blue spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60

Total number of spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 110

Now, let's calculate the percentage of blue spools:
(60 / 110) * 100 = 54.55%

The final answer is: 54.55"
"To find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we need to calculate the number of people who voted by 16:00 and subtract that from the total number of people.

At 8:00, 2/5 of 5000 people had voted by midday. 
2/5 * 5000 = 2000 people voted by midday.

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. 
The number of people remaining after midday is 5000 - 2000 = 3000.
2/3 * 3000 = 2000 people voted by 16:00.

The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is the total number of people minus the number of people who voted by 16:00.
5000 - (2000 + 2000) = 0 people.

The final answer is: 0"
"To find out how many packs of gum Parker will need, we need to calculate the total number of pieces of gum he will chew in 30 days and then divide that by the number of pieces in a pack.

Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day. To find the total number of pieces he will chew in 30 days, we multiply the number of pieces he chews per day by 30:

4 pieces/day * 30 days = 120 pieces

Now, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces in a pack to find out how many packs he will need:

120 pieces / 15 pieces/pack = 8 packs

"To find the total number of smores needed, we first calculate the number of smores the kids and adults will eat. 

9 kids will eat 9 * 2 = 18 smores.
6 adults will eat 6 * 1 = 6 smores.

Total smores needed = 18 + 6 = 24 smores.

Since each sleeve makes 8 smores, we divide the total smores needed by 8 to find the number of sleeves needed:
24 smores / 8 smores per sleeve = 3 sleeves.

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we divide the number of sleeves needed by 3 to find the number of boxes needed:
3 sleeves / 3 sleeves per box = 1 box.

Therefore, they will need 1 box of graham crackers.

The final answer is: 1"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the ages of Dora's father and mother.

Given that Dora is 15 years old, we can find her father's age by using the information that her father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. 

Let's denote Dora's father's age as F and Dora's age as D. We have the equation: F = 2D + 8. Since Dora is 15, we can substitute D = 15 into the equation to find F.

F = 2(15) + 8
F = 30 + 8
F = 38

Now that we know Dora's father is 38 years old, we can find her mother's age. We are given that her mother is four years younger than her father. 

Let's denote her mother's age as M. We have the equation: M = F - 4. Since F = 38, we can substitute F into the equation to find M.

M = 38 - 4
M = 34

Now that we know Dora's age (15), her father's age (38), and her mother's age (34), we can find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother.

Total combined age = D + F + M
Total combined age = 15 + 38 + 34
Total combined age = 87

The final answer is: 87"

"To find the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying, we need to calculate the weight of each book and add them up.

Cindy has 2 math and science books, so the total weight of these books is 2 x 2 = 4 pounds.

Her French book weighs 4 pounds and her English book weighs 3 pounds.

Her history book weighs twice as much as her English book, so the weight of the history book is 2 x 3 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add up the weights of all the books: 4 (math and science) + 4 (French) + 3 (English) + 6 (history) = 17 pounds.

The total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is 17 pounds.

"To find the number of votes candidate C got, we first need to find the number of votes candidate B got. 

Candidate A got 20% of the votes, which is 0.2 * 100 = 20 votes.

Candidate B got 50% more than candidate A's votes, which is 20 + (50% of 20) = 20 + (0.5 * 20) = 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

The total number of votes is 100. Candidate A and B together got 20 + 30 = 50 votes. 

So, candidate C got 100 - 50 = 50 votes.

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many apples Beck has initially. Since Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, and Boris has 100 apples, we can calculate Beck's initial number of apples as follows:

Beck's initial apples = Boris's apples - 23
Beck's initial apples = 100 - 23
Beck's initial apples = 77

Now, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. So, Beck's new number of apples is:

Beck's new apples = Beck's initial apples + 10
Beck's new apples = 77 + 10
Beck's new apples = 87

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris. Boris still has 100 apples, and Beck has 87 apples. So, the difference is:

Difference = Boris's apples - Beck's new apples
Difference = 100 - 87
Difference = 13

"To find out how many ounces of water Peter has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and then subtract that from the total amount of water available (32 ounces).

For giant cubes: 3 cubes * 4 ounces/cube = 12 ounces
For medium cubes: 7 cubes * 2 ounces/cube = 14 ounces
For small cubes: 8 cubes * 0.5 ounces/cube = 4 ounces

Total water used = 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces

Now, subtract the total water used from the total amount of water available:
32 ounces - 30 ounces = 2 ounces

The final answer is: 2"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of books Steven has, then find the number of books Alice has, and finally compare the number of books Clara and Alice have.

Since Clara has two times as many books as Steven, and Clara has 20 books, we can set up the equation:

2x = 20, where x is the number of books Steven has.

To find x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 20 / 2
x = 10

So, Steven has 10 books.

Since Alice has 6 more books than Steven, we can find the number of books Alice has by adding 6 to the number of books Steven has:

Alice's books = 10 + 6
Alice's books = 16

Now, we can compare the number of books Clara and Alice have:

Clara's books = 20
Alice's books = 16

The difference between Clara's and Alice's books is:

20 - 16 = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the cost of a half-gallon jar first. Since a gallon jar costs $5 and it's $2 more than a half-gallon jar, we can set up the equation:

Gallon jar = Half-gallon jar + $2
5 = Half-gallon jar + 2
Half-gallon jar = 5 - 2
Half-gallon jar = 3

Now that we know the cost of a half-gallon jar, we can find the cost of 16 half-gallon jars:
16 * 3 = 48

Next, we need to find the cost of 10-gallon jars. Since a gallon jar costs $5, we can multiply this by 10:
10 * 5 = 50

Now, we add the cost of 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars to find the total amount of money Cecelia spent:
Total cost = 50 + 48
Total cost = 98

The final answer is: 98"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Total students = 50
- Students who like to bake = 10
- Students who like to play basketball = 5
- Students who like to play music = 2 * (students who like to play basketball) = 2 * 5 = 10

We know that the rest of the students like to either play video games or play music. So, the number of students who like to play video games or music is the total number of students minus the students who like to bake and play basketball.

Students who like to play video games or music = Total students - Students who like to bake - Students who like to play basketball
= 50 - 10 - 5
= 35

Since the number of students who like to play music is 10, the number of students who like to play video games is the total number of students who like to play video games or music minus the number of students who like to play music.

Students who like to play video games = Students who like to play video games or music - Students who like to play music
= 35 - 10
= 25

"To find the number of boys in each class, we first need to find the total number of girls in both classes. Since 40% of the students in each class are girls, and there are 80 students in total, we can set up an equation to represent the situation.

Let x be the number of students in each class. Then, 0.4x is the number of girls in each class. Since there are two classes, the total number of girls is 2 * 0.4x = 0.8x.

We know that the total number of students in both classes is 80, so we can set up the equation:

x + x = 80

Combine like terms:

2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 40

So, there are 40 students in each class.

Now, we need to find the number of boys in each class. Since 40% of the students are girls, 60% are boys. We can find the number of boys in each class by multiplying the number of students in each class by 0.6:

Number of boys in each class = 0.6 * 40
= 24

"To find the profit Mark made, we need to calculate the total cost of the packs and the total value of the cards he got.

The total cost of the packs is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

The total value of the cards he got is $4000 + $1000 + (30 * $50) = $4000 + $1000 + $1500 = $6500.

The total value of the cards is greater than the cost of the packs, so Mark made a profit. To find the profit, we subtract the cost of the packs from the total value of the cards: $6500 - $5400 = $1100.

The final answer is: $1100"
"To find the total cost for each amusement park, we need to calculate the cost for the adults and the cost for the children separately and then add them together.

"To find out how much money the tomato vendor saves a week, we need to first calculate the daily savings and then multiply it by 7.

The vendor used to buy 500 tomatoes a day at $.5 each, so his daily cost was 500 * $.5 = $250.

With the new vendor, he buys the same 500 tomatoes at $.4 each, so his new daily cost is 500 * $.4 = $200.

The daily savings is the difference between the old cost and the new cost: $250 - $200 = $50.

To find the weekly savings, we multiply the daily savings by 7: $50 * 7 = $350.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of marbles Carl and Cal have. 

Since Sean has 56 marbles and he has half as many marbles as Cal, we can find the number of marbles Cal has by multiplying Sean's marbles by 2. 

Cal's marbles = 2 * Sean's marbles
Cal's marbles = 2 * 56
Cal's marbles = 112

Now, we know that Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. 

Carl's marbles = 4 * Sean's marbles
Carl's marbles = 4 * 56
Carl's marbles = 224

To find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have, we add their marbles together.

Total marbles = Carl's marbles + Cal's marbles
Total marbles = 224 + 112
Total marbles = 336

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, Lorraine has 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

1. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
   90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
   Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons from trading small stickers.

2. She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
   50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
   Since each large sticker is worth one large button, she gets 20 large buttons from trading large stickers.

3. She trades the rest of her large stickers (40 - 20 = 20) for small buttons. 
   Since each large sticker is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons from trading large stickers.

Now, let's calculate the total number of buttons she has:
- Small buttons: 27 (from small stickers) + 60 (from large stickers) = 87 small buttons
- Large buttons: 20

Total buttons = 87 (small buttons) + 20 (large buttons) = 107 buttons

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as x. Since the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, the number of votes in favor can be represented as 2x.

We know that the total number of people on the council is 33. Since each person can only vote either for or against the regulation, the sum of the votes in favor and against the regulation must equal 33.

We can set up the equation: x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms: 3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3: x = 11

Now that we know the number of votes against the regulation, we can find the number of votes in favor by multiplying x by 2: 2x = 2(11) = 22

To solve for Total Pomeranians, we can multiply both sides by 3:

Total Pomeranians = 6 * 3
Total Pomeranians = 18

Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, and we now know there are 18 Pomeranians, we can set up the equation:

1. The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250.
2. The first house needs 1/2 of what the second house needs.
3. The third house needs double what the first house needs.

Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house as x. Then, the first house needs x/2 cases, and the third house needs 2*(x/2) = x cases.

Since the total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250, we can set up the equation:

x/2 + x + x = 250

Combine like terms:

3x/2 = 250

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

3x = 500

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 500/3
x = 166.67

Now that we know the second house needs approximately 166.67 cases, we can find the number of cases needed for the third house, which is x = 166.67.

However, since we can't have a fraction of a case, we'll round to the nearest whole number. But in this case, we are looking for the exact number of cases the third house needs, which is x = 166.67."

"To find out how many candy bars Marissa bought for Jimmy, we need to subtract the cost of the ball from the amount of money Marissa had initially. 

Marissa had $80 initially and spent $20 on the ball. 

$80 (initial amount) - $20 (cost of the ball) = $60

Now, we need to find out how many candy bars Marissa can buy with $60, given that each candy bar costs $5.

$60 (remaining amount) / $5 (cost of each candy bar) = 12

So, Marissa bought 12 candy bars for Jimmy.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find out how much money Sam needs to spend, we first need to determine how many kilograms of oranges are required to make 4 liters of juice. Since Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges to make 1 liter of juice, we can multiply this by 4 to find the total amount of oranges needed for 4 liters.

5 kg/orange * 4 liters/orange = 20 kg/oranges

Next, we need to find the total cost of the oranges. Each kilogram of oranges costs $3, so we multiply the total amount of oranges needed by the cost per kilogram.

20 kg/oranges * $3/kg/orange = $60

Therefore, Sam would have to spend $60 to make 4 liters of juice. 

The final answer is: $60"
"To find out how many books Ahmed read, we need to divide the number of books Ezra read by 2, since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed. 

Ezra read 300 books, so Ahmed read 300 / 2 = 150 books.

Now, we need to add the 150 books Ezra decided to read to the total number of books they both read. 

Total books read by Ezra = 300 + 150 = 450 books
Total books read by Ahmed = 150 books

Total books read altogether = 450 + 150 = 600 books

The final answer is: 600"
"To find Tanya's total earnings, we need to calculate her earnings from the hourly rate and the additional daily rate.

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Since she earns $15 per hour, her total earnings from the hourly rate for Monday is 5 hours * $15/hour = $75.

Additionally, she earns $5 per day for teaching more than 3 classes, so she earns $5 for Monday.

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Her total earnings from the hourly rate for Wednesday is 2 hours * $15/hour = $30.

Since she teaches only 2 classes, she does not earn the additional $5 per day.

Now, let's add up her earnings for both days: $75 (Monday) + $5 (Monday) + $30 (Wednesday) = $110.

The final answer is: $110"
"To find the difference in the number of vanilla scents sold compared to the fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of each type of scent sold.

The company sold 5 vanilla scents and there are 4 vanilla scents available, so the total number of vanilla scents sold is 5 * 4 = 20.

The company sold 2 fruity scents and there are 8 fruity scents available, so the total number of fruity scents sold is 2 * 8 = 16.

Now, we need to find the difference between the total number of vanilla scents sold and the total number of fruity scents sold. 

Difference = Total vanilla scents sold - Total fruity scents sold
Difference = 20 - 16
Difference = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total amount of money Bennet makes from selling the eggplants. 

20 eggplants * $3 each = $60

Since Bennet wants to make a total of $135, we need to find out how much more money he needs to make from selling the corn. 

$135 (total) - $60 (from eggplants) = $75

Now, we need to find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for to make $75 from 25 ears of corn. 

Let's call the price of each ear of corn 'x'. Then, the total amount of money he makes from selling the corn is 25x.

We want 25x to be equal to $75, so we can set up the equation:

25x = 75

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 25:

x = 75 / 25
x = 3

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To find the percentage of Tatiana's weekend spent playing soccer, we first need to determine the total time she has available and the time she spends on other activities.

Total time available = 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

Time spent reading = 3 hours

Time spent playing video games = 1/3 of the remaining time
Remaining time = Total time available - Time spent reading
Remaining time = 12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours
Time spent playing video games = 1/3 * 9 hours = 3 hours

Time spent playing soccer = Total time available - Time spent reading - Time spent playing video games
Time spent playing soccer = 12 hours - 3 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours

To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we divide the time spent playing soccer by the total time available and multiply by 100.

Percentage of weekend spent playing soccer = (Time spent playing soccer / Total time available) * 100
= (6 hours / 12 hours) * 100
= 0.5 * 100
= 50%

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how many pencils Anthony kept, we need to follow the steps of the problem.

Initially, Anthony had 50 pencils.

He gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon. To find out how many pencils he gave to Brandon, we multiply 50 by 1/2:
50 * 1/2 = 25 pencils given to Brandon.

Now, Anthony has 50 - 25 = 25 pencils left.

He gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. To find out how many pencils he gave to Charlie, we multiply 25 by 3/5:
25 * 3/5 = 15 pencils given to Charlie.

Now, Anthony has 25 - 15 = 10 pencils left.

So, Anthony kept 10 pencils.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time it takes for him to drive to the museum and back, and then add the time he spends at the museum.

The distance to the museum is 150 miles, and he drives at 75 mph.  To find the time it takes to drive to the museum, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time to drive to the museum = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

Since he drives back, the total time spent driving is 2 hours * 2 = 4 hours.

Adding the time spent at the museum (6 hours), the total time Jack is gone from home is:

Total time = Time driving to the museum + Time driving back + Time at the museum
Total time = 2 hours + 2 hours + 6 hours
Total time = 10 hours

"To find the total number of wheels needed for the toys, we need to calculate the number of wheels required for the cars and the motorcycles separately and then add them together.

For the cars, Henry needs 4 wheels for each of the 57 cars, so the total number of wheels needed for the cars is 4 * 57 = 228.

For the motorcycles, Henry needs 2 wheels for each of the 73 motorcycles, so the total number of wheels needed for the motorcycles is 2 * 73 = 146.

The total number of wheels needed for all the toys is 228 + 146 = 374.

Since Henry has a box with 650 wheels, we can subtract the total number of wheels needed from the total number of wheels available to find the number of wheels left: 650 - 374 = 276.

The final answer is: 276"
"To find the amount you have to pay after a 20% discount, we need to calculate 20% of the original price and subtract it from the original price.

20% of $1000 = 0.20 * 1000 = $200

Now, subtract the discount from the original price:
$1000 - $200 = $800

So, you have to pay $800 after the discount.

The final answer is: $800"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how many movies are in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of movies in series = Total movies / 3
= 600 / 3
= 200

Now, we know that the cost of these series movies is $6 each, but we need to find the cost of the normal movies to proceed. We'll come back to this later.

Next, let's find out how many movies are older movies. Since 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, we first need to find the number of remaining movies after removing the series movies:

Remaining movies = Total movies - Movies in series
= 600 - 200
= 400

Now, we can find the number of older movies:

Number of older movies = 40% of remaining movies
= 0.4 * 400
= 160

Now, we know that the remaining movies (after removing the series and older movies) are normal movies. We can find the number of normal movies as follows:

Number of normal movies = Remaining movies - Older movies
= 400 - 160
= 240

Now, we know that the cost of a normal movie is $10, and the cost of a series movie is $6. We can find the total cost of the series movies as follows:

Total cost of series movies = Number of movies in series * Cost of series movie
= 200 * 6
= 1200

We still need to find the cost of the normal movies. We know that the cost of a normal movie is $10, so we can find the total cost of the normal movies as follows:

Total cost of normal movies = Number of normal movies * Cost of normal movie
= 240 * 10
= 2400

Now, we can find the total cost of all the movies by adding the cost of the series movies and the normal movies:

Total cost = Total cost of series movies + Total cost of normal movies
= 1200 + 2400
= 3600

The final answer is: $3600"

"To find the distance to the vacation spot, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by the Llesis family. 

First, let's find the speed at which they hiked. They drove at an average of 50 miles per hour, and they hiked at an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. 

Half of their driving speed is 50 / 2 = 25 miles per hour. 
5 miles per hour less than that is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

Now, let's calculate the distance they drove. They drove for 6 hours at 50 miles per hour. 
Distance = speed * time = 50 * 6 = 300 miles.

Next, let's calculate the distance they hiked. They hiked for 1.5 hours at 20 miles per hour. 
Distance = speed * time = 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

The total distance to the vacation spot is the sum of the distance they drove and the distance they hiked. 
Total distance = 300 + 30 = 330 miles.

The final answer is: 330"
"To find the difference between Ava's and Emma's scores, we need to calculate their individual scores and then subtract Emma's score from Ava's score.

Let's denote Emma's number of enemies jumped as E, Ava's number of enemies jumped as A, Emma's number of berries collected as B, Ava's number of berries collected as a, Emma's time left on the timer as T, and Ava's time left on the timer as t.

We are given that Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so A = E + 8.
We are given that Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, so a = B + 3.

We are also given that Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, so t = T - 4.

The score for each player is calculated as follows:
Emma's score = 10E + 5B + 30T
Ava's score = 10(A) + 5(a) + 30(t)

Substituting the given values, we get:
Emma's score = 10(E + 8) + 5(B + 3) + 30(T)
Ava's score = 10(E + 8) + 5(B + 3) + 30(T - 4)

Simplifying the expressions, we get:
Emma's score = 10E + 80 + 5B + 15 + 30T
Ava's score = 10E + 80 + 5B + 15 + 30T - 120

Combine like terms:
Emma's score = 10E + 5B + 30T + 95
Ava's score = 10E + 5B + 30T - 105

Now, we need to find the difference between their scores:
Difference = Ava's score - Emma's score
= (10E + 5B + 30T - 105) - (10E + 5B + 30T + 95)
= -200

The final answer is: $\boxed{-200}$"
"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we first need to find the total cost of the two pizzas that are already known. 

The cost of the two known pizzas is 30 dollars each, so the total cost of these two pizzas is 2 * 30 = 60 dollars.

Since the total cost of all four pizzas is 64 dollars, we can subtract the cost of the two known pizzas to find the total cost of the other two pizzas: 64 - 60 = 4 dollars.

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we can divide the total cost of these two pizzas by 2 to find the cost of each: 4 / 2 = 2 dollars.

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of times they ride their bikes on usual days and the number of times they ride on the two extra days.

On usual days, they ride 3 times a day for 5 days. So, the total number of times they ride on usual days is 3 * 5 = 15.

On the two extra days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, which is 2 * 3 = 6 times a day. Since there are two extra days, the total number of times they ride on these days is 6 * 2 = 12.

Now, we add the total number of times they ride on usual days and the extra days to get the total number of times they ride in a week. Total = 15 + 12 = 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as W and the number of orange fish Bob bought as O. 

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After buying W white fish and O orange fish, he had 3 + O orange fish and 4 + W white fish. 

Since he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up the equation: 3 + O = 2(4 + W).

We also know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17, so W + O = 17.

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for W by substituting the expression for O from the second equation into the first equation.

3 + (17 - W) = 2(4 + W)

Expanding the equation, we get:
3 + 17 - W = 8 + 2W

Combine like terms:
20 - W = 8 + 2W

Subtract 2W from both sides:
20 - 3W = 8

Subtract 20 from both sides:
-3W = -12

Divide both sides by -3:
W = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to calculate the total distance he travels in a week and then multiply it by the fuel efficiency and the price of gas.

First, let's calculate the total distance Andy travels in a week. Since he goes to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days a week. The one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles, so the round-trip distance is 5 * 2 = 10 miles per day. 

The total distance traveled in a week is 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.

Now, let's calculate the amount of fuel consumed in a week. The fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, so the amount of fuel consumed is the total distance traveled divided by the fuel efficiency: 50 miles/week / 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week.

Finally, let's calculate the total cost of fuel consumed in a week. The price of gas is $3/gallon, so the total cost is 5 gallons/week * $3/gallon = $15/week.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Carrie had initially and then subtract the amount she spent.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie had initially:

- 10 twenties = 10 x $20 = $200
- 140 quarters = 140 x $0.25 = $35

Total amount of money = $200 + $35 = $235

Carrie spent all the quarters, which is $35, and 3/5 of the twenties. To find 3/5 of the twenties, we multiply $200 by 3/5:

3/5 x $200 = (3/5) x 200 = 3 x 40 = $120

Carrie spent $120 from the twenties and $35 from the quarters, so the total amount she spent is:

Total amount spent = $120 + $35 = $155

"To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we first need to find the total percentage of smart TVs and analog TVs sold. 

One-fourth of the TVs are smart TVs, which is 1/4 = 0.25 or 25% of the total. 
One-eighth of the TVs are analog TVs, which is 1/8 = 0.125 or 12.5% of the total.

The total percentage of smart TVs and analog TVs sold is 25% + 12.5% = 37.5%.

Since the rest of the TVs are OLED, we subtract the total percentage of smart and analog TVs from 100% to find the percentage of OLED TVs sold: 100% - 37.5% = 62.5%.

Now, we can find the number of OLED TVs sold by multiplying the total number of TVs sold (40) by the percentage of OLED TVs sold (62.5% or 0.625): 
40 * 0.625 = 25

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much the temperature drops at night and then determine how many logs Carson needs to burn to raise the temperature back up to 32 degrees.

First, let's find out the temperature at night: 
Temperature at night = Temperature during the day - 33 degrees
Temperature at night = 45 - 33
Temperature at night = 12 degrees

Since the pipes will freeze at 32 degrees, Carson needs to raise the temperature from 12 degrees to 32 degrees. 
Temperature to be raised = 32 - 12
Temperature to be raised = 20 degrees

Each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we divide the temperature to be raised by the temperature each log heats up:
Number of logs = Temperature to be raised / Temperature per log
Number of logs = 20 / 5
Number of logs = 4

The total number of people is 90, and they are divided into 9-person groups. To find the number of groups, we divide the total number of people by the number of people per group:

90 / 9 = 10

So, there are 10 groups in total.

Since 3/5 of the groups brought back seashells, we need to find 3/5 of 10:

3/5 * 10 = 6

This means 6 groups brought back seashells. Each of these groups brought back 2 seashells, so the total number of seashells brought back is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total hours Kris has played and subtract that from the total hours required for the achievement.

First, let's calculate the hours Kris played in the first 2 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, 2 weeks is 2 * 7 = 14 days. If Kris plays for half an hour every day, she plays 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours in the first 2 weeks.

Next, let's calculate the hours Kris played in the next week. If Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week, she plays 7 * 2 = 14 hours in the next week.

Now, let's add the hours Kris played in both periods: 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours.

Since Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement, we subtract the hours she has already played from the total hours required: 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

Therefore, Kris still needs to play 9 hours to earn the achievement.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time.

The first car travels at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel:
Distance = Speed x Time = 60 miles/hour x 2 hours = 120 miles

The second car travels at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel:
Distance = Speed x Time = 70 miles/hour x 2 hours = 140 miles

Since the second car was initially passing the first car, we need to find the distance between them after 2 hours. This is the difference between the distances traveled by the two cars:
Distance between the cars = Distance traveled by the second car - Distance traveled by the first car
= 140 miles - 120 miles
= 20 miles

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total amount James paid, we need to calculate the premium and add it to the cost of the diamond and gold.

The cost of the diamond and gold is $600 + $300 = $900.

The premium is 30% of $900, which is 0.3 x $900 = $270.

The total amount James paid is $900 + $270 = $1170.

The final answer is: $1170"
"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school.

First, let's find the number of students who passed in each grade:

- Third-graders: 340 out of 500 passed
- Fourth-graders: 40 out of 100 passed
- Fifth-graders: The pass rate is twice the fourth-graders', so it's 2 * 40 = 80 out of 100 passed

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who passed:
340 (third-graders) + 40 (fourth-graders) + 80 (fifth-graders) = 460 students passed

Next, let's calculate the total number of students in the school:
500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000 students

Now, we can find the overall pass rate:
(460 students passed / 1000 total students) * 100 = 46%

The final answer is: 46"
"To find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we first need to determine how many square inches of mosaic he can make with the glass chips he has.

Since it takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic, and each bag holds 72 chips, we can calculate the total number of chips Milo has:

2 bags * 72 chips/bag = 144 chips

Now, we need to find out how many square inches of mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips:

144 chips / 12 chips/square inch = 12 square inches

Since the mosaic is three inches tall, we can find the area of the mosaic by multiplying the height by the length:

Area = height * length
12 square inches = 3 inches * length
length = 12 square inches / 3 inches
length = 4 inches

Therefore, Milo can make a mosaic that is 4 inches long.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total amount of tea consumed, we need to calculate the amount of tea each group of students drank and add them together.

Four students drank 1.5 quarts each, so the total amount of tea they drank is 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts.

16 students drank 2 quarts each, so the total amount of tea they drank is 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

The total amount of tea consumed is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 10 quarts of tea left, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is 38 + 10 = 48 quarts.

To convert quarts to gallons, we know that 1 gallon is equal to 4 quarts. So, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party in gallons is 48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to first determine how many candies he has in total. 

Initially, Dale had 100 candies. He sold 150, so he was left with 100 - 150 = -50 candies. However, this is not possible since you can't have a negative number of candies. This means that Dale must have sold more candies than he initially had. 

Let's re-evaluate the situation: Dale initially had 100 candies, sold 150, and then ordered 100 more. So, he now has 100 (initial candies) + 100 (new order) = 200 candies. 

Since he sold 150 candies, he still needs to sell 200 - 150 = 50 candies to sell all of his candy.

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students at the end of each month and then subtract the initial number of students from it.

At the beginning of the year, there are 10 students.

- At the end of January, the number of students doubles, so there are 10 * 2 = 20 students.
- At the end of February, the number of students doubles again, so there are 20 * 2 = 40 students.
- At the end of March, the number of students doubles again, so there are 40 * 2 = 80 students.
- At the end of April, the number of students doubles again, so there are 80 * 2 = 160 students.
- At the end of May, the number of students doubles again, so there are 160 * 2 = 320 students.

Now, let's subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May to find the additional students: 320 - 10 = 310.

The final answer is: 310"
"To find the total number of branches Felix climbed, we need to divide the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch. 

Total money made = $105
Cost per branch = $0.25

Total branches climbed = Total money made / Cost per branch
Total branches climbed = $105 / $0.25
Total branches climbed = 420

Since Felix worked during the week, which has 5 days, we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day.

Average branches per day = Total branches climbed / Number of days
Average branches per day = 420 / 5
Average branches per day = 84

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the total number of petals in the vase, we need to calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers and then subtract the petals that were dropped.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers:

- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 x 5 = 15 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 x 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 x 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 x 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add up the total number of petals: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 petal from each set of flowers, we need to subtract 4 petals (1 from each set) from the total: 101 - 4 = 97 petals

The final answer is: 97"
"To find out how many marshmallows are left in the bag, we need to subtract the total number of marshmallows used and the ones dropped from the initial number of marshmallows.

Total marshmallows used = 9 (John) + 9 (DeSean) = 18
Marshmallows dropped = 3
Total marshmallows used and dropped = 18 + 3 = 21

Initial number of marshmallows = 35
Marshmallows left = 35 - 21 = 14

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, the number of S'mores that can be made with the remaining marshmallows is equal to the number of marshmallows left.

Number of S'mores each kid can have = 14 / 2 = 7

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time each person plays and then determine how many quarters are used.

Jack plays for 4 hours, which is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes. Since he can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter, he uses 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.

One of his friends is significantly worse and can play for half as long as Jack, so they play for 240 / 2 = 120 minutes. This friend uses 120 / 20 = 6 quarters.

The other two friends are significantly better and can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they play for 240 * 1.5 = 360 minutes. Each of them uses 360 / 20 = 18 quarters.

Since there are two friends who play for 360 minutes, they use a total of 2 * 18 = 36 quarters.

The total number of quarters used is 12 (Jack) + 6 (worse friend) + 36 (better friends) = 54 quarters.

The cost of each quarter is $0.25, so the total amount of money used is 54 * 0.25 = $13.50.

The final answer is: $13.50"
"Let's break down the information given:

- The total amount of the scrub is 10 ounces.
- The amount of citrus zest is equal to the amount of fragrance.
- The amount of salt is equal to the amount of sugar.
- The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt.
- The amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest.

Let's denote the amount of citrus zest (and fragrance) as x. Then, the amount of salt (and sugar) is 2x, and the amount of oil is 2 * 2x = 4x.

The total amount of the scrub is the sum of the amounts of all the ingredients: x (citrus zest) + x (fragrance) + 2x (salt) + 2x (sugar) + 4x (oil) = 10 ounces.

Combine like terms: 8x = 10.

Divide both sides by 8: x = 10/8 = 1.25.

Now that we know x, we can find the amount of oil: 4x = 4 * 1.25 = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total amount of money John spent, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows separately and then add them together.

The cost of the goats is 3 x $500 = $1500.
The cost of the cows is 2 x $1500 = $3000.

Now, we add the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows to find the total amount spent: $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

The final answer is: $4500"
"To find out how many more cupcakes Paul needs to buy, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs.

Total cupcakes needed = 63
Cupcakes already have = 8 (chocolate) + 40 (toffee) = 48

Number of cupcakes Paul needs to buy = Total cupcakes needed - Cupcakes already have
= 63 - 48
= 15

The final answer is: 15"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cars Joe has initially, then calculate the number of cars he sells and gives away, and finally subtract the total number of cars he gave away from his initial number of cars.

Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

Joe sells 20% of his cars, which is 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars.

He gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold, which is 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

In total, Joe gives away 8 (sold) + 16 (given away) = 24 cars.

To find out how many cars Joe remains with, we subtract the total number of cars he gave away from his initial number of cars: 40 - 24 = 16.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to first determine the total amount raised by the students. Since the charity raised a total of $175,000 and $50,000 came from organizations, the amount raised by the students is:

$175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000

Now, we know that 20 students raised this amount equally. To find out how much each student raised, we divide the total amount raised by the number of students:

$125,000 ÷ 20 = $6,250

Each student raised $6,250."
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the first day and the second day.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. 

On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she walked on the first day, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

The total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 8 hours + 4 hours = 12 hours.

To convert the total time from hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

12 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 720 minutes.

The final answer is: 720"
"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to first find the total number of cars in the parking lot when he got out of class for the lunch break.

Initially, Hunter counted 50 cars. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, so the total number of cars became 50 + 20 = 70.

When he got out of class for the lunch break, 1/2 of the cars had left. This means that 1/2 of 70 cars had left, so 1/2 * 70 = 35 cars had left.

The number of cars remaining in the parking lot when Hunter got out of class for the lunch break is 70 - 35 = 35.

However, the question asks for the total number of cars he counted during the lunch break. Since 1/2 of the cars had left, the other half remained. Therefore, the total number of cars he counted during the lunch break is also 35.

The final answer is: 35"
"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of tasks he completes in a day and then multiply it by the number of days he works in a week.

John does 30 cycles of work a day, and each cycle has 5 different tasks. So, the total number of tasks he completes in a day is:
30 cycles/day * 5 tasks/cycle = 150 tasks/day

Since each task pays $1.20, the total amount he makes in a day is:
150 tasks/day * $1.20/task = $180/day

John works a full 7-day week, so the total amount he makes in a week is:
$180/day * 7 days = $1260

The final answer is: $1260"
"To find the total points Sasha scored in both games, we need to calculate her points in each game and add them together.

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. 

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points in the first game. 

So, in the second game, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points.

To find the total points Sasha scored in both games, we add her points from each game: 14 + 4 = 18.

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as x. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know that the total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find the number of cards Smendrick has:

Smendrick has 3x = 3(47) = 141 cards

And Becca has 12 more than Smendrick:

Becca has 141 + 12 = 153 cards

"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color of eggs and then add them together.

Cindy had 5 green eggs.

She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.

She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.

She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had (1/3) * 9 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add up the total number of eggs: 5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"To find out how much Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total cost of shipping the book and subtract the refund amount from the purchase price.

First, let's calculate the shipping cost:

Shipping cost per pound: $0.35
Weight of the book: 4 pounds
Shipping cost = 4 pounds * $0.35/pound = $1.40

Shipping cost per mile: $0.08
Distance to the distribution center: 20 miles
Additional shipping cost = 20 miles * $0.08/mile = $1.60

Total shipping cost = $1.40 + $1.60 = $2.00

Now, let's calculate the refund amount:
Refund percentage: 75%
Purchase price of the book: $32
Refund amount = 0.75 * $32 = $24

Now, let's calculate the total amount Milly will lose:
Total amount lost = Total shipping cost - Refund amount
Total amount lost = $2.00 - $24
However, since the refund amount is greater than the shipping cost, we need to adjust the calculation:
Total amount lost = Shipping cost - (Refund amount - Shipping cost)
Total amount lost = $2.00 - ($24 - $2.00)
Total amount lost = $2.00 - $22.00
Total amount lost = -$20.00

However, since the total amount lost is negative, it means that Milly will actually gain $20.00.

The final answer is: $20"
"To find out how much money Mulan has left, we need to calculate the total amount of money she spent and subtract it from the initial amount she had, including the money her father gave her.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Mulan had initially: $40 (initial money) + $100 (money from her father) = $140.

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money she spent: 2 pairs of jeans at $30 each = 2 x $30 = $60, and a bag for $20. So, the total amount spent is $60 + $20 = $80.

Now, let's subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $140 - $80 = $60.

Mulan has $60 left."
"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the production for the first three weeks and then determine the pattern.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.

In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.

In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Now, let's calculate the total production for the first three weeks: 
8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in a month, we can find the production for the fourth week by subtracting the total production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production:
50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000

The final answer is: 14,000"
"To find the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends on TikTok in a week and then multiply it by 4.

First, let's calculate the time she spends on TikTok in a week:

1. Time spent recording videos: 18 videos * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes
2. Time spent writing songs: 2 hours = 120 minutes
3. Time spent doing makeup: 15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = 90 minutes

Total time spent on TikTok in a week = 72 minutes + 120 minutes + 90 minutes = 282 minutes

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly time by 4:

Total time spent on TikTok in a month = 282 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 1128 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

1128 minutes / 60 = 18.8 hours

The final answer is: 1128"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the initial installation and the cost of the additional items.

The initial installation includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. The cost of the initial installation is $129.00.

Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures that she needs installed. Since the initial installation already includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, and 1 chandelier, we need to subtract these from the total number of items she has:

- Mirrors: 6 - 4 = 2
- Chandeliers: 2 - 1 = 1
- Pictures: 20 - 10 = 10

The number of additional items is 2 mirrors, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. The cost of the additional items is $15.00 per item, so the total cost of the additional items is:

2 (mirrors) * $15.00 = $30.00
1 (chandelier) * $15.00 = $15.00
10 (pictures) * $15.00 = $150.00

The total cost of the additional items is $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00.

The total cost is the sum of the initial installation and the cost of the additional items: $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00

The final answer is: $324.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much money Anthony has saved, and then calculate 40% more than that amount.

Eva has saved $20.00. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, so Anthony has saved $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.

Since Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony, we need to find 40% of $30.00 and add it to $30.00. 

40% of $30.00 is 0.4 x $30.00 = $12.00. 

So, Roy has saved $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

The final answer is: $42.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the ratio of Naruto's lifting ability to Pompei's lifting ability. 

First, we know that Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift 12 inches. 

Next, Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Then, Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we need to convert 480 inches to feet by dividing by 12.

480 / 12 = 40 feet.

"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has after receiving her payment and her mom's contribution.

First, let's calculate the price of the new laptop after trading in her old one: 
$600 - $200 = $400

Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job and her mom gave her $80, so she has a total of:
$150 + $80 = $230

Since Erika now only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, we can set up an equation to find out how much money she has in her purse:
Let x be the amount of money Erika has in her purse.
x + $230 = $400 + $50

Combine like terms:
x + $230 = $450

Subtract $230 from both sides:
x = $220

For 3 large apples, each sliced into 5 pieces, the total number of slices is 3 * 5 = 15.

For 5 small apples, each sliced into 3 pieces, the total number of slices is 5 * 3 = 15.

The total number of slices from both large and small apples is 15 + 15 = 30.

Since Adam eats 15 slices, the number of slices left is 30 - 15 = 15.

"To find out how many cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to calculate the total amount of milk the farmer currently produces with 3 cows. 

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the total amount of milk produced by 3 cows is:
3 cows * 5 liters/cow = 15 liters/day

Now, we need to find out how many cows are needed to produce 25 liters of milk a day. Let's denote the number of additional cows needed as x. The total number of cows will be 3 + x.

The total amount of milk produced by (3 + x) cows is:
(3 + x) * 5 liters/cow = 25 liters/day

Now, we can solve for x:
(3 + x) * 5 = 25
3 * 5 + x * 5 = 25
15 + 5x = 25
5x = 25 - 15
5x = 10
x = 10 / 5
x = 2

So, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the unused portion of each glue stick and add them together.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, which is 1/6 of 12 millimeters. To find this, we multiply 12 by 1/6:
12 * (1/6) = 12/6 = 2 millimeters

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, which is 2/3 of 12 millimeters. To find this, we multiply 12 by 2/3:
12 * (2/3) = 24/3 = 8 millimeters

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, which is 1/2 of 12 millimeters. To find this, we multiply 12 by 1/2:
12 * (1/2) = 12/2 = 6 millimeters

Now, we add the unused portions of the glue sticks together:
2 + 8 + 6 = 16 millimeters

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 16 millimeters.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much money Gabriel still needs, we need to calculate the total amount he has and subtract it from the total cost of the items he wants to buy.

Gabriel has $5000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200, so he has a total of $5000 + $200 = $5200.

The total cost of the items he wants to buy is $10000 (car) + $800 (phone) = $10800.

Now, let's subtract the amount Gabriel has from the total cost: $10800 - $5200 = $5600.

So, Gabriel still needs $5600 to buy the car and the phone.

The final answer is: $5600"
"To find the change Thea got, we need to subtract the cost of the hat from the total amount she gave the craftsman. 

First, let's calculate the total amount she gave the craftsman: 4 * $20 = $80.

Now, let's subtract the cost of the hat from the total amount: $80 - $70 = $10.

The change Thea got is $10."
"To find out how much money Craig has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent and subtract it from the initial amount.

Craig has 2 twenty-dollar bills, which is 2 x $20 = $40.

He buys 6 squirt guns for $2 each, so the total cost of squirt guns is 6 x $2 = $12.

He also buys 3 packs of water balloons for $3 each, so the total cost of water balloons is 3 x $3 = $9.

The total amount he spent is $12 + $9 = $21.

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $40 - $21 = $19.

The final answer is: $19"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so the number of socks Jack has is 60 / 2 = 30.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has 2 * 30 = 60 socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:
Total socks = Jack's socks + Peter's socks = 30 + 60 = 90
Total dishes = Jack's dishes + Peter's dishes = 60 + 30 = 90

The total number of socks and dishes they have together is 90 + 90 = 180."
"To find the number of students good at math, we need to consider the total number of students and the number of students good at both subjects. 

Let's denote the number of students good at both math and English as x. We know that the total number of students is 20, and the number of students good at math only is 5, and the number of students good at English only is 8.

We can set up the equation: 5 (math only) + 8 (English only) + x (both) = 20 (total)

Simplifying the equation, we get: 13 + x = 20

Subtracting 13 from both sides, we get: x = 7

This means that 7 students are good at both math and English. To find the total number of students good at math, we need to add the number of students good at math only (5) and the number of students good at both subjects (7).

Total number of students good at math = 5 (math only) + 7 (both) = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total time available for performances, we need to subtract the intermission time from the total concert time. 

Total concert time = 2 hours = 2 * 60 minutes = 120 minutes
Intermission time = 10 minutes
Time available for performances = Total concert time - Intermission time = 120 - 10 = 110 minutes

Each group takes 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes to perform and exit. 

Number of groups = Time available for performances / Time per group = 110 / 10 = 11

The final answer is: 11"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand that it's a simple interest scenario. The interest rate is 3/4 of the original amount per year, which can be expressed as 0.75x, where x is the original amount.

The interest earned in the first year is 0.75 * $300 = $225.
The total amount after the first year is $300 + $225 = $525.

In the second year, the interest rate is 0.75 * $525 = $393.75.
The total amount after the second year is $525 + $393.75 = $918.75.

In the third year, the interest rate is 0.75 * $918.75 = $688.0625.
The total amount after the third year is $918.75 + $688.0625 = $1606.8125.

The final answer is: $1606.81"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of white shirts with no collars and the number of floral shirts with no buttons.

First, let's find the number of white shirts with collars. Since half of the white shirts have collars, we can calculate this as:

40 (total white shirts) * 0.5 (half of the shirts have collars) = 20 white shirts with collars

Now, we can find the number of white shirts with no collars by subtracting the number of white shirts with collars from the total number of white shirts:

40 (total white shirts) - 20 (white shirts with collars) = 20 white shirts with no collars

Next, let's find the number of floral shirts with buttons. We are given that 20 of the floral shirts have buttons.

Now, we can find the number of floral shirts with no buttons by subtracting the number of floral shirts with buttons from the total number of floral shirts:

50 (total floral shirts) - 20 (floral shirts with buttons) = 30 floral shirts with no buttons

Finally, we need to find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars:

30 (floral shirts with no buttons) - 20 (white shirts with no collars) = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how much the farmer will earn, we need to determine the number of trays he can fill with 900 eggs. 

Since each tray holds 30 eggs, we can divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs per tray to find the number of trays:

900 eggs / 30 eggs per tray = 30 trays

Now, we can multiply the number of trays by the price per tray to find the total earnings:

30 trays * $2.5 per tray = $75

"To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we need to first determine the number of goats sold from each farm and then subtract that from the initial number of goats in each farm.

From Farm X, Mr. Smith sold 10 goats. 
From Farm Y, he sold twice as many goats as from Farm X, which is 2 * 10 = 20 goats.

Now, let's calculate the number of goats left in each farm:
- Farm X: 55 - 10 = 45 goats
- Farm Y: 45 - 20 = 25 goats

To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the number of goats left in each farm:
45 (Farm X) + 25 (Farm Y) = 70 goats

The final answer is: 70"
"To find the average cost of each pair of shoes, we need to divide the total amount spent on shoes per year by the number of pairs bought per year.

First, let's find the number of pairs James buys per year. Since he buys 2 pairs of shoes a month, and there are 12 months in a year, he buys 2 * 12 = 24 pairs of shoes per year.

Now, we can divide the total amount spent on shoes per year ($2640) by the number of pairs bought per year (24) to find the average cost per pair:

Average cost per pair = Total amount spent per year / Number of pairs bought per year
= $2640 / 24

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food, then subtract the discount for the red food.

The cost of 3 baskets of green food is 3 * $25 = $75.

The cost of 3 baskets of red food is 3 * $18 = $54.

The total cost before discount is $75 + $54 = $129.

Since you get $2 off for each basket of red food, the total discount is 3 * $2 = $6.

The total cost after discount is $129 - $6 = $123.

The final numerical answer is: $123"
"To find the time it takes to clean one-half of the rooms, we first need to determine the number of rooms that is half of 90. 

90 / 2 = 45 rooms

Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, we multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room.

45 rooms * 20 minutes/room = 900 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours

"To find the total number of homes built over the next three years, we need to calculate the number of homes built in each year and then add them together.

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will double the total number of homes built in the first two years, which is 12 + 36 = 48 homes. Then, they will double this amount, so 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

Now, let's add the number of homes built in each year: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144 homes.

The total number of homes built over the next three years is 144.

The final answer is: 144"
"Let's denote my age as 'x'. Since I am three years younger than my brother, my brother's age is x + 3. My sister is 2 years younger than me, so her age is x - 2.

My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, which can be expressed as 3(x + 3) - 1.

The sum of all our ages is 87, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + 3(x + 3) - 1 = 87.

Combine like terms: 5x + 10 + 3x - 1 = 87.

Combine like terms again: 8x + 9 = 87.

Subtract 9 from both sides: 8x = 78.

Divide both sides by 8: x = 9.75.

Since age cannot be a fraction, we need to find the closest integer that satisfies the equation. However, in this case, we can see that x = 9.75 is not a valid solution because it doesn't fit the given conditions. We need to re-examine the equation.

Let's re-examine the equation: 8x + 9 = 87.

Subtract 9 from both sides: 8x = 78.

Divide both sides by 8: x = 9.75.

Since x = 9.75 is not a valid solution, we can try to find the closest integer that satisfies the equation. However, we can see that x = 9 is not a solution because it doesn't fit the given conditions.

Let's try x = 10: 8(10) + 9 = 80 + 9 = 89, which is not equal to 87.

Let's try x = 9: 8(9) + 9 = 72 + 9 = 81, which is not equal to 87.

Let's try x = 10.5: 8(10.5) + 9 = 84 + 9 = 93, which is not equal to 87.

Let's try x = 10.25: 8(10.25) + 9 = 82 + 9 = 91, which is not equal to 87.

Let's try x = 10.75: 8(10.75) + 9 = 86 + 9 = 95, which is not equal to 87.

Let's try x = 10.5: 8(10.5) + 9 = 84 + 9 = 93, which is not equal to 87.

Let's try x = 10.25: 8(10.25) + 9 = 82 + 9 = 91, which is not equal to 87.

Let's try x = 10.75: 8(10.75) + 9 = 86 + 9 = 95, which is not equal to 87.

Let's try x = 9.5: 8(9.5) + 9 = 76 + 9 = 85, which is not equal to 87.

Let's try x = 9.25: 8(9.25) + 9 = 74 + 9 = 83, which is not equal to 87.

Let's try x = 9.75: 8(9.75) + 9 = 78 + 9 = 87.

Since x = 9.75 is a valid solution, we can conclude that the age of the person is 9.75 years old.

However, since age cannot be a fraction, we can round down to the nearest integer, which is 9 years old."
"To find out how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of glue sticks required and then divide that by the number of glue sticks in each pack.

Total number of students: 27
Number of glue sticks per student: 2
Total number of glue sticks required: 27 * 2 = 54

Since glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks required by 8 to find out how many packs are needed.

54 ÷ 8 = 6.75

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he will need to round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we are asked to assume he will have some extra glue sticks left over, so we will round up to the nearest whole number.

6.75 → 7

Therefore, Mr. Jackson will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water passing through the river at the given point over the three days.

On the first day, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

On the second day, the amount of water passing through the river doubles, so it becomes 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.

On the third day, the amount of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons, so it becomes 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

To find the total amount of water passing through the river at that point over the three days, we need to add the amounts of water passing through the river each day:

Total amount of water = 4000 + 8000 + 14000 = 24000 gallons.

The final answer is: 24000"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of exponential growth. The number of people infected each day is six times the number of people infected the previous day, plus the number of people infected the previous day (since the new cases are added to the existing ones).

Day 1: 10 people are initially infected. After one day, 10 * 6 = 60 new people are infected, making a total of 10 + 60 = 70 people infected.

Day 2: 70 people are infected. After one day, 70 * 6 = 420 new people are infected, making a total of 70 + 420 = 490 people infected.

Day 3: 490 people are infected. After one day, 490 * 6 = 2940 new people are infected, making a total of 490 + 2940 = 3430 people infected.

Therefore, after three days, there are 3430 people infected.

The final answer is: 3430"
"To find the total amount of money Rafaela received, we multiply the number of customers by the tip amount each customer gave her. 

40 customers * $20/customer = $800

Since Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela, we need to find 10% of $800 and subtract it from $800.

10% of $800 = 0.1 * $800 = $80

Now, we subtract $80 from $800 to find the amount Julieta received.

$800 - $80 = $720

Julieta received $720 and Rafaela received $800. To find the total amount they received altogether, we add these two amounts together.

$720 + $800 = $1520

The final answer is: $1520"
"To find out how many oranges Jennifer remained with, we need to calculate the total number of oranges given to her children and subtract that from the initial number of oranges she bought.

Jennifer bought 12 oranges. 

She gave her 3 daughters 2 oranges each, so the total number of oranges given to her daughters is 3 x 2 = 6 oranges.

Her only boy got 3 oranges.

The total number of oranges given to her children is 6 (daughters) + 3 (son) = 9 oranges.

To find out how many oranges Jennifer remained with, we subtract the total number of oranges given to her children from the initial number of oranges she bought: 12 - 9 = 3 oranges.

The final answer is: 3"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Claire earns 1 badge per month.
- Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge than Claire, so Amber earns 1/2 badge per month.
- Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so Wendy earns 3 badges per month.

In a 1-year time frame (12 months), the number of badges earned by each person is:
- Claire: 1 badge/month * 12 months = 12 badges
- Amber: 0.5 badges/month * 12 months = 6 badges
- Wendy: 3 badges/month * 12 months = 36 badges

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a 1-year time frame, we subtract the number of badges earned by Amber from the number of badges earned by Wendy:
36 badges (Wendy) - 6 badges (Amber) = 30 badges

"To find the total amount raised, we need to calculate the total number of slices sold and then multiply it by the price per slice.

First, let's find the total number of hours Paige baked. She baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is 5 hours.

Since Paige can bake 2 loaves per hour, the total number of loaves baked in 5 hours is 2 loaves/hour * 5 hours = 10 loaves.

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices is 10 loaves * 8 slices/loaf = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, so the total amount raised is 80 slices * 0.50 dollars/slice = 40 dollars.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find the total number of coins Gretchen has, we need to determine the number of silver coins first. 

Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins can be represented as (x + 30).

We are given that the number of gold coins is 70. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 30 = 70

To solve for 'x', we subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:

x = 70 - 30
x = 40

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of gold coins and silver coins:

Total coins = Number of gold coins + Number of silver coins
Total coins = 70 + 40
Total coins = 110

"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we first need to determine the total number of burritos consumed. 

There were 50 students at the picnic, and each student was given 10 burritos. So, the total number of burritos given to the students is 50 * 10 = 500.

Mr. George also ate 20 burritos. Therefore, the total number of burritos consumed is 500 (by students) + 20 (by Mr. George) = 520.

Since there were 600 burritos ordered initially, the total number of leftover burritos is 600 - 520 = 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the number of yellow cars, we need to first determine the number of green and blue cars. 

Let's start with the number of green cars, which is 2 fewer than the number of red cars. Since there are 12 red cars, the number of green cars is 12 - 2 = 10.

Next, we know that the number of blue cars is 3 times the number of green cars. So, the number of blue cars is 3 * 10 = 30.

Now, we know the total number of red, green, and blue cars: 12 (red) + 10 (green) + 30 (blue) = 52.

Since the rink has 75 cars in total, the number of yellow cars can be found by subtracting the total number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars: 75 - 52 = 23.

The final answer is: 23"
"Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as F, the number of books Anne has as A, and the number of books Sofie has as S.

We are given that Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so we can write an equation:

A = F - 12

We are also given that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so we can write another equation:

S = A + 25

We are also given that together, Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have 85 books, so we can write a third equation:

S + A + F = 85

Now we can substitute the first two equations into the third equation to solve for F:

(F - 12) + (F - 12 + 25) + F = 85

Combine like terms:

2F + 3 = 85

Subtract 3 from both sides:

2F = 82

Divide both sides by 2:

F = 41

"To find the weight of the carrots, we first need to find the weight of the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, the sweet potatoes weigh 2 * 5 = 10 pounds.

The carrots weigh 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes, so the weight of the carrots is 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

The weight of the carrots is 7 pounds."
"To find out how much Greg will spend on Jello, we need to calculate the total number of Jello cups he needs and then multiply it by the cost per box.

First, we need to find out how many Jello cups Greg needs in total. Since each kid will get 4 Jello cups, and there are 30 kids, the total number of Jello cups needed is 4 * 30 = 120.

Since each box of Jello makes 10 Jello cups, we need to find out how many boxes Greg needs to buy. We can do this by dividing the total number of Jello cups needed by the number of Jello cups per box: 120 / 10 = 12.

Since each box costs $1.25, we can multiply the number of boxes needed by the cost per box to find the total cost: 12 * $1.25 = $15.

"To find out how many pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he ate on each day and add them up.

On the first day, he ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces, which is (2/5) * 60 = 24 pieces.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces. To find the remaining pieces after the first two days, we subtract the pieces eaten on the first two days from the total: 60 - 24 - 10 = 26. Then, we calculate 7/13 of the remaining pieces: (7/13) * 26 = 14.

Now, we add up the pieces eaten on each day: 24 + 10 + 14 = 48.

"To find the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water, we first need to find the cost of one bottle of soda and one bottle of water.

The cost of 7 bottles of soda is $21.00, so the cost of one bottle of soda is $21.00 / 7 = $3.00.

The cost of 4 bottles of water is $8.00, so the cost of one bottle of water is $8.00 / 4 = $2.00.

Now, we can find the total cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water by multiplying the cost of one bottle of soda by 3 and the cost of one bottle of water by 2, and then adding the results together.

Cost of 3 bottles of soda = 3 x $3.00 = $9.00
Cost of 2 bottles of water = 2 x $2.00 = $4.00
Total cost = $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00

The cost of each bolt is $0.03, and David wants to buy 16 bolts. 

Total cost = Number of bolts * Cost per bolt
Total cost = 16 * $0.03
Total cost = $0.48

Now, we subtract the total cost from the initial amount of money David has:

Initial amount = $12.48

"To find out how much money Isaias bought the chickens for, we first need to determine how many chickens he plans to sell. Since he has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them, we can calculate the number of chickens he plans to sell as follows:

Number of chickens to sell = 300 * (3/5)
= 300 * 0.6
= 180 chickens

Since he plans to sell 180 chickens at $50 per chicken, the total revenue from selling these chickens will be:

Total revenue = Number of chickens to sell * Price per chicken
= 180 * $50
= $9000

However, we are given that Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. This means that the total revenue from selling the chickens should be the cost price plus the profit. Let's denote the cost price as x. Then, the total revenue is x + $2000.

Since the total revenue is $9000, we can set up the equation:

x + $2000 = $9000

To find the cost price, we subtract $2000 from both sides of the equation:

x = $9000 - $2000
x = $7000

So, Isaias bought the chickens for $7000.

The final answer is: $7000"
"To find out how many glasses Micah and Mitchell sold, we need to divide the total number of glasses sold by 2, since they sold an equal number of glasses. 

Total glasses sold = 32
Number of people who sold an equal number of glasses = 2 (Micah and Mitchell)

Glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell = Total glasses sold / 2
= 32 / 2
= 16

Since Julie sold 14 glasses, we need to find the difference between the number of glasses Julie sold and the number of glasses Micah sold.

Difference = Glasses sold by Julie - Glasses sold by Micah
= 14 - 16
= -2

However, since we can't have a negative number of glasses, we can assume that the question is asking for the absolute difference. 

Absolute difference = |Glasses sold by Julie - Glasses sold by Micah|
= |14 - 16|
= 2

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total amount Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the cost of each service and add them together.

The cost of the hair service is $400.

The cost of the manicure is 1/4 of the cost of the hair service, which is (1/4) * 400 = $100.

The cost of the pedicure is 3/4 of the cost of the manicure, which is (3/4) * 100 = $75.

Now, we add the costs of all three services together: 400 + 100 + 75 = $575.

The final answer is: $575"
"To find out how much money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope, we need to calculate the total amount of money she gets from selling the old rope and then subtract the cost of the new rope.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Sarah gets from selling the old rope:

Length of the old rope = 20 meters
Price per meter = $2
Total amount of money = Length of the old rope * Price per meter
Total amount of money = 20 * $2
Total amount of money = $40

Now, let's calculate the cost of the new rope:

Length of the new rope = ? (we don't know yet, but we'll call it x)
Price per meter = $1.5
Cost of the new rope = Length of the new rope * Price per meter
Cost of the new rope = x * $1.5

Since Sarah plans to use the profit to buy the new rope, the cost of the new rope will be equal to the profit she makes from selling the old rope. Let's set up an equation:

Profit = Total amount of money - Cost of the new rope
Profit = $40 - (x * $1.5)
Profit = $40 - $1.5x

Since the profit is equal to the cost of the new rope, we can set up another equation:

Profit = Cost of the new rope
$40 - $1.5x = x * $1.5

Now, let's solve for x:

$40 - $1.5x = $1.5x
$40 = $1.5x + $1.5x
$40 = $3x
x = $40 / $3
x = 13.33 meters

Now that we know the length of the new rope, we can calculate the cost of the new rope:

Cost of the new rope = Length of the new rope * Price per meter
Cost of the new rope = 13.33 * $1.5
Cost of the new rope = $20

Now, let's calculate the amount of money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope:

Amount of money left over = Total amount of money - Cost of the new rope
Amount of money left over = $40 - $20
Amount of money left over = $20

The final answer is: $20"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let Melanie's current age be x. 

In 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. This means that her current age plus 10 years is equal to 18. We can write this as an equation:

x + 10 = 18

To find Melanie's current age, we need to solve for x. Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation gives us:

x = 8

So, Melanie's current age is 8 years.

Now, we need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her present age. Let's call this number y. We can write this as an equation:

8 + y = 3(8)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

8 + y = 24

Subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation gives us:

y = 16

However, this is the number of years after her current age. To find the total number of years from now, we need to add 10 (the number of years that have already passed) to y:

y = 16 + 10
y = 26

The final answer is: 26"
"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's find the cost of the bacon: 5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total.

Next, we need to find the cost of the chicken. Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so the cost of each packet of chicken is $10 / 5 = $2. Since Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, the total cost of the chicken is 6 * $2 = $12.

The cost of the strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.

The cost of the apples is 7 * ($4 / 2) = 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items: $10 (bacon) + $12 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $48.

Kelly's budget is $65, so we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget: $65 - $48 = $17.

The final answer is: $17"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts.
2. The final concert has a 15-minute encore.
3. The total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes.

Let's denote the runtime of her usual concerts as 'x'. Since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, its runtime is 2x.

The total runtime of the final concert is the sum of the runtime of the main concert and the encore: 2x + 15 = 65.

Now, we can solve for x:

2x + 15 = 65
Subtract 15 from both sides:
2x = 50
Divide both sides by 2:
x = 25

So, her usual concerts run for 25 minutes.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how many toys Argo has now, we need to subtract the number of toys he gave away from the total number of toys he initially had.

Initially, Argo had 200 toys.

He gave away 40 toys to Alyssa, 80 toys to Bonnie, and 30 toys to Nicky. 

Total toys given away = 40 + 80 + 30 = 150

Now, let's subtract the total toys given away from the initial number of toys:

200 - 150 = 50

So, Argo has 50 toys now.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total number of chimichangas made on those three days, we need to add the number of chimichangas made on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday.

On Tuesday, they make 125 chimichangas.
On Wednesday, they also make 125 chimichangas.
On Friday, they make twice as many as Wednesday, which is 2 * 125 = 250 chimichangas.

Now, let's add the number of chimichangas made on each day:
125 (Tuesday) + 125 (Wednesday) + 250 (Friday) = 400

The final answer is: 400"
"To find the number of pairs of microphones that can be arranged, we first need to find the total number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs. 

Let's assume the total number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs is x. Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the total number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs is 2x.

However, we know that 20% of the total 50 microphones won't find any space to fit in. This means that 80% of the microphones will be arranged in pairs. 

We can set up the equation: 80% of 50 = 2x

To find 80% of 50, we multiply 50 by 0.8:
50 * 0.8 = 40

Now we have the equation: 40 = 2x

To find x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:
x = 40 / 2
x = 20

Since x represents the number of pairs of microphones, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total number of birds, we need to calculate the number of birds in each group and add them together.

First, let's find the number of birds nesting in the bushes: 6

Next, we need to find 2/3 of the number of birds nesting in the bushes: 
2/3 * 6 = 4

So, there are 4 birds flying overhead.

Now, let's find the number of birds feeding: 3 groups of 8 birds each = 3 * 8 = 24

Now, let's add the number of birds in each group: 
6 (nesting) + 4 (flying) + 24 (feeding) = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To find out how many cookies were in each jar, we need to subtract the number of cookies Lani ate from the total number of cookies she baked, and then divide the result by the number of jars.

First, let's subtract the number of cookies Lani ate from the total number of cookies:

55 (total cookies) - 5 (cookies eaten) = 50 cookies

Now, let's divide the remaining cookies by the number of jars:

50 cookies / 5 jars = 10 cookies per jar

So, there were 10 cookies in each jar.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of petals on the orchids, we multiply the number of orchids by the number of petals per orchid: 5 orchids * 5 petals/orchid = 25 petals.

To find the total number of petals on the daisies, we multiply the number of daisies by the number of petals per daisy: 4 daisies * 10 petals/daisy = 40 petals.

Now, we subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies to find the difference: 40 petals - 25 petals = 15 petals.

The daisies have 15 more petals compared to the orchids.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To find the percentage of flowering plants, we first need to determine the number of flowering plants. 

There are 100 plants in total. One-fourth of them are indoor plants, which is 100 * (1/4) = 25 plants. 

The remaining plants are 100 - 25 = 75 plants. Two-thirds of these remaining plants are outdoor plants, which is 75 * (2/3) = 50 plants. 

The rest of the remaining plants are flowering plants, which is 75 - 50 = 25 plants.

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100: (25/100) * 100 = 25%.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to first find the speed of the thingamabob. Since the whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob, and the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, we can set up the equation:

Speed of whatchamacallit = 11 * Speed of thingamabob
121 = 11 * Speed of thingamabob

To find the speed of the thingamabob, we can divide both sides of the equation by 11:

Speed of thingamabob = 121 / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 11

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig, which is five times the speed of the thingamabob:

Speed of whirligig = 5 * Speed of thingamabob
Speed of whirligig = 5 * 11
Speed of whirligig = 55

The final answer is: 55"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Ellen eats two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day.
- The salad costs $6.
- The yogurt is half the price of the salad, so the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.
- The total cost of Ellen's daily goods is $11.

Let's denote the cost of one carrot as 'x'. Since Ellen eats two carrots, the total cost of carrots is 2x.

The total cost of Ellen's daily goods is the sum of the cost of carrots, salad, and yogurt: 2x + 6 + 3 = 11.

Combine like terms: 2x + 9 = 11.

Subtract 9 from both sides: 2x = 2.

Divide both sides by 2: x = 1.

The cost of one carrot is $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To find out how much Mark makes a week, we need to calculate his new hourly wage and then multiply it by the number of hours he works in a week.

Mark's new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12 per hour.

He works 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, so the total number of hours he works in a week is 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week.

Now, we multiply his new hourly wage by the total number of hours he works in a week: $12/hour * 40 hours/week = $480/week.

The final answer is: $480"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn. Let's denote the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. 

Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times. 

The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.

The total number of lawns she mowed is the sum of the lawns she mowed each week, which is 3x + x + 5x = 9x.

We know that she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn, and since she mowed Joe's lawn 'x' times, she made a total of $6x from mowing lawns.

We also know that she made a total of $80 from both lemonade sales and mowing lawns. So, the amount she made from lemonade sales is $80 - $6x.

Since we don't know the value of 'x', we need to find a way to determine it. However, we can use the fact that she mowed a total of 9x lawns. We know that she mowed at least one lawn, so 9x ≥ 1.

We also know that she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn, and since she mowed Joe's lawn 'x' times, she mowed at least one lawn, so x ≥ 1.

Since she mowed a total of 9x lawns, and she mowed at least one lawn, 9x ≥ 1. 

Now, we can set up an equation using the information that she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn. Since she mowed Joe's lawn 'x' times, she made a total of $6x from mowing lawns. We know that she made a total of $80 from both lemonade sales and mowing lawns, so the amount she made from lemonade sales is $80 - $6x.

We also know that she mowed a total of 9x lawns, and since she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn, we can set up the equation 6x + (80 - 6x) = 80.

Simplifying the equation, we get 80 = 80.

However, this equation is true for any value of x, so we need to use the fact that she mowed at least one lawn. Since she mowed at least one lawn, x ≥ 1.

We can try x = 1, which gives us 6(1) + (80 - 6(1)) = 80, which is true.

Now, we can find the amount she made from lemonade sales by substituting x = 1 into the equation 80 - 6x.

80 - 6(1) = 80 - 6 = 74

"To find Harry's weight, we need to find Christian's weight first, then subtract 5 kg from it.

Martin's weight is 55 kg. 
Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so Carl's weight is 55 + 16 = 71 kg.
Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight is 71 + 8 = 79 kg.
Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight is 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

His hourly rate is $25, so the total amount he earns is:
30 hours * $25/hour = $750

However, he has a car payment of $500, so we need to subtract this from his total earnings to find his profit:
$750 - $500 = $250

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Martha initially had some number of notebooks, let's call it x. Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, Joseph had 3x notebooks.

After Martha bought 5 more notebooks, she had a total of 7 notebooks. This means that the initial number of notebooks she had (x) plus the 5 notebooks she bought (5) equals 7. We can write this as an equation:

x + 5 = 7

To find the value of x, we subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:

x = 7 - 5
x = 2

So Martha initially had 2 notebooks. Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, Joseph had 3x = 3(2) = 6 notebooks.

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph. Martha has 7 notebooks and Joseph has 6 notebooks. The difference is:

7 - 6 = 1

So Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph."
"To find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we first need to find the distance rowed by Anis. 

Dijana rowed 50 miles. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. 

1/5 of 50 miles is 50 * (1/5) = 10 miles. 

So, Anis rowed 50 + 10 = 60 miles. 

The total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis is 50 + 60 = 110 miles.

"To find out how many cookies each of Susan's nephews will get, we first need to determine the total number of cookies available after her husband took some. 

Initially, Susan had 100 cookies. Her husband took 4 cookies, so the total number of cookies left is 100 - 4 = 96.

Since Susan wants to divide the cookies equally among her 6 nephews, we need to divide the remaining cookies by 6.

96 ÷ 6 = 16

So, each of Susan's nephews will get 16 cookies.

Daniel did not read any pages today.

So, Denise's total pages read is 10 + 18 = 28 pages.
Daniel's total pages read is 13 + 0 = 13 pages.

The difference in the number of pages read by Denise and Daniel is 28 - 13 = 15 pages.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of bowls that can be filled with the leftover soup and then divide that by the number of child-sized bowls.

Since the pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls, we can assume that the capacity of the pot is equivalent to 8 child bowls.

The family consists of 3 adults and 2 children, so for dinner, 3 adult bowls will be used. This leaves 5 bowls of soup (8 - 3 = 5) for the next meal.

Since each child eats one bowl, the 2 children can have 2 bowls of soup for lunch. The remaining 3 bowls will be leftover.

To find out how many times the children can have a bowl of soup for lunch, we need to divide the remaining bowls by the number of child-sized bowls that can be filled from the pot. Since the pot can fill 8 child bowls, we can divide the remaining 3 bowls by 8.

3 ÷ 8 = 0.375

However, since we are looking for the number of times the children can have a bowl of soup, we need to round down to the nearest whole number, as you can't have a fraction of a bowl.

"To find out how much material Jo needs, we need to calculate the total amount of material required for small and large masks separately and then add them together.

For small masks, Jo needs 2 yards of material for each 4 masks. So, the amount of material needed for 20 small masks is:
20 small masks / 4 small masks per 2 yards = 5 sets of 4 small masks
Since each set requires 2 yards, the total material needed for small masks is 5 sets * 2 yards/set = 10 yards

For large masks, Jo needs 2.25 yards of material for each 3 masks. So, the amount of material needed for 8 large masks is:
8 large masks / 3 large masks per 2.25 yards = 2.67 sets of 3 large masks (approximately)
Since each set requires 2.25 yards, the total material needed for large masks is 2.67 sets * 2.25 yards/set ≈ 6 yards

Now, we add the material needed for small and large masks together:
Total material needed = material for small masks + material for large masks
Total material needed = 10 yards + 6 yards
Total material needed = 16 yards

"To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we need to first calculate how many marbles he gave away. 

Dean gives 1/5 of his marbles to Jamie. Since he has 30 marbles, we can calculate 1/5 of 30 as follows: 
1/5 * 30 = 30 / 5 = 6

So, Dean gives 6 marbles to Jamie. 

Then, he gives 10 marbles to Donald. 

In total, Dean gives away 6 + 10 = 16 marbles.

To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we subtract the marbles he gave away from the total number of marbles he had:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Adam's age four years ago as 'x'. Since Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, we can write an equation:

Duncan's age eight years ago = 2 * Adam's age four years ago
Duncan's age eight years ago = 2x

We know that Duncan's current age is 60, so we can find his age eight years ago by subtracting 8 from 60:

Duncan's age eight years ago = 60 - 8 = 52

Now we can equate this to 2x:

52 = 2x

To find x, we divide both sides by 2:

x = 52 / 2
x = 26

This means Adam's age four years ago was 26. To find Adam's current age, we add 4 to x:

Adam's current age = 26 + 4 = 30

Finally, to find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8 = 38

"To find out how much Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday, we need to calculate the total number of packages he completes in that time and then multiply it by his hourly wage.

First, let's find out how many packages Colby completes in an hour. He completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, so we can write this as:

Packages per hour = 50 - 10
Packages per hour = 40

Now, let's calculate the total number of packages Colby completes in an 8-hour workday:

Total packages per day = Packages per hour * 8
Total packages per day = 40 * 8
Total packages per day = 320

Now, let's calculate Colby's daily earnings by multiplying the total number of packages he completes by his hourly wage:

"To find out how many bottles of water John drinks, we need to calculate the time it takes to solve the extreme sudoku and then divide it by the time it takes to drink one bottle of water.

A normal sudoku takes 45 minutes, and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long, so the time to solve an extreme sudoku is 45 * 4 = 180 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we need to convert the time to solve the extreme sudoku to hours and then divide by 0.5 (since there are 2 half hours in an hour). 

180 minutes is equal to 3 hours (180 / 60 = 3). 

Now, we divide 3 hours by 0.5 to get the number of half hours, which is 6. 

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, he drinks 6 bottles of water in 3 hours.

- Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon.
- Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.
- Total bologna thrown = 58
- Number of red balloons = 20

Since Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon, the total bologna thrown at red balloons is 2 * 20 = 40.

Now, let's find the total bologna thrown at yellow balloons. Since the total bologna thrown is 58 and 40 was thrown at red balloons, the bologna thrown at yellow balloons is 58 - 40 = 18.

Since Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, the number of yellow balloons is 18 / 3 = 6.

"To find out how many tune-ups Jon needs, we need to calculate the total number of miles he drives in 30 days and then divide that by the interval at which he needs a tune-up.

Jon drives 100 miles a day for 30 days, so the total number of miles driven is:
100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles

Since Jon needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we can divide the total miles driven by 1000 to find the number of tune-ups needed:
3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3

Therefore, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in that time.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the total hours Bruce works in the three days, we need to calculate the hours he works each day and add them up.

On Tuesday, Bruce works 5 hours.

On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, so he works 2 * 5 = 10 hours.

On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours he works each day: 5 + 10 + 8 = 23.

The final answer is: 23"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount of money Julia and Nadine had, and then divide it by 2 to find out how much each of them received as allowance.

First, let's calculate the cost of the balloons. 1 dozen balloons is equal to 12 balloons. Since 2 balloons cost $0.5, we can find the cost of 1 balloon by dividing $0.5 by 2, which is $0.25. Now, we can multiply the cost of 1 balloon by 12 to find the total cost of the balloons: 12 * $0.25 = $3.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the items they bought: cake ($11) + balloons ($3) + 2 tubs of ice cream ($7 * 2 = $14). The total cost is $11 + $3 + $14 = $28.

Since they used all the money they had to buy these items, the total amount of money they had is $28. Since they both had the same amount of allowance, we can divide the total amount by 2 to find out how much each of them received: $28 / 2 = $14.

The final answer is: $14"
"To find the total number of fruits Kira bought, we need to add the number of apples, bananas, and oranges. 

Total fruits = 3 (apples) + 5 (bananas) + 6 (oranges) = 14

Fruits left = Total fruits - Fruits eaten = 14 - 2 = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total number of students, we need to calculate the number of students playing tennis, volleyball, and soccer, and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of students playing tennis. There are 6 students playing tennis, and twice that number playing volleyball, so the number of students playing volleyball is 6 * 2 = 12.

Next, we add the number of students playing tennis and volleyball: 6 + 12 = 18.

Now, we add the number of students playing soccer: 18 + 16 + 22 = 56.

The final answer is: 56"
"To find the total profit made by the class, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

First, let's find the total revenue. Each student sold 10 lollipops at $0.8 each, so the total revenue per student is 10 * $0.8 = $8. 

Since there are 30 students, the total revenue is 30 * $8 = $240.

Next, let's find the total cost. The class bought the lollipops for $0.5 each, and each student sold 10 lollipops. So, the total number of lollipops bought is 30 * 10 = 300.

The total cost is 300 * $0.5 = $150.

Now, we can find the total profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: $240 - $150 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the total number of pets Larry has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet and add them up.

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 * 7 = 21 fish.
5. He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

Now, let's add up the number of each type of pet: 
3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47

"To find out how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to determine the total number of slices both Abby and Josh can eat per day.

Abby eats 2 slices per day. 
Josh eats twice as much as Abby, so Josh eats 2 * 2 = 4 slices per day.

Together, they eat 2 + 4 = 6 slices per day.

The loaf of bread has 24 slices. To find out how many days it will last, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices they eat per day:

24 slices / 6 slices per day = 4 days

The loaf of bread will last 4 days."
"To find the number of shells Martha has collected by her 10th birthday, we need to calculate the number of months she has been collecting shells. Since she started collecting shells at 5 years old and we want to know the total by her 10th birthday, we need to consider the months from her 5th birthday to her 10th birthday.

There are 12 months in a year. From her 5th birthday to her 10th birthday, Martha has been collecting shells for 5 years. 

5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months

Since Martha collects one shell per month, we multiply the total number of months by 1 shell/month.

60 months * 1 shell/month = 60 shells

Martha will have collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday.

The final answer is: 60"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many cups of tea are in each row. Since Lana divides the 27 cups into 3 rows, we can divide 27 by 3 to get the number of cups in each row.

27 cups / 3 rows = 9 cups per row

Since Lana creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, the number of mint tea cups in each row is also 9.

Now, let's find out how many cups of tea are used for chamomile and mint tea in total. Since there are 3 rows, and each row has 9 cups of mint tea, the total number of mint tea cups is:

9 cups/row * 3 rows = 27 cups

However, we know that Lana uses the remaining cups to brew a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea. This means that the total number of cups used for chamomile and mint tea is 27 + 15 = 42 cups.

Since we already know that the total number of mint tea cups is 27, we can set up an equation to find the number of chamomile tea cups:

Chamomile tea cups + Mint tea cups = Total tea cups
Let's denote the number of chamomile tea cups as x. Then, we have:
x + 27 = 42

Solving for x, we get:
x = 42 - 27
x = 15

So, the number of chamomile tea cups is 15. Since there are 3 rows, and each row has equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups, the number of mint tea cups in each row is still 9.

However, we need to find the number of mint tea cups in each row, given that the total number of mint tea cups is 27 and there are 3 rows. We can divide the total number of mint tea cups by 3 to get the number of mint tea cups in each row.

27 cups / 3 rows = 9 cups per row

The final answer is: 9"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip. 

Let's denote the number of berries picked up per trip as 'b'. Since the sloth takes 4 hours to make a round trip, he can make 8/4 = 2 trips in 8 hours. 

Since he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, and he makes 2 trips, the total number of berries he picks up in 8 hours is 2b. 

We can set up the equation 2b = 24 to find the minimum number of berries he can pick up per trip. 

Solving for b, we get b = 24/2 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much water is initially filled in the tank and then subtract the amount of water used over 6 days.

First, Anthony and his father fill the tank with half the amount of water in the pool. Since there are 10000 gallons of water in the pool, half of that is 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons.

The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. To find out how much water will be remaining in the tank after 6 days, we need to multiply the rate of water usage by the number of days: 500 gallons/day * 6 days = 3000 gallons.

Now, we subtract the amount of water used from the initial amount in the tank: 5000 gallons - 3000 gallons = 2000 gallons.

The final answer is: 2000"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much money Colby has left and then determine how many movies he can see with the remaining money.

Colby's initial budget is $150. He has already spent money on:

- 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays: 5 * $10 = $50
- 8 movies on other days: 8 * $7 = $56
- 2 tubs of popcorn: 2 * $8 = $16
- 4 boxes of candy: 4 * $2 = $8

Total money spent: $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130

Colby has $150 - $130 = $20 left.

Each movie costs $10, and he wants to buy a popcorn ($8) and a box of candy ($2) for the last movie. So, the cost for the last movie will be $10 + $8 + $2 = $20.

Colby can see 1 more movie with the remaining money.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To find the total calories of the pastries, we first need to find the calories of a mini cinnamon roll and a mini blueberry muffin. 

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories. 

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, we can find the total calories of the mini cinnamon rolls: 200 mini cinnamon rolls * 200 calories = 40,000 calories.

Next, we can find the total calories of the mini blueberry muffins: 300 mini blueberry muffins * 150 calories = 45,000 calories.

Finally, we can find the total calories of all the pastries: 40,000 calories + 45,000 calories = 85,000 calories.

On Wednesday, she removed twice as many as Tuesday, so 2 * 78 = 156 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

The total number of Junebugs removed is 39 + 78 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 378.

The average number of Junebugs removed per day is 378 / 5 = 75.6."
"To find the distance traveled by the bus, we multiply its speed by the time it traveled: 60 miles/hour * 5 hours = 300 miles.

To find the distance traveled by the car, we multiply its speed by the time it traveled: 30 miles/hour * 8 hours = 240 miles.

Now, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus to find the difference: 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles.

"Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as Pp, and John's age as J. 

We are given that Pp = J + 10. 

We are also given that P = Pp + J.

We are also given that P + Pp + J = 100.

Substituting Pp = J + 10 into the equation P = Pp + J, we get P = (J + 10) + J, which simplifies to P = 2J + 10.

Substituting P = 2J + 10 and Pp = J + 10 into the equation P + Pp + J = 100, we get (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100.

Combine like terms: 4J + 20 = 100.

Subtract 20 from both sides: 4J = 80.

Divide both sides by 4: J = 20.

Now that we know J = 20, we can find Pp = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30.

Finally, we can find P = Pp + J = 30 + 20 = 50.

"To find the total number of balloons, we need to calculate the initial number of balloons and then add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, Maria had 1 balloon, and each of her 4 friends had 2 balloons. So, the total number of balloons initially is:
1 (Maria's balloon) + 4 * 2 (friends' balloons) = 1 + 8 = 9

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional balloons is:
5 * 3 = 15

Now, we add the initial number of balloons to the additional balloons:
9 (initial balloons) + 15 (additional balloons) = 24

"To find out how much Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his stay with the 24-hour option and the cost of his stay with the 12-hour option plus the additional hours.

First, let's calculate the cost of the 24-hour stay: 
The cost for 24 hours is 1600 pesos.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the 12-hour stay plus the additional hours. Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is 17 hours. The first 12 hours cost 1000 pesos. The additional 5 hours (17 - 12 = 5) will cost 5 * 70 = 350 pesos. 

So, the total cost for the 12-hour option plus the additional hours is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

Now, let's find the difference between the two options: 
Cost of 24-hour stay - Cost of 12-hour stay plus additional hours = 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

Cameron would save 250 pesos by choosing the 12-hour option plus the additional hours instead of the 24-hour option.

"To find the total amount of hay needed, we first need to determine the amount each sheep needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds and each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, we can calculate the amount each sheep needs as follows:

Each goat needs 5 pounds, so twice that amount is 5 * 2 = 10 pounds. 
3 pounds less than 10 pounds is 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep separately:

For the goats: 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds
For the sheep: 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds

The total amount of hay needed is the sum of the hay needed for the goats and the sheep: 75 + 84 = 159 pounds.

Since Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig, we add 50 to the total number of letters Craig spelled: 300 + 50 = 350.

Now, we need to find the number of letters in the words Craig's brother spelled. Since Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig, and Craig spelled 300 letters, we know that Craig's brother spelled 300 + 50 = 350 letters.

However, we also know that Craig spelled 20 words with 15 letters each, and we are given that Craig's brother spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. This means that Craig's brother must have spelled 20 words as well, since the difference in the number of letters is 50, which is the same as the number of words Craig spelled. 

Since Craig's brother spelled 20 words, and we know that each word has 15 letters, we can multiply the number of words by the number of letters in each word to find the total number of letters in the words Craig's brother spelled: 20 * 15 = 300.

Labor cost = $35 * 2.25 = $78.75

The cost of parts is $60.

The initial visit fee is $40.

"To find out how much James spent on the CDs, we first need to calculate the original price of the CDs and then subtract the discount. 

The original price of 10 CDs is 10 * $15 = $150.

Since James gets a 40% discount, we need to find 40% of $150. 
40% of $150 = 0.4 * $150 = $60.

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price: $150 - $60 = $90.

James spent $90 on the CDs.

Next, we need to find out how much he got back from selling 5 CDs. 
He sold them for $40 each, so he got 5 * $40 = $200.

Now, we subtract the amount he got back from the amount he spent: $90 - $200 = -$110.

However, since James can't be out by a negative amount, we need to re-evaluate the situation. 

James spent $90 on the CDs and got $200 from selling 5 of them. This means he actually made a profit of $200 - $90 = $110.

But the question asks how much money he was out, which implies he lost money. Since he made a profit, we need to consider the 5 CDs he didn't sell. 

The original price of 5 CDs is 5 * $15 = $75.

Since James got a 40% discount, we need to find 40% of $75. 
40% of $75 = 0.4 * $75 = $30.

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price: $75 - $30 = $45.

James didn't sell these 5 CDs, so he still has to pay the full price of $45 for them.

Now, we subtract the amount he got back from the amount he still owes: $45 - $200 = -$155.

However, since James can't be out by a negative amount, we need to re-evaluate the situation. 

James owes $45 for the 5 CDs he didn't sell, but he got $200 from selling 5 of them. This means he actually made a profit of $200 - $45 = $155.

But the question asks how much money he was out, which implies he lost money. Since he made a profit, we need to consider the fact that he spent $90 on the CDs.

The correct answer is that James was out $90 - $155 = -$65. However, since James can't be out by a negative amount, we need to re-evaluate the situation.

The correct answer is that James was out $65.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. First, let's find the distance James swims before stopping. Since he swims 60% of the 20-mile lake, we can calculate this as 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles.

2. The time it takes James to swim 12 miles at a pace of 2 miles per hour is 12 / 2 = 6 hours.

3. Since he rests for half as long as the swimming time, he rests for 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

4. The remaining distance is 20 - 12 = 8 miles.

5. James swims the remaining distance at half his original speed, which is 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour.

6. The time it takes James to swim the remaining 8 miles at 1 mile per hour is 8 / 1 = 8 hours.

7. To find the total time, we add the swimming time (6 hours), the resting time (3 hours), and the time it takes to swim the remaining distance (8 hours). Total time = 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.

3. Marcus is half of Leo's age, so Leo's age is twice Marcus's age. 

To find Leo's age, we multiply Marcus's age by 2: 21 * 2 = 42.

The final answer is: 42"
"To find out how many points Azibo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Bahati and Dinar. 

Let's denote the points scored by Dinar as x. Since Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, Bahati's points can be represented as x + 10. 

We also know that Azibo scored 20 more points than Bahati, so Azibo's points can be represented as (x + 10) + 20 = x + 30.

The total points scored by the team is 45, which is the sum of the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 10) + (x + 30) = 45

Combine like terms:

3x + 40 = 45

Subtract 40 from both sides:

3x = 5

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 5/3

However, x represents the points scored by Dinar, which cannot be a fraction. This means that the initial assumption that Dinar's points can be represented as x is incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

Let's denote the points scored by Dinar as x. Since Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, Bahati's points can be represented as x + 10. 

We also know that Azibo scored 20 more points than Bahati, so Azibo's points can be represented as (x + 10) + 20 = x + 30.

The total points scored by the team is 45, which is the sum of the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 10) + (x + 30) = 45

Combine like terms:

3x + 40 = 45

Subtract 40 from both sides:

3x = 5

Since 3x is not a whole number, the initial assumption that the points scored by Dinar, Bahati, and Azibo are whole numbers is incorrect. However, we can try to find a whole number solution by re-evaluating the problem.

Let's re-evaluate the problem:

Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, and 10 more points than Dinar. Let's denote the points scored by Dinar as x. Then, Bahati's points can be represented as x + 10, and Azibo's points can be represented as (x + 10) - 20 = x - 10.

The total points scored by the team is 45, which is the sum of the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 10) + (x - 10) = 45

Combine like terms:

3x = 45

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 15

Now that we know Dinar scored 15 points, we can find Azibo's points:

Azibo's points = (x + 10) - 20
= (15 + 10) - 20
= 5

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To find the total number of pages in the book, we need to calculate the total number of pages per inch and then multiply it by the thickness of the book in inches.

Since each paper is 100 pages to the inch and each paper is printed on both sides, we have 200 pages per inch (100 pages per side).

Given that the book is 1.5 inches thick, we can multiply the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book:

200 pages/inch * 1.5 inches = 300 pages

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the total number of reports Vince stapled, we need to calculate the total time he spent stapling reports and then multiply it by the number of reports he can staple per minute.

First, let's find the total time in minutes. Vince stapled reports from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is a total of 15 hours. 

15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Now, we know Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find the number of reports he can staple per minute, we divide 30 by 15:

30 reports / 15 minutes = 2 reports/minute

Now, we multiply the total time in minutes by the number of reports he can staple per minute:

900 minutes * 2 reports/minute = 1800 reports

The final answer is: 1800"
"To find the total number of minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m. This is a total of 8 hours, which is equal to 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 5:55 a.m. instead of 6 a.m. This means she slept for 480 - 5 = 475 minutes.

She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is a total of 23 minutes.

To find the total sleep time, we subtract the time she was sleepwalking from the total sleep time: 475 - 23 = 452 minutes.

The final answer is: 452"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many measuring spoons Jonathan has initially. 

Since Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, and he has two dozen cups, we can calculate the number of measuring spoons as follows:

Number of measuring cups = 2 dozen = 2 * 12 = 24
Number of measuring spoons = 2/3 * 24 = 16

Now, Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so we subtract 6 from the initial number of measuring spoons:

Remaining measuring spoons = 16 - 6 = 10

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is the sum of the remaining measuring spoons and the measuring cups:

Total remaining utensils = 10 (measuring spoons) + 24 (measuring cups) = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we need to first find the number of occupied beds and then subtract it from the total capacity.

The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 of them are occupied. 

1/5 of 1000 = 100 beds occupied.

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, we need to find the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks is equal to 14 days.

Total patients admitted in 2 weeks = 50 patients/day * 14 days = 700 patients

Now, we add the initial occupied beds to the total patients admitted in 2 weeks to find the total occupied beds.

Total occupied beds = 100 + 700 = 800 beds

Now, we subtract the total occupied beds from the total capacity to find the unoccupied beds.

Total unoccupied beds = 1000 - 800 = 200 beds

The final answer is: 200"
"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we need to first find out how many emails are not work-related. 

Robyn sends 16 emails a day, and 7 of them are work emails. So, the number of non-work emails is 16 - 7 = 9.

Two-thirds of the remainder (non-work emails) are to family. Two-thirds of 9 is (2/3) * 9 = 6. This means 6 emails are to family.

Now, we need to find out how many emails are left after subtracting the family emails from the non-work emails. 9 - 6 = 3.

One-third of the remaining emails are to her boyfriend. One-third of 3 is (1/3) * 3 = 1.

So, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna.
2. Shawna is three times as old as Aliya.
3. Aliya is 3 years old.

From point 2, we can find Shawna's age by multiplying Aliya's age by 3:
Shawna's age = 3 * Aliya's age = 3 * 3 = 9 years

From point 1, we can find Shawna's father's age by multiplying Shawna's age by 5:
Shawna's father's age = 5 * Shawna's age = 5 * 9 = 45 years

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number reported by Courtney and subtract it from the number she reported.

Let's denote the number of people reported by Courtney as C = 48.

The number of people Kelly said Courtney overstated is 20% of C, which is 0.2 * C = 0.2 * 48 = 9.6.

Now, we subtract this number from the number reported by Courtney to find the actual number of people who attended the concert: C - 9.6 = 48 - 9.6 = 38.4.

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 38.4.

The final answer is: 38.4"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Jason carried 2 balls.
- Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jeffrey carried half of what Jason carried, which is 2 / 2 = 1 ball.
- Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls carried by each of them: 2 (Jason) + 1 (Jeffrey) + 4 (Jordan) = 7 balls.

Since the three boys picked up and carried all the balls in one trip, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is equal to the number of balls carried by the boys, which is 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day and then determine how many holes were dug on the fourth day.

The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day, 13 holes on the second day, and 8 holes on the third day. However, they filled in 2 holes on the third day. So, the total number of holes at the end of the third day is:

10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29

The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is:

4 * 10 = 40

Since there were 29 holes at the end of the third day, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:

40 - 29 = 11

Therefore, the pirates dug 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.

The final answer is: 11"
"Let's denote the number of corn chips that Amora and Lainey got as x. Since Collins got 15 more corn chips than the others, Collins got x + 15 corn chips.

We know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, so we can set up the equation:

x = 70

Since Collins got x + 15 corn chips, we can set up the equation:

x + 15 = 70 + 15 (since Collins got 15 more than Amora and Lainey)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 15 = 85

Subtracting 15 from both sides, we get:

x = 70

This confirms that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each.

Now, let's find the total number of corn chips. We know that Collins got x + 15 corn chips, which is 85 corn chips. So, the total number of corn chips is:

x + (x + 15) = 70 + 85

Combine like terms:

2x + 15 = 155

Subtract 15 from both sides:

2x = 140

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 70

Since x represents the number of corn chips that Amora and Lainey got, and Collins got 15 more, we can find the total number of corn chips by adding the number of corn chips that Collins got to the total number of corn chips that Amora and Lainey got:

Total = 2x + (x + 15)
Total = 2(70) + 85
Total = 140 + 85
Total = 225

"To find the cost of travel, we need to calculate 50% more than the cost of supplies. 

First, let's find 50% of the cost of supplies. 50% of $400 is 0.5 * 400 = $200.

Now, we add this to the cost of supplies to find the total cost of travel. 
Cost of travel = Cost of supplies + 50% of cost of supplies
Cost of travel = $400 + $200
Cost of travel = $600

The final answer is: $600"
"Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, Stan as S, and Alex as L. 

We are given that together they have caught 339 Pokémon, so A + S + L = 339.

We are also given that Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so L = S + 5.

We are also given that Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, so S = 4A - 13.

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to get A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 13 + 5) = 339.

Combine like terms to get 9A - 21 = 339.

Add 21 to both sides to get 9A = 360.

Divide both sides by 9 to get A = 40.

Now that we know A, we can find S by substituting A into the equation S = 4A - 13. S = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147.

The final answer is: 147"
"To find the total number of episodes, we need to find half of the number of minutes per episode. Since each episode is 20 minutes long, there are 20 minutes per episode. Half of 20 is 10. 

So, there are 10 episodes in total. 

To find the total time spent watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode: 10 episodes * 20 minutes per episode = 200 minutes.

The final answer is: 200"
"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in the southerly direction and then add it to the distance traveled in the northerly direction.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled in the southerly direction:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 10 hours
Distance = 300 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled in the northerly direction:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 36 miles

Since the bird traveled 36 miles north, we need to subtract this from the total distance traveled in the southerly direction to find the net distance between the two homes:
Net distance = 300 miles - 36 miles
Net distance = 264 miles

However, the bird also traveled 5 hours in the southerly direction after turning back. We need to add this distance to the net distance:
Total distance = Net distance + Distance traveled in the last southerly direction
Total distance = 264 miles + (22 miles/hour * 5 hours)
Total distance = 264 miles + 110 miles
Total distance = 374 miles

The final answer is: 374"
"To find the total number of brownies Greta had left over, we need to calculate the total number of brownies she received and subtract the number of brownies eaten.

She received 1/2 dozen brownies from her office, which is 6 brownies.

She also received 4 dozen brownies from her friends, which is 48 brownies.

So, the total number of brownies Greta received is 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies.

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies.

To find the number of brownies Greta had left over, we subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies she received: 66 - 18 = 48.

"To find the total age of all three family members, we need to find the age of Nani's brother and sister first.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 2 * 8 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means her age is 75% of Nani's age. To find 75% of Nani's age, we multiply his age by 0.75: 8 * 0.75 = 6 years.

Now, we have the ages of all three family members: Nani (8 years), his brother (16 years), and his sister (6 years). 

The total age of all three family members is 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

Zeke's team = Carlton's team + 7
Zeke's team = 13 + 7
Zeke's team = 20

Now, we can find the total number of players in both teams by adding the number of players on Zeke's team and Carlton's team.

Total players = Zeke's team + Carlton's team
Total players = 20 + 13

"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we first need to determine the total number of oranges she had initially. 

Since she bought 12 boxes of oranges, and each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges is 12 * 20 = 240.

Then, she gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes each, which is a total of 4 boxes. Since each box contains 20 oranges, she gave away 4 * 20 = 80 oranges.

So, the number of oranges she had left is 240 - 80 = 160.

Since she kept 1/4 of the oranges, she kept 1/4 * 160 = 40 oranges.

To find out how many oranges she sold, we subtract the number of oranges she kept from the total number of oranges she had left: 160 - 40 = 120.

"To solve this problem, we need to know the number of states in the USA and India. 

The USA has 50 states. 

Let's denote the number of states in India as 'x'. According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. So, we can write the equation as:

x = (50 / 2) + 4

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 25 + 4
x = 29

Now, we know the number of states in India is 29. To find the total number of states in both countries together, we add the number of states in the USA and India:

Total number of states = 50 (USA) + 29 (India)
Total number of states = 79

"To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books. 

The total cost of the books is the sum of the cost of the dictionary, the dinosaur book, and the children's cookbook. 

Total cost = $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) 
Total cost = $39

Since Tyler has already saved $14 from his allowance, we need to subtract this from the total cost to find out how much more he needs to earn.

Amount needed to earn = Total cost - Amount saved
Amount needed to earn = $39 - $14
Amount needed to earn = $25

Now, we know that Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work, we divide the amount he needs to earn by his hourly wage.

Hours needed to work = Amount needed to earn / Hourly wage
Hours needed to work = $25 / $5
Hours needed to work = 5

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many cherries Richard and Jerry have. 

Since Robert has 30 cherries and has 10 more than Richard, we can set up an equation to find out how many cherries Richard has. Let's call the number of cherries Richard has ""R"". Then, we can write the equation as:

R + 10 = 30

To find R, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 10 from both sides:

R = 30 - 10
R = 20

So, Richard has 20 cherries.

Now that we know Richard has 20 cherries, we can find out how many cherries Jerry has. We know that the total number of cherries is 60, and Robert and Richard have 30 and 20 cherries respectively. To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we can subtract the number of cherries Robert and Richard have from the total:

60 - 30 - 20 = 10

So, Jerry has 10 cherries.

Now that we know how many cherries Robert and Jerry have, we can find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry. We can do this by subtracting the number of cherries Jerry has from the number of cherries Robert has:

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many boxes of gingerbread and apple pie Sunny sold on both Saturday and Sunday, and then calculate the total earnings.

Let's denote the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday as G and the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday as A.

We know that on Saturday, Sunny sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. So, the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday is A + 4.

We also know that on Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday. So, the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday is G + 5.

We are given that on Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie. Therefore, A + 4 = 15, which implies A = 11.

We are also given that on Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday. Therefore, G + 5 = G + 5, which implies G = 10.

Now, we can calculate the total earnings for Saturday and Sunday.

On Saturday, the total earnings from gingerbread is 10 * 6 = 60 dollars and from apple pie is 11 * 15 = 165 dollars. The total earnings on Saturday is 60 + 165 = 225 dollars.

On Sunday, the total earnings from gingerbread is 10 + 5 = 15 * 6 = 90 dollars and from apple pie is 15 * 15 = 225 dollars. The total earnings on Sunday is 90 + 225 = 315 dollars.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Emil is 19 years old now.
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
3. When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.

From point 3, we can deduce that when Emil is 24, his brother's age will be 24 / 2 = 12 years.

From point 2, we know that when Emil is 24, his dad's age will be 2 * 24 = 48 years.

Now, we need to find the current ages of Emil's dad and brother. Since Emil is 19 now, we subtract 4 years from his dad's age (48 - 4 = 44) and his brother's age (12 - 4 = 8).

The sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother now is 44 + 8 = 52.

First, we need to convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches, since the width of the plants is given in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches

Now, we need to subtract the space between the plants. Since there are 17 plants, there will be 16 spaces between them. The total space between the plants is:

16 spaces * 1.5 feet/space * 12 inches/foot = 192 inches

Now, we subtract the total space between the plants from the total length of the flower bed:

1332 inches - 192 inches = 1140 inches

Now, we need to find out how many plants can fit in the remaining space. The width of each plant is 12 inches, so:

1140 inches / 12 inches/plant = 95 plants

However, Pat already owns 17 plants, so she only needs to buy:

95 plants - 17 plants = 78 plants

Each plant costs $6, so the total cost will be:

78 plants * $6/plant = $468

The final answer is: $468"
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day, we need to calculate 1/2 of the number of pretzels Edgar eats in a day. 

Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day. 
1/2 of 18 is 18 / 2 = 9 pretzels.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we need to multiply the number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day by 7.

9 pretzels/day * 7 days = 63 pretzels

The final answer is: 63"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

The cost of petunias: 5 baskets * 3 petunias per basket * $3.00 per petunia = 5 * 3 * 3 = $45.00
The cost of sweet potato vines: 5 baskets * 2 sweet potato vines per basket * $2.50 per sweet potato vine = 5 * 2 * 2.50 = $25.00

Total cost = cost of petunias + cost of sweet potato vines = $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00

The final answer is: $70.00"
"To find out how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we need to first calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

The total amount of soil used for the sunflowers is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.

The total amount of soil used for the carnations is 10 * 1.5 = 15 pounds.

The total amount of soil used for both sunflowers and carnations is 12 + 15 = 27 pounds.

Since they have a 30-pound bag of soil, the amount of soil left for the roses is 30 - 27 = 3 pounds.

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil, so the number of roses they can plant is 3 / 1 = 3.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we first need to calculate how much she saves each month. 

Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month and sets 25% of her paycheck aside for shoes. To find 25% of $2,000.00, we multiply $2,000.00 by 0.25.

$2,000.00 * 0.25 = $500.00

So, Jessica saves $500.00 each month for shoes.

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the monthly savings by 12 to find the yearly savings.

$500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00

Now, we need to find out how many pairs of shoes Jessica can buy with her yearly savings. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00.

$6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6

Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two separate tasks: peeling and cooking. 

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp. Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute, so to find the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp, we can divide 90 by 6.

90 / 6 = 15 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp. Emily can cook 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, so to find the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp, we can divide 90 by 30 and then multiply by 10.

90 / 30 = 3
3 * 10 = 30 minutes

However, since peeling and cooking are done sequentially, we need to add the time it takes to peel and cook. 

15 minutes (peeling) + 30 minutes (cooking) = 45 minutes

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

The final answer is: 45"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net change in temperature after the air conditioner has been running and turned off.

First, let's calculate the temperature change when the air conditioner is running on low for 3 hours:

Temperature change on low = -2 degrees/hour * 3 hours = -6 degrees

Next, let's calculate the temperature change when the air conditioner is running on high for 4 hours:

Temperature change on high = -3 degrees/hour * 4 hours = -12 degrees

Now, let's calculate the total temperature change when the air conditioner is running:

Total temperature change while running = -6 degrees + (-12 degrees) = -18 degrees

The air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours, and the room warms up at 2 degrees per hour. So, the temperature change while the air conditioner is off is:

Temperature change while off = 2 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 4 degrees

Now, let's calculate the net temperature change:

Net temperature change = Total temperature change while running + Temperature change while off
= -18 degrees + 4 degrees
= -14 degrees

Since the net temperature change is -14 degrees, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time. 

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. 
2. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. 
   This means Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time.
3. Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, the time between the two sightings is 75 years.
4. To find the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time, we need to subtract 75 from his age at the second sighting.
   So, Bill's age at the first sighting = 90 - 75 = 15 years.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks for each category and then add them up.

1. Checks for the electric bill: 1 check per month, so 12 checks per year.
2. Checks for the gas bill: 1 check per month, so 12 checks per year.
3. Checks to the church: 2 checks per month, so 24 checks per year.
4. Checks to the pest and lawn service: 1 check every 3 months, so 4 checks per year.

Now, let's add up the total number of checks:
12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52

The final answer is: 52"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the total number of flights made by the first plane as x. Since the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, the number of flights to Greece is (3/4)x. The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of flights to France is (1/4)x.

We are given that the second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. So, the total number of flights made by the first plane is 2 times the number of flights made by the second plane, which is 2 * 44 = 88.

Now, we can set up an equation to find the number of flights to France:

(1/4)x = (1/4) * 88

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 4:

x = 88

Now that we know the total number of flights made by the first plane, we can find the number of flights to France:

(1/4)x = (1/4) * 88
= 22

The final answer is: 22"
"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the individual howling times and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, let's add the individual howling times together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents and subtract the amount he already had.

Adam's mother gave him $6. 
His father gave him twice as much as his mother, so his father gave him 2 * $6 = $12.

The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Since Adam bought the trousers for $30, we need to subtract the amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers to find out how much he had to contribute from his savings.

$30 (cost of trousers) - $18 (amount received from parents) = $12

So, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings. 

The final answer is: $12"
"Let's denote the age of Wilfred as W. We know that the total age of the children is 20, and Akbar and Alessandro are 3 and 4 years old, respectively. 

The total age of Akbar and Alessandro is 3 + 4 = 7. 

Since the total age of the children is 20, the combined age of Helene and Wilfred is 20 - 7 = 13.

We are also given that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. Let's denote the average age of the group as A. Then, Helene's age is 2A.

The total age of the group is the sum of the ages of all children, which is A + A + 3 + 4 + W = 20. 

Simplifying the equation, we get 2A + 7 + W = 20.

We also know that the combined age of Helene and Wilfred is 13, which can be expressed as 2A + W = 13.

Now we have two equations:

1) 2A + 7 + W = 20
2) 2A + W = 13

Subtracting equation (2) from equation (1), we get:
(2A + 7 + W) - (2A + W) = 20 - 13

"To find out how much Walter's lawyer will contribute, we need to calculate the total amount collected from Walter's neighbors and the online fund, and then multiply it by 3.

Walter collects $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. 

Total amount collected so far = $500 + $1500 = $2000

Walter's friend donates $200, but this is not included in the amount that the lawyer will base his donation on. The lawyer will donate three times the amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund, which is $2000.

So, the lawyer will donate 3 * $2000 = $6000.

The final answer is: $6000"
"To find the total number of cookies, we multiply the number of guests by the number of cookies each guest brought. 

Total cookies = 100 guests * 15 cookies/guest = 1500 cookies

Since the bride gave 1/2 of the cookies to the church, we need to find 1/2 of 1500 cookies.

1/2 of 1500 cookies = 1500 / 2 = 750 cookies

Now, we know that each person in the church got 15 cookies. To find the number of people in the church, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person got.

Number of people in the church = 750 cookies / 15 cookies/person = 50 people

"To solve this problem, let's assume the total watermelon is divided into 6 equal parts. Let's denote the size of each kid's slice as x. Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid, the size of each adult's slice is 2x.

The total number of slices is 6, so the sum of all slices is 6x. 

The kids have 4 slices, so the total size of the kids' slices is 4x. 

The adults have 2 slices, so the total size of the adults' slices is 2(2x) = 4x.

Since the total size of the watermelon is 6x, the size of the adults' slices is 4x, which is 4/6 of the total watermelon.

To find the percentage, we multiply 4/6 by 100:

(4/6) * 100 = 66.67%

Each adult gets 66.67% of the watermelon.

The final answer is: 66.67"
"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones has left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time he spends on rounds and appointments, and then subtract that from the total hours he works.

First, let's calculate the time spent on rounds:
- Time spent on rounds = Number of inpatients * Time per inpatient
= 9 inpatients * 20 minutes/inpatient
= 180 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time spent on rounds to hours:
- Time spent on rounds (in hours) = 180 minutes / 60
= 3 hours

Next, let's calculate the time spent on appointments:
- Time spent on appointments = Number of appointments * Time per appointment
= 10 appointments * 30 minutes/appointment
= 300 minutes

Converting the time spent on appointments to hours:
- Time spent on appointments (in hours) = 300 minutes / 60
= 5 hours

Now, let's add the time spent on rounds and appointments to find the total time spent:
- Total time spent = Time spent on rounds + Time spent on appointments
= 3 hours + 5 hours
= 8 hours

Since Doctor Jones works 9 hours, we can subtract the total time spent from the total hours worked to find the time left to update his records:
- Time left to update records = Total hours worked - Total time spent
= 9 hours - 8 hours
= 1 hour

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake. 

First, let's convert the time to make the cake batter and bake the cake into hours. 
20 minutes is 20/60 = 1/3 hours, and 30 minutes is 30/60 = 1/2 hours. 

The total time for making the cake batter and baking the cake is 1/3 + 1/2 = 5/6 hours.

The total time required to cool the cake is 2 hours. 

The total time required to frost the cake is 10 minutes, which is 10/60 = 1/6 hours.

The total time required to make the cake is 5/6 + 2 + 1/6 = 2 1/3 + 2 = 4 1/3 hours.

Since Jordan wants to serve the cake at 5:00 pm, we need to subtract the total time required to make the cake from 5:00 pm to find the latest time she can start making the cake.

Let's convert 5:00 pm to a 24-hour clock: 5:00 pm is 17:00.

The latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 17:00 - 4 1/3 hours. 

To subtract 4 1/3 hours from 17:00, we can convert 4 1/3 hours to a decimal: 4 1/3 = 13/3 = 4.33 hours.

17:00 - 4.33 hours = 12:27.

The latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 12:27 pm.

The final answer is: 12:27"
"Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as 'x'. Since Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, she sold 3.5x chocolate bars. Similarly, Peter sold 4.5x chocolate bars. Together, they sold 64 chocolate bars, so we can set up the equation:

3.5x + 4.5x = 64

Combine like terms:

8x = 64

Divide both sides by 8:

x = 8

The number of chocolate bars in a box is 8.

"To find the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the total cost of students per session, then multiply it by the number of sessions in a month.

The cost of renting the studio per session is $25. 
The cost of students per session is $1.50 per student, and there are 10 students, so the total cost of students per session is 10 * $1.50 = $15.

The total cost per session is $25 (rent) + $15 (students) = $40.

The studio is rented 3 days a week, so the number of sessions per week is 3. 
There are 4 weeks in a month, so the total number of sessions in a month is 3 * 4 = 12.

The total earnings per session is $40, and there are 12 sessions in a month, so the total earnings in a month is $40 * 12 = $480.

The final answer is: $480"
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box for both Peter and Martha, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes.

For Peter: 64 chocolate bars / 4 boxes = 16 chocolate bars per box
For Martha: 56 chocolate bars / 7 boxes = 8 chocolate bars per box

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter and Martha:
16 (Peter's chocolate bars per box) - 8 (Martha's chocolate bars per box) = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the number of female porcupines, we multiply the total population by 3/5.

Number of female porcupines = 50 * (3/5) = 30

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, the total number of babies born in a month is 30 * 4 = 120.

In a year, there are 12 months, so the total number of babies born in a year is 120 * 12 = 1440.

The initial population of porcupines is 50, and 1440 babies are added in a year. Therefore, the total population after a year is 50 + 1440 = 1490.

The final answer is: 1490"
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the width, length, and depth of the pool. 

Volume = width * length * depth
Volume = 14 * 25 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the number of gallons needed, we do the following:

Gallons = Volume * 5.9
Gallons = 1400 * 5.9
Gallons = 8260 gallons

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon, so we multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon:

Cost = Gallons * $0.10
Cost = 8260 * $0.10
Cost = $826

The final answer is: $826"
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to calculate the number of blue and yellow sticks first.

We know there are 9 red sticks and 5 more blue sticks than red. So, the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14.

The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is 14 - 3 = 11.

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks: 9 (red) + 14 (blue) + 11 (yellow) = 34.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the distance traveled by Matteo, we multiply his speed by the time he traveled: 55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles.

To find the distance traveled by Shandy, we multiply his speed by the time he traveled: 45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles.

Now, we subtract the distance traveled by Matteo from the distance traveled by Shandy to find the difference: 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles.

The final answer is: 230"
"To find the number of female students, we need to first find the number of male students and then subtract that from the total number of students.

First, let's find the number of students over 16 years old. Since half of the students are over 16 years old, we have:
3000 / 2 = 1500 students over 16 years old.

Next, let's find the number of male students over 16 years old. Since one-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male, we have:
1500 / 4 = 375 male students over 16 years old.

Now, let's find the number of female students over 16 years old. Since there are 1500 students over 16 years old and 375 are male, we have:
1500 - 375 = 1125 female students over 16 years old.

Next, let's find the number of students under 16 years old. Since half of the students are under 16 years old, we have:
3000 / 2 = 1500 students under 16 years old.

Now, let's find the number of male students under 16 years old. Since one-half of the students under 16 years old are male, we have:
1500 / 2 = 750 male students under 16 years old.

Now, let's find the number of female students under 16 years old. Since there are 1500 students under 16 years old and 750 are male, we have:
1500 - 750 = 750 female students under 16 years old.

Now, let's find the total number of female students. We have 1125 female students over 16 years old and 750 female students under 16 years old, so:
1125 + 750 = 1875 female students.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1875}$"
"To find out how many laps each person can run, we need to calculate their individual lap counts.

Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.

Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.

Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.

Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract Quinn's lap count from Bethany's lap count: 10 - 5 = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume the capacity of the tank is 18000 gallons. 

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is (1/4) * 18000 = 4500 gallons. 

Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped (3/4) * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

The total amount of water in the tank after the first day is 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is (2/3) * 4500 = 3000 gallons. 

Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is (1/3) * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water in the tank after the second day is 7875 + 3000 + 1125 = 12000 gallons.

Since the tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, the amount of water remaining for the tank to be full is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is: 6000"
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into two parts: the first part where the power bank loses 9% of its capacity per hour for 5 hours, and the second part where it loses 7% of its capacity per hour for 3 hours.

Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is x.

In the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour. This means that after 5 hours, the charge remaining is 91% of the initial charge. We can represent this as:

x - (0.09x * 5) = 0.91x

After 5 hours, the charge remaining is 0.91x.

In the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. This means that after 3 hours, the charge remaining is 93% of the charge after 5 hours. We can represent this as:

0.91x - (0.07 * 0.91x * 3) = 0.91x * 0.93

Simplifying the equation, we get:

0.91x - 0.1917x = 0.8463x

The charge remaining after 8 hours is 0.8463x.

We are given that the charge remaining after 8 hours is 28% of the initial charge. We can set up the equation:

0.8463x = 0.28x

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.8463:

x = 0.28 / 0.8463
x = 0.33

So, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 33%.

The final answer is: 33"
"To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment, we first need to calculate her total weekly earnings. 

Her hourly wage is $10, and her hourly tips are $15, so her total hourly earnings are $10 + $15 = $25 per hour.

Since she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are $25 * 40 = $1000.

Next, we need to find out how much Janet needs to save for the down payment. She wants to save 20% of the cost of the car, which is 20% of $10,000. 

20% of $10,000 is 0.20 * $10,000 = $2000.

Now, we need to divide the amount she needs to save ($2000) by her weekly earnings ($1000) to find out how many weeks she needs to work.

$2000 / $1000 = 2.

So, Janet needs to work 2 weeks to save the down payment.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has spent so far and subtract that from the $10 he has.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items he has already purchased:

- 3 peaches at $0.5 each: 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
- 4 pears at $0.5 each: 4 * $0.5 = $2
- 2 kiwis at $1 each: 2 * $1 = $2
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Total cost so far: $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25

Now, let's subtract the total cost from the $10 Jamaar has:

$10 - $9.25 = $0.75

Since plums cost $0.25 each, we can divide the remaining amount by the cost of one plum to find out how many plums Jamaar can buy:

$0.75 / $0.25 = 3

Jamaar can buy 3 plums.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To find out how many pieces of sweets each of her friends received, we first need to find out how many packs of sweets Anne gave to her friends. 

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, so she gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs to her friends.

Since she gave the packs equally to 10 friends, we divide the number of packs by 10: 13 / 10 = 1.3 packs per friend.

Now, we need to find out how many pieces of sweets are in 1.3 packs. Since each pack has 60 pieces, we multiply 1.3 by 60: 1.3 * 60 = 78.

However, since we can't divide a pack into fractions, we need to find out how many pieces each friend received from a whole pack and the remaining pieces from the 0.3 pack. 

Each friend received 1 whole pack, which is 60 pieces. The remaining 0.3 pack is 0.3 * 60 = 18 pieces. 

So, each friend received 60 + 18 = 78 pieces of sweets."
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the increase in price each year and add it to the original price.

Year 1: 
Original price = $120
Increase in price = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Original price = $126
Increase in price = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Original price = $132.30
Increase in price = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many pictures Olivia put into each album. Since she put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide the total number of pictures by 8.

Total pictures = 72
Number of albums = 8
Pictures per album = Total pictures / Number of albums
Pictures per album = 72 / 8
Pictures per album = 9

Since 3 albums were selfies only and 2 albums were portraits, the remaining 3 albums must be a mix of both selfies and portraits. However, we are not given any information about the mix of selfies and portraits in these 3 albums. 

But we can still find the total number of selfies and portraits. Since 3 albums were selfies only, the total number of selfies is 3 * 9 = 27. Similarly, since 2 albums were portraits only, the total number of portraits is 2 * 9 = 18.

The final answer is:

"To find the total time James spends reading, we need to determine how many sets of 3 pages he reads and then multiply that by the time it takes to read one set, and then add the time it takes to read the remaining pages.

Since James reads 18 pages, we can divide 18 by 3 to find the number of sets of 3 pages he reads: 18 / 3 = 6.

Since it takes James 10 minutes to read one set of 3 pages, we can multiply the number of sets by the time it takes to read one set: 6 * 10 = 60 minutes.

However, James also reads the remaining 0 pages (since 18 is divisible by 3) so we don't need to add any additional time.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the current number of guests in the hotel, we need to calculate the number of guests who checked in and subtract the number of guests who checked out.

Initially, the hotel had 100 guests.

24 guests checked out early, so the number of guests remaining is 100 - 24 = 76.

15 guests opted for a late checkout, so the number of guests remaining is 76 - 15 = 61.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout, which is 2 * 15 = 30.

So, the number of guests now is 61 + 30 = 91.

After dinner, 7 more people checked in, so the final number of guests is 91 + 7 = 98.

The final number of guests in the hotel is 98."

"To find the number of points Aries is sure to get, we need to calculate the number of questions in each category and then find the number of questions Aries is sure to get in each category.

First, let's find the number of questions in each category:

- Easy questions: 40% of 60 = 0.4 * 60 = 24 questions
- Average and difficult questions: 60 - 24 = 36 questions
- Since the rest are equally divided as average and difficult questions, we have 36 / 2 = 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

Now, let's find the number of questions Aries is sure to get in each category:

- Easy questions: 75% of 24 = 0.75 * 24 = 18 questions
- Average questions: 50% of 18 = 0.5 * 18 = 9 questions

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote the number of small stuffed animals as 's' and the number of large stuffed animals as 'l'. We know that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so we can write an equation:

s = 2l

We also know that the price of a small stuffed animal is $4. Since Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small ones, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.

The total amount earned from the sales is $120. We can write an equation based on the total earnings:

4s + 12l = 120

Substituting s = 2l into the equation, we get:

4(2l) + 12l = 120
8l + 12l = 120
20l = 120

Now, we can solve for l:

l = 120 / 20
l = 6

Since s = 2l, we can find the number of small stuffed animals:

s = 2 * 6
s = 12

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe and then multiply it by 40 dwarves and 30 days.

First, let's find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with an iron pickaxe. Since he can mine twice as much with an iron pickaxe as with his bare hands, he can mine 2 * 12 = 24 pounds of ore per day with an iron pickaxe.

Next, let's find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe. Since he can mine 50% more with a steel pickaxe than with an iron pickaxe, he can mine 24 + (0.5 * 24) = 24 + 12 = 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe.

Now, let's find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day with steel pickaxes. Since one dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe, 40 dwarves can mine 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds of ore per day.

Finally, let's find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in 30 days with steel pickaxes. Since they can mine 1440 pounds of ore per day, they can mine 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds of ore in 30 days.

"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to determine the ratio of the price to the number of sandwiches for the first two packages. 

The ratio for the first package is 3/2, and for the second package is 6/4. We can simplify these ratios to find the price per sandwich.

For the first package, the price per sandwich is 3/2 = 1.5 dollars per sandwich.
For the second package, the price per sandwich is 6/4 = 1.5 dollars per sandwich.

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is the same for all packages. Therefore, the price per sandwich is 1.5 dollars.

Now, we can multiply the price per sandwich by the number of sandwiches in the third package to find the total price.

Price of the package with 8 sandwiches = 1.5 * 8 = 12 dollars.

"To find out how much Tom has to pay per month, we need to subtract the amount he paid from the total cost of the bedroom set.

First, let's calculate the amount Tom paid from his old bedroom: $1000.

Now, subtract this amount from the total cost of the bedroom set: $3000 - $1000 = $2000.

This means Tom still owes $2000 for the bedroom set.

Since he has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month, we need to calculate 10% of $2000.

To find 10% of a number, we multiply it by 0.1. So, 10% of $2000 is $2000 * 0.1 = $200.

Therefore, Tom has to pay $200 per month.

"To find the number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons after each event.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

First, 40% of the red balloons burst. 40% of 25 is 0.4 * 25 = 10. So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

Next, Sally released half of the yellow balloons. Half of 12 is 12 / 2 = 6. So, 6 yellow balloons were released, leaving 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.

Then, Sally found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch. 75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6. So, she added 6 blue balloons to her clutch.

"To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to find the probability that he won't get an extension. 

There are two scenarios where Marcus won't have to turn in his homework: 

1. The substitute teacher is present and doesn't collect the homework (50% chance).
2. The normal teacher is present, but the class gets an extension (40% chance), and Marcus also gets a personal extension (20% chance).

However, these two scenarios are not mutually exclusive, as the class can get an extension and Marcus can still get a personal extension. To find the total probability of these two scenarios, we need to add them together and subtract the overlap (the probability that both scenarios occur).

The probability that the class gets an extension and Marcus gets a personal extension is 0.4 * 0.2 = 0.08.

The total probability that Marcus won't have to turn in his homework is 0.5 + 0.4 * 0.2 = 0.5 + 0.08 = 0.58.

To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we subtract this from 1: 1 - 0.58 = 0.42.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the relationship between the number of small beans and the number of large beans. 

Let's start by using the information that eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. This means that the number of small beans is 3 times the number of medium beans.

Since Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, the number of medium beans is 2 times the number of large beans. 

Let's denote the number of large beans as L. Then, the number of medium beans is 2L, and the number of small beans is 3(2L) = 6L.

We are given that it takes 75 large beans to fill Grandpa up. Therefore, L = 75.

Now, we can find the number of small beans by substituting L = 75 into the equation for the number of small beans: 6L = 6(75) = 450.

"To find out how much Melissa makes per hour after expenses, we need to first calculate her total earnings and total expenses.

Total earnings = Daily earnings * Number of days
Total earnings = $15/day * 3 days = $45

Total expenses = Daily expenses * Number of days
Total expenses = $3/day * 3 days = $9

Now, let's calculate her net earnings (total earnings - total expenses)
Net earnings = Total earnings - Total expenses
Net earnings = $45 - $9
Net earnings = $36

Next, we need to find out how many hours she worked in total.
Total hours worked = 6 hours/day * 3 days = 18 hours

"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to first find out how many soda bottles he will place along the driveway. 

The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. To find the number of bottles, we divide the total width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle:

Number of bottles = Total width of driveway / Distance between each bottle
= 24 feet / 3 feet
= 8 bottles

Since it takes Richard 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, we multiply the number of bottles by the time it takes to set off each one:

Total time = Number of bottles * Time per bottle
= 8 bottles * 5 seconds
= 40 seconds

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the total number of apples Uncle Franky has, we need to multiply the number of apples in one box by the number of boxes he ordered. 

Number of apples in one box = 40
Number of boxes ordered = 2

Total number of apples = 40 * 2 = 80

Now, we need to find out how many packs of apples Uncle Franky can make with 80 apples. Each pack contains 8 apples.

Number of packs = Total number of apples / Number of apples in one pack

"To find out how much money Amor will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she bought and subtract it from the initial amount of money she had.

The cost of 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese is 2 x $11 = $22.
The cost of 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese is 3 x $6 = $18.
The total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40.

Amor starts with $50, so subtracting the total cost of the cheese from her initial amount of money, we get:
$50 - $40 = $10.

Therefore, Amor will have $10 left to buy meat.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim lost due to loans and lost income while in college. 

First, let's calculate the total amount of loans he took: 
4 years * $50,000/year = $200,000

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money he lost due to not working while in college. 
His income before college was $25,000/year. 
His income after college is $25,000 * 3 = $75,000/year. 
The difference in income is $75,000 - $25,000 = $50,000/year. 
The total amount of money he lost due to not working while in college is $50,000/year * 4 years = $200,000.

The total amount of money he needs to earn is the sum of the loans and the lost income: 
$200,000 (loans) + $200,000 (lost income) = $400,000.

Now, let's calculate how long it will take him to earn this amount at his new income of $75,000/year:
Time = Total amount / Annual income
Time = $400,000 / $75,000
Time = 5.33 years

The final answer is: 5.33"
"To find the total area of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the two pieces of fabric. 

The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric that are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, we add 2 feet to both the length and the width of the bed.

New length = 6 + 2 = 8 feet
New width = 8 + 2 = 10 feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the new dimensions by 2 to get the total area of fabric needed.

Total area = 2 * (new length * new width)
Total area = 2 * (8 * 10)
Total area = 2 * 80
Total area = 160 square feet

The final answer is: 160"
"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then add them together.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. 
One-fifth of 425 is 425 / 5 = 85. 
So, they delivered 85 + 17 = 102 letters on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. 
Twice as many as Tuesday is 2 * 102 = 204. 
So, they delivered 204 + 5 = 209 letters on Wednesday.

Now, let's add the number of letters delivered each day: 
425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736

"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we need to first calculate their current heights.

Xavier's initial height was 4 feet, which is equal to 48 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches). He grew 3 inches over the summer, so his current height is 48 + 3 = 51 inches.

Cole's initial height was 50 inches and he grew 2 inches over the summer, so his current height is 50 + 2 = 52 inches.

The difference in height between Cole and Xavier is 52 - 51 = 1 inch.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the share of the first person as x. 

Since the second person took $80 more than the first, the second person's share is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is 2(x + 80).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920

Combine like terms:

4x + 240 = 1920

Subtract 240 from both sides:

4x = 1680

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 420

The share of the first person is $420.

The final answer is: $420"
"To find the total hours worked by each painter, we need to calculate the total hours worked in 3 weeks and then divide it by the number of painters and the number of days they worked.

First, let's convert 3 weeks to days: 3 weeks = 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Since they worked 3/8ths of a day every day, we need to find the fraction of a day in hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3/8 of a day is (3/8) * 24 = 9 hours.

Now, we multiply the hours worked per day by the number of days: 9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours.

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4: 189 hours / 4 = 47.25 hours.

The final answer is: 47.25"
"Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. 

Since Rory retrieved four more balls in the first set than in the second, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set, which is given as 19. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for x, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Combine like terms:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms again:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

Number of balls in the first set = x + 4
= 6 + 4
= 10

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation of the car from 2007 to 2010.

The car was bought in 2007, so we need to calculate the depreciation for 3 years (2008, 2009, and 2010).

The initial price of the car is $20,000.

The depreciation rate is 21% per year.

We can use the formula for exponential decay to calculate the price of the car after 3 years:

P(t) = P0 * (1 - r)^t

where P(t) is the price at time t, P0 is the initial price, r is the depreciation rate, and t is the time.

In this case, P0 = $20,000, r = 0.21, and t = 3.

P(3) = 20000 * (1 - 0.21)^3
P(3) = 20000 * (0.79)^3
P(3) = 20000 * 0.4914
P(3) = 9814

The price of the car in 2010 is $9814.

"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to first calculate how many cups she drinks in 30 days and then convert that to gallons.

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. To find out how many cups she drinks in 30 days, we multiply the number of cups she drinks per day by 30:

8 cups/day * 30 days = 240 cups

Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we can convert the total number of cups to gallons by dividing by 16:

240 cups / 16 cups/gallon = 15 gallons

So, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days.

"To find the total cost of renovating the kitchen floor, we need to calculate the total number of tiles required and then multiply it by the cost of each tile.

First, we need to find the area of a single tile. Since each tile is a square with a side length of 1 ft, the area of a single tile is:

Area of a single tile = side length * side length
= 1 ft * 1 ft
= 1 sq ft

Now, we need to find the total number of tiles required to cover the kitchen floor. We can do this by dividing the total area of the kitchen floor by the area of a single tile:

Total number of tiles = Total area of kitchen floor / Area of a single tile
= 200 sq ft / 1 sq ft
= 200 tiles

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the total number of tiles by the cost of each tile:

Total cost = Total number of tiles * Cost of each tile
= 200 tiles * $12
= $2400

"To find the total number of loads of laundry Greg does in a week, we need to calculate the total number of twin and king size sheets he puts on the beds and divide that by the number of sheets he can wash at a time.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. Since each twin bed requires 1 set of sheets and the king size bed requires 1 set of sheets, the total number of sets of sheets he puts on the beds is 4 + 1 = 5.

Since the laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time, we need to calculate how many twin sets he needs to wash in a week. Since he has 4 twin beds, he needs to wash 4 / 2 = 2 twin sets of sheets every week.

The king size bed requires 1 set of sheets per week, so he needs to wash 1 king set of sheets every week.

In total, Greg needs to wash 2 twin sets + 1 king set = 3 sets of sheets every week.

Since the laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time, we need to calculate how many loads of laundry he does in a week. Since he needs to wash 2 twin sets of sheets every week, he needs to do 2 / 2 = 1 load of twin sheets. He also needs to do 1 load of king size sheets. So, in total, he does 1 + 1 = 2 loads of laundry every week.

To find the total number of loads of laundry he does in a year, we multiply the number of loads he does in a week by the number of weeks in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total number of loads of laundry he does in a year is 2 * 52 = 104.

"To find out how many days the cat food will last, we need to divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the amount of cat food each cat eats per day (60 grams).

First, we need to calculate the total amount of cat food each cat eats per day. Since Imma has 3 cats and each cat eats 60 grams of food twice a day, the total amount of cat food each cat eats per day is:

60 grams * 2 = 120 grams per cat per day

Now, we multiply the amount of cat food each cat eats per day by the number of cats:

120 grams per cat per day * 3 cats = 360 grams per day

Now, we divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the amount of cat food each cat eats per day (360 grams):

720 grams / 360 grams = 2

"To find the total number of pizzas left, we need to first calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club and the football team, and then subtract that from the total number of pizzas ordered.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. 
70% of 20 is 0.7 * 20 = 14 pizzas eaten by the glee club.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. 
They ate 80% of them, which is 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas eaten by the football team.

The total number of pizzas eaten is 14 (by the glee club) + 32 (by the football team) = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered is 20 (by the glee club) + 40 (by the football team) = 60 pizzas.

"To find the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we first need to find the number of trucks that did not experience mechanical failures. 

Since a quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures, we can find the number of trucks that failed by dividing the total number of trucks by 4.

Number of trucks that failed = Total number of trucks / 4
= 20 / 4
= 5

Now, we can find the number of trucks that did not experience mechanical failures by subtracting the number of failed trucks from the total number of trucks.

Number of trucks that did not fail = Total number of trucks - Number of trucks that failed
= 20 - 5
= 15

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, we can find the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers by multiplying the number of trucks that did not fail by the tons of fertiliser each truck was carrying.

Total tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers = Number of trucks that did not fail * Tons of fertiliser per truck

"To find the total cost of the butter, we first need to determine how much Dennis needs to buy. Since he needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants and he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter.

Since the grocery store has a promotion for buy one pound of butter get one half off, we can calculate the cost as follows:

- For the first pound of butter, the cost is $4.00.
- For the second pound of butter, the cost is $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00 (since it's half off).
- For the third pound of butter, the cost is $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00 (since it's half off).
- For the fourth pound of butter, the cost is $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00 (since it's half off).
- For the fifth pound of butter, the cost is $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00 (since it's half off).
- For the sixth pound of butter, the cost is $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00 (since it's half off).

The total cost is the sum of the costs of all six pounds of butter: $4.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 = $12.00.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, so she spent 0.25x dollars. This means she has 0.75x dollars left.

Riza spent one-third of her money, so she spent 1/3x dollars. This means she has 2/3x dollars left.

Since they each have $60 left, we can set up the following equations:

0.75x = 60
2/3x = 60

We can solve for x by multiplying both sides of the first equation by 4/3 to get:

x = 60 * (4/3)
x = 80

Now that we know x, we can find the total amount of money they have left:

Total money left = (0.75x) + (2/3x)
= 0.75(80) + 2/3(80)
= 60 + 53.33
= 113.33

However, since the problem states that they each have $60 left, we can find the total amount of money they have left by adding the amount each of them has:

Total money left = 60 + 60
= 120

The final answer is: $120"
"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to first determine how many bananas the first and second monkeys eat each day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. 

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day.

Since there are three monkeys in total, the total number of bananas they eat each day is 10 + 14 + x, where x is the number of bananas the third monkey eats.

We know that the total number of bananas is 315, and they last for a week, which is 7 days. So, the total number of bananas eaten in a week is 315 * 7 = 2205.

However, we are interested in the daily consumption, so we need to divide 2205 by 7 to get the daily consumption: 2205 / 7 = 315 bananas per day.

Now, we know that the first and second monkeys eat 10 + 14 = 24 bananas each day. So, the third monkey eats 315 - 24 = 291 bananas each day.

The final answer is: 291"
"To find the number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he placed. 

Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, which is 500 / 2 = 250 pieces. 

Then, he finished another 500 piece puzzle, which is 500 pieces. 

So, the total number of pieces he placed is 250 + 500 = 750 pieces.

The final answer is: 750"
"To find out how many quarters Jenny leaves with, we first need to determine the total cost of the roses and then calculate the change she receives.

Since Jenny bought 15 roses, and the cost of a dozen roses is $15, we can calculate the cost per rose as follows:

Cost per rose = Total cost of a dozen roses / 12
Cost per rose = $15 / 12
Cost per rose = $1.25

Now, we can calculate the total cost of 15 roses:

Total cost = Cost per rose * Number of roses
Total cost = $1.25 * 15
Total cost = $18.75

Jenny arrived with five $5 bills, which is a total of:

Total amount = 5 * $5
Total amount = $25

Now, we can calculate the change she receives:

Change = Total amount - Total cost
Change = $25 - $18.75
Change = $6.25

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the change to quarters:

Number of quarters = Change / Value of a quarter
Number of quarters = $6.25 / $0.25
Number of quarters = 25

Jenny leaves with 25 quarters."
"To find the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to calculate the revenue from each item and add them together.

Revenue from milkshakes: 6 milkshakes * $5.50 each = 6 * 5.50 = $33
Revenue from burger platters: 9 burger platters * $11 each = 9 * 11 = $99
Revenue from sodas: 20 sodas * $1.50 each = 20 * 1.50 = $30

Total revenue = Revenue from milkshakes + Revenue from burger platters + Revenue from sodas
Total revenue = $33 + $99 + $30
Total revenue = $162

The final answer is: $162"
"To find the total waiting time for Paul, we need to calculate the time intervals between the trains and the time Paul needs to wait for his train.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the first train leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves the station, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves the station, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. The third train leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it leaves at 125 minutes.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes. This is the train Paul will board.

Now, we need to find the time Paul needs to wait for his train. Since the current time is not given, we assume Paul starts waiting at time 0. The first train arrives at 10 minutes, but Paul will not board it. The second train arrives at 60 minutes, but Paul will not board it. The third train arrives at 125 minutes, but Paul will not board it. The fourth train arrives at 145 minutes, which is the train Paul will board.

To find the waiting time, we subtract the arrival time of the fourth train from the time Paul starts waiting. However, since we don't know the exact time Paul starts waiting, we can calculate the waiting time from the time the first train arrives to the time the fourth train arrives. The first train arrives at 10 minutes, and the fourth train arrives at 145 minutes. 

The waiting time is 145 - 10 = 135 minutes.

The final answer is: 135"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many toothpicks Melanie has saved so far and then determine how many more weeks it will take her to reach 200 toothpicks.

Melanie saved 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks, so the total number of toothpicks she has saved is:
10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Since Melanie needs 200 toothpicks for the sculpture, and she already has 120, we need to find out how many more toothpicks she needs:
200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Since Melanie saves 10 toothpicks per week, we can divide the number of toothpicks she needs by the number of toothpicks she saves per week to find out how many more weeks it will take her to collect 200 toothpicks:
80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to first find the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch and then the price at which he sold it to his friend.

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price, so the price he paid is:

2000 * 0.75 = $1500

Then, he sold it to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, so the price his friend paid is:

1500 * 1.20 = $1800

Now, to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to find the difference between the original price and the price his friend paid, and then divide it by the original price and multiply by 100:

(2000 - 1800) / 2000 * 100 = 10%

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours and then multiply it by the number of springs and the rate at which they create jellyfish.

There are 60 minutes in an hour and 60 seconds in a minute, so there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour. 

In 4 hours, there are 4 * 3600 = 14400 seconds.

Since each spring creates a new jellyfish every second, the rate of jellyfish creation per spring is 1 jellyfish per second.

If there are 5 springs working at the same rate, the total rate of jellyfish creation is 5 jellyfish per second.

To find the total number of jellyfish created in 14400 seconds, we multiply the rate of jellyfish creation per second by the total number of seconds: 5 jellyfish/second * 14400 seconds = 72000 jellyfish.

The final answer is: 72000"
"To find Frankie's score, we need to first calculate twice Binkie's score and then add 15 to it. 

Binkie's score is 90. Twice Binkie's score is 2 * 90 = 180. 

Now, we add 15 to 180 to find Frankie's score: 180 + 15 = 195.

The final answer is: 195"
"To find the total time it took James to reach the store, we need to calculate the total distance he traveled and then divide it by his walking speed.

First, let's find the total distance James traveled. Since he walked halfway to the store and then walked back home, the total distance is twice the distance from his home to the store. 

Total distance = 2 * distance from home to store
Total distance = 2 * 4 miles
Total distance = 8 miles

Now, we can find the total time it took James to reach the store by dividing the total distance by his walking speed.

Time = Total distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 2 hours

However, this is the total time it took James to walk to the store and back home. Since the question asks for the time it took him to reach the store, we need to divide this time by 2.

Time to reach the store = Total time / 2
Time to reach the store = 2 hours / 2
Time to reach the store = 1 hour

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the total cost of buying bananas individually, we first need to find the total number of bananas. Since Jenny buys 10 bunches with 4 bananas per bunch, the total number of bananas is 10 * 4 = 40.

The cost of buying 40 bananas individually would be 40 * $0.80 = $32.00.

The cost of buying 10 bunches is $3.00 per bunch, so the total cost is 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

The amount saved by buying in bunches is $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation. Let's say Sam gets x feet of fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets x + 60 feet.

We know that the total amount of fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence. To find out how much is left over, we need to subtract the amount Sam gets from the total amount of fence:

100 - 20 = 80

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the rate at which the crocodile grows per year, we need to divide the growth in inches by the number of years. 

Growth per year = Total growth / Number of years
Growth per year = 8 inches / 4 years
Growth per year = 2 inches/year

Now, we can multiply the growth per year by the total number of years to find the total growth in 13 years.

Total growth in 13 years = Growth per year * Total years
Total growth in 13 years = 2 inches/year * 13 years
Total growth in 13 years = 26 inches

The final answer is: 26"
"To find the total earnings, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply it by its price.

Let's start by finding the number of each type of bike sold:

- Total bikes sold: 300
- Trekking bikes: 300 / 2 = 150
- BMX bikes: 300 * 0.15 = 45
- MTB bikes: 300 - (150 + 45) = 105

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each type of bike:
- Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500
- BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250 (since BMX is half the price of MTB, which is $500, so BMX is $500 / 2 = $250)
- MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500

Now, let's add up the earnings from each type of bike to find the total earnings:
$67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250

The final answer is: $131,250"
"To find the number of bales left in the field, we need to calculate the total number of bales made by the farmer and the total number of bales picked up by the truck, and then subtract the number of bales picked up from the number of bales made.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the farmer makes 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck picks up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

The total number of bales made is 30, and the total number of bales picked up is 18. To find the number of bales left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up from the number of bales made: 30 - 18 = 12.

The number of bales left in the field is 12."
"To find the total time John spends learning, we need to calculate the time spent in classes, and the extra time spent on Saturday and Sunday.

First, let's calculate the time spent in classes:
- John takes 2 extra classes, each 40 minutes long, so the total time spent in classes per day is 2 * 40 = 80 minutes.
- He goes to class for 5 days a week, so the total time spent in classes per week is 80 * 5 = 400 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the extra time spent on Saturday and Sunday:
- John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on extra learning time.
- There are 7 days in a week, so the total minutes in a week is 7 * 24 * 60 = 1680 minutes.
- 1/16 of the total minutes is (1/16) * 1680 = 105 minutes.

Now, let's add the time spent in classes and the extra time spent on Saturday and Sunday:
- Total time spent learning per week = 400 + 105 = 505 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:
- 505 minutes / 60 = 8.42 hours.

The final answer is: 8.42"
"To find the height of the ball on its second bounce, we need to first find the initial height from which it is dropped. Since the third floor is 24 feet high, the initial height is 3 * 24 = 72 feet.

The ball bounces to 2/3rds of its starting height with each bounce. So, on the first bounce, the height will be 2/3 * 72 = 48 feet.

On the second bounce, the height will be 2/3 * 48 = 32 feet.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the height of each child in inches. 

The first child is 6 feet tall, which is equal to 6 * 12 = 72 inches.

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child's height is 72 + 2 = 74 inches.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child's height is 74 - 5 = 69 inches.

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child's height is 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

The final answer is: 72"
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to determine the number of bags sold and then multiply it by the price per bag.

Since the orchard sold a total of 2000 apples and each bag contains 10 apples, we can find the number of bags sold by dividing the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag:

Number of bags sold = Total apples / Apples per bag
= 2000 / 10
= 200

Now, we can find the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags sold by the price per bag:

Total earnings = Number of bags sold * Price per bag
= 200 * $5
= $1000

The final answer is: $1000"
"To solve this problem, we can work backwards from the amount of meat left after the Allosaurus ate. 

Let's start with the 270 kilograms of meat left after the Allosaurus ate. Since the Allosaurus ate the last of the meat, the 270 kilograms is what was left after the velociraptors scavenged their share.

The velociraptors scavenged half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. So, if we let x be the amount of meat left after the T-Rex ate, then the velociraptors took half of x, which means they took x/2 kilograms of meat.

Since the velociraptors took x/2 kilograms of meat, the amount of meat left after the velociraptors ate is x - x/2 = x/2 kilograms.

We know that the amount of meat left after the velociraptors ate is 270 kilograms, so we can set up the equation x/2 = 270.

To solve for x, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2, which gives us x = 540.

Now, we know that the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so the amount of meat left after the T-Rex ate is half of the original amount of meat. Let's call the original amount of meat y. Then, the T-Rex ate y/2 kilograms of meat, and the amount of meat left after the T-Rex ate is y - y/2 = y/2 kilograms.

We know that the amount of meat left after the T-Rex ate is 540 kilograms, so we can set up the equation y/2 = 540.

To solve for y, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2, which gives us y = 1080.

The final answer is: 1080"
"To find the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted and then divide it by the coverage of a gallon of paint to find out how many gallons are needed. After that, we can multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon to get the total cost.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so their area is 10 * 8 = 80 square feet each. Since there are two of them, their total area is 2 * 80 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so their area is 5 * 8 = 40 square feet each. Since there are two of them, their total area is 2 * 40 = 80 square feet.

The total area of all the walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

The cost per gallon is $12, so the total cost is 12 * 12 = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To find the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to determine the probability of her choosing a shaken can out of the remaining cans.

Initially, there were 12 sodas. Ellen shook 3 of them, so 3 were shaken and 9 were unshaken. She took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 11 sodas. Her brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 2 shaken and 7 unshaken sodas.

The total number of sodas left is 2 (shaken) + 7 (unshaken) = 9.

The probability of Ellen's friend choosing a shaken can is the number of shaken cans divided by the total number of cans: 2/9.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (2/9) * 100 = 22.22%.

The final answer is: 22.22"
"To find the distance between the two trains after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled and then add those distances together.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled 30 * 3 = 90 miles.

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, we add the distances they have traveled to find the total distance between them: 180 + 90 = 270 miles.

The final answer is: 270"
"To find the total number of days Billy helps, we first need to calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th. 

March has 31 days, and April has 19 days until the 19th. So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, we need to find 20% of 50. To do this, we multiply 50 by 0.2: 50 * 0.2 = 10.

Now, we subtract the number of days off from the total number of days: 50 - 10 = 40.

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so we need to find the total number of hours he works in a day. This is 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

Now, we multiply the number of days he works by the number of people he can help per day: 40 * 6 = 240.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the total number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people that were transported by the buses and the cars, and then subtract that from the total number of people that were present.

First, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the buses:
12 buses * 35 people/bus = 420 people

Next, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the cars:
20 cars * 3 people/car = 60 people

Now, let's add the number of people transported by the buses and the cars:
420 people + 60 people = 480 people

Since the total number of people present is the sum of the people inside the church and the people outside, we can assume that the number of people outside is the sum of the number of cars and buses, which is 20 + 12 = 32 people.

So, the total number of people present is 32 (outside) + 480 (transported) = 512 people.

To find the number of people inside the church, we subtract the number of people outside from the total number of people present:
512 people - 32 people = 480 people

The final answer is: 480"
"To find Jeff's age, we need to first find Martha's age, and then add 10 to it. 

Since Mike is 24 years old and Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, we can find Martha's age by subtracting 4 from Mike's age.

Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
Martha's age = 24 - 4
Martha's age = 20

Now that we know Martha's age, we can find Jeff's age by adding 10 to Martha's age.

Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
Jeff's age = 20 + 10
Jeff's age = 30

"To find the time it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of each slide by the speed at which people slide down.

For the biggest slide: 
Time = Length / Speed
Time = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute
Time = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide:
Time = Length / Speed
Time = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute
Time = 3 minutes

To find the difference in time, we subtract the time it takes to ride the second biggest slide from the time it takes to ride the biggest slide:
Difference = Time for biggest slide - Time for second biggest slide
Difference = 5 minutes - 3 minutes
Difference = 2 minutes

"To find the total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks, we need to calculate the total time spent per day and then multiply it by 5.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 x 15-minute breaks per day. 

First, let's convert the time to minutes: 
- Lunch: 30 minutes
- Breaks: 2 x 15 minutes = 30 minutes
- Total time per day: 30 + 30 = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours: 
60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Now, we multiply the time per day by 5:
1 hour/day * 5 days = 5 hours

The total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks after 5 days is 5 hours."
"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we first need to determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can multiply 8 by 3.5 to find out how many miles Micah ran.

Micah's miles = 8 * 3.5 = 28 miles

Now, we know that the total miles run by all three is 52. We can subtract the miles run by Amber and Micah from the total to find out how many miles Ahito ran.

Ahito's miles = Total miles - (Amber's miles + Micah's miles)
Ahito's miles = 52 - (8 + 28)
Ahito's miles = 52 - 36
Ahito's miles = 16

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total amount she spent after returning the item and then add it to the initial charge.

1. Initial charge: $85.00
2. Return: -$15.00 (since she returned an item)
   New balance after return: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

3. Frying pan purchase: 20% off $20.00
   Discount: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
   Price of frying pan: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

4. Towel purchase: 10% off $30.00
   Discount: 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
   Price of towels: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

5. Total amount spent after return: $70.00 (initial balance) + $16.00 (frying pan) + $27.00 (towels) = $113.00

"Let's break down the information given:

1. A fifth of the jellyfish are large.
2. A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light.
3. The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue.
4. When a UV light turned on, 6 jellyfish changed color.

From point 2, we know that 1/3 of the large jellyfish change color. This means 2/3 of the large jellyfish do not change color. Since the jellyfish that do not change color are small, we can conclude that 2/3 of the large jellyfish are small.

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. Then, the number of large jellyfish is x/5, and the number of small jellyfish is 4x/5 (since 4/5 of the jellyfish are not large).

We know that 2/3 of the large jellyfish are small, so we can set up the equation:

(2/3)(x/5) = 4x/5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

(2x)/15 = 4x/5

Multiplying both sides by 15, we get:

2x = 12x

Subtracting 12x from both sides, we get:

-10x = 0

Dividing both sides by -10, we get:

x = 0

However, this is not a valid solution, as it implies that there are no jellyfish in the tank. Let's re-examine the problem.

We know that 6 jellyfish changed color, and this is 1/3 of the large jellyfish. So, the number of large jellyfish that changed color is 6. Since 1/3 of the large jellyfish changed color, we can set up the equation:

(1/3)(x/5) = 6

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x/15 = 6

Multiplying both sides by 15, we get:

x = 90

The final answer is: 90"

Ben's age = 2 * Chris's age
Ben's age = 2 * 4
Ben's age = 8

Now, we know that Caroline is three times older than Ben.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Lauren needs to save for her retirement. 

First, let's calculate her annual expenses in retirement: 40% of $100,000 is 0.4 * $100,000 = $40,000.

Since she plans to live for 20 years, her total expenses will be $40,000 * 20 = $800,000.

Lauren saves 20% of her salary, which is 0.2 * $100,000 = $20,000 per year.

To find out how many years she needs to work to save $800,000, we can divide the total amount needed by the annual savings: $800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years.

However, this is the total number of years she needs to work to save for her retirement. Since she already has a 20-year retirement period, we need to subtract this from the total number of years: 40 - 20 = 20 years.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the length of each final cut, we need to first divide the total length of the ribbon (100 cm) by 4 to get the length of each of the initial cuts. 

100 cm / 4 = 25 cm

Then, we need to divide the length of each initial cut by 5 to get the length of each final cut.

25 cm / 5 = 5 cm

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total population of the school, we can use the information given about the boys. Since 40% of the school population is 240 boys, we can set up the equation:

0.4x = 240

where x is the total population of the school.

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.4:

x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

Now that we know the total population of the school is 600, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total population:

Number of girls = Total population - Number of boys
= 600 - 240
= 360

The final answer is: 360"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to add the cost of the pots and the garden soil, then subtract the discount.

Cost of pots: $19
Cost of garden soil: $26
Total cost before discount: $19 + $26 = $45
Discount: $7
Total cost after discount: $45 - $7 = $38

The final answer is: $38"
"To find the average height of heels at the party, we need to calculate the total height of all the heels and then divide it by the total number of women.

The three women wearing 4-inch heels have a total height of 3 x 4 = 12 inches.
The three women wearing 2-inch heels have a total height of 3 x 2 = 6 inches.

The total height of all the heels is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.
There are 6 women in total.

The average height of heels at the party is 18 / 6 = 3 inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike, we first need to calculate the total number of days in June. June has 30 days.

Since Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in 30 days, we can calculate her daily target by dividing the total miles by the number of days:

9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

Soledad is planning to hike 125 miles twice a day, which is a total of 250 miles per day. To find out how many more miles per day she needs to hike, we subtract her planned daily miles from her target daily miles:

310 miles per day - 250 miles per day = 60 miles per day

So, Soledad must hike 60 more miles per day to complete her journey on time.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the total amount the store will receive after selling all the balls, we need to calculate the total revenue from each color of balls and add them together.

The number of red balls is 3, and each red ball costs $9, so the total revenue from red balls is 3 x $9 = $27.

The number of blue balls is 11, and each blue ball costs $5, so the total revenue from blue balls is 11 x $5 = $55.

The number of green balls is 25, and each green ball costs $3, so the total revenue from green balls is 25 x $3 = $75.

Now, we add the revenues from all the balls together: $27 + $55 + $75 = $157.

The final answer is: $157"
"To find out how much James will have left, we first need to determine how much Pierre and Paul will take. 

Pierre wants a quarter of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/4 = 3 kg. 

Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/3 = 4 kg.

So, Pierre and Paul will take 3 + 4 = 7 kg in total.

Since they started with 12 kg, James will have 12 - 7 = 5 kg left.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the temperature in the morning, we need to subtract the temperature drop from the initial temperature and then add the temperature increase.

Initial temperature = 2 degrees Celsius
Temperature drop = 8 degrees Celsius
Temperature increase = 3 degrees Celsius

Temperature in the morning = Initial temperature - Temperature drop + Temperature increase
= 2 - 8 + 3

The final answer is: $\boxed{-3}$"
"To find out how much money Raymond has left, we need to subtract the amount he spent from the initial amount he had, and then add the amount he saved.

Raymond initially had $21. He saved $11, so we add that to his initial amount: $21 + $11 = $32.

Then, he spent $5 on a comic book and $19 on a puzzle, so we subtract the total amount he spent from the new total: $32 - ($5 + $19) = $32 - $24 = $8.

Therefore, Raymond has $8 left.

The final answer is: $8"
"To find the cost of each book, we need to first determine how much money Anna spent on the books. Since she had a budget of $16 and has $2 left, she spent $16 - $2 = $14 on the books.

Since she bought 2 books and they cost the same amount of money, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

2x = 14

where x is the cost of each book.

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 14 / 2
x = 7

So, each book cost $7."
"To find the number of students enrolled this year, we need to calculate 20% of the previous year's enrollment and add it to the previous year's enrollment.

Previous year's enrollment: 50 students
20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 students

Add the increase to the previous year's enrollment: 50 + 10 = 60 students

Therefore, there are 60 students enrolled in the calligraphy class this year.

"To find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times, we need to first find the rate at which the light blinks per minute. 

The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. To find the rate per minute, we divide the number of blinks by the number of minutes: 

255 blinks / 5 minutes = 51 blinks per minute.

Now that we know the rate, we can find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times by dividing the total number of blinks by the rate per minute:

459 blinks / 51 blinks per minute = 9 minutes.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the total number of male and female fishes, we need to add the initial and additional numbers of each type.

Initial male guppies: 4
Additional male guppies: 2
Total male guppies: 4 + 2 = 6

Initial female guppies: 7
Additional female guppies: 1
Total female guppies: 7 + 1 = 8

Initial male goldfishes: 3
Additional male goldfishes: 2
Total male goldfishes: 3 + 2 = 5

Initial female goldfishes: 5
Additional female goldfishes: 3
Total female goldfishes: 5 + 3 = 8

Now, let's find the total number of male and female fishes:
Total male fishes: 6 (guppies) + 5 (goldfishes) = 11
Total female fishes: 8 (guppies) + 8 (goldfishes) = 16

To find the difference between the number of female and male fishes, we subtract the total number of male fishes from the total number of female fishes:
Difference = Total female fishes - Total male fishes = 16 - 11 = 5

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total time they all took to do their chores, we need to calculate the time taken by each person and add them together.

Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia, so Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours to walk the dog.

Dior took 4 hours longer than Amalia, so Dior took 4 + 4 = 8 hours to do laundry.

Now, let's add the time taken by each person: 
4 (Amalia) + 6 (Megan) + 8 (Dior) = 18

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 18 hours."
"To find the total distance John drives in a round trip, we need to calculate the distance of a one-way trip and then multiply it by 2.

The distance of a one-way trip can be calculated using the formula: distance = speed * time. 

Given that the speed is 70 mph and the time is 2 hours, we can plug in the values: distance = 70 * 2 = 140 miles.

Since John makes a round trip, we need to multiply the one-way distance by 2: 140 * 2 = 280 miles.

However, we need to find the total distance driven in a month. Since John visits his parents twice a month, we need to multiply the round-trip distance by 2: 280 * 2 = 560 miles.

The final answer is: 560"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how far Sofie will walk in 7 days. Since Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, we can multiply the number of miles she walks per day by the number of days:

10 miles/day * 7 days = 70 miles

Since Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship:

Sofie's distance = 2 * Brian's distance

We know that Sofie's distance is 70 miles, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

70 = 2 * Brian's distance

To find Brian's distance, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

Brian's distance = 70 / 2
Brian's distance = 35 miles

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

The final answer is: 35"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers and then find out how many toys the fifth worker needs to produce to meet the remaining demand.

First, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the 2 workers who produce 6 toys an hour:

2 workers * 6 toys/hour * 10 hours = 120 toys

Next, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour:

2 workers * 4 toys/hour * 10 hours = 80 toys

Now, let's add the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers:

120 toys + 80 toys = 200 toys

Since the manufacturer still needs 20 toys to meet the order, the total number of toys needed is 400. We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

200 (toys produced by the first 4 workers) + x (toys produced by the fifth worker) = 400

Subtracting 200 from both sides of the equation gives us:

x = 200

However, this is the total number of toys the fifth worker needs to produce in 10 hours. To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we need to divide x by 10:

x / 10 = 200 / 10
x = 20 toys/hour

The fifth worker produces 20 toys per hour.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To find the total weight of Elijah's dogs, we first need to find the weight of each of his dogs. 

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so we multiply 60 by 1/4 to find the weight of Elijah's first dog: 
60 * (1/4) = 15 pounds.

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so we multiply 60 by 1/2 to find the weight of Elijah's second dog:
60 * (1/2) = 30 pounds.

Now, we add the weights of Elijah's two dogs to find the total weight of his dogs: 
15 + 30 = 45 pounds.

To find the total weight of all three dogs, we add the weight of Kory's dog to the total weight of Elijah's dogs:
60 + 45 = 105 pounds.

The final answer is: 105"
"To solve this problem, let's work backwards from the information given.

Let's denote the number of stickers Seth had initially as 'x'.

Kris had 7 stickers, which is half of what he received from Luis. So, Luis gave Kris 7 * 2 = 14 stickers.

Luis had 14 stickers, which is half of what he received from Seth. So, Seth gave Luis 14 * 2 = 28 stickers.

Therefore, Seth had 28 stickers in the beginning.

The final answer is: 28"
"To find the total number of M&M's John has, we need to calculate the total weight of the M&M's and then multiply it by the number of M&M's per ounce. 

First, let's find the total weight of the M&M's: 
3 large bags * 10 ounces per bag = 30 ounces

Since an ounce of M&M's has 30 M&M's, the total number of M&M's is:
30 ounces * 30 M&M's per ounce = 900 M&M's

Now, we need to find out how many small bags John can make with 10 M&M's in each bag:
Total M&M's / M&M's per small bag = 900 M&M's / 10 M&M's per bag = 90 small bags

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the number of days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we need to first calculate half of the circumference of the earth.

The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. Half of the circumference is 40,000 / 2 = 20,000 kilometers.

Since Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day, we can find the number of days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers by dividing 20,000 by 400.

20,000 / 400 = 50

So, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth.

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the speed of the 2nd fastest car first, and then use that to find the speed of the fastest car.

Let's denote the speed of the average car as A, the speed of the 2nd fastest car as B, and the speed of the fastest car as C.

We are given that the average car can go 120 miles per hour, so A = 120.

We are also given that the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, so B = 5A = 5 * 120 = 600.

Now, we are given that the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car, so C = 1.25B = 1.25 * 600 = 750.

Therefore, the fastest car can go 750 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 750"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Liam's age two years ago. Since Liam is 16 years old now, two years ago he was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.

Two years ago, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince, so we can set up the equation:

14 = 2x

where x is Vince's age two years ago.

To find x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 14 / 2
x = 7

Since x is Vince's age two years ago, we need to add 2 to find his current age:

Vince's current age = 7 + 2
Vince's current age = 9

The final answer is: 9"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so let's call this number A. 
2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. Let's call the number of eggs Sarah painted S. Then, Camden painted S + 12 eggs.
3. Since Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, we can write the equation: S + (S + 12) = 30
4. Simplifying the equation, we get: 2S + 12 = 30
5. Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get: 2S = 18
6. Dividing both sides by 2, we get: S = 9
7. Since Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.
8. Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, the total number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline is 56 - 30 = 26. 
9. Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, each of them painted 26 / 2 = 13 eggs.
10. The difference between the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold is 21 - 13 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we first need to find the total number of boxes and the total weight of the crayons and boxes.

Since Nik wants to put the crayons into groups of 8, we can divide the total number of crayons by 8 to find the number of boxes: 
200 crayons / 8 crayons per box = 25 boxes.

Since each box weighs 8 ounces and there are 16 ounces in a pound, we can find the weight of one box in pounds: 
8 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 0.5 pounds per box.

Now, we can find the total weight of the boxes: 
25 boxes * 0.5 pounds per box = 12.5 pounds.

Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce, we can find the total weight of the crayons in ounces: 
200 crayons * 1 ounce per crayon = 200 ounces.

Now, we can convert the total weight of the crayons to pounds: 
200 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 12.5 pounds.

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is the sum of their individual weights: 
12.5 pounds (boxes) + 12.5 pounds (crayons) = 25 pounds.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how much John makes, we need to calculate the total number of planks he can make and then multiply it by the price of each plank.

First, let's find out how many logs John can make from the tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, and the tree is 80 feet long, we can calculate the length of the logs he can make:

80% of 80 feet = 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet

Since each log is 4 feet long, we can divide the total length of the logs by the length of each log to find the number of logs:

64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs

Now, let's find out how many planks John can make from each log. Since he cuts 5 planks from each log, and he has 16 logs, we can multiply the number of logs by the number of planks per log:

16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks

Finally, let's calculate the total amount of money John makes by selling each plank for $1.2:

80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96

The final answer is: $96"
"To find the total amount of money they all have together, we need to first find the salary of Valerie's brother and their mother.

Let's denote Valerie's brother's salary as x. Since Valerie earns 1/2 of what her brother earns, we can write an equation:

Valerie's salary = 1/2 * x
5000 = 1/2 * x
x = 5000 * 2
x = 10000

So, Valerie's brother earns $10,000 per month.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so we can write an equation:

Mother's salary = 2 * (Valerie's salary + brother's salary)
Mother's salary = 2 * (5000 + 10000)
Mother's salary = 2 * 15000
Mother's salary = 30000

Now, we can find the total amount of money they all have together by adding their individual salaries:

Total amount = Valerie's salary + brother's salary + mother's salary
Total amount = 5000 + 10000 + 30000
Total amount = 40000

The final answer is: $40000"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the speed at which Grandma walks on the beach and the sidewalk. Let's denote the speed on the beach as x miles per minute. Since she walks at twice the rate on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.

We know that she spends 40 minutes walking on the beach, and the distance covered on the beach is 2 miles. So, we can use the formula: distance = speed * time. 

For the beach: 2 = x * 40
x = 2 / 40
x = 1/20 miles per minute

Now that we know her speed on the beach, we can find her speed on the sidewalk, which is 2x = 2 * (1/20) = 1/10 miles per minute.

The time taken to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk is 1 / (1/10) = 10 minutes. 

The total time taken to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk is 10 minutes, and the total distance on the sidewalk is 1 mile. So, the total time taken to walk on the sidewalk is 10 minutes.

The total time taken to walk on the beach is 40 minutes, and the total distance on the beach is 2 miles. So, the total time taken to walk on the beach is 40 minutes.

The total time taken to walk the entire 3-mile walk is 40 + 10 = 50 minutes.

"To find out how many more weeks it will take Jane to save a total of $60, we first need to calculate how much she has saved so far. 

She has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so the total amount saved is 4 * 8 = $32.

Now, we need to find out how much more she needs to save to reach $60. This is 60 - 32 = $28.

Since she saves $4 per week, we can divide the amount she needs to save ($28) by the amount she saves per week ($4) to find out how many more weeks it will take: 28 / 4 = 7.

3 trees had 7 blue birds each, so the total number of blue birds in these trees is 3 x 7 = 21.

2 trees had 4 blue birds each, so the total number of blue birds in these trees is 2 x 4 = 8.

1 tree had 3 blue birds.

Now, let's add up the total number of blue birds: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote the number of marbles Bob initially has as 'x'. 

If he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 * 12 = 24. So, he receives 24 more marbles. 

Now, we can write an equation to represent the situation: x + 24 = 60. 

To find the initial number of marbles Bob has, we need to isolate 'x'. We can do this by subtracting 24 from both sides of the equation: x = 60 - 24. 

x = 36.

Now that we know Bob initially has 36 marbles, we need to find out how many marbles he will have if he loses 10. 

To do this, we subtract 10 from 36: 36 - 10 = 26.

Let's denote the temperature of the second bottle as x degrees. 

When Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle into his water bottle, the total volume of water in the bottle is 5 ounces. 

Since the temperature of the mixture is at least 40 degrees, we can set up the following inequality:

(33 * 4 + x * 1) / 5 ≥ 40

Simplifying the inequality, we get:

132 + x ≥ 200

Subtracting 132 from both sides, we get:

x ≥ 68

So, the second bottle must be at least 68 degrees.

The final answer is: 68"
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of cows:

Initial number of cows = 50
Cows brought per day = 20
Number of days in three weeks = 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days
Total cows brought = 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
Total number of cows = Initial number of cows + Total cows brought = 50 + 420 = 470 cows

Next, let's calculate the number of chickens:

Initial number of chickens = 20
Chickens brought per day = 10
Total chickens brought = 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens
Total number of chickens = Initial number of chickens + Total chickens brought = 20 + 210 = 230 chickens

Now, let's add the total number of cows and chickens to find the total number of animals on the farm:

Total number of animals = Total number of cows + Total number of chickens = 470 + 230 = 700

"To find the cost of each single bagel, we first need to calculate the total cost of the 4 packs of bagels with the 10% discount. 

The original cost of 4 packs of bagels is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00. 

Since Russell receives a 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of $40.00. 
10% of $40.00 = 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00

Now, we subtract the discount from the original cost to get the discounted cost: 
$40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

Since each pack has 9 bagels, the total number of bagels is 4 * 9 = 36 bagels.

To find the cost of each single bagel, we divide the discounted cost by the total number of bagels: 
$36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00 per bagel.

The final answer is: $1.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. We know that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops, so we can write this as:

Gomer's scoops = 23 - 5
Gomer's scoops = 18

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes it takes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. We know that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops, so we can write this as:

Potatoes per scoop = 6 - 3
Potatoes per scoop = 3

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes it takes to make 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. We can multiply the number of scoops by the number of potatoes per scoop:

Total potatoes = Gomer's scoops * Potatoes per scoop
Total potatoes = 18 * 3
Total potatoes = 54

"To find the total number of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we need to calculate the number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately, and then add them together.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days is:
3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

In the next 30 days, Chester increases his egg consumption to 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in the next 30 days is:
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Now, we add the total number of eggs from both periods:
90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens:
240 eggs / 12 = 20 dozens

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we first need to determine the total number of red jellybeans. We are given that there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans, and there are 17 green jellybeans. 

Let's denote the number of red jellybeans as R and the number of green jellybeans as G. We know that R = 2G. Since we are given that G = 17, we can substitute this value into the equation to find R.

R = 2G
R = 2(17)
R = 34

Now that we know there are 34 red jellybeans, we can find the total number of non-blue jellybeans by adding the number of green and red jellybeans.

Total non-blue jellybeans = G + R
Total non-blue jellybeans = 17 + 34
Total non-blue jellybeans = 51

Since there are a total of 60 jellybeans, we can find the number of blue jellybeans by subtracting the total number of non-blue jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans.

"To find the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade, we need to calculate the total number of lemons he collects in one year and then multiply it by 10.

First, let's find the total number of lemons he collects in one year:

Number of trees: 5
Lemons per tree per year: 6

Total lemons per year = Number of trees * Lemons per tree per year
Total lemons per year = 5 * 6
Total lemons per year = 30

Now, let's find the total number of lemons he collects in a decade (10 years):

Total lemons in a decade = Total lemons per year * 10
Total lemons in a decade = 30 * 10
Total lemons in a decade = 300

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the number of women who remained on the bus, we first need to find the total number of women on the bus initially. 

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, we can let the number of men be 5x and the number of women be 9x. 

Since the total number of passengers is 84, we can set up the equation: 5x + 9x = 84

Combine like terms: 14x = 84

Divide both sides by 14: x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the initial number of women: 9x = 9 * 6 = 54

After 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining is: 54 - 20 = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold per day. 

Let's denote the number of sunflowers sold per day as 'x'. Since each sunflower costs $2, the total amount earned from sunflowers per day is 2x. We are given that Faraday earned $26 from sunflowers per day, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 26

To find the value of 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 26 / 2
x = 13

So, Faraday sold 13 sunflowers per day.

Now, we need to find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold in total after 3 days. We can multiply the number of sunflowers sold per day by the number of days:

Total sunflowers sold = 13 * 3
Total sunflowers sold = 39

The final answer is: 39"
"To find out how much money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks he buys, the total revenue from selling 60% of the rocks, and then find the difference between the two.

First, let's find out how many rocks Adam can buy with $100. Since each rock costs $5, we divide $100 by $5:

$100 / $5 = 20 rocks

Now, Adam sells 60% of his inventory, which is 60% of 20 rocks:

60% of 20 = 0.6 * 20 = 12 rocks

The revenue from selling 12 rocks at $7 each is:

12 rocks * $7/rock = $84

The cost of buying 20 rocks at $5 each is:

20 rocks * $5/rock = $100

Since Adam only sells 12 rocks, he still has 8 rocks left, which he didn't sell. The cost of these unsold rocks is:

8 rocks * $5/rock = $40

The total cost of the rocks is the cost of the rocks he sold plus the cost of the rocks he didn't sell:

$100 (total cost) = $84 (cost of rocks sold) + $16 (cost of rocks not sold)

However, we need to find the cost of the rocks he didn't sell to calculate the loss. The cost of the rocks he didn't sell is $40.

The total revenue is $84, and the total cost is $100. The loss is the difference between the total cost and the total revenue:

Loss = Total cost - Total revenue
Loss = $100 - $84
Loss = $16

However, this is not the correct answer. We need to consider the cost of the rocks he didn't sell, which is $40. The correct loss is the difference between the cost of the rocks he didn't sell and the revenue he would have gotten if he sold all the rocks:

Loss = Cost of rocks not sold - (Revenue from selling all rocks * (1 - 0.6))
Loss = $40 - ($100 * (1 - 0.6))
Loss = $40 - ($100 * 0.4)
Loss = $40 - $40
Loss = $0

However, this is also not the correct answer. The correct answer is the difference between the cost of the rocks he didn't sell and the revenue he would have gotten if he sold all the rocks. The revenue he would have gotten if he sold all the rocks is $140 ($7 * 20). The correct loss is:

Loss = Cost of rocks not sold - Revenue from selling all rocks

"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of days it takes Lauren to complete each type of picture scene. 

Let's first find the number of days it takes Lauren to complete each type of picture scene:

- Large-sized picture scenes: 45 / 5 = 9 days
- Medium-sized picture scenes: 36 / 6 = 6 days
- Small-sized picture scenes: 49 / 7 = 7 days

Now, we need to find the LCM of 9, 6, and 7. 

The prime factorization of 6 is 2 * 3
The prime factorization of 7 is 7
The prime factorization of 9 is 3^2

To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the numbers:
LCM(6, 7, 9) = 2 * 3^2 * 7 = 2 * 9 * 7 = 126

So, it will take Lauren 126 days to complete all the picture scenes.

The final answer is: 126"
"To find out how many eggs each child receives, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of children.

Since Chatty prepared three dozen eggs, we first need to convert the dozen to a numerical value. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so three dozen eggs would be 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Now, we divide the total number of eggs (36) by the number of children (4) to find out how many eggs each child receives:

36 ÷ 4 = 9

Each child receives 9 eggs."
"To find out how much Jen spends on food for her fish in May, we need to calculate the total cost of food for one month. 

First, we need to determine the number of days in May. May has 31 days.

Since each fish needs $1 worth of food per day, and Jen has 3 fish, the daily cost of food for all her fish is 3 * $1 = $3.

To find the total cost for the month, we multiply the daily cost by the number of days in May: $3 * 31 = $93.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many seashells Carrey collected. Let's denote the number of seashells Carrey collected as x.

Since Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, the number of seashells Carlos collected is 2x.

We are also given that Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, so the number of seashells Jim collected is 2x + 5.

We know that the total number of seashells collected by all three is the sum of the seashells collected by each of them: x + 2x + (2x + 5) = 5x + 5.

Since they divided the seashells equally among themselves, each person got (5x + 5) / 3 seashells.

However, we still need to find the value of x. We can do this by using the information that Jim collected 27 seashells. Since Jim collected 2x + 5 seashells, we can set up the equation 2x + 5 = 27.

Solving for x, we get 2x = 22, and x = 11.

Now that we know x, we can find the number of seashells each person got: (5x + 5) / 3 = (5(11) + 5) / 3 = (55 + 5) / 3 = 60 / 3 = 20.

On Saturday and Sunday, Mason eats 5 carrots each day. So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is 5 + 5 = 10.

Now, we add the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend to get the total number of carrots he eats in a week: 20 + 10 = 30.

"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song and add it to the length of the first song.

The first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. To find 60% of 5 minutes, we multiply 5 by 0.6:

5 * 0.6 = 3 minutes

So the second song is 3 minutes longer than the first song. To find the length of the second song, we add 3 minutes to the length of the first song:

5 + 3 = 8 minutes

Now we have the lengths of both songs: 5 minutes for the first song and 8 minutes for the second song. To find the total time of the cassette, we add the lengths of both songs:

5 + 8 = 13 minutes

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes.

"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the profit from each day and then add them together.

On Monday, Linus bought 2 devices for $20 each, so the total cost is 2 x $20 = $40. He sold each device for twice the original price, which is 2 x $20 = $40. So, the profit from each device is $40 - $20 = $20. Since he bought 2 devices, the total profit from Monday is 2 x $20 = $40.

On Tuesday, Linus bought 4 devices for $20 each, so the total cost is 4 x $20 = $80. He sold each device for twice the original price, which is 2 x $20 = $40. So, the profit from each device is $40 - $20 = $20. Since he bought 4 devices, the total profit from Tuesday is 4 x $20 = $80.

The total profit is the sum of the profit from Monday and Tuesday, which is $40 + $80 = $120.

"To find the length of Carl's cane, we need to first determine Carl's height. We know that Isabel is 7 feet tall and Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel. 

Isabel's height = 7 feet
Ned's height = Isabel's height - 2 feet
Ned's height = 7 - 2
Ned's height = 5 feet

Since Carl is one foot taller than Ned, we can find Carl's height by adding 1 foot to Ned's height.

Carl's height = Ned's height + 1 foot
Carl's height = 5 + 1
Carl's height = 6 feet

We are given that Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. To find the length of the cane, we can divide Carl's height by 2.

Length of Carl's cane = Carl's height / 2
Length of Carl's cane = 6 / 2
Length of Carl's cane = 3 feet

"To find out how many bottles Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles required to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

Since each bottle covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, we need 100% / 20% = 5 bottles.

For 2300 people, we need 2300 * 5 = 11500 bottles.

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, to find out how many more bottles it needs to produce, we subtract the number of bottles it can produce from the total number of bottles required: 11500 - 4200 = 7300.

The final answer is: 7300"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that Carla has 8 identical octuplets. 

She dresses 3/4 of them in purple, which is (3/4) * 8 = 6 babies in purple.

She dresses 1/4 of them in blue, which is (1/4) * 8 = 2 babies in blue.

Now, we are told that all the blue-wearers and 1/3 of the purple wearers also wear bows. 

The number of blue-wearers wearing bows is 2 (all of them).

The number of purple-wearers wearing bows is (1/3) * 6 = 2.

So, the total number of babies wearing bows is 2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4.

The number of babies wearing purple is 6, and the number of babies wearing purple and a bow is 2.

To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we divide the number of babies wearing purple and a bow by the total number of babies wearing bows, and then multiply by 100.

(2 / 4) * 100 = 50%

Reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

First, let's find the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday. 

Reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

Now, let's find the total number of reports received on Wednesday by subtracting the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday, and then subtracting that result from the total number of reports received last week.

Reports received on Wednesday = Total reports received last week - (Reports received on Monday and Tuesday + Reports received on Thursday and Friday)
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - (1907 + 2136)
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - 4043
Reports received on Wednesday = 1125

The final answer is: 1125"
"To find the total amount of money Abraham will earn, we need to calculate the amount of money he earned from each sale and add them together.

First, Abraham sold half of his land for $50. Since he owns 80 square meters, half of that is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters. 

Next, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. Since he owns 80 square meters, 1/4 of that is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters.

The remaining land is 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters.

He sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, the amount of money he earned from selling the remaining land is 20 * 3 = $60.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money he earned. He earned $50 from the first sale, $30 from the second sale, and $60 from the third sale. 

Total money earned = $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

The final answer is: $140"
"To find Geb's age, we need to first find half of Haley's age and then subtract 10 from it.

Haley's age is 26 years. Half of 26 is 26 / 2 = 13.

Now, we subtract 10 from 13 to find Geb's age: 13 - 10 = 3.

Geb is 3 years old."
"To find out how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to first find out how many face masks he uses in a day. 

Since Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out and he goes out three times a day, the total number of face masks he uses in a day is 2 * 3 = 6.

Now, to find out how many face masks he uses in 2 days, we multiply the number of face masks he uses in a day by 2. 

6 * 2 = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Cole hid 3 dozen eggs. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 3 dozen is equal to 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

2. Lamar finds 5 eggs.

3. Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 2 * 5 = 10 eggs.

4. Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.

5. Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

6. To find the total number of eggs found, we add the number of eggs found by each person: 5 (Lamar) + 10 (Stacy) + 8 (Charlie) + 4 (Mei) = 27 eggs.

7. To find the number of eggs still hidden, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the initial number of eggs: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the total amount John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of apartments and the total amount he gets paid per week.

First, let's find the total number of apartments in the first two complexes:
200 apartments * 2 = 400 apartments

The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, so we need to find 60% of 400 and add it to 400:
60% of 400 = 0.6 * 400 = 240
Total apartments in the last complex = 400 + 240 = 640

Now, we add the total number of apartments in all three complexes:
400 + 640 = 1040 apartments

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so the total number of collections per week is:
1040 apartments * 3 = 3120 collections per week

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so the total amount he makes per week is:
3120 collections * $0.40 = $1248

The final answer is: $1248"
"To find the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and add them up.

- In the 5th year, the tree produces 50 fruits.
- In the 6th year, it produces 3 times the initial amount, which is 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
- In the 7th year, it produces 7 times the initial amount, which is 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
- In the 8th year, it produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree, but we don't know the production of a 10-year-old tree yet. Let's denote the production of a 10-year-old tree as x. So, in the 8th year, it produces x - 200 fruits.
- In the 9th year, the tree doesn't produce any fruit.
- In the 10th year, a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

We know that a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits. We also know that an 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. So, the production of an 8-year-old tree is 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

Now, let's add up the fruits produced each year:
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350

The final answer is: $\boxed{2350}$"
"To find out how much money Jack has now, we need to calculate the amount Sophia gave him and add it to his initial amount.

Sophia gave Jack 1/5 of her $100. To find 1/5 of $100, we multiply $100 by 1/5.

1/5 * $100 = $20

Now, we add the amount Sophia gave Jack to his initial amount:

$100 (initial amount) + $20 (amount given by Sophia) = $120

So, Jack now has $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as x. Since the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, the length of the yellow rope is x + 7.

The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so its length is 4x.

The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can write the equation:

x + (x + 7) + 4x = 37

Combine like terms:

6x + 7 = 37

Subtract 7 from both sides:

6x = 30

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 5

Now that we know the length of the blue rope, we can find the length of the red rope:

Length of red rope = 4x = 4(5) = 20

The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's assume Ronnie was given x dollars initially. Since Rissa was given thrice as much, Rissa was given 3x dollars.

After giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, Ronnie is left with x - y dollars and Rissa is left with 3x - y dollars, where y is the amount they each gave to their little sister.

We are given that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, so we can set up the equation:

3x - y = (4/5)(3x)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3x - y = 12x/5

Multiplying both sides by 5 to eliminate the fraction, we get:

15x - 5y = 12x

Subtracting 12x from both sides, we get:

3x - 5y = 0

Now, we need to find the value of y. Since Ronnie and Rissa gave an equal amount of money to their little sister, we can set up the equation:

x - y = (1/2)(3x - y)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - y = (3/2)x - (1/2)y

Multiplying both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction, we get:

2x - 2y = 3x - y

Multiplying both sides by -1, we get:

y = -x

Now, substitute y = -x into the equation 3x - 5y = 0:

3x - 5(-x) = 0

Expanding the equation, we get:

3x + 5x = 0

Combine like terms:

8x = 0

Dividing both sides by 8, we get:

x = 0

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the value of y:

y = -x
y = -0

"Let's break down the information given:

- There are four colors of paint: red, white, purple, and yellow.
- There are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint.
- Half the mural is yellow.
- The total amount of paint used is 12 pints.

Since half the mural is yellow, the other half is a combination of red, white, and purple paint. Let's denote the amount of red, white, and purple paint as x. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple, the total amount of these three colors is 3x.

The total amount of paint used is 12 pints, and half of it is yellow. So, the amount of yellow paint is 12 / 2 = 6 pints.

The other half of the mural is a combination of red, white, and purple paint, which is 3x. Since the total amount of paint used is 12 pints, we can set up the equation:

6 (yellow) + 3x (red, white, and purple) = 12

Subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:

3x = 6

Divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 2

Since x represents the amount of red, white, and purple paint, and there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple, the amount of red paint is x = 2 pints.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom:
Area of one bedroom = length * width = 20 * 12 = 240 square feet

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms = 4 * 240 = 960 square feet

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area = 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet

The rest of the house is given as 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas together:
Total area of the house = area of bedrooms + area of living room + area of the rest of the house
= 960 + 1200 + 1000
= 3160 square feet

On Wednesday, she counts double the number of clouds from Tuesday, which is 2 * 6 = 12 clouds.

On Thursday, she counts double the number of clouds from Wednesday, which is 2 * 12 = 24 clouds.

On Friday, she counts double the number of clouds from Thursday, which is 2 * 24 = 48 clouds.

Now, let's add up the number of clouds for each day: 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93.

20% of 100 = 0.2 * 100 = 20
Number of pods in the new box = 100 + 20 = 120

Since the price remains the same, we can calculate the number of cycles for $1 by dividing the total number of pods by the cost of the box and then by the number of pods per cycle.

Cost of the box = $12
Number of pods per cycle = 1
Cost per pod = $12 / 120 = $0.1

Number of cycles for $1 = 1 / $0.1 = 10

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since he withdraws 1000 dollars in 20 dollar bills, he has 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home. So, he has 50 - 10 = 40 bills left.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he uses 20 bills to pay for the bill. This leaves him with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

4. Thomas then triples his money. Since he has 20 bills left, and each bill is worth $20, he has a total of 20 * 20 = $400. Tripling this amount gives him 3 * 400 = $1200.

5. He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. To find out how many 5 dollar bills he has, we need to divide the total amount of money by 5. 1200 / 5 = 240.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals in the first half.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals.

Now, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B in the second half, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

So, in the first half, the total number of goals scored is 4 (team A) + 2 (team B) = 6 goals. In the second half, the total number of goals scored is 2 (team A) + 8 (team B) = 10 goals.

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (first half) + 10 (second half) = 16 goals.

The final answer is: 16"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much chalk is left after Monday and then determine how many days it will last.

Initially, the teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk. On Monday, he uses 45% of the chalk, which is 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches.

So, the remaining chalk is 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches.

Since the teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches, we need to find out how many days it will last until it reaches 2 inches.

Let's assume the teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day. We can set up an equation to represent the remaining chalk after each day:

Initial chalk = 2.75 inches
Daily usage = 0.20 * Initial chalk
Remaining chalk = Initial chalk - Daily usage

We can calculate the remaining chalk for each day until it reaches 2 inches:

Day 1: 2.75 - (0.20 * 2.75) = 2.2 inches
Day 2: 2.2 - (0.20 * 2.2) = 1.76 inches
Day 3: 1.76 - (0.20 * 1.76) = 1.4 inches
Day 4: 1.4 - (0.20 * 1.4) = 1.12 inches
Day 5: 1.12 - (0.20 * 1.12) = 0.896 inches

"To find the number of students not on varsity, we first need to find the number of students on varsity. 

One-third of the girls are on varsity, so the number of girls on varsity is 12 * (1/3) = 4.

One-fourth of the boys are on varsity, so the number of boys on varsity is 12 * (1/4) = 3.

The total number of students on varsity is 4 (girls) + 3 (boys) = 7.

Since there are 12 boys and 12 girls in the class, the total number of students is 12 + 12 = 24.

The number of students not on varsity is 24 (total students) - 7 (students on varsity) = 17.

"To find out how many face masks Johnny bought, we need to first determine how many face masks Mike bought, which is given as 5. 

Next, we are told that Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike. ""Thrice as many"" means 3 times the number of face masks Mike bought. 

So, 3 times the number of face masks Mike bought is 3 * 5 = 15. 

Then, we add 2 more to this number to find out how many face masks Johnny bought: 15 + 2 = 17.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we need to first determine the total number of teeth the dentist works on. 

The dentist drills 4 teeth, and then caps 7 more teeth than he drills. So, the number of teeth capped is 4 + 7 = 11.

The total number of teeth the dentist works on is 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15.

Now, we need to find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes. To do this, we divide the total number of teeth the dentist works on by the total number of James' teeth and multiply by 100.

(15 / 30) * 100 = 50%

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the amount of milk that Mr. Marcellus returned, we need to calculate 2/5 of the total amount of milk he purchased. 

2/5 of 4000 gallons is (2/5) * 4000 = (2 * 4000) / 5 = 8000 / 5 = 1600 gallons.

Since the cost per gallon is $3.5, the total refund Mr. Marcellus received is 1600 * $3.5 = $5600.

The final answer is: $5600"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Colin's current age as C and Wendy's current age as W.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:

W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:

C + 25 = (5/3)(C + 7)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2:

20 = C

So, Colin is 20 years old now.

"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we first need to determine the total number of books he can buy with $27000. 

Since he can buy 100 books for $500, we can find the total number of books he can buy by dividing the total amount he has ($27000) by the cost of 100 books ($500).

Total number of books = $27000 / $500 = 54

Now, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books he can buy per school.

Books per school = Total number of books / Number of schools
= 54 / 3
= 18

The final answer is: 18"

2. Newton picked up the two apples, put one in his pocket, and threw the other apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. Now, he has 1 apple in his pocket and 5 new apples, making a total of 6 apples.
3. Newton picked up these 5 new apples and put all but one in his pocket. This means he kept 1 apple and put 4 in his pocket. Now, he has 1 apple in his hand and 4 apples in his pocket, making a total of 5 apples.
4. He threw the remaining apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out. Now, he has 5 apples (from the previous step) and 6 new apples, making a total of 11 apples.
5. Newton picked up all the remaining apples, which is 11 apples.

Therefore, Newton brought home 11 apples to make a pie.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the total cost of Ali's order, we need to calculate the total number of coal bags and multiply it by the cost per bag.

First, let's find the total number of coal bags:
Total coal in kilos = 850 kg
Weight of each bag = 50 kg
Number of bags = Total coal in kilos / Weight of each bag
= 850 kg / 50 kg
= 17 bags

Now, let's find the total cost:
Cost per bag = $18
Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
= 17 bags * $18
= $306

The final answer is: $306"
"To find out how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of slices each type of pizza that her friends will eat.

For the cheese pizza, each friend eats 6 slices, and there are 6 friends, so the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten is 6 friends * 6 slices/friend = 36 slices.

For the pepperoni pizza, each friend eats 4 slices, and there are 6 friends, so the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten is 6 friends * 4 slices/friend = 24 slices.

Since the cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices and the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, we need to find out how many whole pizzas of each type Kate needs to buy to meet the demand.

For the cheese pizza, Kate needs to buy enough to cover 36 slices. Since each pizza has 12 slices, she needs 36 slices / 12 slices/pizza = 3 pizzas.

For the pepperoni pizza, Kate needs to buy enough to cover 24 slices. Since each pizza has 8 slices, she needs 24 slices / 8 slices/pizza = 3 pizzas.

Therefore, Kate needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas.

The total number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy is 3 (cheese) + 3 (pepperoni) = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total number of miles Sam ran this week, we need to add up the miles he ran on each day.

On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Sam ran 3 miles each day. Since there are 3 days, we multiply 3 miles by 3 to get the total miles for these days: 3 * 3 = 9 miles.

On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day. Since there are 2 days, we multiply 5 miles by 2 to get the total miles for these days: 5 * 2 = 10 miles.

Now, we add the total miles from the two sets of days: 9 miles + 10 miles = 19 miles.

The final answer is: 19"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the net rate at which Jay is building snowballs. 

Jay builds 20 snowballs in 1 hour, which is equivalent to 60 minutes. So, his rate of building snowballs is 20/60 = 1/3 snowballs per minute.

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. To find the rate at which snowballs melt, we divide the number of snowballs that melt by the time it takes for them to melt: 2/15 snowballs per minute.

Now, we need to find the net rate at which Jay is building snowballs. This is the rate at which he builds snowballs minus the rate at which they melt: (1/3) - (2/15) = (5/15) - (2/15) = 3/15 = 1/5 snowballs per minute.

Since Jay wants to have 60 snowballs, we need to find out how many minutes it will take to build 60 snowballs at a rate of 1/5 snowballs per minute. 

To do this, we divide the total number of snowballs by the net rate: 60 / (1/5) = 60 * 5 = 300 minutes.

However, this is the time it would take if Jay didn't melt any snowballs. Since he melts 2 snowballs every 15 minutes, we need to account for this. 

Let's calculate how many snowballs Jay will have after 300 minutes, considering the melting rate: 

In 300 minutes, Jay builds 300 * (1/3) = 100 snowballs. However, 2 * (300/15) = 40 snowballs melt. So, Jay will have 100 - 40 = 60 snowballs.

But we need to find the time it takes to have 60 snowballs, not the time it takes to have 60 snowballs after 300 minutes. 

Let's re-evaluate the situation: Jay builds 20 snowballs in 60 minutes, but 2 melt every 15 minutes. 

In 60 minutes, Jay builds 20 snowballs, but 4 melt (2 every 15 minutes). So, Jay has 20 - 4 = 16 snowballs after 60 minutes.

In the next 60 minutes, Jay builds another 20 snowballs, but 4 more melt. So, Jay has 16 + 20 - 4 = 32 snowballs after 120 minutes.

In the next 60 minutes, Jay builds another 20 snowballs, but 4 more melt. So, Jay has 32 + 20 - 4 = 48 snowballs after 180 minutes.

In the next 60 minutes, Jay builds another 20 snowballs, but 4 more melt. So, Jay has 48 + 20 - 4 = 64 snowballs after 240 minutes.

In the next 60 minutes, Jay builds another 20 snowballs, but 4 more melt. So, Jay has 64 + 20 - 4 = 80 snowballs after 300 minutes.

In the next 60 minutes, Jay builds another 20 snowballs, but 4 more melt. So, Jay has 80 + 20 - 4 = 96 snowballs after 360 minutes.

In the next 60 minutes, Jay builds another 20 snowballs, but 4 more melt. So, Jay has 96 + 20 - 4 = 112 snowballs after 420 minutes.

In the next 60 minutes, Jay builds another 20 snowballs, but 4 more melt. So, Jay has 112 + 20 - 4 = 128 snowballs after 480 minutes.

In the next 60 minutes, Jay builds another 20 snowballs, but 4 more melt. So, Jay has 128 + 20 - 4 = 144 snowballs after 540 minutes.

In the next 60 minutes, Jay builds another 20 snowballs, but 4 more melt. So, Jay has 144 + 20 - 4 = 160 snowballs after 600 minutes.

In the next 60 minutes, Jay builds another 20 snowballs, but 4 more melt. So, Jay has 160 + 20 - 4 = 176 snowballs after 660 minutes.

"To find Jim's age, we need to first find John's age 20 years ago. Since John is 28 now, we subtract 20 from 28 to get his age at the time of the Digimon release.

28 - 20 = 8

Since John was twice as old as Jim at the time of the Digimon release, we can set up an equation to find Jim's age:

John's age = 2 * Jim's age
8 = 2 * Jim's age

To find Jim's age, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

Jim's age = 8 / 2
Jim's age = 4

So, Jim is 4 years old now."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Doxa ate 1 slice of apple. 
Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so her sister ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.
Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so her brother ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

Now, let's add up the number of slices each of them ate: 
Doxa ate 1 slice, her sister ate 2 slices, and her brother ate 3 slices. 
So, the total number of slices they ate is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, the remaining bandages after the first day are x - 38 + 50.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. The remaining bandages after the second day are (x - 38 + 50) - 28.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they had 100 bandages added. They used half a pack, which is 25 bandages. The remaining bandages after the third day are ((x - 38 + 50) - 28) + 100 - 25.

We are given that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. So, we can set up the equation:

(x - 38 + 50) - 28 + 100 - 25 = 78

Simplifying the equation:

x - 38 + 50 - 28 + 100 - 25 = 78
x + 57 = 78

Subtracting 57 from both sides:

x = 21

The initial number of bandages is 21. 

The final answer is: 21"
"To find the total cost of the haircut, we need to calculate the cost of the color and the cost of the haircut separately and then add them together.

The cost of the color is $40.

The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch, and May's hair was cut from 10 inches to 8 inches, so the length of hair cut is 10 - 8 = 2 inches. 

The cost of the haircut is 2 inches * $30 per inch = $60.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the color and the cost of the haircut: $40 + $60 = $100.

"To find Jen's total earnings for April, we need to calculate her total hours worked and her total attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her total hours worked in April:

Jen works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week. Since there are 4 weeks in April, we multiply the number of hours she works per day by the number of days she works per week and then by the number of weeks:

7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week = 45 hours/week
45 hours/week * 4 weeks = 180 hours

Now, let's calculate her total earnings from her hourly rate:

Jen's hourly rate is $1.5, so we multiply her total hours worked by her hourly rate:

180 hours * $1.5/hour = $270

Next, let's calculate her attendance bonus. Since she had complete attendance for the month, she receives an additional $10 for each day she worked. There are 6 days in a week, and she worked 4 weeks, so:

6 days/week * 4 weeks = 24 days
24 days * $10/day = $240

Now, let's add her total earnings from her hourly rate and her attendance bonus:

$270 + $240 = $510

The final answer is: $510"

"To find the total amount of blood in ten sharks, we first need to find the amount of blood in one shark. Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and a whale has 40 gallons of blood, a shark has 3 * 40 = 120 gallons of blood.

Now, we need to find the total amount of blood in ten sharks. To do this, we multiply the amount of blood in one shark by 10: 120 * 10 = 1200 gallons.

The final answer is: 1200"
"To find the total number of people who entered the restaurant, we need to calculate the number of people who entered at each time and add them up.

First, 50 people entered in the morning. 
Then, 40 more people entered at 10:00. 
Next, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is 2 * 40 = 80 people. 
Finally, 3 times as many people as the number that came in first (50) entered by evening, which is 3 * 50 = 150 people.

Now, let's add up the number of people who entered at each time: 
50 (morning) + 40 (10:00) + 80 (lunch) + 150 (evening) = 320

The total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day is 320."
"To find the total number of pens Alain has, we need to calculate the number of red pens and black pens separately and then add them together.

First, we know that Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens. Since each pack has 5 pens, the total number of red pens is 5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 red pens.

We are also told that Alain's mom bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens. Since there are 25 red pens, the number of black pens is 2 * 25 = 50 black pens.

To find the total number of pens Alain has, we add the number of red pens and black pens together: 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens.

The final answer is: 75"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the cost of the scotch and the cognac separately and then add them together.

Let's start with the scotch. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for $600. To find the cost per bottle, we can divide the total cost by the number of bottles:

Cost per bottle of scotch = Total cost / Number of bottles
= $600 / 10
= $60 per bottle

Now, let's find the number of bottles of cognac. John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so he buys 2 x 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The cost of cognac is 50% more than the cost of scotch. To find the cost per bottle of cognac, we can multiply the cost per bottle of scotch by 1.5 (which is 100% + 50%):

Cost per bottle of cognac = Cost per bottle of scotch x 1.5
= $60 x 1.5
= $90 per bottle

Now, we can find the total cost of the cognac by multiplying the cost per bottle by the number of bottles:

Total cost of cognac = Cost per bottle of cognac x Number of bottles of cognac
= $90 x 20
= $1800

Finally, we can find the total amount John spends by adding the cost of the scotch and the cognac:

Total amount spent = Total cost of scotch + Total cost of cognac
= $600 + $1800
= $2400

The final answer is: $2400"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

- On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
- He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, so he planted 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees on the first day.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, so the total number of White Oak trees planted is 20 + 10 = 30.
He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than he planted on the first day, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees. So, the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is 40 + 10 = 50.

Now, let's calculate the total number of trees planted in the two days:
- Total White Oak trees = 20 (first day) + 10 (second day) = 30
- Total Lodgepole Pine trees = 40 (first day) + 50 (second day) = 90

Total number of trees planted = 30 (White Oak) + 90 (Lodgepole Pine) = 120

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the amount of root beer available for each person to drink, we need to calculate the total amount of root beer remaining after all the events.

Initially, Fred made 24 gallons of root beer.

On the first day, 4 gallons were consumed by his children, so the remaining amount is:
24 - 4 = 20 gallons

On the second day, 7 gallons were spilled, so the remaining amount is:
20 - 7 = 13 gallons

On the third day, 5 gallons were consumed by Ronnie, so the remaining amount is:
13 - 5 = 8 gallons

On the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party, and they shared the remaining root beer equally. To find the amount each person got, we divide the remaining amount by the number of people:
8 / 3 = 2.67 gallons

The final answer is: $\boxed{2.67}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let x be the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

The problem states that ""eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" can be written as 4x + 8.

We are told that this expression is equal to 40, so we can set up the equation:

4x + 8 = 40

To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable x. We can do this by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:

4x = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for x:

x = 32 / 4
x = 8

Therefore, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the number of fish with red stripes, we need to calculate one-third of the total number of fish. 

One-third of 66 is 66 / 3 = 22.

Now, we need to find the number of fish with blue stripes. Since 22 fish have red stripes, we subtract this from the total number of fish to find the remaining fish.

Remaining fish = Total fish - Fish with red stripes
Remaining fish = 66 - 22
Remaining fish = 44

Now, we need to find 5/11 of the remaining fish.

5/11 of 44 = (5/11) * 44
= 5 * 4
= 20

So, the number of fish with blue stripes is 20.

Now, we need to find the total number of fish with red and blue stripes. We add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes.

Total fish with red and blue stripes = Fish with red stripes + Fish with blue stripes
Total fish with red and blue stripes = 22 + 20
Total fish with red and blue stripes = 42

The final answer is: 42"
"To find out how many eyeshadow colors Amy has left, we need to calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors she initially had and then subtract the ones she used up or lost.

Amy initially had 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each, so she had 2 * 4 = 8 eyeshadow colors from the palettes.

She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 eyeshadow colors each, so she had 3 * 6 = 18 eyeshadow colors from the makeup sets.

In total, Amy had 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors.

Her sister stole one of the palettes, which had 4 colors, so Amy lost 4 eyeshadow colors.

Amy used up half of the colors from one makeup set, which had 6 colors. Half of 6 is 3, so she used up 3 eyeshadow colors.

In total, Amy lost 4 + 3 = 7 eyeshadow colors.

So, Amy has 26 - 7 = 19 eyeshadow colors left.

The final answer is: 19"
"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to break down the information given.

1. Mattison's height is 60 inches.
2. The two-story house is 7 times as high as Mattison, so the total height of the house is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.
3. The first floor's floor to ceiling height is three times Mattison's height, so it is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.
4. Since the total height of the house is 420 inches and the first floor's height is 180 inches, the height of the second floor is 420 - 180 = 240 inches.
5. The height of the roof from the second floor's floor is the same as the height of the second floor, which is 240 inches.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the number of shells found by team Gogetters, we first need to find the number of shells found by team Alphas and team The finders.

Team Alphas found 40% of the total 700 shells. 
40% of 700 = 0.4 * 700 = 280 shells.

The remaining shells are 700 - 280 = 420 shells.

Team The finders found 60% of the remaining 420 shells.
60% of 420 = 0.6 * 420 = 252 shells.

The number of shells found by team Gogetters is the remaining shells after team Alphas and team The finders have found their share.
Shells found by Gogetters = 420 - 252 = 168 shells.

The final answer is: 168"
"To find the total miles walked by the first three dogs, we add their individual miles: 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles.

Since there are 4 dogs in total, and they need to walk an average of 3 miles per day, the total miles walked by all 4 dogs is 4 * 3 = 12 miles.

Now, we subtract the miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles walked by all 4 dogs to find the miles walked by the last dog: 12 - 8 = 4 miles.

The last dog needs to walk 4 miles."
"To find out how much money John got from the loan, we need to calculate 40% of the value of his house. 

40% of $250,000 = 0.4 * $250,000 = $100,000

Now, John uses 60% of this amount to pay off his debts. 

60% of $100,000 = 0.6 * $100,000 = $60,000

This means John paid off $60,000 of his debt. To find out how much money he has leftover, we subtract this amount from the loan amount.

$100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000

So, John has $40,000 leftover after paying off his debt.

The final answer is: $40,000"
"To find the total weight of the tunas caught, we need to add the weights of all three tunas. 

Weight of the first tuna = 56 kilograms
Weight of the second tuna = 46 kilograms
Weight of the last tuna = 26 kilograms

Total weight of the tunas = 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 kilograms

Since a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, we can multiply the total weight by the cost per kilogram to find the total earnings.

Total earnings = Total weight of the tunas * Cost per kilogram
Total earnings = 128 * 0.50
Total earnings = 64

The final answer is: $64"
"To find Trinity's profit, we need to first find the selling price of the magazines. 

The cost price of the magazines is $72. 

Trinity sells the magazines at 11/8 of the price she bought them. To find the selling price, we multiply the cost price by 11/8.

Selling price = Cost price * (11/8)
= $72 * (11/8)
= $72 * 1.375
= $99

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the cost price from the selling price.

Profit = Selling price - Cost price
= $99 - $72
= $27

The final answer is: $27"
"To find the total amount of water removed, we need to calculate the amount of water removed by each setting and then add them together.

The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed by the low setting is:
1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters

The medium setting removes twice as much water as the low setting, so it removes 2 liters of water per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed by the medium setting is:
2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters

The high setting removes twice as much water as the medium setting, so it removes 4 liters of water per day (2 * 2 = 4). Since Brian ran it for 5 days, the total amount of water removed by the high setting is:
4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters

Now, we add the total amount of water removed by each setting to find the total amount of water removed:
3 liters (low) + 6 liters (medium) + 20 liters (high) = 29 liters

"To find the total amount of the second medicine, we need to calculate 3 times the amount of the first medicine. 

The first medicine is 14 mL, so 3 times that amount is 3 * 14 = 42 mL.

Now, we need to find the total amount of both medicines in one dose. The first medicine is 14 mL and the second medicine is 42 mL, so the total amount in one dose is 14 + 42 = 56 mL.

To find the total amount in 8 doses, we multiply the amount in one dose by 8. 

56 mL * 8 = 448 mL.

The final answer is: 448"
"To find the combined capacity of both schools, we need to find the capacity of John's school first. 

Since each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, we can find the capacity of one of John's classes by multiplying Ali's class capacity by 1/8.

Capacity of one of John's classes = 120 * (1/8) = 15

Since John has two classes, we multiply the capacity of one class by 2 to find the total capacity of John's school.

Capacity of John's school = 15 * 2 = 30

Now, we add the capacity of Ali's school (which is 120) to the capacity of John's school to find the combined capacity of both schools.

Combined capacity = 120 + 30 = 150

"To find the total amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we need to calculate the total interest he owes and add it to the initial amount borrowed.

First, let's calculate the total interest Stephen owes. The interest rate is 2% of the initial amount borrowed, which is $300. 

Interest = 2% of $300 = 0.02 * $300 = $6

Since Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, the total amount he will pay in these 11 months is:

Total paid in 11 months = $25 * 11 = $275

Now, we need to find the remaining amount that Stephen will pay in the twelfth month. This includes the initial amount borrowed and the interest.

Remaining amount = Initial amount + Interest
= $300 + $6
= $306

However, Stephen has already paid $275 in the previous 11 months. So, the amount he will pay in the twelfth month is the remaining amount minus the amount already paid.

Amount paid in the twelfth month = Remaining amount - Total paid in 11 months
= $306 - $275
= $31

Therefore, Stephen will pay $31 in the twelfth month.

The final answer is: $31"
"To find out how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we need to first calculate the total number of diaper changes required for both children. 

Since each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, and there are 2 children, the total number of diaper changes required per day is 2 * 5 = 10.

Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, so she changes 10 / 2 = 5 diapers per day. 

Since Jordan's wife changes 5 diapers, Jordan changes the remaining half, which is also 5 diapers per day.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total volume of the jar, we need to calculate the area of the base and multiply it by the height. The base is a square with a side length of 6 inches, so the area is 6 * 6 = 36 square inches. Multiplying this by the height of 15 inches gives us a volume of 36 * 15 = 540 cubic inches.

Since the jelly beans are packed with 80% efficiency, we need to divide the volume of the jar by 0.8 to get the total volume that can be occupied by the jelly beans. This gives us 540 / 0.8 = 675 cubic inches.

Each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, so we can divide the total volume that can be occupied by the jelly beans by the volume of a single jelly bean to get the total number of jelly beans. This gives us 675 / 0.15 = 4500 jelly beans.

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we can multiply the total number of jelly beans by 0.3 to get the number of red jelly beans. This gives us 4500 * 0.3 = 1350 red jelly beans.

However, we are given that the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find out how far off Tim's guess was, we need to find the difference between his estimated number of red jelly beans and the true number of red jelly beans. 

First, we need to find Tim's estimated number of red jelly beans.  We know that he knows the total number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar is 4500.  We also know that 30% of the jelly beans are red.  So, we can multiply 4500 by 0.3 to get his estimated number of red jelly beans.  This gives us 4500 * 0.3 = 1350.

The difference between his estimated number of red jelly beans and the true number of red jelly beans is 1350 - 900 = 450.

The final answer is: 450"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, the bus had 20 people.

At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus became 20 + 40 = 60.

At the second stop, 3/4 of the people who entered at the first stop entered the bus. Since 40 people entered at the first stop, 3/4 of 40 is (3/4) * 40 = 30. So, 30 people entered the bus at the second stop. The total number of people on the bus became 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus became 2 * 90 = 180.

The bus has a capacity of 200 people. To find the remaining spaces, we subtract the current number of people from the capacity: 200 - 180 = 20.

"To find the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to calculate the cost of visits for the first 5 years and the cost of visits for the next 3 years.

For the first 5 years, the cost of one visit is $2. Since Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year, the annual cost is 3 * $2 = $6. For 5 years, the total cost is 5 * $6 = $30.

The cost of one visit increases by 150% after 5 years. A 150% increase means the new cost is 2.5 times the original cost. So, the new cost of one visit is $2 * 2.5 = $5. The annual cost for the next 3 years is 3 * $5 = $15. For 3 years, the total cost is 3 * $15 = $45.

The total cost for all visits is the sum of the cost for the first 5 years and the cost for the next 3 years: $30 + $45 = $75.

"To find the total number of students who will try the escape room, we need to multiply the number of students in each grade by the number of grades. 

There are 4 grades (4-7) and 10 students in each grade, so the total number of students is 4 * 10 = 40.

Since only 8 students can try the escape room at a time, we need to divide the total number of students by 8 to find the number of groups.

40 / 8 = 5

Since each group uses 45 minutes, and there are 5 groups, the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room is 5 * 45 = 225 minutes.

"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length can be represented as 4x.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, and it is divided into two pieces. Therefore, the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is equal to 40 feet:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet, we can find the length of the longer piece by multiplying x by 4:

4x = 4(8) = 32

The length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find out how much seasoning Aiden needs, we first need to determine how many pounds of ground beef he needs to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound to find the total pounds of meat needed.

Total meatballs needed = 80
Meatballs per pound = 16

Total pounds of meat needed = Total meatballs needed / Meatballs per pound
Total pounds of meat needed = 80 / 16
Total pounds of meat needed = 5

Now that we know Aiden needs 5 pounds of ground beef, we can find out how much seasoning he needs. He adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat.

Total pounds of meat needed = 5
Seasoning per pound = 2 tablespoons

Total seasoning needed = Total pounds of meat needed * Seasoning per pound
Total seasoning needed = 5 * 2

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the discount, and then add the cost of the nail art.

The original cost of the manicure and pedicure is $35 + $40 = $75.

The discount for both services is 20% of $75, which is 0.20 * $75 = $15.

So, the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure is $75 - $15 = $60.

Since Karen wants to add nail art on each of her fingers, and assuming she has 10 fingers (2 hands with 5 fingers each), the total cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost for Karen would be the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure plus the cost of the nail art, which is $60 + $30 = $90.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given. 

We know that Samantha has 27 paintings. Since Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship:

Samantha's paintings = Shelley's paintings - 12
27 = Shelley's paintings - 12

To find Shelley's number of paintings, we add 12 to both sides of the equation:

Shelley's paintings = 27 + 12
Shelley's paintings = 39

Now that we know Shelley has 39 paintings, and Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, we can set up another equation:

Shelley's paintings = Kim's paintings + 8
39 = Kim's paintings + 8

To find Kim's number of paintings, we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:

Kim's paintings = 39 - 8
Kim's paintings = 31

"To find the price of the toy after the discount in January, we need to follow the given changes in price.

Initially, the price of the toy is $40.

In December, the price increased by 80%. To find the new price, we multiply the initial price by 1.8 (100% + 80% = 180%, or 1 + 0.8 = 1.8).

New price in December = $40 * 1.8 = $72

In January, the price decreased by 50%. To find the new price, we multiply the price in December by 0.5 (100% - 50% = 50%, or 1 - 0.5 = 0.5).

New price in January = $72 * 0.5 = $36

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many pomelos Eve gave away. Let's start by identifying the information given:

- Eve originally had 20 pieces of pomelos.
- After giving some away, she is left with 1/4 of the original amount.

Since Eve is left with 1/4 of the original amount, we can set up an equation to represent this situation:

Let x be the number of pomelos Eve gave away.

The number of pomelos Eve has left is 1/4 of the original amount, which is 20 * 1/4 = 5 pomelos.

We can set up the equation: 20 - x = 5

To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 20 from both sides:

-x = 5 - 20
-x = -15

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by -1:

x = 15

So, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

So, Walter had 60 - 24 = 36 apples remaining.

Walter then gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples. 
25% of 36 is (25/100) * 36 = 9 apples.

So, Walter had 36 - 9 = 27 apples remaining.

Walter sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. 
The total amount of money he received is 27 * 3 = $81.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 50 km/hr * 72 hr
Distance = 3600 km

Now, we can find the percentage of the distance covered by dividing the distance traveled by the total distance and multiplying by 100:
Percentage = (Distance Traveled / Total Distance) * 100
Percentage = (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100
Percentage = 0.6 * 100
Percentage = 60%

The final answer is: 60"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Madeline ate 6 grapes.
2. Her brother used up 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make a full glass, so he used 5 * 6 = 30 grapes.
3. The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.
4. Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie requires 12 grapes. So, the total number of grapes used by their mother is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.
5. To find the total number of grapes at the beginning, we need to add the grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and their mother: 36 + 48 = 84 grapes.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the total number of teachers at school that day, we need to add the number of teachers who were sick and the number of substitute teachers.

Number of teachers who were sick: 13
Number of substitute teachers: 9

Total number of teachers at school that day = Number of teachers who were sick + Number of substitute teachers
= 13 + 9
= 22

However, we also need to consider the teachers who were not sick. Since there were 82 teachers in total, we need to subtract the number of teachers who were sick from the total number of teachers.

Number of teachers who were not sick = Total number of teachers - Number of teachers who were sick
= 82 - 13
= 69

Now, we add the number of substitute teachers to the number of teachers who were not sick to find the total number of teachers at school that day.

Total number of teachers at school that day = Number of teachers who were not sick + Number of substitute teachers
= 69 + 9
= 78

The final answer is: 78"
"To find the total cost of making macaroni and cheese, we need to calculate the cost of the pasta, cheddar cheese, and gruyere cheese.

The cost of the pasta is $1.00 per box. Since Bud makes it once a week, he buys 1 box per week. There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total cost of pasta in a year is 1 * 52 = $52.

The cost of cheddar cheese is $3.00. Since Bud makes it once a week, he buys 1 block of cheddar cheese per week. There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total cost of cheddar cheese in a year is 3 * 52 = $156.

The cost of gruyere cheese is twice the cost of cheddar cheese, which is 2 * $3.00 = $6.00. Since Bud makes it once a week, he buys 1 block of gruyere cheese per week. There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total cost of gruyere cheese in a year is 6 * 52 = $312.

The total cost of making macaroni and cheese in a year is the sum of the cost of pasta, cheddar cheese, and gruyere cheese: $52 + $156 + $312 = $520.

The final answer is: $520"
"To find the total number of minutes the custodian works in a day, we multiply the number of hours they work by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). 

8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes/day

The total number of classrooms is 80, and it takes them 15 minutes per classroom. So, the total time spent cleaning classrooms is:

80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes

To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms, we divide the time spent cleaning by the total time worked in a day and multiply by 100:

(1200 minutes / 480 minutes) * 100 = 250%

However, this is not a percentage of their day, but rather a multiplier. To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms, we need to subtract this multiplier from 100% and then divide by 100:

(100% - 250%) / 100 = -150%

However, this is not a percentage of their day, but rather a negative percentage. This is because the custodian is spending more than their entire day cleaning classrooms, which is not possible. 

Let's re-evaluate the problem. The custodian has 5 days to clean 80 classrooms, and it takes them 15 minutes per classroom. The total time spent cleaning classrooms is:

80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes

The total time available to clean is 5 days * 480 minutes/day = 2400 minutes

The percentage of their time spent cleaning classrooms is:

(1200 minutes / 2400 minutes) * 100 = 50%

The final answer is: 50%"
"To solve this problem, let's first determine the capacity of each shelf. 

Let's denote the capacity of a middle shelf as M. Since the bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, its capacity is 2M. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so its capacity is 2M - 5.

We know that each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books. Therefore, M = 10. 

Now, we can calculate the capacity of the bottom and top shelves:
- Bottom shelf: 2M = 2 * 10 = 20
- Top shelf: 2M - 5 = 2 * 10 - 5 = 15

The total capacity of one bookcase is the sum of the capacities of all its shelves: 10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55.

Since Elly has 110 books, we need to find out how many bookcases are required to hold all of them. 

To do this, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase: 110 / 55 = 2.

Therefore, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find Rose's profit, we first need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

The cost of 5 dozens of eggs is 5 * $2.40 = $12.

Since 1 dozen has 12 eggs, 5 dozens have 5 * 12 = 60 eggs.

Rose will sell each egg for $1 for 3 eggs, so the selling price per egg is $1 / 3 = $0.33.

The total revenue from selling 60 eggs is 60 * $0.33 = $20.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $20 - $12 = $8.

The final answer is: $8"
"To find the number of white hats, we first need to find the number of red and blue hats.

Half of the hats are red, so the number of red hats is 100 * 1/2 = 50.

The remaining hats are 100 - 50 = 50.

3/5 of the remaining hats are blue, so the number of blue hats is 50 * 3/5 = 30.

The rest of the hats are white, so the number of white hats is 50 - 30 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the cost of each stick of jerky, we need to first calculate the total cost of the bag after the discount and then divide it by the number of sticks.

The original price of the bag is $18.00, and there's a $3.00 discount. So, the discounted price is $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00.

Since the price is in dollars, we need to convert it to cents for consistency. There are 100 cents in a dollar, so the discounted price in cents is $15.00 * 100 = 1500 cents.

Now, we divide the total cost in cents by the number of sticks to find the cost per stick: 1500 cents / 30 sticks = 50 cents per stick.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many questions Audrey needs to get right in total to pass the 6th grade. Since she needs to get 70% of the total questions correct, we need to find the total number of questions first.

The first test has 70 questions, and the second test has 40 questions. The total number of questions is 70 + 40 = 110.

To find 70% of 110, we multiply 110 by 0.7: 110 * 0.7 = 77.

So, Audrey needs to get 77 questions correct in total to pass the 6th grade.

Now, let's find out how many questions she got right in the first test. She got 60% of 70 questions correct, which is 70 * 0.6 = 42.

To find out how many questions she needs to get right in the second test, we subtract the number of questions she got right in the first test from the total number of questions she needs to get right: 77 - 42 = 35.

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as S and the number of blueberry cubes as B. We are given that B = 5S - 4.

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so S + B = 116.

Substituting the expression for B into the second equation, we get S + (5S - 4) = 116.

Combine like terms: 6S - 4 = 116.

Add 4 to both sides: 6S = 120.

Divide both sides by 6: S = 20.

Now that we know S, we can find B: B = 5S - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96.

"To find the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years, we need to calculate the total number of games she has played and multiply it by her score per game.

Ara plays 40 games every year, and she has been playing for 4 years. So, the total number of games she has played is:
40 games/year * 4 years = 160 games

Since her score for every game is 21 points, we can multiply the total number of games by her score per game to find the total number of points:
160 games * 21 points/game = 3360 points

The final answer is: 3360"

2. He dropped half of them, so he had 10 / 2 = 5 marbles left.
3. He found 3 more marbles, so now he had 5 + 3 = 8 marbles.
4. However, one of the marbles he picked up was actually a bead, so he got rid of it. This means he had 8 - 1 = 7 marbles left.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, we know that for every 2 customers that come into the car dealership, 1 will buy a car. This means that for every 2 customers, Jason will sell 1 car. 

Since Jason needs to sell 15 cars, he will need 15 * 2 = 30 customers to come into the car dealership.

Next, we know that for every 25 telephone calls, Jason gets 1 customer to come into the car dealership. This means that for every 25 calls, he will get 1 customer. 

To get 30 customers, Jason will need 30 * 25 = 750 telephone calls.

"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of flashlights and the number of candles separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of flashlights. There are 4 people in the house, and each person has a flashlight. So, the total number of flashlights is 4.

Next, let's calculate the number of candles. There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. 

Half of 8 rooms is 4 rooms. So, 4 rooms have 4 small candles each, which is 4 * 4 = 16 small candles. The other 4 rooms have 5 medium candles each, which is 4 * 5 = 20 medium candles. 

The total number of candles is 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles.

Now, we add the number of flashlights and the number of candles together: 4 flashlights + 36 candles = 40.

"To find the total time it takes to solve the Rubik's cube, we need to calculate the time taken for each side and add them up.

The first side takes 5 minutes.
The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so they take 2 * 5 = 10 minutes each.
The last two sides each take half as long as the first side, so they take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes each.

Now, let's add up the time taken for all sides:
5 (first side) + 10 (second side) + 10 (third side) + 2.5 (fourth side) + 2.5 (fifth side) = 30 minutes

The total time it takes to solve the Rubik's cube is: 30"

"To find the number of calls Tim deals with in a day, we need to divide the total hours he spends at work by the time it takes to deal with a call. 

First, we convert the time it takes to deal with a call from minutes to hours: 15 minutes = 15/60 = 0.25 hours.

Now, we divide the total hours Tim spends at work by the time it takes to deal with a call: 6 hours / 0.25 hours = 24 calls per day.

To find the total number of calls he deals with in a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of calls he deals with in a day by 5: 24 calls/day * 5 days = 120 calls.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the total time it takes for Phineas to cover the distance on land and in water. 

Since Phineas is 200 yards away from home, and half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, we can calculate the distance for each part as follows:

Distance on land = 200 yards / 2 = 100 yards
Distance in water = 200 yards / 2 = 100 yards

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for Phineas to cover each part of the distance:

Time on land = Distance on land / Speed on land = 100 yards / 20 yards/minute = 5 minutes
Time in water = Distance in water / Speed in water = 100 yards / 10 yards/minute = 10 minutes

Since Phineas needs to cover both parts of the distance, we add the time it takes for each part:

Total time = Time on land + Time in water = 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes

"To find the total cost of the phone plan, we need to determine the cost of the additional phones and add it to the cost of the main phone.

Let's assume the cost of each additional phone is x. Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of the main phone is 2x.

We know that the main phone plan costs $20, which is equal to 2x. So, we can set up the equation:

2x = 20

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 20 / 2
x = 10

Now that we know the cost of each additional phone is $10, we can find the total cost of the additional phones. There are 4 additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is:

4x = 4 * 10
4x = 40

The total cost of the phone plan is the sum of the cost of the main phone and the cost of the additional phones:

Total cost = 2x + 4x
Total cost = 6x
Total cost = 6 * 10
Total cost = 60

"To find out how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to calculate the total number of doughnuts he sells in a day and then multiply it by the number of days in June.

Since Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day, and 1 dozen is equal to 12, we can calculate the total number of doughnuts he makes in a day as follows:

10 dozen * 12 doughnuts/dozen = 120 doughnuts/day

Since Derrick sells all the doughnuts, we can assume he sells 120 doughnuts every day.

June has 30 days, so the total number of doughnuts Derrick sells in June is:

120 doughnuts/day * 30 days = 3600 doughnuts

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money Derrick makes in June by multiplying the total number of doughnuts sold by the price per doughnut:

3600 doughnuts * $2/doughnut = $7200

"To find the time it takes for John to speak 10 pages, we first need to calculate his new speaking speed in words per minute (WPM) after training.

His original speed is 150 WPM. After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster, so we multiply his original speed by 2.5:

New speed = 150 WPM * 2.5 = 375 WPM

Now, we need to find the total number of words in 10 pages. Each page has 450 words, so:

Total words = 10 pages * 450 words/page = 4500 words

To find the time it takes to speak 4500 words at 375 WPM, we divide the total number of words by the new speed:

Time = Total words / New speed

"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the total number of people he saw on the first three days and add it to the total number of people he saw on the remaining days.

On the first day, Conor saw 50 people.

On the second day, there were 20 more people than on the first day, so the number of people on the second day is 50 + 20 = 70.

On the third day, the number of people was twice the number on the second day, so the number of people on the third day is 2 * 70 = 140.

The total number of people on the first three days is 50 + 70 + 140 = 260.

Since there are 7 days in a week, and Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the remaining 4 days, the total number of people he saw on the remaining days is 60 * 4 = 240.

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 260 + 240 = 500.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.

In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount pop, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.

In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increases to four times the initial rate, which is 4 * 20 = 80 kernels.

In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slows down to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, which is 0.5 * 80 = 40 kernels.

So, the total number of kernels popped in the first 120 seconds is 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 kernels.

However, we need to consider the kernels that popped from the residual heat. A quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds pop from the residual heat, which is 0.25 * 40 = 10 kernels.

Therefore, the total number of kernels that popped is 200 + 10 = 210 kernels.

"To find out how many lemons Tim needs, we first need to calculate the total amount of lemonade he needs to make, which is 4 gallons for the party plus 1 extra gallon for Allen. 

Total gallons = 4 (for the party) + 1 (for Allen) = 5 gallons

Since each gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice, and 5 gallons will require 5 cups of lemon juice, we need to find out how many lemons are needed to get 5 cups of juice.

Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can set up a proportion to find out how many lemons are needed for 5 cups of juice:

6 lemons / 1 cup = x lemons / 5 cups

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

6 * 5 = x * 1
30 = x

So, Tim will need 30 lemons in total.

"To find the total amount of dog food needed in a week, we need to calculate the daily consumption of both breeds and then multiply it by 7.

The German Shepherds consume 5 kilograms each per day, and there are 3 of them. So, the total consumption of German Shepherds per day is 5 * 3 = 15 kilograms.

The Bulldogs consume 3 kilograms each per day, and there are 2 of them. So, the total consumption of Bulldogs per day is 3 * 2 = 6 kilograms.

The total daily consumption of dog food is the sum of the consumption of both breeds: 15 + 6 = 21 kilograms.

To find the total consumption in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7: 21 * 7 = 147 kilograms.

The 4-legged animals have 15 * 4 = 60 legs.

Now, we add the total number of legs from both types of animals: 20 + 60 = 80.

Since we are asked for pairs of animal legs, we need to divide the total number of legs by 2 to get the number of pairs: 80 / 2 = 40.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the total distance traveled by Elvis and then determine the remaining distance from his house.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled in the west direction. Distance = Speed * Time. Since Elvis traveled for 5 hours at 18mph, the distance traveled west is:

Distance west = 18mph * 5 hours = 90 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled in the east direction. Elvis traveled for 8 hours at 18mph, so the distance traveled east is:

Distance east = 18mph * 8 hours = 144 miles

Since Elvis traveled 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, we need to find the net distance from his house. The net distance is the difference between the distance traveled east and the distance traveled west:

Net distance = Distance east - Distance west
= 144 miles - 90 miles
= 54 miles

So, Elvis is 54 miles from his house now.

The final answer is: 54"
"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year and subtract it from the initial value.

Initial value of the boat = $9000

Depreciation in the first year = 30% of $9000 = 0.3 * $9000 = $2700
Value after the first year = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Depreciation in the second year = 30% of $6300 = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890
Value after the second year = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Depreciation in the third year = 20% of $4410 = 0.2 * $4410 = $882
Value after the third year = $4410 - $882 = $3528

The final value of the boat after three years is $3528."
"To find the number of pink candies, we need to first determine the number of orange and yellow candies.

Given that there are 54 red candies, and twice that amount of orange candies, we can calculate the number of orange candies as follows:

Number of orange candies = 2 * Number of red candies
= 2 * 54
= 108

Since there are half as many yellow candies as red candies, we can calculate the number of yellow candies as follows:

Number of yellow candies = (1/2) * Number of red candies
= (1/2) * 54
= 27

Now, we know the total number of candies in the bag is 232. We can calculate the total number of non-pink candies (red, orange, and yellow) as follows:

Total non-pink candies = Number of red candies + Number of orange candies + Number of yellow candies
= 54 + 108 + 27
= 189

To find the number of pink candies, we subtract the total number of non-pink candies from the total number of candies in the bag:

Number of pink candies = Total number of candies - Total non-pink candies
= 232 - 189
= 43

"To find out how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we first need to determine how many marbles Dallas received. We know that Dallas has 21 marbles after dropping 4, so he must have had 21 + 4 = 25 marbles initially.

Since Mazie gave a total of 52 marbles to the twins, and Dallas received 25, we can find out how many marbles Darla received by subtracting 25 from 52.

52 - 25 = 27

So, Mazie gave 27 marbles to Darla.

"To find the total weight of the car, luggage, and children, we need to add their individual weights together.

Total weight = weight of car + weight of luggage + weight of children
Total weight = 1200 + 250 + (2 * 75)
Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150
Total weight = 1600 pounds

Since the force to move the car is 1% of the total weight, we need to find 1% of 1600.

Force = 1% * Total weight
Force = 0.01 * 1600
Force = 16 pounds

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total length of crepe paper James needs, we need to calculate the perimeter of the backyard fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2l + 2w, where l is the length and w is the width.

Given that the length (l) is 20 feet and the width (w) is 15 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

P = 2(20) + 2(15)
P = 40 + 30
P = 70

So, James needs 70 feet of crepe paper to go around the entire fence.

"To find out how much feed is left after a week, we need to calculate the total amount of feed consumed by the pigs in a week and subtract that from the total amount ordered.

First, let's calculate the amount of feed each pig eats in a day: 4 pounds * 2 = 8 pounds per pig per day.

Since there are 5 pigs, the total amount of feed consumed by all pigs in a day is: 8 pounds/pig * 5 pigs = 40 pounds per day.

In a week, there are 7 days, so the total amount of feed consumed by all pigs in a week is: 40 pounds/day * 7 days = 280 pounds.

Now, let's subtract the total amount of feed consumed from the total amount ordered: 300 pounds - 280 pounds = 20 pounds.

So, there are 20 pounds of feed left after a week.

"To find out how many hot dogs John needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of hot dogs required for the party. 

The total number of guests is 20, and each guest will eat 2 hot dogs. So, the total number of hot dogs needed is 20 * 2 = 40.

However, John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party. Therefore, the number of hot dogs he needs to buy is 40 - 4 = 36.

Since each pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs and costs $2, we need to find out how many packs John needs to buy. 

To do this, we divide the total number of hot dogs needed (36) by the number of hot dogs in each pack (6). 

36 / 6 = 6

So, John needs to buy 6 packs of hot dogs.

Since each pack costs $2, the total amount John needs to spend on hot dogs is 6 * 2 = 12.

Initially, there are 5 children following the truck.

On the second street, each of the 5 children is joined by another child, so the total number of children becomes 5 + 5 = 10.

On the third street, each of the 10 children is joined by another 2 children, so the total number of children becomes 10 + (10 * 2) = 10 + 20 = 30.

The original 5 children then give up and leave the group, so we subtract 5 from the total number of children: 30 - 5 = 25.

Therefore, there are 25 children now following the truck.

"To find the total age of all the siblings, we first need to determine the age of the older brother. Since one of the brothers is 12 years old, which is half the age of the older brother, the older brother's age is 12 * 2 = 24 years.

Now, we know that all 3 sisters are 16 years old. 

The total age of the 3 sisters is 16 * 3 = 48 years.

The total age of the 2 brothers is 12 + 24 = 36 years.

The total age of all the siblings is the sum of the total age of the brothers and the total age of the sisters, which is 48 + 36 = 84 years.

"To find the total time spent on meditation and yoga, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity separately and then add them together.

Meditation time per day: 15 minutes (morning) + 15 minutes (night) = 30 minutes
Since Charisma meditates 7 days a week, the total meditation time per week is: 30 minutes/day * 7 days/week = 210 minutes/week

Yoga time per day: 1 hour = 60 minutes
Since Charisma practices yoga 5 days a week, the total yoga time per week is: 60 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 300 minutes/week

Total time spent on meditation and yoga per week: 210 minutes/week (meditation) + 300 minutes/week (yoga) = 510 minutes/week

"To find the total number of seeds, we first need to determine the number of seeds in a small sunflower and a large sunflower.

A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, we can calculate the number of seeds in a small sunflower as follows:
3 dozen * 12 seeds/dozen = 3 * 12 = 36 seeds

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find the number of seeds in a large sunflower, we need to calculate 50% of the seeds in a small sunflower and add it to the number of seeds in a small sunflower:
50% of 36 seeds = 0.5 * 36 = 18 seeds
Number of seeds in a large sunflower = 36 seeds + 18 seeds = 54 seeds

"To find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately and then add them together.

For the T-shirts, Jake buys 2 T-shirts with a buy one get one 50% off deal. This means that the price of one T-shirt is 100% and the price of the other T-shirt is 50% of the original price. 

The original price of each T-shirt is $8. So, the price of the first T-shirt is $8 and the price of the second T-shirt is 50% of $8, which is 0.5 * $8 = $4. 

The total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

For the shoes, the original price is $40 and there is a 40% discount. To find the discount amount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage: 0.4 * $40 = $16. 

The discounted price of the shoes is the original price minus the discount amount: $40 - $16 = $24.

The total amount of money Jake spends at the store is the cost of the T-shirts plus the cost of the shoes: $12 + $24 = $36.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog and then determine how many holes Nate needs to fill in per day to catch up.

The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes dug is:
6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes

Since Nate starts filling in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night, the net number of holes filled in per day is:
9 holes/day - 6 holes/day = 3 holes/day

To find out how many days it takes to fill in all the holes, we divide the total number of holes by the net number of holes filled in per day:
84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can convert the number of days to weeks by dividing by 7:
28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks

Therefore, it will take Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

2. Igor gathered two more test tubes than the number of Petri dishes requested: 14 - 2 = 12 test tubes, but we already know Igor gathered 8 test tubes, so this statement is incorrect. Let's assume Igor gathered 2 more than the number of Petri dishes requested, which means he gathered 16 test tubes (16 = 14 + 2). This is a contradiction, so we will use the first statement that Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested.
3. Igor gathered the correct number of beakers: 7 beakers.
4. The total number of items Igor had placed on the lab bench was 29.

Let's denote the number of beakers Igor lost as x. The total number of items Igor had is the sum of the test tubes, beakers, and Petri dishes he gathered, minus the number of beakers he lost. We can write the equation:

8 (test tubes) + 7 (beakers) + 14 (Petri dishes) - x (beakers lost) = 29

Combine like terms:

29 - x = 29

Subtract 29 from both sides:

"To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws needed for the tables and subtract that from the total number of screws he has.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws, so each table needs 4 x 2 = 8 screws.

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws needed is 8 x 4 = 32 screws.

James has 40 screws, so to find out how many he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the total number of screws he has: 40 - 32 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we need to determine the number of eggs in the second basket and then add it to the number of eggs in the first basket.

Since there are twice as many eggs in the second basket as in the first, we can represent the number of eggs in the second basket as 2 times the number of eggs in the first basket. 

Let's denote the number of eggs in the first basket as x. Then, the number of eggs in the second basket is 2x.

We are given that the first basket contains 10 eggs. So, x = 10.

Now, we can find the number of eggs in the second basket: 2x = 2 * 10 = 20.

To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we add the number of eggs in the first basket to the number of eggs in the second basket: 10 + 20 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to calculate the individual amounts raised by each girl and then add them together.

Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, who raises $430. So, Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750.

Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, who raises $300. So, Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, we add up the amounts raised by each girl: $750 (Kim) + $430 (Alexandra) + $700 (Maryam) + $300 (Sarah) = $2180.

The final answer is: $2180"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, but Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron.
2. Vanessa ran 4 miles.
3. Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.

Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, if Vanessa runs 4 miles, Aaron would run half the distance, which is 2 miles.

Since Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, and he ran 2 miles, we can find his speed. Speed = Distance / Time = 2 miles / 16 minutes = 1/8 miles per minute.

Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's speed is half of Aaron's speed, which is 1/16 miles per minute.

Now, we can find the time it took Vanessa to complete her part of the race. Time = Distance / Speed = 4 miles / (1/16 miles per minute) = 4 * 16 = 64 minutes.

The final answer is: 64"
"To find out how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of line required for the existing dock. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock, we multiply 200 by 3.

200 * 3 = 600

This means he needs 600 feet of line for the existing dock. Since he already has 6 feet of new line, we need to subtract that from the total amount needed.

600 - 6 = 594

So, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total.

The final answer is: 594"
"To find out how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to calculate their daily revenue and then multiply it by the number of days they are open.

Daily revenue = (2 meals * $5 per meal) + $5 bottle of wine
Daily revenue = (2 * $5) + $5
Daily revenue = $10 + $5
Daily revenue = $15

Since they are open 2 days a week, we multiply the daily revenue by 2:
Weekly revenue = Daily revenue * 2
Weekly revenue = $15 * 2
Weekly revenue = $30

The final answer is: $30"
"To find the cost price of each watermelon, we first need to find the total cost of the watermelons. The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80, so the cost price of each watermelon is:

Cost price of 50 watermelons = $80
Cost price of 1 watermelon = $80 / 50
Cost price of 1 watermelon = $1.60

Now, we know that the vendor sold each watermelon at a profit of 25%. To find the selling price of each watermelon, we need to add 25% of the cost price to the cost price:

Selling price of 1 watermelon = Cost price of 1 watermelon + (25% of Cost price of 1 watermelon)
Selling price of 1 watermelon = $1.60 + (0.25 * $1.60)
Selling price of 1 watermelon = $1.60 + $0.40
Selling price of 1 watermelon = $2

However, the question asks for the selling price, not the cost price. So, the selling price of each watermelon is $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the current age of James and then determine the age of John's youngest son.

First, let's find James' current age. We know that James is twice as old as Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years. This means that Dora's current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

We also know that James is 9 years older than John, since John was 19 when James was born. Therefore, John's current age is 19 + 9 = 28 years.

Now, we need to find the age of John's youngest son, who was born when John was 32. This means that John's youngest son is 32 - 28 = 4 years old now.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 4 + 3 = 7 years old.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many oranges each person can peel in an hour and then find the difference.

Ana peels 1 orange in 3 minutes, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges.

Jane peels 1 orange in 4 minutes, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), she can peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

The difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane is 20 - 15 = 5 oranges.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator and the labor cost.

The original cost of the radiator is $400. Mark gets it for 80% off, so he pays 20% of the original cost. 

20% of $400 is 0.2 x $400 = $80.

The labor cost is $50 per hour for 3 hours, so the total labor cost is $50 x 3 = $150.

The total cost is the cost of the radiator plus the labor cost: $80 + $150 = $230.

The final answer is: $230"
"Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as W. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write the equation:

C + W = 20

We also know that the total number of legs is 70. Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, so we can write the equation:

2C + 4W = 70

We can solve this system of equations by multiplying the first equation by 2 to get:

2C + 2W = 40

Now, we can subtract this equation from the second equation to eliminate C:

(2C + 4W) - (2C + 2W) = 70 - 40
2W = 30

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

W = 15

Now that we know the number of cows, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find the number of chickens:

C + 15 = 20
C = 5

Therefore, there are 5 chickens on the farm.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

First, let's find the total number of slices. There are 7 pizzas, and each pizza is cut into 8 slices. 

Total number of slices = 7 pizzas * 8 slices/pizza = 56 slices

There are 4 people in total, including Henry and his 3 friends. 

Number of people = 4

Now, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people to find out how many slices each person can have.

Slices per person = Total number of slices / Number of people
= 56 slices / 4 people
= 14 slices/person

The final answer is: 14"
