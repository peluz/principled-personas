"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to first determine how many eggs she has left after eating and baking. 

Janet starts with 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast, so she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left. Then, she bakes 4 eggs for muffins, leaving her with 13 - 4 = 9 eggs.

Janet sells these 9 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each. To find out her daily earnings, we multiply the number of eggs she sells by the price per egg: 9 * 2 = 18.

The final answer is: $18"
"To find the total number of bolts required, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber first. Since it's half the amount of blue fiber, and there are 2 bolts of blue fiber, we can calculate the white fiber as follows:

White fiber = 2 bolts (blue fiber) / 2 = 1 bolt

Now, we add the blue fiber and white fiber to get the total number of bolts:

Total bolts = 2 bolts (blue fiber) + 1 bolt (white fiber) = 3 bolts

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the profit Josh made, we first need to determine the total value of the house after the repairs. 

The original value of the house was $80,000. Josh put in $50,000 in repairs, which increased the value of the house by 150%. 

Let's denote the increased value as x. We can set up the equation: 

80,000 + 50,000 = x + 1.5x (since 150% increase is the same as multiplying by 2.5 or 1.5)

Combine like terms: 
130,000 = 2.5x

Now, divide both sides by 2.5 to solve for x: 
x = 130,000 / 2.5
x = 52,000

So, the total value of the house after the repairs is $52,000. 

To find the profit, we need to subtract the original cost of the house from the new value: 
Profit = New Value - Original Cost
Profit = 52,000 - 80,000
Profit = -28,000

However, this is the loss, not the profit. Since Josh put in $50,000 in repairs, we need to add this to the original cost to find the total investment: 
Total Investment = Original Cost + Repairs
Total Investment = 80,000 + 50,000
Total Investment = 130,000

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the total investment from the new value: 
Profit = New Value - Total Investment
Profit = 52,000 - 130,000
Profit = -78,000

However, this is still a loss. To find the profit, we need to consider the original cost of the house as the initial investment. The profit is the difference between the new value and the original cost, but since the new value is less than the original cost, it's a loss. 

The correct way to find the profit is to calculate the difference between the new value and the original cost, but since the new value is less than the original cost, it's a loss. However, if we consider the repairs as an investment, the profit is the difference between the new value and the original cost plus the repairs. 

The correct way to find the profit is to calculate the difference between the new value and the original cost plus the repairs. 

New Value = 52,000

"To find the total number of meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total meters he runs in one sprint session and then multiply it by the number of sessions he has in a week.

Since James runs 3 sprints in one session, and each sprint is 60 meters, the total meters he runs in one session is:
3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/session

Since James runs 3 times a week, the total meters he runs in a week is:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

Therefore, James runs a total of 540 meters a week. 

The final answer is: 540"
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to determine the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon meals. 

In the morning, Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups of feed. In the afternoon, she gives them another 25 cups of feed. The total amount of feed given in these two meals is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

Since Wendi feeds each chicken 3 cups of feed per day, and she has a flock of 20 chickens, the total amount of feed needed per day is 3 * 20 = 60 cups.

Now, to find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we subtract the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon meals from the total amount of feed needed per day. 

60 (total feed needed per day) - 40 (feed given in morning and afternoon) = 20 cups.

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining glasses. 

The first glass costs $5. 
The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3. 
The third glass costs 60% of $3, which is 0.6 * $3 = $1.8. 
We can see that the cost of each subsequent glass is 60% of the previous glass's cost. 

The sequence of the cost of the glasses is: $5, $3, $1.8, $1.08, $0.64, $0.384, $0.2304, $0.13824, $0.082944, $0.0497664, $0.02986584, $0.017949504, $0.010794903, $0.00646784128, $0.003863960576, $0.0023281813456, $0.0014005088032.

To find the total cost, we need to sum up the cost of all the glasses. 
Total cost = $5 + $3 + $1.8 + $1.08 + $0.64 + $0.384 + $0.2304 + $0.13824 + $0.082944 + $0.0497664 + $0.02986584 + $0.017949504 + $0.010794903 + $0.00646784128 + $0.003863960576 + $0.0023281813456 + $0.0014005088032
Total cost ≈ $24.999999999999996

However, we can simplify this process by using a geometric series formula. The cost of the glasses forms a geometric series with the first term a = $5 and the common ratio r = 0.6. The number of terms is 16. 

The sum of a geometric series is given by the formula: S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r), where n is the number of terms.

S = $5 * (1 - 0.6^16) / (1 - 0.6)
S ≈ $24.999999999999996

The total cost is approximately $25.

The final answer is: $25"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of sheep in Toulouse and Charleston first, and then add them to the number of sheep in Seattle.

Since Seattle has 20 sheep, and Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, we can find the number of sheep in Charleston by multiplying 20 by 4.

Charleston's sheep = 20 * 4 = 80

Now, since Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, we can find the number of sheep in Toulouse by multiplying the number of sheep in Charleston by 2.

Toulouse's sheep = 80 * 2 = 160

Now, we can add the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle to find the total number of sheep.

Total sheep = Toulouse's sheep + Charleston's sheep + Seattle's sheep
Total sheep = 160 + 80 + 20
Total sheep = 260

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how long it would take Carla to download the file without any interruptions. 

The total size of the file is 200 GB. Carla can download 2 GB/minute. 

Time taken to download the file = Total size / Download speed
Time taken to download the file = 200 GB / 2 GB/minute
Time taken to download the file = 100 minutes

However, Windows forces a restart 40% of the way through the download. 

40% of 200 GB = 0.4 * 200 GB = 80 GB

So, Carla downloads 80 GB before the restart. 

Time taken to download 80 GB = 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes

After the restart, Carla has to download the remaining 120 GB (200 - 80 = 120 GB) from the beginning.

Time taken to download the remaining 120 GB = 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes

Total time taken = Time taken to download 80 GB + Time taken to download the remaining 120 GB + Time taken for the restart
Total time taken = 40 minutes + 60 minutes + 20 minutes
Total time taken = 120 minutes

The final answer is: 120"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance John travels to the point where he turns around, and the distance he travels back home.

First, let's calculate the distance John travels to the point where he turns around. He drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph. 

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 mph * 3 hours
Distance = 180 miles

Now, let's calculate the distance John travels back home. He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance during this time. Then, he drives for half an hour at 30 mph, and the remaining 2.5 hours at 80 mph.

Distance covered in the first half-hour = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 mph * 0.5 hours
Distance = 15 miles

Distance covered in the remaining 2.5 hours = Speed * Time
Distance = 80 mph * 2.5 hours
Distance = 200 miles

Total distance covered in the return trip = Distance covered in the first half-hour + Distance covered in the remaining 2.5 hours
Total distance = 15 miles + 200 miles
Total distance = 215 miles

Now, let's find the total distance from home at the end of those 4 hours. This is the sum of the distance John traveled to the point where he turns around and the distance he traveled back home.

Total distance = Distance to the point where he turns around + Distance back home
Total distance = 180 miles + 215 miles
Total distance = 395 miles

The final answer is: 395"
"To find Eliza's total earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately, then add them together.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings are:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours, she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours. Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, so her overtime rate is:
$10/hour * 1.2 = $12/hour

Her earnings for the overtime hours are:
5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Now, we add her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours:
$400 + $60 = $460

Her total earnings for the week are $460.

In the third month, the downloads were reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which is 54. Then, we subtract 54 from 180 to get 126 downloads in the third month.

Now, we add the downloads from each month together: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The final answer is: 366"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts: 3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen will be 3 x $68 = $204.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes: 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen will be 2 x $80 = $160.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes: 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen will be 6 x $55 = $330.

Finally, we add the costs of all the pastries together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost is $694."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of planting the tree and the annual expenses, and then find the point at which the total earnings from selling lemons exceed these costs.

The initial cost of planting the tree is $90. The annual expenses for watering and feeding the tree are $3. The tree grows 7 lemons per year, which can be sold for $1.5 each, resulting in an annual revenue of 7 * $1.5 = $10.5.

Let's denote the number of years it takes for the tree to start earning money as 'x'. The total cost of planting the tree and the annual expenses for 'x' years will be $90 + $3x. The total revenue from selling lemons for 'x' years will be $10.5x.

To find the point at which the tree starts earning money, we need to set up the inequality:

Total revenue ≥ Total cost

$10.5x ≥ $90 + $3x

Subtract $3x from both sides:

$7.5x ≥ $90

Divide both sides by $7.5:

x ≥ $90 / $7.5
x ≥ 12

Since 'x' represents the number of years, it must be a whole number. Therefore, the tree will start earning money after 13 years.

The final answer is: 13"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume Melanie started with x vacuum cleaners.

At the green house, she sold a third of her vacuum cleaners, which is x/3.

At the red house, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners.

At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, which is (x - x/3 - 2)/2.

We know that after selling at all three houses, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the equation:

x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

To simplify the equation, let's first simplify the fraction (x - x/3 - 2)/2:

(x - x/3 - 2)/2 = (2x/3 - 6)/2 = x/3 - 3

Now, let's rewrite the equation:

x - x/3 - 2 - (x/3 - 3) = 5

Combine like terms:

x - 2x/3 - 2 + x/3 + 3 = 5

Combine like terms:

x - 2x/3 + x/3 + 3 - 2 = 5

Combine like terms:

x - x/3 + 1 = 5

Combine like terms:

(3x - x)/3 + 1 = 5

Combine like terms:

2x/3 + 1 = 5

Subtract 1 from both sides:

2x/3 = 4

Multiply both sides by 3/2:

x = 6

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to find the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance, and then subtract that from the total number of students.

20% of 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance:
20 * 0.2 = 4 students

The remaining students are 20 - 4 = 16 students.

25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:
16 * 0.25 = 4 students

The number of students enrolled in jazz dance is 4, and the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance is 4. So, the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance is 16 - 4 - 4 = 8 students.

To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100:
(8 / 20) * 100 = 40%

The final answer is: 40"
"To determine the maximum profit, we need to calculate the potential future value of both options and compare them.

Let's assume the merchant buys the jewelry worth $5,000. With a 2.5% increase, the future value of the jewelry will be:
$5,000 + ($5,000 * 0.025) = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125

Now, let's calculate the potential future value of the electronic gadgets worth $8,000 with a 1.2% increase:
$8,000 + ($8,000 * 0.012) = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096

Since the merchant wants to maximize profit, we need to compare the future values of both options. The higher the future value, the higher the potential profit.

The future value of the jewelry is $5,125, and the future value of the electronic gadgets is $8,096. Therefore, the merchant should choose the electronic gadgets to maximize profit.

To calculate the profit, we need to subtract the initial cost from the future value:
Profit = Future Value - Initial Cost
Profit = $8,096 - $8,000
Profit = $96

The final answer is: $96"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance covered on the first day and the distance covered on the second day.

On the first day, both trains travel 80 miles westward. Since they are traveling in the same direction, they cover the same distance. 

On the second day, they travel 150 miles northward. Again, since they are traveling in the same direction, they cover the same distance.

So, the distance covered by each train in the two days is:

- Day 1: 80 miles (westward)
- Day 2: 150 miles (northward)

The total distance covered by each train in the two days is the sum of the distances covered on each day, which is 80 + 150 = 230 miles.

The final answer is: 230"
"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:

- Hourly wage: $20
- Hours worked per week: 35
- Weeks worked per year: 50
- Total hours worked per year: 35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year
- Annual earnings from teaching: 1750 hours/year * $20/hour = $35,000/year

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:

- Hourly wage: $30
- Hours worked per week: 15
- Weeks worked per year: 50
- Total hours worked per year: 15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year
- Annual earnings from coaching: 750 hours/year * $30/hour = $22,500/year

Now, let's add her earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary:

Annual salary = Annual earnings from teaching + Annual earnings from coaching
= $35,000/year + $22,500/year
= $57,500/year

The final answer is: $57,500"
"To find out how many eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in a week and then multiply it by 4.

Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning, so in a week, she eats 3 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 21 eggs/week.

In 4 weeks, she will eat 21 eggs/week * 4 weeks = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens she will eat in 4 weeks.

84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozens.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total time Marissa has taken to walk the first 6 miles. She took 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles and another hour to walk the next 2 miles, so the total time taken for the first 6 miles is 1 + 1 = 2 hours.

The total distance of the trail is 12 miles, and she has already walked 6 miles. So, the remaining distance is 12 - 6 = 6 miles.

Since Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail, and she has already walked 6 miles in 2 hours, her average speed for the entire trail is 12 miles / 3 hours = 4 miles per hour.

Now, let's find the time she needs to take to walk the remaining 6 miles at an average speed of 4 miles per hour. Time = Distance / Speed = 6 miles / 4 miles per hour = 1.5 hours.

Since she has already taken 2 hours to walk the first 6 miles, the time she needs to take to walk the remaining 6 miles is 1.5 hours. However, the question asks for the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance, not the time.

To find the speed, we can use the formula: Speed = Distance / Time. The distance is 6 miles, and the time is 1.5 hours. Speed = 6 miles / 1.5 hours = 4 miles per hour.

However, this is the average speed she needs to maintain for the remaining distance, not the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance. Since she has already walked 6 miles at an average speed of 4 miles per hour, she needs to walk the remaining 6 miles at the same average speed of 4 miles per hour.

The question asks for the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance, not the average speed. Since she needs to walk the remaining 6 miles in 1.5 hours, the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance is 6 miles / 1.5 hours = 4 miles per hour.

"To find the total amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink, we first need to calculate two-thirds of 10. 

Two-thirds of 10 is (2/3) * 10 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters. 

Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the remaining one-third is non-water. So, the amount of non-water in the orange drink is 10 - 6.67 = 3.33 liters.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Three-fifths of 15 is (3/5) * 15 = 45/5 = 9 liters.

The amount of non-water in the pineapple drink is 15 - 9 = 6 liters.

Now, we have 10 liters of orange drink and 15 liters of pineapple drink. However, we spill 1 liter of the orange drink. So, the remaining amount of orange drink is 10 - 1 = 9 liters.

The total amount of water in the remaining orange drink is 9 * (2/3) = 6 liters.

The total amount of water in the pineapple drink remains the same, which is 9 liters.

The total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is the sum of the water in the remaining orange drink and the pineapple drink, which is 6 + 9 = 15 liters.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how old Raymond was when his son was born and then subtract that from the current age of Samantha to find out how many years ago the son was born.

First, we know that Samantha is 31 years old now. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, we can calculate Raymond's current age as follows:

Raymond's current age = Samantha's current age - 6
Raymond's current age = 31 - 6
Raymond's current age = 25

We also know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. So, when his son was born, Raymond was 23 years old. Now that we know Raymond's current age, we can find out how many years have passed since his son was born:

Years passed since son's birth = Raymond's current age - Age at son's birth
Years passed since son's birth = 25 - 23
Years passed since son's birth = 2

Since Samantha is 31 years old now, and 2 years have passed since Raymond's son was born, we can find out how many years ago the son was born by subtracting 2 from Samantha's current age:

Years ago son was born = Samantha's current age - Years passed since son's birth
Years ago son was born = 31 - 2
Years ago son was born = 29

"To find the total number of DVDs sold by Billy, we need to calculate the number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers separately and then add them together.

The first 3 customers buy one DVD each, so the total number of DVDs sold to them is 3 * 1 = 3.

The next 2 customers buy 2 DVDs each, so the total number of DVDs sold to them is 2 * 2 = 4.

Now, we add the number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers: 3 + 4 = 7.

The last 3 customers don't buy any DVDs, so we don't need to add anything for them.

Therefore, the total number of DVDs sold by Billy on Tuesday is 7.

"To find the total number of centimeters the candle will be shorter, we need to calculate the total time it burns and multiply it by the rate at which it melts.

The candle burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, which is a total of 4 hours.

The rate at which the candle melts is 2 centimeters per hour.

So, the total number of centimeters the candle will be shorter is 4 hours * 2 centimeters/hour = 8 centimeters.

"To find the original price of the book, we need to determine the amount of the discount and add it to the discounted price. 

Let's denote the original price as 'x'. Since Kyle bought the book with a 25% discount, the amount of the discount is 25% of the original price, which is 0.25x.

The discounted price is the original price minus the discount, so it is x - 0.25x = 0.75x.

We are given that the discounted price is $19.50, so we can set up the equation:

0.75x = 19.50

To solve for x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book was $26.

The final answer is: $26"
"To find the total cost of the items Marie ordered excluding the pizza, we need to calculate the cost of the chicken meal, the packs of milk, and the apples.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3 = $15.
The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6.

The total cost of the items excluding the pizza is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the cost of the pizza boxes is $50 - $33 = $17.

To find the number of boxes of pizza, we need to divide the cost of the pizza by the cost of each box. 

Number of boxes of pizza = $17 / $8.50 = 2.

Now, we add the costs together: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243.

The final answer is: $243"
"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream, we need to calculate the total number of cartons she buys and multiply it by the cost per carton.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she will go through 60 servings in 60 days. Each carton has 15 servings, so we need to divide 60 servings by 15 servings per carton to find out how many cartons she buys:

60 servings / 15 servings per carton = 4 cartons

Now, we multiply the number of cartons by the cost per carton to find the total cost:

4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00

Therefore, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream after 60 days.

The final answer is: $16.00"
"To find the distance traveled between Henry's first and second stops, we need to determine the distance between the two stops. 

Henry's first stop was after 20 miles, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total distance of the trip is 60 miles, we can find the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip by subtracting 15 miles from 60 miles. 

60 miles - 15 miles = 45 miles

Now, we know that the distance from the first stop to the second stop is the difference between the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip and the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip.

Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip = 60 miles
Distance from the second stop to the end of the trip = 45 miles

Distance between the first and second stops = 60 miles - 45 miles
Distance between the first and second stops = 15 miles

However, this is the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip, not the distance between the two stops. To find the distance between the two stops, we need to subtract the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip from the distance from the first stop to the second stop.

Distance from the first stop to the second stop = 20 miles
Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip = 60 miles
Distance from the second stop to the end of the trip = 45 miles

Distance between the first and second stops = Distance from the first stop to the second stop - Distance from the second stop to the end of the trip

"Let's denote the cost of the more expensive pair of heels as x. Since the other pair costs twice as much, its cost is 2x. We know that the two pairs of heels together cost $5 less than the boots. 

We can set up the equation: x + 2x = boots - 5. 

Combine like terms: 3x = boots - 5.

We also know that one pair of heels costs $33, which is the more expensive pair. So, we can substitute x with 33 in the equation: 3(33) = boots - 5.

Solve for boots: 99 = boots - 5.

Add 5 to both sides: 104 = boots.

The boots cost $104. 

The final answer is: $104"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given ratio of their ages. Let's assume Darrell's age is 7x and Allen's age is 11x, where x is a common multiplier.

We know that the total of their ages is 162, so we can write the equation:

7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms:

18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18:

x = 9

Now that we have the value of x, we can find Darrell's and Allen's current ages:

Darrell's age = 7x = 7(9) = 63
Allen's age = 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

The final answer is: 109"
"To find the average guess, we need to calculate the total number of guesses and divide it by the number of people who made the guesses.

The first person guesses 80 jelly beans.
The second person guesses 20 more than half of the first person's guess, which is (80 / 2) + 20 = 60.
The third person guesses 25% more than the first person's guess, which is 80 + (0.25 * 80) = 80 + 20 = 100.

Now, let's add up all the guesses: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

There are 3 people who made the guesses. To find the average, we divide the total by 3: 240 / 3 = 80.

"To find the total hours John spends taking care of dogs in a week, we need to first calculate the total hours he spends per day and then multiply it by 7 (the number of days in a week).

Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business. Since John takes care of 10 dogs, the total hours he spends per day is:
10 dogs * 0.5 hours/dog = 5 hours/day

Now, we multiply the daily hours by 7 to get the total hours per week:
5 hours/day * 7 days/week = 35 hours/week

The final answer is: 35"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations. Let's denote the number of silver coins as 's' and the number of gold coins as 'g'. We are given that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, so we can write an equation:

g = s + 30

We are also given that Gretchen has a total of 110 coins, which means the sum of silver and gold coins is 110. We can write another equation:

s + g = 110

Now, we can substitute the expression for g from the first equation into the second equation:

s + (s + 30) = 110

Combine like terms:

2s + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:

2s = 80

Divide both sides by 2:

s = 40

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins by substituting s into the first equation:

g = s + 30
g = 40 + 30
g = 70

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

The final answer is: 70"
"To find out how many jewels Siobhan has, we need to first determine how many jewels Aaron has. 

Since Raymond has 40 jewels, half of Raymond's jewels would be 40 / 2 = 20. 

Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, so Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.

Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, so Siobhan has 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.

"To find the total points scored by Mike, we need to calculate the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes separately, and then add them together.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% of 4, we multiply 4 by 0.25, which is 1. Then, we add this to the original 4 points to get the total points scored in the second 20 minutes: 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Now, we add the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes to get the total points: 4 + 5 = 9 points.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to first determine how many yogurts he eats in 30 days and then calculate the cost.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

Since the yogurts are on sale at 4 for $5.00, we need to find out how many sets of 4 yogurts Terry buys in 30 days. To do this, we divide the total number of yogurts he eats by 4: 60 / 4 = 15.

Now, we multiply the number of sets by the cost per set: 15 * $5.00 = $75.00.

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days.

The final answer is: $75.00"
"To find out how many Lego sets John sold, we need to first calculate the total amount of money he made from selling the Lego sets. 

He sold 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount of money he made is 13 * 15 = $195.

Next, we need to find out how much money he spent on video games. He bought 8 video games for $20 each, so the total amount of money he spent is 8 * 20 = $160.

Since he had $5 left after buying the video games, we can find out how much money he had before buying the video games by adding the money he had left to the money he spent on video games. So, he had $160 + $5 = $165 before buying the video games.

Now, we can find out how much money he made from selling the Lego sets by subtracting the money he had before buying the video games from the total amount of money he made from selling the Lego sets. However, we can also find out how much money he made from selling the Lego sets by subtracting the money he spent on video games from the money he had left plus the money he spent on video games. This will give us the same result. 

So, the total amount of money he made from selling the Lego sets is $165 + $160 = $325. 

Now, we can find out how many Lego sets he sold by dividing the total amount of money he made from selling the Lego sets by the price of each Lego set. 

13 Lego sets were not sold, but we know he sold 13 - x Lego sets. The equation is 15 * (13 - x) = 325. 

15 * (13 - x) = 325
195 - 15x = 325
-15x = 130
x = 130 / 15
x = 8.67

Since we can't sell a fraction of a Lego set, we round down to the nearest whole number. However, we know he sold 8 video games, so he must have sold 8 Lego sets. 

Now, we can find out how many Lego sets he still has by subtracting the number of Lego sets he sold from the total number of Lego sets he had. 

13 - 8 = 5

The final answer is: 5"
"To find John's running speed, we first need to calculate the total hours he runs per week. 

He runs 3 hours on the first day. The other two days, he runs half as much as the first day, which is 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours per day. 

So, the total hours he runs per week is 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours.

Since John runs 60 miles a week and runs for 6 hours a week, we can find his speed by dividing the total miles by the total hours: 

Speed = Total miles / Total hours = 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine Dana's running and walking speeds. We are given that she can skip at 3 miles per hour, and her skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed. 

Let's denote her running speed as R and her walking speed as W. We know that R = 2 * skipping speed, so R = 2 * 3 = 6 miles per hour. 

We also know that Dana can run at a rate four times faster than she can walk, so R = 4 * W. Substituting the value of R, we get 6 = 4 * W. Solving for W, we get W = 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, we need to find out how much time Dana spends running and walking in six hours. We are given that she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. 

Time spent running = (1/3) * 6 = 2 hours
Time spent walking = (2/3) * 6 = 4 hours

Now, we can calculate the distance traveled while running and walking. 

Distance traveled while running = speed * time = 6 * 2 = 12 miles
Distance traveled while walking = speed * time = 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles

Total distance traveled = distance traveled while running + distance traveled while walking = 12 + 6 = 18 miles

"To solve this problem, we need to find the age of Brandon's iPhone. 

First, we know that Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old. 
Since Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, we can calculate Ben's iPhone age as 2 * 1 = 2 years.

Next, we know that Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. 
So, we can calculate Brandon's iPhone age as 4 * 2 = 8 years.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the distance Polly can throw the javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone and then subtract the dragon's reach from that distance.

When Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone. Since she can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone, she can throw it 3 * 400 = 1200 feet with the gemstone.

The dragon's reach is 1000 feet, so Polly can stand 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet outside of the dragon's reach and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

The final answer is: 200"
"To find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we need to subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces. 

First, let's calculate the total number of pieces. Since Grandma Jones cut each pie into 8 pieces and she baked 5 pies, the total number of pieces is 5 * 8 = 40.

Now, we subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces to find out how many were taken by the guests. 

40 (total pieces) - 14 (remaining pieces) = 26

"To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we first need to determine how many calories you have left to consume. 

Your daily calorie target is 2000, and you have already consumed 1800 calories. 

2000 (daily target) - 1800 (already consumed) = 200 calories left

Since each serving of chips has 250 calories, we need to find out how many servings you can have within your remaining calorie limit.

200 calories / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings

Since a 300g bag has 5 servings, we need to find out how many grams are in one serving.

300g / 5 servings = 60g per serving

Now, we can multiply the number of servings you can have by the grams per serving to find out how many grams you can eat.

0.8 servings * 60g per serving = 48g

The final answer is: 48"
"To find Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost.

First, let's calculate the total cost. Since one pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10.00, and Charlie makes 10 candles per pound, the cost per candle is $1.00 ($10.00 / 10 candles). 

Now, let's calculate the total cost for 20 candles: 20 candles * $1.00 per candle = $20.00.

Next, let's calculate the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, so the total revenue for 20 candles is 20 candles * $2.00 per candle = $40.00.

Now, let's calculate the net profit: Total revenue - Total cost = Net profit. 

Net profit = $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00

The final answer is: $20.00"
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply it by the time it takes to write one article (4 hours).

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. To find 2/5 of 5, we multiply 5 by 2/5:
5 * (2/5) = 2
So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 7 * 2 = 14 articles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles she wrote in the three days:
5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles

Since it takes 4 hours to write one article, the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours

The final answer is: 104"
"To find the number of Post-it notes in the package Candice purchased, we need to determine how many Post-it notes she had after placing one on each of the 220 cups of coffee. 

Initially, Candice had 80 Post-it notes. After placing one on each of the 220 cups, she would have 80 - 220 = -140 Post-it notes. However, this is not possible since she had 23 Post-it notes remaining. 

This means that the number of Post-it notes she had after placing one on each of the 220 cups of coffee must be 23. So, we can set up the equation: 80 + x - 220 = 23, where x is the number of Post-it notes in the package.

Solving for x, we get: 
80 + x - 220 = 23
x - 140 = 23
x = 163

The final answer is: 163"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of blue ties John bought and the cost of the red ties.

Since John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can find the number of blue ties by dividing the total amount spent on blue ties by the cost of each blue tie:

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost of each blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is:

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
= 2 * 5
= 10

The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the cost of each blue tie. To find the cost of each red tie, we need to calculate 50% of the cost of each blue tie and add it to the cost of each blue tie:

Cost of each blue tie = $40
50% of the cost of each blue tie = 0.5 * $40 = $20
Cost of each red tie = Cost of each blue tie + 50% of the cost of each blue tie
= $40 + $20
= $60

Now, we can find the total amount spent on red ties by multiplying the number of red ties by the cost of each red tie:

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of each red tie
= 10 * $60
= $600

Finally, we can find the total amount spent on ties by adding the total amount spent on blue ties and the total amount spent on red ties:

Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
= $200 + $600
= $800

The final answer is: $800"
"To find the number of pieces Tracy obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches, since the pieces are 6 inches long. There are 12 inches in 1 foot, so the total length of the wire in inches is 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches.

Now, we can divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece to find the number of pieces: 48 inches / 6 inches/piece = 8 pieces.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total number of units in the building, we need to multiply the number of floors by the number of units per floor. 

Number of floors = 15
Number of units per floor = 8

Total number of units = Number of floors * Number of units per floor
Total number of units = 15 * 8
Total number of units = 120

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we need to find 1/4 of the total number of units to determine the number of unoccupied units.

Number of unoccupied units = Total number of units * (1 - 3/4)
Number of unoccupied units = Total number of units * 1/4
Number of unoccupied units = 120 * 1/4
Number of unoccupied units = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to calculate the total number of eggs produced per week and then multiply it by the price per dozen.

First, let's find the total number of eggs produced per week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the number of eggs produced per day by 7:

252 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 1764 eggs/week

Since Lloyd sells eggs by the dozen, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so:

1764 eggs/week / 12 eggs/dozen = 147 dozen/week

Now, we multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen to find the total weekly revenue:

147 dozen/week * $2/dozen = $294/week

So, Lloyd makes $294 per week on eggs.

The final answer is: $294"
"To find the total time it takes for Tom to travel back, we need to first determine the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM. 

Since we don't know the exact distance, let's assume the distance from 1 to 4 PM is 'd' miles. The time taken to travel from 1 to 4 PM can be calculated using the formula: time = distance / speed. 

Given that the speed is 10 miles per hour, the time taken to travel from 1 to 4 PM is d / 10 hours.

The time from 1 to 4 PM is 3 hours. So, d / 10 = 3. This implies that d = 30 miles.

Now, we need to find the time taken to travel back 30 miles at a speed of 6 mph. Using the formula time = distance / speed, the time taken to travel back is 30 / 6 = 5 hours.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he removes 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books removed is:

30 * (1/4) = 30/4 = 7.5 pounds

Since Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds, the remaining weight that needs to be removed from toys is:

15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, the number of toys that need to be removed is:

7.5 / (1/2) = 7.5 * 2 = 15

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the revenue earned by the mechanic on each day, we need to calculate the total revenue from truck tire repairs and car tire repairs separately for both days.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. The revenue from truck tire repairs is 6 * $60 = $360. The revenue from car tire repairs is 4 * $40 = $160. The total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires. The revenue from car tire repairs is 12 * $40 = $480. Since there were no truck tire repairs, the total revenue on Friday is $480.

To find the day with higher revenue, we compare the revenues: $520 (Thursday) and $480 (Friday). Thursday has higher revenue.

The difference in revenue between the two days is $520 - $480 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find the total number of kittens, we first need to determine the number of kittens each cat has had. 

Patchy, the first cat, has had thrice the number of adopted kittens. Since the Doubtfire sisters adopted 7 kittens, Patchy has had 3 * 7 = 21 kittens.

Trixie, the other cat, has had 12 kittens.

Now, we add the number of adopted kittens (7) to the number of kittens each cat has had: 7 (adopted) + 21 (Patchy's kittens) + 12 (Trixie's kittens) = 40.

The Doubtfire family now has 40 kittens.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the number of bags Jean can fill, we first need to determine the number of lollipops remaining after eating 2. 

Jean starts with 30 lollipops and eats 2, so the number of lollipops remaining is 30 - 2 = 28.

Since Jean wants to package 2 lollipops in one bag, we need to divide the number of remaining lollipops by 2 to find the number of bags.

28 / 2 = 14

So, Jean can fill 14 bags with the remaining lollipops.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find out how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to calculate how many times he can afford the total cost of a movie outing, which includes both the ticket and popcorn.

The total cost of a movie outing is $7 (ticket) + $7 (popcorn) = $14.

Peter has $42 for the week. To find out how many times he can go to the movies, we divide the total amount of money he has by the cost of a movie outing:

$42 ÷ $14 = 3

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times this week.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck, we need to subtract the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit, and then divide the result by the weight of each box.

First, let's calculate the remaining weight capacity of the bridge:

Bridge's weight limit = 5000 pounds
Combined weight of driver and empty truck = 3755 pounds
Remaining weight capacity = 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds

Next, let's divide the remaining weight capacity by the weight of each box:

Weight of each box = 15 pounds
Maximum number of boxes = Remaining weight capacity / Weight of each box
= 1245 / 15
= 83

So, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83.

The final answer is: 83"
"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to follow the order of operations. 

First, we need to calculate the 25% fee added to the final total. The 25% fee is calculated as 25% of $40.00, which is 0.25 * $40.00 = $10.00. 

Next, we add the delivery fee of $3.00 to the 25% fee, resulting in $10.00 + $3.00 = $13.00.

Now, we add the 25% fee and the delivery fee to the original total of $40.00, resulting in $40.00 + $13.00 = $53.00.

Finally, we add the $4.00 tip to the new total, resulting in $53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00.

The final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00."
"To find the total number of raspberries, we need to calculate the number of raspberries in the clusters and add the number of individual fruit.

"To find the number of good oranges, we first need to find the total number of oranges that are not good. 

There is 1 bad orange, 20% of 25 oranges are unripe, and 2 are sour. 

First, let's find the number of unripe oranges: 
20% of 25 = 0.2 * 25 = 5 oranges.

Now, let's add the number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges: 
1 (bad) + 5 (unripe) + 2 (sour) = 8 oranges.

Now, we subtract the total number of oranges that are not good from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges: 
25 (total oranges) - 8 (not good oranges) = 17 oranges.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the total amount Janet paid, we need to add the cost of the material and the cost of the jeweler, then add the insurance cost.

The cost of the material is $500.
The cost of the jeweler is $800.
The total cost before insurance is $500 + $800 = $1300.

To find the insurance cost, we need to calculate 10% of $1300.
10% of $1300 is 0.1 x $1300 = $130.

Now, we add the insurance cost to the total cost before insurance.
$1300 + $130 = $1430.

So, Janet paid a total of $1430."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the value of the pension after 30 years and then find 5% of that value.

Marcy works for 30 years, but she only gets the 5% increase after 20 years. So, for the first 20 years, she gets the standard $50,000 annual pension. For the remaining 10 years, she gets 5% of the value of the pension.

First, let's calculate the total amount she would have received in 20 years at the standard rate:

20 years * $50,000/year = $1,000,000

Now, let's calculate the value of the pension after 20 years, which is the base for the 5% increase:

Since the 5% increase starts after 20 years, we need to calculate the value of the pension after 20 years. However, the problem doesn't specify the interest rate or any other factors that would affect the pension growth. Assuming the pension grows at a constant rate, we can consider it as a simple interest problem.

However, the problem does not provide enough information to calculate the growth rate of the pension. Therefore, we will assume that the pension remains constant at $50,000 for the first 20 years.

For the remaining 10 years, she gets 5% of the value of the pension. Since the value of the pension is not explicitly stated, we will assume it remains constant at $50,000 for the calculation.

5% of $50,000 = 0.05 * $50,000 = $2,500

Now, let's calculate the total annual pension for the remaining 10 years:

$50,000 (standard rate) + $2,500 (5% increase) = $52,500

Since the 5% increase is applied to the standard rate, we can calculate the total annual pension for the remaining 10 years as $52,500.

However, this is not the final answer. We need to calculate the total annual pension for 30 years.

For the first 20 years, she gets the standard $50,000 annual pension. For the remaining 10 years, she gets $52,500.

Total annual pension for 30 years = ($50,000 * 20) + ($52,500 * 10)
= $1,000,000 + $525,000
= $1,525,000

The final answer is: $1,525,000"
"To find the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to calculate the amount she paid for the first half of the year and the second half of the year separately and then add them together.

The first half of the year is 6 months, and the second half of the year is also 6 months. 

The initial amount charged per month is $140. 

For the first half of the year, the total amount paid is 6 * $140 = $840.

For the second half of the year, the company charges 10% less than the initial amount. To find the amount charged for the second half, we need to calculate 10% of $140 and subtract it from $140.

10% of $140 = 0.1 * $140 = $14

The amount charged for the second half of the year is $140 - $14 = $126.

The total amount paid for the second half of the year is 6 * $126 = $756.

The total amount paid by Aleena for the streaming service by the end of the year is $840 + $756 = $1596.

"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to determine the car's miles per gallon (mpg) rating. We can do this by dividing the distance traveled since the last fill-up (100 miles) by the amount of gas used (4 gallons).

mpg = distance / gas used
mpg = 100 miles / 4 gallons
mpg = 25 miles per gallon

Now that we know the car's mpg rating, we can calculate the total distance Sophia can drive on a full tank by multiplying the tank capacity (12 gallons) by the mpg rating.

total distance = tank capacity * mpg
total distance = 12 gallons * 25 miles/gallon
total distance = 300 miles

Therefore, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas.

"To find out how much money Bailey started with, we need to subtract the total amount she received from her weekly allowance from the total amount she has at the end of 8 weeks.

Let's denote the initial amount of money Bailey had as 'x'. 

Bailey receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks, so the total amount she received from her allowance is 5 * 8 = $40.

At the end of 8 weeks, Bailey has a total of $100. This includes the initial amount she had and the total amount she received from her allowance.

We can set up the equation: x + 40 = 100

To find the initial amount Bailey had, we need to isolate 'x' by subtracting 40 from both sides of the equation:

x = 100 - 40
x = 60

So, Bailey started with $60.

"To find the total number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total number of cups of dog food the puppy will eat in the first year and then divide it by the number of cups in a bag.

First, let's calculate the number of cups the puppy will eat in the first 180 days. Since the puppy eats 1 cup of dog food every day for 180 days, the total number of cups is:

1 cup/day * 180 days = 180 cups

Next, let's calculate the number of cups the puppy will eat for the rest of its life. Since the puppy eats 2 cups of dog food every day for the rest of its life, we need to find out how many days are left in the first year. There are 365 days in a year, so the number of days left is:

365 days - 180 days = 185 days

The total number of cups the puppy will eat for the rest of its life is:

2 cups/day * 185 days = 370 cups

Now, let's add the number of cups the puppy will eat in the first 180 days and the number of cups it will eat for the rest of its life:

180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah.
2. Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David.
3. Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.

From point 2, we can express the amount of laundry David does in terms of Sarah's laundry: 
David's laundry = Sarah's laundry / 4
David's laundry = 400 / 4
David's laundry = 100 pounds

From point 1, we can express the amount of laundry Raymond does in terms of Sarah's laundry:
Raymond's laundry = Sarah's laundry / 2
Raymond's laundry = 400 / 2
Raymond's laundry = 200 pounds

Now, we need to find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:

"To find the better price, we need to calculate the cost per flower for each package option. 

For the package of 3 flowers for $2.50, the cost per flower is $2.50 / 3 = $0.8333 per flower.

For the package of 2 flowers for $1, the cost per flower is $1 / 2 = $0.5 per flower.

Since $0.5 per flower is less than $0.8333 per flower, the package of 2 flowers for $1 is the better option.

Now, we need to calculate the total cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price. Since 18 is divisible by 2, we can buy 18 flowers in 9 packages of 2 flowers each. The total cost is 9 * $1 = $9.

To find the cost of buying 18 flowers at the worse price, we can calculate the total cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3. Since 18 is not divisible by 3, we can buy 18 flowers in 6 packages of 3 flowers each and 0 packages of 1 flower. The total cost is (6 * $2.50) + (0 * $2.50) = $15.

"To find out how many stickers Charlie has left, we need to calculate the total number of stickers he had initially and then subtract the number of stickers he gave away and used.

Initially, Charlie had 10 stickers.

He bought 21 stickers from the store, so now he has 10 + 21 = 31 stickers.

He got 23 stickers for his birthday, so now he has 31 + 23 = 54 stickers.

Then, he gave 9 stickers to his sister, so now he has 54 - 9 = 45 stickers.

Finally, he used 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card, so now he has 45 - 28 = 17 stickers.

Therefore, Charlie has 17 stickers left.

"To find Alex's weight, we need to calculate 4 times Grace's weight and then subtract 2 pounds from it. 

First, we multiply Grace's weight by 4: 125 * 4 = 500 pounds. 

Then, we subtract 2 pounds from the result: 500 - 2 = 498 pounds.

Now, we have Alex's weight. To find their combined weights, we add Grace's weight and Alex's weight: 125 + 498 = 623 pounds.

The final answer is: 623"
"To find the total number of thorns, we need to multiply the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush, and then multiply that result by the number of thorns per rose.

First, we multiply the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush: 3 * 25 = 75

Then, we multiply the result by the number of thorns per rose: 75 * 8 = 600

Therefore, there are 600 thorns in total.

600"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let's denote the number of games the team lost as 'x'. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games they won is 'x + 8'.

We know that the total number of games played is 22, which is the sum of the games won and lost. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:

2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 7

Since x represents the number of games lost, the number of games won is x + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total number of quilt blocks, we need to calculate the total number of years Gene has been vacationing and multiply it by the number of vacations he goes on per year.

Gene has been vacationing since he was 23 years old and is now 34, so he has been vacationing for 34 - 23 = 11 years.

Since he goes on four vacations a year, the total number of quilt blocks is 11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 quilt blocks.

The final answer is: 44"
"To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the number of times it rang each time it went off and add them together.

The first time the alarm went off, it rang 4 times.

The second time, it rang for three times as long as the first time, so it rang 3 * 4 = 12 times.

The third time, it rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we add the number of times it rang each time: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To find Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate her salary after the 5th year and then calculate the increase for the next three years.

Initially, Sylvie's salary is $600. 

After 5 years, her salary will increase by 10% of $600 for each year. 
Year 1: $600 * 0.10 = $60, $600 + $60 = $660
Year 2: $660 * 0.10 = $66, $660 + $66 = $726
Year 3: $726 * 0.10 = $72.60, $726 + $72.60 = $798.60
Year 4: $798.60 * 0.10 = $79.86, $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46
Year 5: $878.46 * 0.10 = $87.85, $878.46 + $87.85 = $966.31

Now, for the next three years, her salary will increase by 10% of the new salary ($966.31) each year.

Year 6: $966.31 * 0.10 = $96.63, $966.31 + $96.63 = $1062.94
Year 7: $1062.94 * 0.10 = $106.29, $1062.94 + $106.29 = $1169.23
Year 8: $1169.23 * 0.10 = $116.92, $1169.23 + $116.92 = $1286.15

Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service is $1286.15."
"Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as H. Since Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, the number of copies Marilyn sold is 10H.

We know that the total number of copies sold by both is 88,000. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

H + 10H = 88,000

Combine like terms:

11H = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:

H = 88,000 / 11
H = 8,000

"To find out how many gift bags Christina needs, we first need to calculate the number of guests she expects to attend. Since 1/4 of the invited guests don't show up, we can find the number of expected attendees by subtracting 1/4 from the total number of invited guests.

Number of invited guests = 16
Number of guests not showing up = 1/4 * 16 = 4
Number of expected attendees = 16 - 4 = 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we multiply the number of expected attendees by 0.75 to find the total number of gift bags needed.

Number of gift bags needed = 12 * 0.75 = 9

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of gift bags needed by the cost per gift bag.

Cost per gift bag = $2
Total cost = 9 * $2 = $18

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of pets each person has and then add them together.

We know that Cindy has 4 pets. Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.

Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets.

To find the total number of pets, we add the number of pets each person has: 4 (Cindy) + 6 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan) = 28.

The final answer is: 28"
"To find Jackson's age, we need to determine Corey's age first. Since James is 10 and 1 year younger than Corey, Corey must be 10 + 1 = 11 years old.

We also know that Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy's age is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

Given that Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, we can find Jackson's age by subtracting 5 from Amy's age: 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it takes Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles before his diet change. Since Lee runs 2 seconds faster than Gerald, we can set up an equation:

Time it takes Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles = Time it takes Lee to run the 400-meter hurdles + 2 seconds

We know that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds. So, the time it takes Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles before his diet change is:

Time it takes Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles = 38 + 2 = 40 seconds

Now, we know that Gerald's diet improved his speed by 10%. To find out how much time he will save, we need to calculate 10% of 40 seconds:

10% of 40 seconds = 0.1 * 40 = 4 seconds

Since Gerald's speed improved by 10%, he will save 4 seconds from his original time. To find out how long it takes Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles with his improved diet, we subtract 4 seconds from his original time:

Time it takes Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles with his improved diet = 40 - 4 = 36 seconds

The final answer is: 36"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of cats, then the number of rabbits, and finally add them up with the number of dogs to get the total number of pets.

Given that there are two cats for every dog, and the number of dogs is 60, we can find the number of cats by multiplying the number of dogs by 2.

Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
= 2 * 60
= 120

Now, we know that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. We can find the combined number of dogs and cats by adding the number of dogs and cats.

Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
= 60 + 120
= 180

Now, we can find the number of rabbits by subtracting 12 from the combined number of dogs and cats.

Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
= 180 - 12
= 168

Finally, we can find the total number of pets in the neighborhood by adding the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits.

Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
= 60 + 120 + 168
= 348

The final answer is: 348"
"To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we first need to find the total number of girls and then subtract the number of girls in the girl scout.

First, let's find the number of boys and girls. We know that 2/5 of the students are boys. 

Number of boys = (2/5) * 200 = 80

Since there are 200 students in total, the number of girls can be found by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students.

Number of girls = 200 - 80 = 120

Now, we know that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. 

Number of girls in the girl scout = (2/3) * 120 = 80

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls.

Number of girls not in the girl scout = 120 - 80 = 40

"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we first need to determine the total volume of the tomatoes before they were cooked. Since the sauce made 32 ounces and it's half the volume of the tomatoes, the total volume of the tomatoes must be 32 * 2 = 64 ounces.

Since each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces, we can divide the total volume of the tomatoes by the volume of each can to find out how many cans Freda used: 64 / 16 = 4 cans.

Each can contains 3 tomatoes, so we multiply the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can to find the total number of tomatoes: 4 * 3 = 12 tomatoes.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes. Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as x.

We know that 5 cars took an exit, so the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the original number of cars minus the cars that took an exit: 30 - 5 = 25.

We also know that 20 cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. Since the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 25, we can set up the equation: x + 20 = 25.

To solve for x, we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation: x = 25 - 20.

x = 5

So, 5 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

"To find out how many potted plants Mary will have left, we need to first determine how many potted plants she has initially and then subtract the number of plants she gives away.

Initially, Mary has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, so she has 2 * 40 = 80 potted plants.

She received 18 new potted plants from the nursery, so now she has 80 + 18 = 98 potted plants.

Tomorrow, she will give away 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges, so she will give away 40 potted plants.

To find out how many potted plants Mary will have left, we subtract the number of plants she gives away from the total number of plants she has: 98 - 40 = 58.

"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell and add them up.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. Since 1/4 of 20 is 5, the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. We are given that the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times, so the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

Now, we add up the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell: 20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 155.

The total number of doorbell rings is 155.

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to find the inner volume of one box and then multiply it by 3.

The dimensions of the box are given as 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches, but the walls are 1 inch thick. This means that the inner dimensions of the box will be (5-2) inches by (6-2) inches by (4-2) inches, since 1 inch is subtracted from each side for the wall thickness.

So, the inner dimensions of the box are 3 inches by 4 inches by 2 inches.

The formula to find the volume of a rectangular prism is length * width * height. 

Inner volume of one box = 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches.

Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes = 24 * 3 = 72 cubic inches.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 2 episodes of a 1-hour show, which is a total of 2 * 1 = 2 hours.

On Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. Let's denote the number of episodes as 'x'. The total time he watched on Wednesday is 30x minutes, which is equal to 0.5x hours (since 30 minutes is half an hour).

On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, which is a total of 1.5 hours.

On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, which is a total of 2 hours.

The total time Frankie watched TV is 7 hours. We can set up an equation to represent this:

2 (Monday and Tuesday) + 0.5x (Wednesday) + 1.5 (Thursday) + 2 (Friday) = 7

Combine like terms:
2 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 = 7

Combine the constants:
5.5 + 0.5x = 7

Subtract 5.5 from both sides:
0.5x = 1.5

Divide both sides by 0.5:
x = 3

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as 'x'. Since Henry wants to make twice as many as he did last year, he plans to bake 2x cookies this year.

However, he actually baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the actual number of cookies he baked is 2x + 15.

After dropping 5 cookies, he has a total of 110 cookies. This can be represented by the equation: 2x + 15 - 5 = 110.

Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 10 = 110.

Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation, we get 2x = 100.

Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get x = 50.

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To find the total cost of gas after the cashback rewards, we need to first calculate the total cost of gas without the rewards, and then subtract the cashback amount.

The cost of gas per gallon is $3.00, and the person is buying 10 gallons. 

Total cost of gas = cost per gallon * number of gallons
Total cost of gas = $3.00 * 10
Total cost of gas = $30.00

The cashback reward is $0.20 per gallon, and the person is buying 10 gallons.

Total cashback = cashback per gallon * number of gallons
Total cashback = $0.20 * 10
Total cashback = $2.00

Now, we subtract the total cashback from the total cost of gas to find the final cost.

Final cost = Total cost of gas - Total cashback
Final cost = $30.00 - $2.00
Final cost = $28.00

"To find the total number of fruit roll-ups eaten by each person, we need to calculate the area of their respective roll-ups. 

Beatrice's roll-up is 2 roll-ups wide and 24 rolls up long, so its area is 2 * 24 = 48 square roll-ups. 

Marcell's roll-up is 3 roll-ups wide and 14 rolls up long, so its area is 3 * 14 = 42 square roll-ups.

Since they ate their entire roll-ups, the total number of roll-ups eaten by Beatrice is 48 and by Marcell is 42.

To find the average number of roll-ups eaten, we need to add the total number of roll-ups eaten by both and divide by 2. 

Total roll-ups eaten = 48 + 42 = 90

Average roll-ups eaten = Total roll-ups eaten / 2 = 90 / 2 = 45

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's denote the number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold as B, and the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as D.

We know that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. This can be expressed as:
Jamal's phone = 6 * B

We are given that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs. So, we can write:
6 * B = 1800

To find the value of B, we divide both sides by 6:
B = 1800 / 6
B = 300

Now, we know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. This can be expressed as:
B = 50 * D

We have already found that B = 300. So, we can write:
300 = 50 * D

To find the value of D, we divide both sides by 50:
D = 300 / 50
D = 6

Therefore, the number of ducks that can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo is 6.

"To find the total cost of the lumber, we need to calculate the cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards and the 4 x 4 x 10 boards separately and then add them together.

The cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $10 per board = $100.

The cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $16 per board = $80.

The total cost of the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since prices have gone up by 50%, the new price of the lumber is 1.5 times the original price. 

The new price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 per board.

The new price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 per board.

The total revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $15 per board = $150.

The total revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $24 per board = $120.

The total revenue is $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

To find 'x', we can divide both sides by 1.3:

x = 40000 / 1.3
x = 30769.23

So, Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30769.23.

Now, we need to find their salaries four years later. We are given that Adrien's salary increased by 40% of his original salary. 

Adrien's salary four years later = 40000 + (40% of 40000)
= 40000 + 0.4 * 40000
= 40000 + 16000
= 56000

Since their salaries increased simultaneously, Lylah's salary also increased by 40% of her original salary.

Lylah's salary four years later = 30769.23 + (40% of 30769.23)
= 30769.23 + 0.4 * 30769.23
= 30769.23 + 12307.69
= 43076.92

Now, we can find the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later:

Total salary = Adrien's salary + Lylah's salary
= 56000 + 43076.92
= 99076.92

The final answer is: $99077"
"To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we need to first calculate how many sheets he uses in a week and then multiply that by the number of weeks in a month.

Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad has 30 sheets. So, the total number of sheets he uses in a week is:

2 pads/week * 30 sheets/pad = 60 sheets/week

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we can multiply the number of sheets used in a week by 4 to get the total number of sheets used in a month:

60 sheets/week * 4 weeks/month = 240 sheets/month

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the total number of fruits, we first need to determine the number of fruits each person brought. 

Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges. 

Kael brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette, so Kael brought 2 * 5 = 10 apples. 
Kael brought half the number of oranges as Morisette, so Kael brought 8 / 2 = 4 oranges.

Now, we can find the total number of fruits each person brought: 
Morisette brought 5 + 8 = 13 fruits.
Kael brought 10 + 4 = 14 fruits.

To find the total number of fruits, we add the number of fruits each person brought: 
13 (Morisette's fruits) + 14 (Kael's fruits) = 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"To find the total hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we need to calculate her sleep hours for each day and add them up.

On Monday, Sadie slept 8 hours.

For the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday), she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours each day.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Sunday), she slept 1 hour more than the previous two days, so she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours each day.

Now, let's calculate the total hours for each period:

- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday and Wednesday: 2 days * 6 hours = 12 hours
- Thursday to Sunday: 5 days * 7 hours = 35 hours

Total hours = 8 + 12 + 35 = 55 hours

The final answer is: 55"
"To find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break down her running into two segments: the first 3 hours and the remaining 4 hours.

In the first 3 hours, Rosie runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour. We can calculate the distance covered in this time by multiplying her speed by the time:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour x 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

In the remaining 4 hours, Rosie runs at a speed of 5 miles per hour. We can calculate the distance covered in this time by multiplying her speed by the time:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour x 4 hours
Distance = 20 miles

Now, we add the distances covered in both segments to find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours:

Total Distance = 30 miles + 20 miles
Total Distance = 50 miles

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the initial number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. Let's denote the initial number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters as 'x'. 

Since Jennie puts stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, this means that two-thirds of the letters needing stamps remain unstamped. The number of letters needing stamps is 60, so the number of letters that are now stamped is 60 - (1/3 * 60) = 60 - 20 = 40.

We are given that there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. This means that the 40 letters that Jennie stamped are the ones that were in the pile of already-stamped letters initially, plus the 30 letters that were already in the pile. So, we can set up the equation: x + 30 = 40.

Solving for x, we get x = 40 - 30 = 10.

Therefore, the initial number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters was 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Julia initially had an unknown number of spoons, but we know she was out of them, so let's call the number of spoons in the package she bought 'x'.
2. Her husband bought a package of 5 new spoons and gave them to Julia, so now she has x + 5 spoons.
3. Julia used 3 spoons while making the stew, so she has (x + 5) - 3 spoons left.
4. When she went to set the table, she had a total of 12 spoons, so we can set up the equation (x + 5) - 3 = 12.
5. To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. First, we add 3 to both sides of the equation: (x + 5) - 3 + 3 = 12 + 3.
6. This simplifies to x + 5 = 15.
7. Next, we subtract 5 from both sides of the equation: x + 5 - 5 = 15 - 5.
8. This simplifies to x = 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we need to add the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages. 

First, we know that Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages. 
Then, we know that he bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages. So, the number of fish sausages is 38 + 6 = 44.

Now, we can find the total number of sausages by adding the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages: 38 + 44 = 82.

The final answer is: 82"
"To find the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together, we first need to determine the number of friends Amy has. Since Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, and Lily has 50 friends, we can calculate Amy's friends by adding 20 to Lily's friends.

Amy's friends = Lily's friends + 20
Amy's friends = 50 + 20
Amy's friends = 70

Now, to find the total number of friends they have together, we add the number of friends Lily and Amy have.

Total friends = Lily's friends + Amy's friends
Total friends = 50 + 70
Total friends = 120

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to determine the cost of each item and then multiply it by the quantity.

First, let's find the cost of a watermelon. Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, and each pepper costs $15, the cost of a watermelon is 3 * $15 = $45.

Next, we find the cost of an orange. An orange costs 5 dollars less than a watermelon, so the cost of an orange is $45 - $5 = $40.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of each item:

- 4 watermelons: 4 * $45 = $180
- 20 peppers: 20 * $15 = $300
- 10 oranges: 10 * $40 = $400

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is the sum of the costs of all items: $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

The final answer is: $880"
"To find the total profit made by the hospital, we need to calculate the total time spent by doctors and the total amount charged to patients, then subtract the cost from the revenue.

First, let's calculate the total time spent by doctors. Since the hospital sees 500 people a day and each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes, the total time spent by doctors is:

500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours:

12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

The doctors charge $150 an hour, so the total cost to the hospital is:

200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000

Next, let's calculate the total amount charged to patients. The hospital charges $200 an hour, and the total time spent by doctors is 200 hours, but the patients are charged for the time spent by the doctors, so the total amount charged to patients is:

200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000

The profit made by the hospital is the difference between the total amount charged to patients and the total cost to the hospital:

Profit = Total amount charged to patients - Total cost to the hospital
= $40,000 - $30,000
= $10,000

The final answer is: $10,000"
"To find the number of elves left, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, Nissa hires 60 seasonal workers.

A third of the elves quit after children vomit on them. To find the number of elves who quit, we divide 60 by 3:
60 / 3 = 20 elves quit.

Now, we subtract the number of elves who quit from the initial number of elves:
60 - 20 = 40 elves left.

Then, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. To find the number of elves left, we subtract 10 from the remaining elves:
40 - 10 = 30 elves left.

"To find the total expenditure for the two months, we need to add the expenditure in May and June. 

The expenditure in May was $500. 
The expenditure in June was $60 less than May, so it is $500 - $60 = $440.

Now, we add the expenditures for May and June: $500 + $440 = $940.

The final numerical answer is: $940"
"To find the total number of tickets used, we need to calculate the total number of rides taken by Pam and Fred and then multiply it by the cost of each ride.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, so she took a total of 2 + 2 = 4 rides.
Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, so he took a total of 4 + 2 = 6 rides.

The total number of rides taken by both Pam and Fred is 4 + 6 = 10 rides.

Since each ride costs 6 tickets, the total number of tickets used is 10 * 6 = 60.

"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we first need to determine how many miles he walked on Tuesday. 

On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. 
On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, which is 4 * 6 = 24 miles.

Now, we know that his total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. We already know that he walked 4 miles on Monday and 24 miles on Tuesday. 

So, the total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday is 4 + 24 = 28 miles. 

To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we subtract the total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage for the three days: 41 - 28 = 13 miles.

"To find out how many video games Bobby has, we first need to determine how many video games Brian has after losing 5. 

Brian initially has 20 video games but lost 5, so he has 20 - 5 = 15 video games.

Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian. To find out how many video games Bobby has, we multiply the number of video games Brian has by 3 and then subtract 5.

3 times the number of video games Brian has is 3 * 15 = 45.

5 fewer than 45 is 45 - 5 = 40.

Bobby has 40 video games.

- 2 bags of chips for $1.50 each: 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
- 2 cookies for $1.00 each: 2 x $1.00 = $2.00
Total cost of items: $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

Next, let's calculate the delivery fee: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 x $20.00 = $4.00

Now, let's add the delivery fee to the total cost of items: $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

"To find out how many questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate the total number of questions he completed in each test and then subtract that from the total number of questions in each test.

For the first test, Mark had 8 hours to complete 75 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour. 

First, let's find out how many questions Mark completed in 8 hours:
Questions completed in 8 hours = 5 questions/hour * 8 hours = 40 questions

Since Mark completed 40 questions in 8 hours, he left 75 - 40 = 35 questions incomplete in the first test.

For the second test, Mark had 6 hours to complete 100 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour.

Questions completed in 6 hours = 5 questions/hour * 6 hours = 30 questions

Since Mark completed 30 questions in 6 hours, he left 100 - 30 = 70 questions incomplete in the second test.

Now, let's add the number of incomplete questions from both tests:
Total incomplete questions = 35 (from the first test) + 70 (from the second test) = 105 questions

"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine the total number of semi-automatic cars. We know that there are 20 cars in total, with 12 being automatic and 4 being manual. 

Total number of automatic and manual cars = 12 + 4 = 16

Now, we can find the number of semi-automatic cars by subtracting the total number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars.

Number of semi-automatic cars = Total number of cars - Total number of automatic and manual cars
= 20 - 16
= 4

Now, we can find the percentage of semi-automatic cars by dividing the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100
= (4 / 20) * 100

"Let's denote the number of baby bees as B, the number of worker bees as W, and the number of queens as Q. We are given that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so W = 2B. We are also given that there are twice as many babies as queens, so B = 2Q.

We know that the total number of bees in the hive is 700, so W + B + Q = 700. Substituting W = 2B and B = 2Q into this equation, we get 2B + B + Q = 700, which simplifies to 3B + Q = 700.

Since B = 2Q, we can substitute this into the previous equation to get 3(2Q) + Q = 700, which simplifies to 6Q + Q = 700, or 7Q = 700. Solving for Q, we get Q = 100.

Now that we know Q = 100, we can find B by substituting this value into the equation B = 2Q, which gives B = 2(100) = 200. Finally, we can find W by substituting B = 200 into the equation W = 2B, which gives W = 2(200) = 400.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of food items and non-food items separately and then add them together.

Food items: milk and eggs
Cost of milk = 2 dollars
Cost of eggs = 3 dollars
Total cost of food items = 2 + 3 = 5 dollars

Non-food items: light bulbs, cups, and roach traps
Cost of light bulbs = 3 dollars
Cost of cups = 3 dollars
Cost of roach traps = 4 dollars
Total cost of non-food items = 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars

Since there is a 10% tax on non-food items, we need to calculate the tax amount:
Tax amount = 10% of 10 dollars = 0.1 * 10 = 1 dollar

Now, we add the tax amount to the total cost of non-food items:
Total cost of non-food items with tax = 10 + 1 = 11 dollars

"To calculate the total profit, we first need to determine the total income and total expenses. 

Kim has 3 current clients and 5 potential clients, making a total of 8 clients. Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. 

Total bottles of bleach needed per week = 8 clients * 2 bottles/client = 16 bottles
Total packs of cloths needed per week = 8 clients * 1 pack/client = 8 packs

The cost of bleach per week = 16 bottles * $2/bottle = $32
The cost of cloths per week = 8 packs * $5/pack = $40

Total expenses per week = $32 (bleach) + $40 (cloths) = $72

Since Kim's total income per week is $92, we can calculate the profit as follows:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of the bees that left in the first 6 hours return. So, 1/2 * 30 = 15 bees return.
3. The number of bees that have left but not returned so far is 30 - 15 = 15 bees.
4. In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees as the initial 30 leave the hive. So, 2 * 30 = 60 bees leave.
5. The number of bees that have left but not returned so far is now 15 + 60 = 75 bees.
6. In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left before that but hadn't already returned return to the hive. So, 15 bees return.

Therefore, the number of bees Debra sees return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is 15."

To find Dorothy's friends, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:

Dorothy's friends = 12 / 3
Dorothy's friends = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find out how many friends James has. Since James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, we can set up another equation:

"To determine the time it takes for each person to get home, we need to calculate the time it takes for Steve and Tim to cover their respective distances.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet, as the speeds are given in feet per minute. 

1 mile = 5280 feet
Steve's distance = 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15,840 feet
Tim's distance = 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10,560 feet

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for each person to get home.

Steve's time = distance / speed = 15,840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time = distance / speed = 10,560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 36 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve will be the winner. To find out how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to subtract the winner's time from the loser's time.

Waiting time = Tim's time - Steve's time = 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Dave ate 14 french fries initially.
2. The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 french fries.
   Now, the total amount eaten by Dave and the seagull is 14 + 7 = 21 french fries.
3. Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate a total of 3 * 3 = 9 french fries.
   Now, the total amount eaten is 21 + 9 = 30 french fries.
4. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries. Let's denote the initial number of fries as x. 
   After the seagull and pigeons ate, the remaining fries are x - 30.
   The raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries, which is (2/3)(x - 30).
   The remaining fries after the raccoon ate are (1/3)(x - 30).
5. Ants carried off a final french fry, leaving 5 behind. This means that (1/3)(x - 30) - 1 = 5.
6. To solve for x, we need to isolate it. First, add 1 to both sides of the equation: (1/3)(x - 30) = 6.
7. Multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction: x - 30 = 18.
8. Add 30 to both sides to solve for x: x = 48.

First, let's convert the length of the baguettes from feet to inches, since the lengths of the rolls and croissants are given in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so each baguette is 2 * 12 = 24 inches long.

Now, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good:

- Rolls: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches
- Croissants: 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches
- Baguettes: 60 baguettes * 24 inches/baguette = 1440 inches

Now, let's add the total lengths together: 1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 inches.

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot): 3360 / 12 = 280 feet.

The final answer is: 280"
"To determine the total number of bananas needed for 2 months, we need to calculate the monthly consumption of all the apes and then multiply it by 2.

The monkeys need 200 bananas per month, the gorillas need 400 bananas per month, and the baboons need 100 bananas per month. 

Total monthly consumption = 200 (monkeys) + 400 (gorillas) + 100 (baboons) = 700 bananas per month.

Since the zookeeper needs to order bananas for 2 months, we multiply the total monthly consumption by 2.

Total bananas needed for 2 months = 700 bananas/month * 2 months = 1400 bananas.

The final answer is: 1400"
"To find out who the winner is, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Since he's running back and forth, the total distance he covers is 2 times the length of the field for each run. So, the total distance Blake ran is 15 * 2 * 100 = 3000 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 2 * 100 = 200 yards. Then, she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 2 * 40 = 80 yards. She does this 34 times, so the total distance she covers is 34 * 80 = 2720 yards. 

To find the total distance Kelly ran, we add the initial 200 yards to the distance she ran to the 40-yard line and back: 2720 + 200 = 2920 yards.

Now, we compare the distances: Blake ran 3000 yards, and Kelly ran 2920 yards. Blake is the winner.

To find out how much farther the winner ran than the loser, we subtract the loser's distance from the winner's distance: 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the total amount Raphael spent, we need to calculate the cost of the pens, the cost of the notebooks, and the cost of the bond paper, then add them together.

The cost of the pens is 4 * $1.5 = $6.
The cost of the notebooks is 2 * $4 = $8.
The cost of the bond paper is $20.

Now, we add the costs together: $6 + $8 + $20 = $34.

"To find the number of tadpoles Finn can see in the pond now, we need to subtract the number of tadpoles that hid under the rock from the number of tadpoles that came out from under the lily pad.

Initially, Finn saw 11 tadpoles. Then, 6 more tadpoles came out from under the lily pad, making it 11 + 6 = 17 tadpoles. However, 2 of these tadpoles hid under a rock, so we need to subtract 2 from 17.

17 - 2 = 15

"To find the depth of the water on Wednesday, we need to first find the depth of the water on Tuesday. 

The depth of the water on Monday is 17 feet. On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water, so the depth of the water on Tuesday is 17 + 7 = 24 feet.

On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. To find two thirds of 24, we multiply 24 by 2/3.

24 * (2/3) = (24 * 2) / 3
= 48 / 3

"To find the total number of fish caught by Anakin, we need to add the number of starfish, sea horses, and clownfish he caught. 

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. 

Total fish caught by Anakin = 10 + 6 + 3 = 19

Now, let's find the number of fish caught by Locsin. 

Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so he caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.

Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so he caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.

Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so he caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Total fish caught by Locsin = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

Now, let's find the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin.

Total fish caught = Total fish caught by Anakin + Total fish caught by Locsin
= 19 + 13
= 32

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the price increase every two months and add it to the original price. 

The original price of the bag of marbles is $20. 

After 2 months, the price increases by 20% of $20, which is 0.20 * $20 = $4. 
So, the price after 2 months is $20 + $4 = $24.

After 4 months, the price increases by 20% of $24, which is 0.20 * $24 = $4.80. 
So, the price after 4 months is $24 + $4.80 = $28.80.

After 6 months, the price increases by 20% of $28.80, which is 0.20 * $28.80 = $5.76. 
So, the price after 6 months is $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56.

After 8 months, the price increases by 20% of $34.56, which is 0.20 * $34.56 = $6.912. 
So, the price after 8 months is $34.56 + $6.912 = $41.472.

After 10 months, the price increases by 20% of $41.472, which is 0.20 * $41.472 = $8.2944. 
So, the price after 10 months is $41.472 + $8.2944 = $49.7664.

After 12 months, the price increases by 20% of $49.7664, which is 0.20 * $49.7664 = $9.95328. 
So, the price after 12 months is $49.7664 + $9.95328 = $59.71968.

After 14 months, the price increases by 20% of $59.71968, which is 0.20 * $59.71968 = $11.943936. 
So, the price after 14 months is $59.71968 + $11.943936 = $71.663616.

After 16 months, the price increases by 20% of $71.663616, which is 0.20 * $71.663616 = $14.3327232. 
So, the price after 16 months is $71.663616 + $14.3327232 = $85.9963392.

After 18 months, the price increases by 20% of $85.9963392, which is 0.20 * $85.9963392 = $17.19926784. 
So, the price after 18 months is $85.9963392 + $17.19926784 = $103.19560704.

After 20 months, the price increases by 20% of $103.19560704, which is 0.20 * $103.19560704 = $20.639121208. 
So, the price after 20 months is $103.19560704 + $20.639121208 = $123.834728248.

After 22 months, the price increases by 20% of $123.834728248, which is 0.20 * $123.834728248 = $24.7669456496. 
So, the price after 22 months is $123.834728248 + $24.7669456496 = $148.601673898.

After 24 months, the price increases by 20% of $148.601673898, which is 0.20 * $148.601673898 = $29.7203347796. 
So, the price after 24 months is $148.601673898 + $29.7203347796 = $178.321998678.

After 26 months, the price increases by 20% of $178.321998678, which is 0.20 * $178.321998678 = $35.664399736. 
So, the price after 26 months is $178.321998678 + $35.664399736 = $213.986398414.

After 28 months, the price increases by 20% of $213.986398414, which is 0.20 * $213.986398414 = $42.7972796828. 
So, the price after 28 months is $213.986398414 + $42.7972796828 = $256.783678097.

After 30 months, the price increases by 20% of $256.783678097, which is 0.20 * $256.783678097 = $51.3567356194. 
So, the price after 30 months is $256.783678097 + $51.3567356194 = $308.140413716.

After 32 months, the price increases by 20% of $308.140413716, which is 0.20 * $308.140413716 = $61.6280827432. 
So, the price after 32 months is $308.140413716 + $61.6280827432 = $369.768496459.

After 34 months, the price increases by 20% of $369.768496459, which is 0.20 * $369.768496459 = $73.9536992918. 
So, the price after 34 months is $369.768496459 + $73.9536992918 = $443.722195751.

After 36 months, the price increases by 20% of $443.722195751, which is 0.20 * $443.722195751 = $88.7444391502. 
So, the price after 36 months is $443.722195751 + $88.7444391502 = $532.466634901.

"To find the total worth of all the toys, we need to calculate the cost of each type of toy and then add them together.

The doll costs as much as 3 action figures. Since an action figure costs $5, the doll costs 3 * $5 = $15.

One red car costs $4. Since there are 5 red cars, the total cost of the red cars is 5 * $4 = $20.

The total cost of the action figures is 3 * $5 = $15.

Now, we add the cost of the doll, the red cars, and the action figures together: $15 (doll) + $20 (red cars) + $15 (action figures) = $50.

The total worth of all the toys is $50.

The final answer is: $50"
"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the difference in income between the two options.

If Jackie does her taxes herself, she'll lose $35/hour in missed income for 3 hours of freelance work. So, the total income lost is $35/hour * 3 hours = $105.

The cost of hiring the accountant is $90.

Now, let's calculate the difference in income between the two options. If Jackie hires the accountant, she'll have the $90 cost, but she won't lose any income from missed freelance work. If she does her taxes herself, she'll have the $105 income loss.

The difference in income is $105 (income loss from doing taxes herself) - $90 (cost of hiring the accountant) = $15.

So, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

"To find out how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the computer accessories and subtract that from her budget.

The total cost of the computer accessories is:
- Computer: €1090
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Total cost = €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102 = €1323

Now, we subtract the total cost from Elvira's budget:
Budget = €1500
Total cost = €1323
Money left = Budget - Total cost = €1500 - €1323 = €177

So, Elvira will have €177 left for her clothing.

"To find out how many times Sandra has to babysit, we need to determine how many eggs she needs in total to make 15 Spanish flans and then divide that number by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting job.

Since each Spanish flan requires 3 eggs, Sandra will need 15 * 3 = 45 eggs in total.

Since Sandra gets 9 eggs every time she babysits, we can divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting job: 45 / 9 = 5.

Therefore, Sandra has to babysit 5 times to get enough eggs to make 15 Spanish flans.

"Let's denote Brooke's current age as B and Seth's current age as S. We are given that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write an equation:

S = 2B

We are also given that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. This means that in 2 years, Seth's age will be S + 2 and Brooke's age will be B + 2. The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write another equation:

S + 2 + B + 2 = 28

Combine like terms:

S + B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

S + B = 24

Now we can substitute S = 2B into this equation:

2B + B = 24

Combine like terms:

3B = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B = 8 into the equation S = 2B:

S = 2(8)
S = 16

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much money Jimmy has, we need to first determine what ""twice the money Ethel has"" is. Since Ethel has $8, twice that amount would be 2 * 8 = 16.

"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of the hat, jacket, and pants separately and then add them together.

The cost of the hat is given as $25.

The cost of the jacket is three times as much as the hat, so it is 3 * $25 = $75.

The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. To find the average, we add the costs of the hat and jacket and divide by 2. The average cost of the pants is ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50.

Now, we add the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants together to find the total cost of each uniform: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

- Credit card: $200 (minimum) * 1.5 (50% increase) = $300/month
- Mortgage: $500 (minimum) * 1.5 (50% increase) = $750/month

Now, let's add up the increased minimum payments for each debt:

$450 (student loans) + $300 (credit card) + $750 (mortgage) = $1500/month

Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds = 5/60 minutes (converting seconds to minutes for consistency)

Total time to peel all potatoes: 60 potatoes * 1.5 minutes/potato = 90 minutes
Total time to cut all potatoes: 60 potatoes * (5/60) minutes/potato = 5 minutes

Adding both times together: 90 minutes + 5 minutes = 95 minutes

Therefore, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out the total revenue and then the total cost. 

Let's denote the number of gallons as 'g'. The total revenue is the number of glasses sold multiplied by the price per glass. Since they get 20 glasses per gallon, the total number of glasses sold is 20g. The price per glass is $0.50, so the total revenue is 20g * $0.50 = $10g.

The total cost consists of the cost of lemons and the cost of sugar. The cost of lemons is $3 per gallon, and the cost of sugar is $2 per gallon. So, the total cost is 3g + 2g = 5g.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. We are given that the profit is $25. So, we can set up the equation: 10g - 5g = 25.

Simplifying the equation, we get 5g = 25. To find the number of gallons, we divide both sides by 5: g = 25 / 5 = 5.

Now that we know the number of gallons, we can find the cost of lemons. The cost of lemons is $3 per gallon, so the total cost of lemons is 3g = 3 * 5 = $15.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations and calculate the remaining amount after each expense.

1. Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent: 
   1/4 of 6000 = 6000 * 1/4 = 1500

   Remaining amount after rent = 6000 - 1500 = 4500

2. Zaid spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel:
   1/3 of 6000 = 6000 * 1/3 = 2000

   Remaining amount after car fuel = 4500 - 2000 = 2500

3. Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity:
   Half of 2500 = 2500 * 1/2 = 1250

   Remaining amount after charity donation = 2500 - 1250 = 1250

4. Zaid gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$:
   Total amount given away = 200 + 700 = 900

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of white carnations and then calculate the number of red roses.

Let's denote the number of white carnations as 'x'. According to the problem, Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations. This can be represented as:

200 = 5x

To find the value of 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 5:

x = 200 / 5
x = 40

So, Sandra ordered 40 white carnations.

Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, the number of red roses can be calculated as:

Number of red roses = 4 * x

"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. Jean is two years older than Mark.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age.
3. Jan is 30 years old.

From point 3, we know Jan's current age is 30. 

Two years ago, Jan's age would have been 30 - 2 = 28.

From point 2, we know that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. Half of Jan's age two years ago would be 28 / 2 = 14. 

So, two years ago, Mark's age would have been 14 + 5 = 19.

Since Mark's age two years ago was 19, his current age would be 19 + 2 = 21.

From point 1, we know that Jean is two years older than Mark. Therefore, Jean's current age would be 21 + 2 = 23.

"To find the total time for each team, we need to calculate the time for each runner and add them up.

The well-rounded team's total time is the sum of each runner's time, which is 55 seconds for each runner. Since there are 4 runners, the total time is 55 * 4 = 220 seconds.

The less well-rounded team's first runner runs 60 seconds. The subsequent runners are 3 seconds faster than the previous one, so the second runner runs 60 - 3 = 57 seconds, the third runner runs 57 - 3 = 54 seconds, and the fourth runner runs 54 - 3 = 51 seconds. The total time for the less well-rounded team is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 162 seconds.

To find the difference in time between the two teams, we subtract the less well-rounded team's time from the well-rounded team's time: 220 - 162 = 58 seconds.

The faster team will win by 58 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, and then find the difference between these two probabilities.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die is the number of favorable outcomes (4, 5, 6) divided by the total number of possible outcomes (6). So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5 or 50%.

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is the product of the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll and the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll. The probability of rolling an even number on a six-sided die is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5. Therefore, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 = 0.25 or 25%.

Now, we need to find the difference between the two probabilities. The difference is 50% - 25% = 25%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To find out how many apples Jenna picked, we need to determine half of the number of apples her mom picked. Since her mom picked 20 apples, we can calculate Jenna's share by dividing 20 by 2.

20 / 2 = 10

Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, and her mom picked 20, Jenna picked 10 apples. To find the total number of apples they both picked, we need to add Jenna's share to her mom's share.

20 (mom's apples) + 10 (Jenna's apples) = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of small rodents (rats and hamsters) and the total number of straw pieces distributed among them. 

Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as 'r'. Since there are 3 cages of rats, the total number of rats is 3r. 

The total number of hamsters is 10. 

The total number of straw pieces distributed among the rats is 3r * 6 = 18r. 

The total number of straw pieces distributed among the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50. 

The total number of straw pieces distributed among the small rodents is 160. 

We can set up the equation: 18r + 50 = 160.

Now, let's solve for 'r':

18r = 160 - 50
18r = 110
r = 110 / 18
r = 6.11 (round down to the nearest whole number is not possible here as we are looking for the number of rats in each cage, so we will round down to 6 and check if it is correct)

If r = 6, then the total number of rats is 3 * 6 = 18. The total number of straw pieces distributed among the rats is 18 * 6 = 108. The total number of straw pieces distributed among the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50. The total number of straw pieces distributed among the small rodents is 108 + 50 = 158, which is less than 160. 

If r = 7, then the total number of rats is 3 * 7 = 21. The total number of straw pieces distributed among the rats is 21 * 6 = 126. The total number of straw pieces distributed among the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50. The total number of straw pieces distributed among the small rodents is 126 + 50 = 176, which is more than 160.

Since r = 6 is less than the actual number of rats and r = 7 is more than the actual number of rats, the actual number of rats must be between 6 and 7. We can try r = 6.5, but since the number of rats must be a whole number, we will try r = 6.11, which is not a whole number, so we will round down to 6 and check if it is correct.

However, we can also try to find the number of rats by finding the difference between the total number of straw pieces distributed among the small rodents and the total number of straw pieces distributed among the hamsters. 

The total number of straw pieces distributed among the small rodents is 160. The total number of straw pieces distributed among the hamsters is 50. The total number of straw pieces distributed among the rats is 160 - 50 = 110. 

The total number of rats is 110 / 6 = 18.33, which is not a whole number. However, we know that the total number of rats is a multiple of 3, so we can try to find the closest multiple of 3 to 18.33. The closest multiple of 3 to 18.33 is 18.

If the total number of rats is 18, then the number of rats in each cage is 18 / 3 = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To calculate the total amount Mandy should pay, we need to calculate the interest for 3 months and add it to the initial amount.

The formula for simple interest is: Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

Given:
- Principal (initial amount) = $100
- Rate = 2% or 0.02 (as a decimal)
- Time = 3 months

Interest = $100 * 0.02 * 3
Interest = $6

Now, we add the interest to the principal to get the total amount Mandy should pay:
Total Amount = Principal + Interest
Total Amount = $100 + $6
Total Amount = $106

The final answer is: $106"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the total revenue and the total cost, and then calculate the profit.

Let's denote the number of bags as 'x'. 

The total revenue is the selling price per bag multiplied by the number of bags: 30x.

The total cost consists of the cost of buying the bags and the transportation cost. The cost of buying the bags is 20x, and the transportation cost is 2x. So, the total cost is 20x + 2x = 22x.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost: 30x - 22x = 8x.

We are given that the profit is $400, so we can set up the equation: 8x = 400.

To find the number of bags, we need to solve for x: x = 400 / 8 = 50.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how much each friend paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets, food, and rides, and then divide it by 3.

First, let's find the cost of the food. They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. Since they spent $20.25 on tickets, the cost of food is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.

The cost of the rides is 2 rides * $33 per ride = $66.

Now, let's add up the total cost: $20.25 (tickets) + $15.75 (food) + $66 (rides) = $102.

Since they agreed to split the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3: $102 / 3 = $34.

The final answer is: $34"
"To find the total number of peaches John collects, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends collecting peaches and then multiply it by the number of peaches he collects per minute.

John collects peaches for 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 3 hours by 60 minutes per hour to get the total minutes:

3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Now, we know John collects 2 peaches per minute. To find the total number of peaches, we multiply the total minutes by the peaches collected per minute:

180 minutes * 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches

The final answer is: 360"
"To find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ducks needs per day, we first need to calculate the total pounds of insects needed per week for the flock. 

Since each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week, and there are ten ducks, the total pounds of insects needed per week is 3.5 pounds/duck * 10 ducks = 35 pounds/week.

To find out how many pounds of insects the flock needs per day, we need to divide the total pounds of insects needed per week by 7 (the number of days in a week). 

35 pounds/week / 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net change in the number of trees Tom has each year and then account for the trees that die after 10 years.

Initially, Tom has 50 trees. 

Each year, he plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees, resulting in a net gain of 10 - 2 = 8 trees per year.

Over 10 years, the net gain would be 8 * 10 = 80 trees.

So, after 10 years, Tom would have 50 (initial trees) + 80 (net gain) = 130 trees.

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find the number of trees that die, we multiply 130 by 0.3: 130 * 0.3 = 39 trees.

Now, we subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees: 130 - 39 = 91 trees.

Therefore, Tom has 91 trees left.

The final answer is: 91"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos on Sue's front yard.

On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. They painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back out on Sue's front yard. This means there are now 6 white flamingos and 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos.

On Sunday morning, the neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection. So, the total number of pink flamingos is now 12 + 18 = 30.

The total number of white flamingos remains the same, which is 6.

To find out how many more pink plastic flamingos were out than white plastic flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find out how much change Violetta will get, we first need to determine the total cost of the crayons. Since she wants 5 crayons and each crayon costs $2, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of crayons by the cost per crayon.

Total cost = Number of crayons * Cost per crayon
Total cost = 5 * $2
Total cost = $10

Since Violetta prepared $20 for the purchase, we can find the change by subtracting the total cost from the amount she prepared.

Change = Amount prepared - Total cost
Change = $20 - $10
Change = $10

The final answer is: $10"
"To find the cost of a pen, we need to add the cost of a pencil and an eraser, since a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined. 

Cost of a pencil = $1.20
Cost of an eraser = $0.30
Cost of a pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser
Cost of a pen = $1.20 + $0.30
Cost of a pen = $1.50

Now, we need to find the cost of 8 pens. 

Cost of 8 pens = Cost of a pen * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $1.50 * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $12.00

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we first need to calculate the total pounds of carrots that will be distributed to the restaurants. 

Each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants. 

Total pounds of carrots distributed = Number of restaurants * Pounds per restaurant
Total pounds of carrots distributed = 40 * 2
Total pounds of carrots distributed = 80 pounds

Now, we need to subtract the total pounds of carrots distributed from the initial amount of carrots to find out how many pounds will not be used.

Pounds of carrots not used = Initial amount of carrots - Total pounds of carrots distributed
Pounds of carrots not used = 200 - 80
Pounds of carrots not used = 120

Total population = 23786
Number of men = 8417
Number of women = 9092

Number of children = Total population - (Number of men + Number of women)
= 23786 - (8417 + 9092)

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Initially, Elaine had 20 Pokémon cards.

In the first month, she collected three times the number of cards she initially had: 3 * 20 = 60 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month: 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months: (60 + 40) * 2 = 100 cards.

Now, let's add up the total number of cards Elaine has: 20 (initial cards) + 60 (first month) + 40 (second month) + 100 (third month) = 220 cards.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote the number of sentences Mark edits for each publisher as x. Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, x is also the number of sentences he edits for Publisher B.

We know that Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, so the total number of sentences for both publishers is 2x = 1000.

To find the number of sentences for each publisher, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 1000 / 2
x = 500

Now, we know that Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence, and Publisher B pays him twice as much, which is 10 cents per sentence.

The total amount Mark makes from Publisher A is 5 cents * 500 sentences = 2500 cents.

The total amount Mark makes from Publisher B is 10 cents * 500 sentences = 5000 cents.

To find the total amount Mark makes in a week, we add the amounts from both publishers:

Total amount = 2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents

"To find the total amount John made that year, we need to calculate his new salary after the 5% raise and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

First, let's calculate the 5% raise on his weekly salary:
5% of $2000 = 0.05 * $2000 = $100

New weekly salary = $2000 + $100 = $2100

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, we multiply his new weekly salary by 52:
Total annual salary = $2100 * 52 = $109200

Now, let's add the one-time monetary reward of $5000 to his total annual salary:
Total amount made that year = $109200 + $5000 = $114200

"To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the slices used for the sandwiches, omelets, and macaroni and cheese separately and then add them together.

For the sandwiches, Carl ate 7 days' worth of sandwiches (since he ate one every day for a week) with 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. So, the total slices used for sandwiches = 7 * 2 = 14.

For the omelets, Carl ate 3 days' worth of omelets with one more slice per omelet than per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 3 slices per omelet. So, the total slices used for omelets = 3 * 3 = 9.

For the macaroni and cheese, Carl used 8 slices.

Now, let's add the slices used for sandwiches, omelets, and macaroni and cheese together: 14 (sandwiches) + 9 (omelets) + 8 (macaroni and cheese) = 31.

"To find the total number of pens Janet has now, we need to calculate the number of blue and red pens she bought and add them to her initial number of pens.

Janet initially had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, so she had a total of 22 + 10 = 32 pens.

She bought 6 bags of blue pens, with 9 pens in each bag, so she bought 6 * 9 = 54 blue pens.

She bought 2 bags of red pens, with 6 pens in each bag, so she bought 2 * 6 = 12 red pens.

Now, we add the number of blue and red pens she bought to her initial number of pens: 32 (initial pens) + 54 (blue pens) + 12 (red pens) = 98 pens.

"To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we first need to find the total score she needs for the semester. Since Mr. Bert allows the students to remove the lowest score, we need to find the highest possible total score. 

The highest possible total score is when the lowest score is 71. 

The sum of the given scores is 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 338. 

To get an average of 93, the total score for the semester should be 6 * 93 = 558.

Since the lowest score is 71, we need to find the score on the sixth test such that the total score is 558. 

The total score without the lowest score is 338 + x, where x is the score on the sixth test. 

We need to find x such that 338 + x - 71 = 558.

Simplifying the equation, we get 267 + x = 558.

Subtracting 267 from both sides, we get x = 291.

"To find the total number of kilometers Michael rode his bike, we need to calculate the total kilometers for each period and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total kilometers for the first four weeks when he rode 25 kilometers each time, 5 times a week. 

Total kilometers in the first four weeks = 25 km * 5 times/week * 4 weeks = 25 * 5 * 4 = 500 km

Next, let's calculate the total kilometers for the next three weeks when he rode 60 kilometers each time, 2 times a week.

Total kilometers in the next three weeks = 60 km * 2 times/week * 3 weeks = 60 * 2 * 3 = 360 km

"To find the total weight of the bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the weight of the chocolate bars. Since there are 25 chocolate bars and each weighs 40g, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
25 * 40g = 1000g

Next, let's find the weight of the candied apples. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, the weight of each candied apple is:
40g / 2 = 20g

Now, we can find the total weight of the candied apples:
80 * 20g = 1600g

Finally, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag of candy:
1000g + 1600g = 2600g

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy and the total amount of money she has earned from babysitting. 

The total cost of the items is the cost of the jacket plus the cost of 2 pairs of shoes: 
$30 (jacket) + 2 * $20 (shoes) = $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved before she started babysitting. She earns $5 each time she babysits the kids, so the total amount she earns from babysitting is:
$5 * number of times she babysits.

Let's denote the number of times she babysits as 'x'. Then, the total amount she earns from babysitting is $5x.

The total amount she earns from mowing the lawn is $4 * number of times she mows the lawn. Let's denote the number of times she mows the lawn as 'y'. Then, the total amount she earns from mowing the lawn is $4y.

The total amount of money she has is the sum of the money she already has, the money she earns from babysitting, and the money she earns from mowing the lawn:
$10 (initial savings) + $5x (babysitting) + $4y (mowing the lawn).

Since Sara wants to buy the jacket and shoes, the total amount of money she has must be greater than or equal to the total cost of the items:
$10 + $5x + $4y ≥ $70.

We want to find the minimum number of times she must mow the lawn, so we want to find the smallest value of 'y' that satisfies the inequality. To do this, we can first subtract $10 from both sides of the inequality:
$5x + $4y ≥ $60.

Since we want to find the minimum value of 'y', we can try to find the smallest value of 'x' that satisfies the inequality. We know that 'x' must be an integer (since it represents the number of times Sara babysits), so we can try different values of 'x' to find the smallest one that satisfies the inequality.

If x = 8, then $5x = $40, and $40 + $4y ≥ $60. Subtracting $40 from both sides gives $4y ≥ $20. Dividing both sides by $4 gives y ≥ 5.

So, the smallest value of 'y' that satisfies the inequality is 5.

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as R and the number of white chickens as W. We know that W = R + 2.

We also know that the total number of eggs collected is 42. Since each red chicken produces 3 eggs and each white chicken produces 5 eggs, we can set up the following equation:

3R + 5W = 42

Substituting W = R + 2 into the equation, we get:

3R + 5(R + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3R + 5R + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8R + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8R = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

R = 4

"To find the time Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park since he walks around the edge. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the dimensions of the park, l = 6 miles and w = 1.5 miles, we can substitute these values into the formula:

P = 2(l + w)
P = 2(6 + 1.5)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles/hour, we can find the time he spends walking by dividing the perimeter by his speed:

Time = Perimeter / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of customers Sloane counted on the first day. Let's denote the number of customers on the first day as x.

On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so the number of customers on the second day is x + 50.

The total number of customers by the third day was 500, which is the sum of the customers on the first and second days. We can write the equation:

x + (x + 50) = 500

Combine like terms:

2x + 50 = 500

Subtract 50 from both sides:

2x = 450

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 225

So, Sloane counted 225 customers on the first day. 

Now, we need to find the number of customers she counted on the third day. We already know that the number of customers on the second day is x + 50 = 225 + 50 = 275. The total number of customers by the third day is 500, so the number of customers on the third day is 500 - 225 = 275.

The number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is 275."
"Let's denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as 'x' gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the initial amount of water in the big pool is 2x gallons.

Since both pools leak at 4 gallons/minute, the rate of water loss for both pools is 8 gallons/minute. 

In 4 minutes, the total water lost from both pools is 8 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 32 gallons.

The big pool initially had 2x gallons of water. After losing 32 gallons, it has 2x - 32 gallons of water. 

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as 'y'. Then, the current amount of water in the big pool is 4y.

We can set up the equation: 2x - 32 = 4y.

We also know that the small pool initially had x gallons of water and lost 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons of water. So, the current amount of water in the small pool is x - 16 gallons.

Since the small pool now has y gallons of water, we can set up the equation: x - 16 = y.

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can substitute the expression for y from the second equation into the first equation:

2x - 32 = 4(x - 16)

Expanding the equation, we get:
2x - 32 = 4x - 64

Subtracting 2x from both sides, we get:
-32 = 2x - 64

Adding 64 to both sides, we get:
32 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
x = 16

Now that we know x, we can find y by substituting x into the equation x - 16 = y:
16 - 16 = y
y = 0

However, this doesn't make sense in the context of the problem, as the small pool would have lost all its water. Let's re-examine the problem.

We can also set up the equation: y = x - 16, where y is the current amount of water in the small pool.

The big pool initially had 2x gallons of water and now has 4y gallons of water. Since the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool, we can set up the equation: 4y = 2x.

Substituting y = x - 16 into the equation 4y = 2x, we get:
4(x - 16) = 2x

Expanding the equation, we get:
4x - 64 = 2x

Adding 64 to both sides, we get:
4x = 2x + 64

Subtracting 2x from both sides, we get:
2x = 64

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
x = 32

Now that we know x, we can find y by substituting x into the equation y = x - 16:
y = 32 - 16
y = 16

However, this doesn't make sense in the context of the problem, as the small pool would have lost all its water. Let's re-examine the problem.

We can also set up the equation: y = x - 16, where y is the current amount of water in the small pool.

The big pool initially had 2x gallons of water and now has 4y gallons of water. Since the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool, we can set up the equation: 4y = 2x.

Substituting y = x - 16 into the equation 4y = 2x, we get:
4(x - 16) = 2x

Expanding the equation, we get:
4x - 64 = 2x

Adding 64 to both sides, we get:
4x = 2x + 64

Subtracting 2x from both sides, we get:
2x = 64

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
x = 32

Now that we know x, we can find y by substituting x into the equation y = x - 16:
y = 32 - 16
y = 16

However, this doesn't make sense in the context of the problem, as the small pool would have lost all its water. Let's re-examine the problem.

We can also set up the equation: y = x - 16, where y is the current amount of water in the small pool.

The big pool initially had 2x gallons of water and now has 4y gallons of water. Since the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool, we can set up the equation: 4y = 2x.

Substituting y = x - 16 into the equation 4y = 2x, we get:
4(x - 16) = 2x

Expanding the equation, we get:
4x - 64 = 2x

Adding 64 to both sides, we get:
4x = 2x + 64

Subtracting 2x from both sides, we get:
2x = 64

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
x = 32

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Janeth will pay in 12 months and then subtract that from the initial amount borrowed plus the additional 10% interest.

First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth will pay in 12 months:

Monthly payment = $165
Number of months = 12
Total amount paid = Monthly payment * Number of months
Total amount paid = $165 * 12
Total amount paid = $1980

Now, let's calculate the total amount Janeth needs to pay, including the 10% interest:

Initial amount borrowed = $2000
Interest = 10% of $2000 = 0.1 * $2000 = $200
Total amount to be paid = Initial amount borrowed + Interest
Total amount to be paid = $2000 + $200
Total amount to be paid = $2200

Now, let's subtract the total amount paid from the total amount to be paid to find the remaining balance:

Remaining balance = Total amount to be paid - Total amount paid
Remaining balance = $2200 - $1980
Remaining balance = $220

The final answer is: $220"
"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to determine the number of dahlias and add it to the number of roses. 

First, we know there are 4 roses in the vase. Then, we are told there are 7 more dahlias than roses. This means the number of dahlias is 4 (number of roses) + 7 (additional dahlias) = 11 dahlias.

Now, to find the total number of flowers, we add the number of roses to the number of dahlias: 4 (roses) + 11 (dahlias) = 15.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the current ages of Adrian and Zack. 

Given that Harriet is 21 years old, and she is half the age of Zack, we can find Zack's age by multiplying Harriet's age by 2. 

Zack's age = 2 * Harriet's age = 2 * 21 = 42 years.

Since Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, we can find Adrian's age by multiplying Harriet's age by 3.

Adrian's age = 3 * Harriet's age = 3 * 21 = 63 years.

Now, we need to find the average age of the three in three years. To do this, we first need to find their ages in three years.

Harriet's age in three years = 21 + 3 = 24 years.
Zack's age in three years = 42 + 3 = 45 years.
Adrian's age in three years = 63 + 3 = 66 years.

Now, we can find the average age by adding their ages and dividing by 3.

Average age = (24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45 years.

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Yuri and Brianna. 

We know that Naomi scored 68 points. 

Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. 10 more than that is 34 + 10 = 44 points for Yuri.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, which is 68 + 17 = 85 points.

The total points scored by the four students is 251. We already know that Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna scored 68, 44, and 85 points respectively. 

So, the total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna is 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points.

To find out how many points Jojo scored, we subtract the total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points scored by all four students: 251 - 197 = 54 points.

Number of petunias = 90 - 40
Number of petunias = 50

Now, we add the number of geraniums and petunias to find the total number of flowers:

Total number of flowers = Number of geraniums + Number of petunias
Total number of flowers = 90 + 50
Total number of flowers = 140

"To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we need to first calculate the total number of cards James has after losing 8 water type and buying 14 grass type. 

Initially, James has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type. 

After losing 8 water type, he has 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards.

After buying 14 grass type, he has 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards.

The total number of cards James has now is 30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96 cards.

The probability of picking a water type card is the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards, which is 32/96.

To find the percentage, we multiply by 100: (32/96) * 100 = 33.333...

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type is 33."
"To find out how much Chad still owes, we need to calculate the total cost of his meal and then subtract the gift card amount.

The base burrito costs $6.50. 
He adds extra meat for $2.00, extra cheese for $1.00, avocado for $1.00, and 2 sauces for $0.25 each, which is 2 * $0.25 = $0.50. 
So, the total cost of the add-ons is $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $4.50.
The total cost of the meal before the upgrade is $6.50 + $4.50 = $11.00.
He upgrades his meal for an extra $3.00, so the new total is $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the combined rate at which Kalinda and her mom can add pieces to the puzzle. 

Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute. Her mom can add half as many pieces per minute, which is 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute.

The combined rate is the sum of their individual rates: 4 pieces/minute (Kalinda) + 2 pieces/minute (her mom) = 6 pieces/minute.

Since there are 360 pieces in the puzzle, we need to find out how many minutes it will take to complete the puzzle. 

Time = Total pieces / Combined rate
Time = 360 pieces / 6 pieces/minute
Time = 60 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
Time = 60 minutes / 60
Time = 1 hour

Therefore, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, there were 120 baby watermelons.

After two months, 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest. To find 30% of 120, we multiply 120 by 0.3.

120 * 0.3 = 36

So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest after two months. This means 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons were not ready.

After two weeks, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest. To find 3/4 of 84, we multiply 84 by 3/4.

84 * (3/4) = 84 * 0.75 = 63

So, 63 watermelons were ready for harvest after two weeks. This means 84 - 63 = 21 watermelons were not ready.

The total cost of the cars is the price of one car multiplied by the number of cars: 12 * $20,000 = $240,000.

The tax on the cars is 10% of the total cost of the cars: 0.10 * $240,000 = $24,000.

The registration fees are $1000 per car, so the total registration fees are: 12 * $1000 = $12,000.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees: $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many tomatoes Steve eats per week and then divide that by the number of tomatoes a vine can produce per week.

Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, he eats 6 * 7 = 42 tomatoes per week.

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats half as much as Steve, which is 42 / 2 = 21 tomatoes per week.

The total number of tomatoes they eat per week is 42 (Steve) + 21 (girlfriend) = 63 tomatoes per week.

Each vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week. To find out how many vines Steve needs, we divide the total number of tomatoes they eat per week by the number of tomatoes a vine can produce per week: 63 / 3 = 21 vines.

"To determine the number of pizzas John needs to order, we need to calculate the total number of slices required and then divide that by the number of slices per pizza.

First, we calculate the total number of slices required: 
Total friends = 20
Slices per friend = 4
Total slices required = Total friends * Slices per friend
Total slices required = 20 * 4
Total slices required = 80

Since pizzas are sold in 8 slices, we need to divide the total slices required by 8 to find the number of pizzas needed:
Total slices required = 80
Slices per pizza = 8
Number of pizzas = Total slices required / Slices per pizza
Number of pizzas = 80 / 8
Number of pizzas = 10

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas to ensure each of his 20 friends gets 4 slices.

1. Johnny started with an allowance of $20 and added an extra $10 to it. So, the initial amount of money he had is $20 + $10 = $30.

2. He then invested this sum of money, which tripled in a year. This means the amount of money he had after a year is 3 times the initial amount. 

3. To find the final amount, we multiply the initial amount by 3: $30 * 3 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the sum of the ages of the three girls, we need to determine the ages of Mary and Joan first.

Since Jessa is 20 years old, and Joan is five years older than Jessa, we can calculate Joan's age as follows:
Joan's age = Jessa's age + 5
Joan's age = 20 + 5
Joan's age = 25

Now, we know that Mary is two years younger than Joan. So, we can calculate Mary's age as follows:
Mary's age = Joan's age - 2
Mary's age = 25 - 2
Mary's age = 23

Now that we have the ages of all three girls, we can find the sum of their ages:
Sum of ages = Jessa's age + Joan's age + Mary's age
Sum of ages = 20 + 25 + 23
Sum of ages = 68

The final answer is: 68"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Initially, there are 1000 students in the hall.

First, 30% of the students went out through exit A. 
30% of 1000 is 0.3 * 1000 = 300 students.

Now, there are 1000 - 300 = 700 students remaining in the hall.

Next, 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B. 
3/5 of 700 is (3/5) * 700 = 420 students.

Now, there are 700 - 420 = 280 students remaining in the hall.

The rest of the students went out through exit C, which is 280 students.

The final answer is: 280"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many candies Robert has. Since John has twice as many candies as Robert, and John has 54 candies, we can set up an equation to find Robert's candies.

Let R be the number of candies Robert has. Since John has twice as many candies as Robert, we can write the equation: 2R = 54.

To find R, we divide both sides of the equation by 2: R = 54 / 2 = 27.

Now that we know Robert has 27 candies, we can find out how many candies James has. Since James has 6 more candies than Robert, we can write the equation: James = R + 6.

Substituting the value of R, we get: James = 27 + 6 = 33.

Now that we know James has 33 candies, we can find out how many more candies John has than James. We subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has: 54 - 33 = 21.

The final answer is: 21"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Dolly has 2 books and Pandora has 1 book. 

Dolly will read her own 2 books and Pandora's 1 book, so Dolly will read a total of 3 books.

Pandora will read her own 1 book and Dolly's 2 books, so Pandora will read a total of 3 books.

In total, they will read 3 (Dolly's total) + 3 (Pandora's total) = 6 books.

However, we need to consider that they also read each other's books. This means that Dolly will read Pandora's book and Pandora will read Dolly's book, but this is already included in the count of 6 books.

Therefore, the total number of books they will collectively read by the end is 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total number of hours Mike spends writing a week, we need to calculate the total number of letters he writes and then multiply it by the time it takes him to write one page.

First, let's find the total number of letters Mike writes. He has 3 pen pals left, and each of them sends 2 letters a week. So, the total number of letters he receives is 3 * 2 = 6 letters.

Since he responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters a week. 

Now, let's find the total number of pages he writes. Each letter is 5 pages long, so the total number of pages is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

Since he can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time he spends writing a week is 30 pages * 6 minutes/page = 180 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60. So, the total time he spends writing a week is 180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many minutes Jason has left, we need to calculate the total minutes used by his daily calls and the extra minutes, then subtract that from his total plan minutes.

First, let's calculate the total minutes used by his daily calls:
15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes

Next, let's add the extra minutes:
450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes

Now, let's subtract the total minutes used from Jason's total plan minutes:
1000 minutes - 750 minutes = 250 minutes

The final answer is: 250"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Griffin had 24 fries.

Kyle took 5 fries from Griffin. So, Griffin was left with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.

Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, which means Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Now, Griffin has 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

Ginger gave Griffin a certain number of fries, let's call it 'x'. After this, Griffin had 9 + x fries.

Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had taken, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. So, after Colby took 2 fries, Griffin had 9 + x - 2 = 7 + x fries.

We are given that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. Therefore, we can set up the equation 7 + x = 27.

To find the value of 'x', we subtract 7 from both sides of the equation: x = 27 - 7 = 20.

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28.

According to the problem, this difference is twice the total number of fish, so we can set up the equation:

28 = 2(2x)

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 2:

14 = 2x

Now, divide both sides by 2 again:

7 = x

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

The final answer is: 7"

"To find out how much each person paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the party supplies and then divide it by 3.

The total cost of the party supplies is:
$12 (cake) + $43 (presents) + $15 (decorations) + $4 (invitations) + $22 (goodie bags) = $96

Since Isabelle and her two parents split the cost evenly, we divide the total cost by 3:
$96 ÷ 3 = $32

Each person paid $32."
"To find the total amount spent by the chef, we need to calculate the total weight of onions and then multiply it by the cost per pound.

The chef bought 4 bags of onions, each weighing 50 pounds. So, the total weight of onions is:
4 bags * 50 pounds/bag = 200 pounds

Since a pound of onions costs $1.50, the total cost is:
200 pounds * $1.50/pound = $300

The chef spent $300."
"To find out how many calories Sue consumed, we first need to determine how many cookies she ate each day. 

On Monday, Sue's sister ate 5 cookies. Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate 5 * 4 = 20 cookies on Monday.

On Tuesday, Sue's sister ate 13 cookies. Since Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate 13 * 2 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.

The total number of cookies Sue ate is 20 + 26 = 46 cookies. 

The total number of cookies her sister ate is 5 + 13 = 18 cookies.

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, Sue consumed 46 * 200 = 9200 calories. Her sister consumed 18 * 200 = 3600 calories.

The difference in calories consumed is 9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories.

The final answer is: 5600"
"To find the number of boys in the third class, we first need to determine the total number of girls in the school. Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, and there are 3 classes with 20 students each, the total number of students in the school is 3 * 20 = 60.

Given that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls, the total number of girls in the school is 15 + 12 = 27. 

Since the school is 50% girls, the total number of boys in the school is also 60 - 27 = 33.

Now, we need to find the number of girls in the third class. Since the school is 50% girls, the third class should also have 50% girls. The total number of students in the third class is 20, so the number of girls in the third class is 20 * 0.5 = 10.

To find the number of boys in the third class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in the third class: 20 - 10 = 10.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars. 

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's represent the number of cougars killed today as 'x'. Then, the number of wolves killed today is 3x.

We also know that Rick killed three fewer cougars today than the previous night. So, the number of cougars killed today is 15 - 3 = 12.

Since we know the number of cougars killed today is 12, we can set up the equation 3x = 12 to find the number of wolves killed today. Solving for x, we get x = 4.

Now that we know x, we can find the number of wolves killed today by multiplying 3 and x, which is 3 * 4 = 12.

To find the total number of animals killed, we add the number of animals killed last night and today. The total number of wolves killed is 10 + 12 = 22. The total number of cougars killed is 15 + 12 = 27.

The total number of animals killed is 22 + 27 = 49.

"To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we first need to determine how many times Anne went down the slide. 

Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we need to calculate 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30. 

30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. 

So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne, so we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4.

21 * 4 = 84

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we first need to determine how many cows Mr. Sylas added to each stall. 

Initially, each stall had 20 cows. Mr. Sylas bought 40 cows and divided them equally among the 10 stalls. 

To find out how many cows he added to each stall, we divide the total number of cows bought (40) by the number of stalls (10). 

40 / 10 = 4

So, Mr. Sylas added 4 cows to each stall. 

Now, we need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. We know that each stall originally had 20 cows and 4 more were added. 

20 (original cows) + 4 (new cows) = 24 cows per stall

Since we want to know the total number of cows in 8 stalls, we multiply the number of cows per stall by 8.

24 * 8 = 192

"To find the total weight of the redwood tree, we need to calculate the total number of 10-foot sections and then multiply it by the weight of each section. 

The redwood tree is 200 feet tall, so we divide 200 by 10 to get the total number of sections: 200 / 10 = 20 sections.

Each section weighs 400 pounds, so we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section: 20 * 400 = 8000 pounds.

However, termites ate 30% of the wood, so we need to subtract 30% of the total weight from the total weight. To find 30% of 8000, we multiply 8000 by 0.3: 8000 * 0.3 = 2400.

Now, we subtract 2400 from the total weight: 8000 - 2400 = 5600 pounds.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, and Andrea has 52 apples. So, Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.
2. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.
3. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits. 
Andrea has 52 apples and 24 bananas, so she has 52 + 24 = 76 fruits.
Jamal has 44 apples and 48 bananas, so he has 44 + 48 = 92 fruits.

The total number of fruits is 76 (Andrea's fruits) + 92 (Jamal's fruits) = 168.

"To determine the total amount of flour needed, we need to calculate the amount of flour required for each day and then add them together.

For today, Carla is making 36 cookies. Since two cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many cups are needed for 36 cookies. 

First, let's find out how many dozens are in 36 cookies: 36 / 12 = 3. This means Carla needs 3 dozen cookies' worth of flour for today. Since 2 cups are needed for a dozen, Carla will need 3 * 2 = 6 cups of flour for today.

For tomorrow, Carla is making 30 cookies. Again, we need to find out how many dozens are in 30 cookies: 30 / 12 = 2.5. Since 2 cups are needed for a dozen, Carla will need 2.5 * 2 = 5 cups of flour for tomorrow.

Now, we add the flour needed for both days: 6 cups (for today) + 5 cups (for tomorrow) = 11 cups.

"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two-thirds of the pennies in the cup, we need to first calculate two-thirds of 9,300 pennies.

Two-thirds of 9,300 can be calculated as (2/3) * 9,300.

To find the value of two-thirds of 9,300, we can multiply 9,300 by 2 and then divide by 3.

First, multiply 9,300 by 2: 9,300 * 2 = 18,600

Then, divide 18,600 by 3: 18,600 / 3 = 6,200

Since each penny is worth $0.01, we can multiply 6,200 by 0.01 to find the total dollar amount.

6,200 * 0.01 = $62.00

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know it takes 20 minutes for the oil to heat up to 300 degrees. Then, it takes 40% longer to heat up to 400 degrees. 

40% of 20 minutes is 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes. So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat up to 400 degrees.

After warming the oil, it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil. It took 28 minutes to warm up the oil, so it takes 28 - 5 = 23 minutes to cook.

"To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we first need to determine the total number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette. 

The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches used for the body, which is 900 stitches. So, the collar takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

The total number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette is 90 + 180 = 270 stitches.

Since the total number of stitches for the sweater is 1800, and the body and the collar and rosette take 900 + 270 = 1170 stitches, the two sleeves must take 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches.

"To find the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we first need to determine their current ages. Since the sum of their ages is 20, we can represent their ages as x and 20 - x, where x is Mico's age.

Let's assume Mico's age is x. Then, Marco's age is 20 - x.

In 10 years, Mico's age will be x + 10, and Marco's age will be (20 - x) + 10 = 30 - x.

The sum of their ages in 10 years will be (x + 10) + (30 - x) = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's denote Ruby's current age as R and Sam's current age as S. According to the problem, Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, so we can write an equation:

R = 6S

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9, and Sam's age will be S + 9. According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can write another equation:

R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second one:

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the right side of the equation:

6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtracting 3S from both sides:

3S + 9 = 27

Subtracting 9 from both sides:

3S = 18

Dividing both sides by 3:

S = 6

So, Sam is 6 years old now.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total amount Peter paid, we need to calculate the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars separately and then add them together.

The cost of the popsicles is 20 * $0.25 = $5.
The cost of the ice cream bars is 4 * $0.50 = $2.

Now, we add the cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars together: $5 + $2 = $7.

The final answer is: $7"
"To find the total number of spots on the cobras, we need to multiply the number of cobras by the number of spots on each cobra. Since the cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, and a mamba has 70 / 2 = 35 spots, the cobra has 70 spots.

Total spots on cobras = 70 spots/cobra * 40 cobras = 2800 spots

To find the total number of spots on the mambas, we multiply the number of mambas by the number of spots on each mamba.

Total spots on mambas = 35 spots/mamba * 60 mambas = 2100 spots

Now, we add the total spots on the cobras and mambas to find the combined total.

Combined total spots = 2800 spots + 2100 spots = 4900 spots

To find half the number of spots, we divide the combined total by 2.

Half the combined total spots = 4900 spots / 2 = 2450 spots

The final answer is: 2450"
"To find the total number of people Maddy needs to buy pizza for, we need to calculate the total number of team members, coaches, and their guests. 

There are 12 team members, and each brings 2 guests, so the total number of guests is 12 * 2 = 24. Adding the 3 coaches, the total number of people is 12 + 24 + 3 = 39.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, the total number of pizzas needed is 39 / 3 = 13.

Each pizza costs $15, so the total cost will be 13 * 15 = $195.

The final answer is: $195"
"To find the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace, we first need to calculate the total space occupied by the topaz gemstones and the remaining space that will be filled by the sterling silver beads.

Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and there are 8 gemstones per necklace. So, the total space occupied by the gemstones is 8 inches.

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches. To find the remaining space for the sterling silver beads, we subtract the space occupied by the gemstones from the total length of the necklace:

25 inches (total length) - 8 inches (space occupied by gemstones) = 17 inches

Each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long. To find the number of beads that can fit in the remaining space, we divide the remaining space by the length of each bead:

17 inches / 0.25 inches (length of each bead) = 68

So, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

The final answer is: 68"
"To find the total number of stories written in the first week, we need to add the number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot.

Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week.
Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week.
Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week.

Total number of stories in the first week = 20 + 40 + 60 = 120

In the second week, each of them doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week. 

Alani doubled her stories from 20 to 20 * 2 = 40.
Braylen doubled his stories from 40 to 40 * 2 = 80.
Margot doubled her stories from 60 to 60 * 2 = 120.

Total number of stories in the second week = 40 + 80 + 120 = 240

To find the total number of stories written altogether, we need to add the number of stories written in the first and second weeks.

Total number of stories = 120 + 240 = 360

The final answer is: 360"
"To find the current age of Ann's brother, we need to multiply Ann's age by 2. 

Ann's age is 9 years, so her brother's current age is 9 * 2 = 18 years.

"To find out how many cents Kelly has left, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has and subtract the cost of the can of pop.

Kelly has 5 quarters, which is equivalent to 5 x 25 cents = 125 cents. She also has 2 dimes, which is equivalent to 2 x 10 cents = 20 cents. 

The total amount of money Kelly has is 125 cents + 20 cents = 145 cents.

Now, we subtract the cost of the can of pop, which is 55 cents, from the total amount of money Kelly has: 145 cents - 55 cents = 90 cents.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the number of rows of 5-star, we first need to determine the total number of stars and the number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows.

The total number of stars in the 8-star rows is 3 * 8 = 24.
The total number of stars in the 6-star rows is 2 * 6 = 12.
The total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows is 24 + 12 = 36.
The total number of stars in the flag is 76.
The number of stars in the 5-star rows is 76 - 36 = 40.
Since each row has 5 stars, the number of rows of 5-star is 40 / 5 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the number of trucks needed, we need to calculate the total weight of the flagstones and divide it by the weight capacity of each truck.

First, let's calculate the total weight of the flagstones:
80 flagstones * 75 pounds/flagstone = 6000 pounds

Next, we'll divide the total weight by the weight capacity of each truck:
6000 pounds / 2000 pounds/truck = 3

So, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

The final answer is: 3"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the speed of the car in the slow lane. Since it's traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, we can calculate it as follows:

Speed of the car in the fast lane = 60 miles/hour
Speed of the car in the slow lane = 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour

Now, we know that both cars traveled the same distance, which is 480 miles. We can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

For the car in the fast lane:
Time = 480 miles / 60 miles/hour = 8 hours

Since the car in the slow lane traveled the same distance, it will take the same amount of time to cover the distance. Therefore, the time taken by the car in the slow lane is also 8 hours.

The final answer is: 8"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem.

Ali has 22 medals. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.

Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

It's given that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. This means that the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have. Let's represent the total number of medals given out as 'x'. Then, we can write the equation:

39 = x / 10

To solve for 'x', we multiply both sides of the equation by 10:

x = 39 * 10
x = 390

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is 390.

The final answer is: 390"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of chocolate bars available. Since each packet contains 5 chocolate bars and there are 8 packets, the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

We know that each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, and there are 4 adults. So, the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 * 6 = 24.

Now, we need to find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children. This can be calculated by subtracting the number of chocolate bars given to adults from the total number of chocolate bars: 40 - 24 = 16.

Since there are 8 children, and the remaining chocolate bars are to be shared equally among them, we can find out how many chocolate bars each child will get by dividing the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children: 16 / 8 = 2.

Therefore, each child will get 2 chocolate bars.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much Susan earns, we need to calculate the total time she works and then multiply it by her hourly wage.

First, let's find the total time she works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total time.

Total time worked = 3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to convert the total time to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Now, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes:

150 minutes / 10 minutes/interval = 15 intervals

Since she earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by her earnings per interval:

15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

Therefore, Susan earns $75 for the online task.

The final answer is: $75"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the points each player has after the third round and then calculate the extra points they receive in the fourth round.

After the third round, Mike has 21 points. Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points. Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 2 * 21 = 42 points.

In the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. Mike has 21 points, which is not over 20, so he does not get an extra point. Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so he does not get an extra point. Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point.

The points after the fourth round are: Mike - 21, Jim - 18, Tony - 43.

To find the total points, we add the points of all three players: 21 + 18 + 43 = 82.

The final answer is: 82"
"To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we first need to determine how many oranges the sons washed. 

The oldest son is 8 years old, and he washes as many oranges as he is years old, so he washes 8 oranges. 

The youngest son is half as old as the oldest son, which means he is 8 / 2 = 4 years old. He also washes as many oranges as he is years old, so he washes 4 oranges.

In total, the sons wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

Will buys 15 oranges initially, and the sons wash 12 oranges. To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we subtract the number of oranges washed from the total number of oranges: 15 - 12 = 3.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the total count of activities, we need to calculate the number of each activity done on both days and then sum them up.

On the first day, Darren does:
- 100 pushups
- 50 squats
- 20 dumbbell presses

On the second day, he does:
- 20 more pushups than the first day: 100 + 20 = 120 pushups
- 10 fewer squats than the first day: 50 - 10 = 40 squats
- Doubles the number of dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses

Now, let's calculate the total count of each activity over the two days:
- Total pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Total squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Total dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

The total count of activities is the sum of the total count of each activity: 220 + 90 + 60 = 370.

"To find out how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day and then divide the total amount of rice available by this daily consumption.

First, let's calculate the daily consumption of rice. Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 3 meals per day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner). Since 5 members of the household eat rice every lunch and dinner, we'll assume they also eat it for breakfast. So, the total number of people eating rice per day is 5.

Daily consumption per person = 0.2 kg/meal * 3 meals = 0.6 kg/day
Total daily consumption for 5 people = 0.6 kg/day * 5 people = 3 kg/day

Now, let's calculate how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last:

Total rice available = 42 kg
Daily consumption = 3 kg/day

Number of days the rice will last = Total rice available / Daily consumption
= 42 kg / 3 kg/day
= 14 days

Since we want to find out how many weeks the rice will last, we'll divide the number of days by 7 (number of days in a week):

Number of weeks the rice will last = 14 days / 7 days/week
= 2 weeks

"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we first need to calculate the total number of crates he sold in the week. 

Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he sold bread for 5 days. 

He sold 20 crates over the weekend, which is 2 days. 
He sold 15 crates on Tuesday, 12 crates on Wednesday, and 18 crates on Thursday.

Total crates sold = 20 (weekend) + 15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday) = 65 crates

Since he was closed on Monday and Friday, he had 5 working days. His target for the week is 120 crates. 

To find the target for 5 working days, we need to calculate the daily target: 
Daily target = 120 / 7 = 17.14 (approximately)

Since we can't sell a fraction of a crate, we'll consider the daily target as 17 crates per day.

Target for 5 working days = 17 * 5 = 85 crates

Now, let's find out how many crates Sam was off from his target:
Crates off target = Target for 5 working days - Total crates sold
= 85 - 65
= 20

"To find the total cost of the desk, we need to determine the last bid made by Carmen. 

Since there are 3 other people who bid once, and Carmen bids after each of them, the total number of bids made by the other 3 people and Carmen is 3 + 3 = 6. 

The initial bid is $200, and each subsequent bid increases by $50. To find the last bid, we can use the formula for an arithmetic sequence: 

Last bid = Initial bid + (Number of bids - 1) * Increment
Last bid = 200 + (6 - 1) * 50
Last bid = 200 + 5 * 50
Last bid = 200 + 250
Last bid = 450

However, this is the last bid made by one of the other people. Since Carmen bids after each of them, she will make one more bid than the last person. Therefore, the last bid made by Carmen is the last bid made by the other people plus $50.

Last bid by Carmen = Last bid by other people + $50
Last bid by Carmen = 450 + 50
Last bid by Carmen = 500

The total cost of the desk is the last bid made by Carmen.

The final answer is: $500"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total miles driven, the total cost of driving, and the total bonus paid.

1. Total miles driven: Since John goes to work and back each day, the total miles driven per day is 2 * 30 = 60 miles. He goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year, so the total miles driven per year is 60 * 5 * 50 = 15,000 miles.

2. Total cost of driving: John is charged $2 per mile driven, so the total cost of driving per year is 15,000 * $2 = $30,000.

3. Total bonus paid: John gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus paid per year is $150 * 12 = $1,800.

4. Total cost: The total cost is the sum of the total cost of driving and the total bonus paid, which is $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

The final answer is: $31,800"
"To find out how many minutes Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to add the minutes he exercised on both days. 

Monday: 16 minutes
Sunday: 23 minutes
Combined: 16 + 23 = 39 minutes

Since Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to multiply the combined minutes by 2.

Combined minutes: 39
Twice the combined minutes: 2 * 39 = 78 minutes

Therefore, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal.

"To determine the number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider the folding process. 

When a piece of paper is folded vertically, it creates two layers: the front and the back. 

In a standard tabloid, the pages are arranged in a way that the first page is on the left back, the second page is on the left front, the 32nd page is on the right back, and the 31st page is on the right front. 

This means that we need two pieces of paper to create the left and right sides of the tabloid. 

Since we have 32 pages, we need two pieces of paper to create the left and right sides, each with 16 pages (32 / 2 = 16). 

Therefore, the total number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid is 2.

"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to first determine how many books she sold in the first year and the second year.

Let's denote the number of books sold in the current year as x. We are given that the number of books sold in the first year is twice as many as the current year, so the number of books sold in the first year is 2x.

We know that there are 50 unsold books, and the total number of books is 250. Therefore, the total number of books sold is 250 - 50 = 200.

We are also given that the number of books sold in the current year is 45. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 200

Combine like terms:

3x = 200

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 66.67

Since we can't sell a fraction of a book, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can use the exact value of x to find the number of books sold in the first year.

Number of books sold in the first year = 2x = 2 * 66.67 = 133.33

Since we can't sell a fraction of a book, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can use the exact value of the number of books sold in the first year to find the total amount of money earned in the second year.

Number of books sold in the second year = 45

Price per book = $20

Total amount of money earned in the second year = Number of books sold in the second year * Price per book
= 45 * 20

"To find out how much Watson made in April, we need to calculate his total earnings from his hourly wage and the weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate his total hours worked in a week: 
10 hours/day * 5 days/week = 50 hours/week

Since Watson earns $10 per hour, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:
50 hours/week * $10/hour = $500/week

In a month, there are approximately 4 weeks. So, his total earnings from his hourly wage in April are:
$500/week * 4 weeks = $2000

Additionally, Watson gets a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well. Since the company performed well for the whole month, he gets the bonus for 4 weeks:
$300/week * 4 weeks = $1200

Now, let's add his earnings from his hourly wage and the bonus to find his total earnings in April:
$2000 + $1200 = $3200

The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. 

Two-thirds of 60 is calculated as (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves sold in the morning.

Now, we need to find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales. The total number of loaves left is 60 - 40 = 20 loaves.

Half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening. Half of 20 is calculated as (1/2) * 20 = 10 loaves.

Since the remaining loaves are divided equally between the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is 10.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which Joey loses weight and then use that rate to calculate how long it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight.

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. To find the rate at which Joey loses weight, we divide the weight lost by the number of weeks:

Weight loss rate = Weight lost / Number of weeks
Weight loss rate = 8 pounds / 4 weeks
Weight loss rate = 2 pounds per week

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, we can multiply the number of weeks it takes Joey to lose the weight by 4:

Time for Sandy = 4 weeks * 4
Time for Sandy = 16 weeks

"To find the total savings, we need to calculate the savings on the tubs of ice cream and the packets of milk separately and then add them together.

The original price of a tub of ice cream is $13, and it's now sold at $11. The discount on each tub of ice cream is $13 - $11 = $2.

If you buy 2 tubs of ice cream, the total discount will be 2 * $2 = $4.

The original price of a packet of milk is not given, but we know that it was sold at a discount of $0.5. Let's assume the original price of a packet of milk is x. The selling price of a packet of milk will be x - $0.5.

Since we are not given the original price of a packet of milk, we cannot calculate the exact discount on each packet. However, we can express the total discount on 4 packets of milk as 4 * ($x - $0.5).

To find the total savings, we need to know the original price of a packet of milk. However, since the original price of a packet of milk is not provided, we can express the total savings as $4 (discount on 2 tubs of ice cream) plus the discount on 4 packets of milk, which is 4 * ($x - $0.5).

Since the original price of a packet of milk is not given, we cannot provide a numerical answer.

However, if we assume the original price of a packet of milk is $1, then the total savings will be $4 (discount on 2 tubs of ice cream) + 4 * ($1 - $0.5) = $4 + 4 * $0.5 = $4 + $2 = $6.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. Calculate the total cost of the business suits:
   Number of suits = 6
   Cost per suit = $100
   Total cost of suits = 6 * $100 = $600

2. Calculate the total cost of the suitcases:
   Number of suitcases = 3
   Cost per suitcase = $50
   Total cost of suitcases = 3 * $50 = $150

3. Calculate the cost of the flight ticket:
   Cost of a business suit = $100
   5 times the cost of a business suit = 5 * $100 = $500
   The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit, so the cost of the flight ticket = $500 + $700 = $1200

4. Calculate the total amount spent so far:
   Total spent so far = Total cost of suits + Total cost of suitcases + Cost of flight ticket
   Total spent so far = $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950

5. Calculate the total amount available for spending, including the savings:
   Total amount available = $6000 (initial amount) - $2000 (savings) = $4000

6. Calculate the amount left for buying gifts:

3. The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah, so it was 3000 * 20 = 60000.
4. The population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now, so the current population is 2 * 60000 = 120000.

The final answer is: 120000"
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as D, the number of players on the offense as O, and the number of players on the special teams as S.

We are given that there are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense, so we can write an equation:

O = 2D

We are also given that there is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, so we can write another equation:

S = D/2

We know that the total number of players on the team is 105, and this is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams. Therefore, we can write the equation:

O + D + S = 105

Substituting the expressions for O and S from the first two equations into the third equation, we get:

2D + D + D/2 = 105

Combine like terms:

2.5D = 105

Divide both sides by 2.5:

D = 42

The final answer is: 42"
"To find the total number of people invited, we first need to calculate the number of people from the 2 families with 6 people and the 3 families with 4 people.

For the 2 families with 6 people, the total number of people is 2 * 6 = 12.
For the 3 families with 4 people, the total number of people is 3 * 4 = 12.
The total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.

However, 8 people couldn't come due to illness. So, we subtract 8 from the total number of people invited: 24 - 8 = 16.

Then, 1/4 of the people who couldn't come due to illness had previous commitments. 1/4 of 8 is 2. So, we subtract 2 from the number of people who couldn't come due to illness: 8 - 2 = 6.

Now, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come due to illness and previous commitments from the total number of people invited: 16 - 6 = 10.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store, we need to calculate the total number of marbles first.

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and added them to a store that had 50. So, the total number of marbles in the store after buying from Johanna is 20 + 50 = 70.

His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna, his father gave him 2/5 * 20 = 8 marbles.

Now, the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store is 70 (initial marbles) + 20 (bought from Johanna) + 8 (given by his father) = 98 marbles.

Each marble weighs 2kgs, so the total weight of marbles is 98 * 2 = 196 kgs.

The final answer is: 196"
"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (such as the pool) is V = length * width * height.

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length (L) = 6 feet
- Width (W) = 4 feet
- Height (H) = 5 feet

We can calculate the volume as follows:
V = L * W * H
V = 6 * 4 * 5
V = 120 cubic feet

Now, we know the volume of the pool is 120 cubic feet. The cost to fill the pool is $0.1 per cubic foot. To find the total cost, we multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot:
Total Cost = Volume * Cost per cubic foot
Total Cost = 120 * $0.1
Total Cost = $12

The final answer is: $12"
"To find the total number of children in the classroom, we need to calculate the number of girls, nongendered children, and then add them to the number of boys.

Given that there are 30 boys, and the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, the number of girls can be calculated as:
Girls = 3 * Boys = 3 * 30 = 90

The classroom has 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, so the number of nongendered children can be calculated as:
Nongendered children = (1/10) * Boys = (1/10) * 30 = 3

Now, we can find the total number of children by adding the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
Total children = Boys + Girls + Nongendered children = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123

The final answer is: 123"
"To solve this problem, we can use the given ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This means that for every 1 electric pole, 3 electric wires are needed.

Let's denote the number of electric poles as 'x'. According to the given ratio, the number of electric wires will be 3x.

We are given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45. So, we can set up the equation:

3x = 45

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 45 / 3
x = 15

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required by the electric company to supply the electricity in the neighborhood is 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of people who left the party. We know that 22 men stayed, and there were initially 25 men. So, the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3.

Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, the total number of people who left is 1/4 of the initial total number of people. Let's denote the initial total number of people as x. Then, 1/4x = 3.

To find x, we multiply both sides by 4: x = 3 * 4 = 12.

Now, we know that the initial total number of people was 12 + 25 (men) + 15 (women) = 52. 

The total number of people who left is 1/4 of 52, which is 13. Since 3 men left, the number of women who left is 13 - 3 = 10.

Initially, there were 15 women. So, the number of women left is 15 - 10 = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the cost of the pen, we need to first determine the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book, and the book costs $4, the magazine costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Given that the pen costs $1 less than the magazine, we can find the cost of the pen by subtracting $1 from the cost of the magazine. Therefore, the cost of the pen is $2 - $1 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To find the total number of pencils Jam has, we know she has 3 boxes and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils. We can set up an equation to represent this: 3x + 2 = 26, where x is the number of pencils in each box.

To solve for x, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: 3x = 26 - 2, 3x = 24.

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 3 to find the value of x: x = 24 / 3, x = 8.

Now that we know each box contains 8 pencils, we can find the total number of pencils Jam has: 3 boxes * 8 pencils per box = 24 pencils.

We also know that Meg has 46 pencils. To find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have, we add their pencils together: 24 pencils (Jam) + 46 pencils (Meg) = 70 pencils.

Since each box contains 8 pencils, we can find the total number of boxes needed to store all their pencils by dividing the total number of pencils by 8: 70 pencils / 8 pencils per box = 8.75.

Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we round up to the nearest whole number to ensure all pencils are stored. Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

The final answer is: 9"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, let's find out how many ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, we can divide 65 by 13 to get the number of ice cubes needed:

65 / 13 = 5

Now, we know that each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Since we need 5 ice cubes, the total weakening effect of the ice cubes is:

5 * 12 = 60 milliliters

Next, we need to consider the effect of adding 15 milliliters of cream. Since any added liquid weakens the coffee, we add this to the weakening effect of the ice cubes:

60 + 15 = 75 milliliters

So, Shannon's iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.

The final answer is: 75"
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple ratio. Since 2 old records are traded for 1 new record, the ratio of old records to new records is 2:1.

Let's denote the number of old records brought in by the 5 people as 'x'. Since 5 people come in and leave with 7 new records, the total number of new records is 7. 

Since the ratio of old records to new records is 2:1, the number of old records brought in must be twice the number of new records. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x / 5 = 2 / 1 * 7

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x / 5 = 14

Multiplying both sides by 5, we get:

x = 70

So, the 5 people brought in 70 old records.

The final answer is: 70"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of junior programmers and the number of senior programmers. 

The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, which is 100. 

Number of junior programmers = (2/5) * 100 = 40

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers is the remaining 3/5 of the total number of employees.

Number of senior programmers = (3/5) * 100 = 60

The junior programmers are each paid $2000 per month, so the total amount paid to junior programmers is:

Total amount paid to junior programmers = Number of junior programmers * Salary of junior programmers
= 40 * $2000
= $80,000

Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so their salary is $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month.

The total amount paid to senior programmers is:

Total amount paid to senior programmers = Number of senior programmers * Salary of senior programmers
= 60 * $2400
= $144,000

The total amount paid to all programmers is the sum of the total amount paid to junior programmers and the total amount paid to senior programmers.

Total amount paid to all programmers = Total amount paid to junior programmers + Total amount paid to senior programmers
= $80,000 + $144,000
= $224,000

The final answer is: $224,000"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as 'x'.

Initially, there were x people on the bus.

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the total number of people became x + 5.

At the second bus stop, 7 people got down, so the total number of people became (x + 5) - 7 = x - 2.

Then, 8 more people got in, so the total number of people became (x - 2) + 8 = x + 6.

We are given that the total number of people heading to the third stop is 20, so we can set up the equation:

x + 6 = 20

To solve for x, we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:

x = 20 - 6
x = 14

The final answer is: 14"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left.
3. He passes 14 out to his friends, so he has 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops left.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now, he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.
5. He eats 3 more that night, so he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops left.
6. He eats 2 more in the morning, so he has 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops left.

The final answer is: 31"
"To find the time it takes to fully charge the phone, we need to first determine how many percentage points are left to charge. Since the phone is already at 60% charged, it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more to be fully charged.

Given that the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time it takes to charge the remaining 40% as follows:

Time = Total percentage points left / Rate of charge per minute
Time = 40 / (1/3)
Time = 40 * 3
Time = 120 minutes

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60:
Time = 120 / 60
Time = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we need to follow the sequence of events. 

Initially, Erin has 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her 10 more, so she now has 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops. 

Then, Erin gives 3 lollipops to Ella, so we subtract 3 from 17: 17 - 3 = 14.

Therefore, Erin has 14 lollipops left.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's determine the rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip. They spent $80, and for every $20 they spend, they get $1 off their next purchase. 

$80 / $20 = 4, so they earned 4 rewards.

Now, let's calculate the rewards they used on this shopping trip. They spent $43 and used their rewards, but we don't know the exact amount of rewards they used yet. However, we do know that they applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price.

Let's denote the amount of rewards used as 'x'. Since the coupon took twice the amount of rewards off the price, the amount taken off by the coupon is 2x.

The total amount taken off the price is the sum of the rewards used and the coupon: x + 2x = 3x.

Now, let's set up an equation to represent the situation. The customer spent $43, and the total amount taken off the price is 3x. The amount they paid is the difference between the price and the total amount taken off.

Let's denote the price of the items as 'p'. The amount they paid is p - 3x = 43.

However, we still need to find the value of x. We know that the customer earned 4 rewards from their last shopping trip, and they used some of those rewards on this shopping trip. Since they used their rewards, the amount of rewards they used must be less than or equal to 4.

Let's assume the customer used all 4 rewards on this shopping trip. In this case, the amount taken off the price is 3x = 3(4) = 12.

Now, we can set up the equation p - 12 = 43, where p is the price of the items.

p = 43 + 12
p = 55

Now that we have the price of the items, we can find the amount the customer paid. The amount they paid is p - 3x = 55 - 12 = 43.

However, this is the same as the initial price, which means our assumption that the customer used all 4 rewards was incorrect. Let's try another assumption.

Let's assume the customer used 3 rewards on this shopping trip. In this case, the amount taken off the price is 3x = 3(3) = 9.

Now, we can set up the equation p - 9 = 43, where p is the price of the items.

p = 43 + 9
p = 52

Now that we have the price of the items, we can find the amount the customer paid. The amount they paid is p - 3x = 52 - 9 = 43.

However, this is the same as the initial price, which means our assumption that the customer used 3 rewards was also incorrect. Let's try another assumption.

Let's assume the customer used 2 rewards on this shopping trip. In this case, the amount taken off the price is 3x = 3(2) = 6.

Now, we can set up the equation p - 6 = 43, where p is the price of the items.

p = 43 + 6
p = 49

Now that we have the price of the items, we can find the amount the customer paid. The amount they paid is p - 3x = 49 - 6 = 43.

However, this is the same as the initial price, which means our assumption that the customer used 2 rewards was also incorrect. Let's try another assumption.

Let's assume the customer used 1 reward on this shopping trip. In this case, the amount taken off the price is 3x = 3(1) = 3.

Now, we can set up the equation p - 3 = 43, where p is the price of the items.

p = 43 + 3
p = 46

Now that we have the price of the items, we can find the amount the customer paid. The amount they paid is p - 3x = 46 - 3 = 43.

However, this is the same as the initial price, which means our assumption that the customer used 1 reward was also incorrect. Let's try another assumption.

Let's assume the customer used 0 rewards on this shopping trip. In this case, the amount taken off the price is 3x = 3(0) = 0.

Now, we can set up the equation p = 43, where p is the price of the items.

The amount they paid is p = 43.

However, this is the same as the initial price, which means our assumption that the customer used 0 rewards was also incorrect. Let's try another assumption.

Let's assume the customer used more than 4 rewards on this shopping trip. However, this is impossible since they only earned 4 rewards from their last shopping trip.

Now, let's try another approach. We know that the customer spent $43 and used their rewards and a coupon. The coupon took twice the amount of rewards off the price. Let's denote the amount of rewards used as 'x'. The amount taken off the price is 3x.

We can set up the equation p - 3x = 43, where p is the price of the items.

However, we still need to find the value of x. We know that the customer earned 4 rewards from their last shopping trip, and they used some of those rewards on this shopping trip. Since they used their rewards, the amount of rewards they used must be less than or equal to 4.

Let's try to find the value of x by setting up an equation. We know that the customer earned 4 rewards and used some of those rewards on this shopping trip. The amount of rewards they used is x.

We can set up the equation 4 - x = y, where y is the number of rewards they have left.

However, we don't know the value of y. We do know that the customer used their rewards and a coupon on this shopping trip. The coupon took twice the amount of rewards off the price. Let's denote the amount of rewards used as 'x'. The amount taken off the price is 3x.

We can set up the equation p - 3x = 43, where p is the price of the items.

However, we still need to find the value of x. We can try to find the value of x by setting up an equation. We know that the customer earned 4 rewards and used some of those rewards on this shopping trip. The amount of rewards they used is x.

We can set up the equation 4 - x = y, where y is the number of rewards they have left.

We also know that the customer used a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. The amount taken off the price is 3x.

We can set up the equation 3x = 2y.

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for x and y.

4 - x = y
3x = 2y

We can substitute the expression for y from the first equation into the second equation.

3x = 2(4 - x)
3x = 8 - 2x

Now we can add 2x to both sides of the equation.

5x = 8

Now we can divide both sides of the equation by 5.

x = 8/5
x = 1.6

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the amount the customer paid. The amount they paid is p - 3x = p - 3(1.6).

However, we still need to find the value of p. We know that the customer spent $43 and used their rewards and a coupon. The coupon took twice the amount of rewards off the price. Let's denote the amount of rewards used as 'x'. The amount taken off the price is 3x.

We can set up the equation p - 3x = 43, where p is the price of the items.

Now that we have the value of x, we can substitute it into the equation.

p - 3(1.6) = 43

p - 4.8 = 43

Now we can add 4.8 to both sides of the equation.

p = 47.8

Now that we have the price of the items, we can find the amount the customer paid. The amount they paid is p - 3x = 47.8 - 4.8 = 43.

However, this is the same as the initial price, which means our calculation is incorrect. Let's try another approach.

We know that the customer spent $43 and used their rewards and a coupon. The coupon took twice the amount of rewards off the price. Let's denote the amount of rewards used as 'x'. The amount taken off the price is 3x.

4 - x = y
3x = 2y

We can substitute the expression for y from the first equation into the second equation.

3x = 2(4 - x)
3x = 8 - 2x

Now we can add 2x to both sides of the equation.

5x = 8

Now we can divide both sides of the equation by 5.

x = 8/5
x = 1.6

However, this is not an integer, which means our assumption that the customer used an integer number of rewards was incorrect. Let's try another approach.

Let's try to find the value of x by setting up an equation. We know that the customer earned 4 rewards and used some of those rewards on this shopping trip. The amount of rewards they used is x.

We can set up the equation 4 - x = y, where y is the number of rewards they have left.

We also know that the customer used a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. The amount taken off the price is 3x.

We can set up the equation 3x = 2y.

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for x and y.

4 - x = y
3x = 2y

We can substitute the expression for y from the first equation into the second equation.

3x = 2(4 - x)
3x = 8 - 2x

Now we can add 2x to both sides of the equation.

5x = 8

Now we can divide both sides of the equation by 5.

x = 8/5
x = "
"To determine which job pays more, we need to calculate the net pay for each job.

For Job A, the total income is $15/hour * 2000 hours/year = $30,000/year. The total tax paid is 20% of $30,000, which is 0.20 * $30,000 = $6,000. The net pay for Job A is $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

For Job B, the total income is $42,000. The property tax is $6,000, so the net income before taxes is $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000. The tax paid is 10% of $36,000, which is 0.10 * $36,000 = $3,600. The net pay for Job B is $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

To find the difference in net pay between the two jobs, we subtract the net pay of Job A from the net pay of Job B: $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

The final answer is: $8,400"
"To find the number of unmanned ruined castles, we first need to find the total number of ruined castles. 

40% of the castles are ruins, so we multiply the total number of castles by 0.4 (which is the decimal form of 40%): 
220 * 0.4 = 88

Now, we know that half of the ruined castles are unmanned. To find the number of unmanned ruined castles, we divide the total number of ruined castles by 2:
88 / 2 = 44

The final answer is: 44"
"To find the total cost of each offer, we need to calculate the total amount paid in advance and the total amount paid in installments.

Furniture United's offer:
- Advance payment: $1,350
- Monthly installments: 6 * $350 = $2,100
- Total cost: $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450

Cozy Homes' offer:
- Advance payment: $1,100
- Monthly installments: 9 * $250 = $2,250
- Total cost: $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350

Now, we can find the cost difference between the two offers:
Cost difference = Total cost of Furniture United's offer - Total cost of Cozy Homes' offer
Cost difference = $3,450 - $3,350
Cost difference = $100

"To find the final value of Maria's shares, we need to calculate the stock price after the first year and then after the second year.

Initially, Maria buys 8 shares for $8 each, so the total cost is 8 * 8 = $64.

The stock price increases by 50% in the first year. To find the new price, we multiply the original price by 1.5 (100% + 50% = 150%, or 1.5 as a decimal). 

New price after the first year = 8 * 1.5 = $12.

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. To find the new price, we multiply the price after the first year by 0.75 (100% - 25% = 75%, or 0.75 as a decimal).

New price after the second year = 12 * 0.75 = $9.

Now, we multiply the new price after the second year by the number of shares to find the final value of Maria's shares.

Final value = 9 * 8 = $72.

The final answer is: $72"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many hot dogs each person ate and then compare John's and Luke's amounts.

Luke ate 2 hot dogs.

Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, so Thomas ate 2 * 3 = 6 hot dogs.

John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so John ate 6 / 2 = 3 hot dogs.

To find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we need to subtract Luke's amount from John's amount: 3 - 2 = 1.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of students in the two equal groups as 'x'. Since the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the smallest group is 'x - 10'.

We know that the total number of students in the class is 200, and the sum of the students in all three groups is equal to 200. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 70

Since the smallest group has 'x - 10' students, we can find the number of students in the smallest group by subtracting 10 from x:

x - 10 = 70 - 10
= 60

The final answer is: 60"
"Let's denote the number of cows as C and the number of chickens as CH. We are given that the total number of animals is 60, so C + CH = 60. We are also given that the number of chickens is twice the number of cows, so CH = 2C.

We can substitute the second equation into the first one to get C + 2C = 60, which simplifies to 3C = 60. Dividing both sides by 3, we get C = 20. 

Since CH = 2C, we can substitute C = 20 into this equation to get CH = 2 * 20 = 40.

The number of legs of a cow is 4 and the number of legs of a chicken is 2. The total number of legs of the cows is 4 * 20 = 80 and the total number of legs of the chickens is 2 * 40 = 80.

The total number of legs of all the animals is 80 + 80 = 160.

"To find out how many balls Josh is juggling at the talent show, we need to determine how many balls he had before the incident and then subtract the balls that were lost.

Initially, Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week for 4 weeks. So, the total number of balls he had before the talent show is 3 + (1 * 4) = 7.

However, during the performance, Josh drops 3 balls, 2 of which are caught by the crowd, and 1 is lost. So, the total number of balls lost is 1.

Now, let's subtract the balls lost from the total number of balls Josh had before the incident: 7 - 1 = 6.

Josh starts to juggle on stage with 6 balls.

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the weights of the blue beetle, green toad, yellow snake, and red bird. 

Since the pink frog weighs 50 pounds and it weighs the same as the blue beetle and the green toad, we can conclude that the blue beetle and the green toad also weigh 50 pounds.

The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.

The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we can find the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal by adding the weights of all the animals and the container: 50 (pink frog) + 50 (blue beetle) + 50 (green toad) + 60 (yellow snake) + 30 (red bird) + 20 (container) = 260 pounds.

"To find the total distance Tyson covered in June, we first need to calculate the new daily distance he needs to run based on his coach's advice. 

The coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters in a day. This means we need to find 1/5 of 5000 meters and add it to the original distance.

1/5 of 5000 meters is (1/5) * 5000 = 1000 meters.

So, the new daily distance is 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters.

Since there are 30 days in June, we can find the total distance covered in June by multiplying the new daily distance by 30.

Total distance = 6000 meters/day * 30 days = 180,000 meters.

"To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we need to calculate the total number of cookies consumed by her son and her husband, and then subtract that from the total number of cookies in a bag.

Jenny's son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, so the total number of cookies he eats in a week is 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

Jenny's husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so the total number of cookies he eats in a week is 1 * 7 = 7 cookies.

The total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband is 20 + 7 = 27 cookies.

Since there are 36 cookies in a bag, and 27 cookies are consumed by her son and husband, the number of cookies left for Jenny is 36 - 27 = 9 cookies.

Therefore, Jenny eats 9 cookies.

"To find the total cost of the shirts, we first need to calculate the discount amount. The original price of each shirt is $30, and the discount is 40%. 

Discount amount = 40% of $30 = 0.4 * $30 = $12

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the discounted price of one shirt. 

Discounted price of one shirt = $30 - $12 = $18

Since Davos bought 2 shirts, we multiply the discounted price of one shirt by 2 to get the total cost.

Total cost = $18 * 2 = $36

"To find the percentage increase in the amount of money the factory is making per day, we need to first calculate the difference in the amount of money they are making per day now and the amount they used to make per day.

The factory used to make $100 per tractor and sold 10 tractors a day, so they made $100 * 10 = $1000 per day.

Now, they make $220 per silo and sell 5 silos a day, so they make $220 * 5 = $1100 per day.

The difference in the amount of money they are making per day now and the amount they used to make per day is $1100 - $1000 = $100.

To find the percentage increase, we divide the difference by the original amount and multiply by 100:

"To find out how many plant pots April has left over, we first need to determine the total number of plant pots she needs for the school garden. 

The school needs 30 plant pots for the daisies. Since they need twice as many for the roses, we multiply 30 by 2 to get the number of plant pots needed for the roses. 

30 * 2 = 60

So, the total number of plant pots needed for both daisies and roses is 30 + 60 = 90.

April had already bought 100 plant pots from the garden center. To find out how many plant pots she has left over, we subtract the total number of plant pots needed from the number she already bought.

100 - 90 = 10

Therefore, April has 10 plant pots left over.

Time spent boating = 6 hours
Time spent swimming = 6 / 2 = 3 hours

Next, let's calculate the time spent watching shows. 
Time spent watching shows = 3 shows * 2 hours per show = 6 hours

Now, we know that the time spent watching shows is 30% of the total time. Let's represent the total time as 'T'. 
30% of T = 6 hours
0.3T = 6
T = 6 / 0.3
T = 20 hours

"To find out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to first calculate the total cost of the activities. 

The cost of mini-golf for Morgan and her friends is $5 per person. Since we don't know the number of friends yet, let's call it 'x'. The total cost for mini-golf will be 1 (Morgan) + x (friends) * $5.

The cost of arcade tokens is $5.

The cost of go-karts is $10 per ride, and Morgan and her friends will ride it twice. So, the total cost for go-karts will be 2 * (1 + x) * $10.

The total budget is $90, so we can set up the equation: 
1 + x + 5 + 2 * 10 * (1 + x) = 90

Simplifying the equation:
1 + x + 5 + 20 + 20x = 90
26 + 21x = 90

Subtract 26 from both sides:
21x = 64

Divide both sides by 21:
x = 64 / 21
x = 3.047619 (round down to 3 since you can't invite a fraction of a person)

However, this is the number of friends plus Morgan herself. Since we want to know the number of friends, we subtract 1 from x:

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how much change Billy had after buying the candy. Since he spent $1.5 per pound and he had $10, we can set up an equation to find the number of pounds of candy he bought. Let's call the number of pounds 'x'. The equation would be:

10 = 1.5x + change

Since we don't know the change yet, we'll come back to this equation later.

Next, we know that Billy spent half of his change on gumballs. He bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, so the total cost of gumballs is:

40 * 0.05 = 2

Since he spent half of his change on gumballs, the other half of his change is also 2. This means his total change is 4.

Now we can substitute the change into the first equation:

10 = 1.5x + 4

Subtract 4 from both sides:

6 = 1.5x

Divide both sides by 1.5:

4 = x

So, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy.

"Let's denote Carver's age as C and his son's age as S. We are given that Carver is 45 years old, so C = 45. We are also given that Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son, which can be expressed as C = 2S - 5.

Substituting C = 45 into the equation, we get 45 = 2S - 5. To solve for S, we need to isolate S on one side of the equation.

First, we add 5 to both sides of the equation: 45 + 5 = 2S - 5 + 5, which simplifies to 50 = 2S.

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for S: 50 / 2 = 2S / 2, which simplifies to 25 = S.

"To find the total distance the train travels in one trip, we need to add the distances between the three cities. The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles, and the distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles. The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than the sum of the first two distances, which is 75 + 100 = 175 miles. So, the distance from the third city to the first city is 175 - 50 = 125 miles.

The total distance for one trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train travels this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles.

To find out how many days the train goes between services, we need to divide the total distance the train can travel before needing service (18,000 miles) by the total distance it travels in a day (900 miles).

18,000 / 900 = 20 days.

"To find the total time taken for the trip, we need to calculate the time taken for each part of the trip and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time taken for the trip to his friend's house. The distance is 200 miles and the speed is 70 mph. 

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 200 miles / 70 mph
Time = 2.857 hours (approximately)

However, he had to take a detour that added 10 miles to his trip. So, the actual distance traveled to his friend's house is 200 + 10 = 210 miles. 

Time taken for the detour = 10 miles / 70 mph
Time taken for the detour = 0.143 hours (approximately)

Total time taken to reach his friend's house = 2.857 hours + 0.143 hours
Total time taken to reach his friend's house = 3 hours

Now, let's calculate the time taken for the trip back home. The distance is 240 miles and the speed is 80 mph.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 240 miles / 80 mph
Time = 3 hours

Total time taken for the trip = Time taken to reach his friend's house + Time taken for the trip back home
Total time taken for the trip = 3 hours + 3 hours

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many points Erin has now. Since Erin has three times more points than Sara, and Sara scored 8 points, we can calculate Erin's current points as follows:

Erin's current points = 3 * Sara's points
Erin's current points = 3 * 8
Erin's current points = 24

Now, we know that Erin scored 14 points and has a total of 24 points. To find out how many points Erin had before, we need to subtract the points she scored from her current total:

Erin's previous points = Erin's current points - points scored
Erin's previous points = 24 - 14
Erin's previous points = 10

"To find the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to calculate the cost of the picture frames, the etching, the pins, and the cords separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames. There are 44 seniors, and each picture frame costs $20. So, the total cost of the picture frames is 44 * $20 = $880.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of etching the logo on each picture frame. The etching costs an additional 20% of the cost of the picture frame, which is 20% of $20 = 0.2 * $20 = $4. So, the total cost of etching is 44 * $4 = $176.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the pins. 2 seniors will receive pins, and each pin costs $5. So, the total cost of the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the cords. 1/4 of the seniors are officers, which is 1/4 * 44 = 11 officers. Each officer will receive a cord that costs $12. So, the total cost of the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, we can add up the costs of the picture frames, etching, pins, and cords to find the total cost of the senior gifts. The total cost is $880 + $176 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

The final answer is: $1198"
"To find the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we first need to calculate the materials cost. Since Ethan saved 20% by making it himself, we can assume that the materials cost is 80% of the market price.

The market price of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400. 

To find 80% of $400, we multiply $400 by 0.8 (since 100% - 20% = 80%).

Materials cost = $400 * 0.8 = $320

This is the cost of the materials. However, the question asks for the total cost, which includes the cost of the materials and any other expenses. Since the question does not provide any additional expenses, we can assume that the total cost is equal to the materials cost.

Total cost = $320

The final answer is: $320"
"To find the total number of tennis shoes sold, we need to calculate the number of shoes sold on each day and then add them together.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes they sold on Friday, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the amount they did the day before, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six people returned their pairs because they didn't fit, so we need to subtract those from the total number of shoes sold on Sunday. The number of shoes returned is 6 pairs * 2 (since each pair has 2 shoes) = 12 shoes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of shoes sold by adding the number of shoes sold on each day and subtracting the number of shoes returned on Sunday:

Total shoes sold = 14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 14 (Sunday) - 12 (returned shoes)
Total shoes sold = 66 - 12
Total shoes sold = 54

"To find the total amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we first need to find the value of the faulty equipment and subtract it from the total amount spent.

The total amount spent on equipment is $400,000. The faulty equipment is 40% of the total amount.

40% of $400,000 = 0.4 * $400,000 = $160,000

This is the value of the faulty equipment. To find the value of the functioning equipment, we subtract the value of the faulty equipment from the total amount spent.

Value of functioning equipment = Total amount spent - Value of faulty equipment
= $400,000 - $160,000

First, let's find the number of sheep in each half: 
Total sheep = 30
Half of the sheep = 30 / 2 = 15

Now, let's calculate the milk from each half:
Milk from the first half = 15 * 1 kg = 15 kg
Milk from the second half = 15 * 2 kg = 30 kg

Total milk collected = Milk from the first half + Milk from the second half

"To find the number of pupils who like the color yellow, we first need to determine the number of pupils who like blue, then the number of pupils who like green, and finally subtract the sum of these two from the total number of pupils.

First, half of the class likes blue. Since there are 40 pupils in the class, half of them would be 40 / 2 = 20 pupils who like blue.

Next, one-fourth of the remaining pupils like green. The remaining pupils after excluding those who like blue are 40 - 20 = 20. One-fourth of 20 is 20 / 4 = 5 pupils who like green.

Now, we need to find the number of pupils who like yellow. The total number of pupils who like blue and green is 20 + 5 = 25. Subtracting this from the total number of pupils gives us the number of pupils who like yellow: 40 - 25 = 15.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many apples Lucy picked on Monday, and then add the apples picked on Tuesday and Wednesday.

Let's start by finding out how many apples Lucy picked on Monday. We know that she sold all the apples picked on Monday and made $56 at $4 per apple. 

To find the number of apples picked on Monday, we can divide the total amount of money made ($56) by the price per apple ($4).

Apples picked on Monday = Total money made / Price per apple
Apples picked on Monday = $56 / $4
Apples picked on Monday = 14

Now, we know that Lucy picked 12 apples on Tuesday. 

On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she did the previous day, which is 2 * 12 = 24 apples.

To find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we add the apples picked on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.

Total apples picked = Apples picked on Monday + Apples picked on Tuesday + Apples picked on Wednesday
Total apples picked = 14 + 12 + 24
Total apples picked = 50

"To find the monthly payment, we need to calculate the total interest paid over the five months and then divide it by the number of months. 

First, we need to find the total interest paid over the five months. The formula for simple interest is:

Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

Here, Principal = $3,650, Rate = 10% or 0.10, and Time = 5 months.

Interest = $3,650 * 0.10 * 5
Interest = $1,825

Now, we need to add the interest to the principal to find the total amount Karan needs to pay back.

Total Amount = Principal + Interest
Total Amount = $3,650 + $1,825
Total Amount = $5,475

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month, we divide the total amount by the number of months.

Monthly Payment = Total Amount / Number of Months
Monthly Payment = $5,475 / 5
Monthly Payment = $1,095

"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to calculate the total number of silver pesos and gold pesos they have separately and then add them together.

Axel has 50 silver pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so Anna has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos.

Axel has 80 gold pesos. Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so Anna has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

Now, let's add the total number of silver pesos and gold pesos they have together:
Total silver pesos = 50 (Axel's) + 100 (Anna's) = 150
Total gold pesos = 80 (Axel's) + 120 (Anna's) = 200

The total number of pesos they have together is the sum of the total silver pesos and total gold pesos:
Total pesos = Total silver pesos + Total gold pesos = 150 + 200 = 350

"To find the total profit per hour, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

First, let's find the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make with the supplies she bought. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups and she bought enough supplies to make 3 pitchers, she can make 3 * 12 = 36 cups of lemonade.

Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue will be the number of cups sold multiplied by the price per cup. However, we need to know how many hours she operates the stand to find the total revenue. Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, and she has 36 cups, she will sell all of the lemonade in 36 / 4 = 9 hours.

The total revenue will be 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

Now, let's find the total cost. Millie spent $18 to buy the supplies.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. So, the profit per hour will be the total profit divided by the number of hours she operates the stand.

Total profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Total profit = $36 - $18
Total profit = $18

Since she operates the stand for 9 hours, the profit per hour will be:
Profit per hour = Total profit / Number of hours
Profit per hour = $18 / 9
Profit per hour = $2

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the initial amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we can use the concept of proportions. If he sold 3/5 of his land, that means he has 2/5 of his land left. We are given that the remaining land is 12.8 hectares.

Let's set up a proportion to find the initial amount of land:

2/5 = 12.8 / x

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

2x = 12.8 * 5
2x = 64
x = 64 / 2
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land initially.

32"
"To find the number of female members in the choir, we first need to calculate 50% of the total members. 

50% of 52 = 0.5 * 52 = 26

Since there are 26 female members, and half of them can't make it to the show, we need to find half of 26.

Half of 26 = 26 / 2 = 13

The number of female members who can't make it to the show is 13. So, the number of female members who can make it to the show is 26 - 13 = 13.

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them. To find the total number of people who sang in the performance, we add the number of female members who can make it to the show and the number of teachers.

Total number of people who sang = 13 + 3 = 16

"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to calculate the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu and add it to the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson.

First, let's find the number of messages James delivers to Mr. Yu. Since he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can multiply the number of messages to Ms. Thompson by 1/3.

Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * Messages to Ms. Thompson
Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * 66
Messages to Mr. Yu = 22

Now, we can add the number of messages to Mr. Yu and Ms. Thompson to find the total number of messages James delivers.

Total messages = Messages to Ms. Thompson + Messages to Mr. Yu
Total messages = 66 + 22
Total messages = 88

"To find out how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we need to first determine the total number of gifts she needs to wrap and then divide the total amount of ribbon by that number.

Monica has 6 gifts for her family, 4 gifts for her friends, and 2 gifts for her teachers, so the total number of gifts is 6 + 4 + 2 = 12.

Since she wants to make a bow for each gift, she will need to make 12 bows in total.

To find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each bow, we need to divide the total amount of ribbon (144 inches) by the total number of bows (12).

144 inches / 12 bows = 12 inches per bow.

The final answer is: 12"
"To solve this problem, we can start by adding the parts of the ratio together to find the total number of parts. In this case, the ratio is 5:6, so the total number of parts is 5 + 6 = 11.

Next, we can divide the total number of popsicles (165) by the total number of parts (11) to find the value of each part. 

165 / 11 = 15

Now that we know the value of each part, we can multiply the number of parts that each person has by the value of each part to find the number of popsicles they have. Betty has 5 parts, so she has 5 x 15 = 75 popsicles. Sam has 6 parts, so he has 6 x 15 = 90 popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we can subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has.

90 - 75 = 15

"To find the total cost of the streaming services, we need to calculate the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus. 

The normal cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 each, so together they cost $20. However, Tim saves 20% by bundling them. 

20% of $20 is 0.2 * $20 = $4. 

So, the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $20 - $4 = $16. 

The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $16 (bundled Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26.

Since Tim was paying $60 for the cable package, he saves $60 - $26 = $34 by cancelling his cable subscription.

So, Erica now has 38 Valentine's Day cards."
"To find out how many slices are left, we first need to determine how many slices Jenny gave away. 

Jenny gave 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices, we can calculate the number of slices Bill received as follows:

1/3 of 12 = (1/3) * 12 = 4 slices

Jenny gave 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. We can calculate the number of slices Mark received as follows:

1/4 of 12 = (1/4) * 12 = 3 slices

In total, Jenny gave away 4 + 3 = 7 slices.

Jenny ate 2 slices, so the total number of slices she gave away or ate is 7 + 2 = 9 slices.

To find out how many slices are left, we subtract the total number of slices given away or eaten from the total number of slices:

12 - 9 = 3 slices

"To find out how many bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of flour and milk required for the quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. Since Mark is making a quadruple batch, he needs 4 times the amount of each ingredient. 

For flour: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups
For milk: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark needs to buy:
12 cups / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags of flour

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so Mark needs to buy:
4 cups / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles of milk

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour:
6 bags of flour - 2 bottles of milk = 4

"To find the energy saved, we first need to calculate the original energy consumption and the new energy consumption. 

The original energy consumption can be calculated by multiplying the power (watts) by the time (hours) and then converting it to kilowatt-hours (kWh). 

Original energy consumption = 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 Wh (or 7.2 kWh per day)

Since 1 kWh = 1000 Wh, we can convert the original energy consumption to kWh.

Now, let's calculate the new energy consumption after reducing the usage by 5 hours.

New energy consumption = 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 Wh (or 2.7 kWh per day)

The energy saved per day is the difference between the original and new energy consumption.

Energy saved per day = 7.2 kWh - 2.7 kWh = 4.5 kWh

To find the total energy saved in 30 days, we multiply the energy saved per day by 30.

Total energy saved in 30 days = 4.5 kWh/day * 30 days = 135 kWh

"To determine the total cost of the meat and cheese, we first need to calculate the total number of sandwiches required to serve 20 people. Since each sandwich serves 4 people, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each sandwich serves:

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, we need a total of 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

The cost of the meat is $7.00 per pound, so the total cost of the meat is:

5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00

The cost of the cheese is $3.00 per pound, so the total cost of the cheese is:

5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

The total cost of the meat and cheese is the sum of the cost of the meat and the cost of the cheese:

$35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that Allan initially has 40 cannolis. Since there are twice as many corns as cannolis, he initially has 2 * 40 = 80 corns.

Allan then bought 60 more cannolis and 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. Since he bought 60 cannolis, he now has 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis.

The number of corns he bought is 40 fewer than the number of cannolis, so he bought 60 - 40 = 20 corns.

Now, Allan has 80 (initial corns) + 20 (new corns) = 100 corns.

The total number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 100 (cannolis) + 100 (corns) = 200.

Elliott finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. Since he wants to walk 10,000 steps, half of that would be 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps. 

He also took an additional 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So, before the jog, he had completed 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

After the jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal of 10,000 steps. Therefore, the number of steps he took during his jog can be found by subtracting the steps he had completed before the jog from his total goal: 10,000 - 6,000 = 4,000 steps.

The final answer is: 4000"
"To find out how many minutes Toby will be early, we need to calculate the total time it takes him to read the book and then subtract the time it takes to get to the airport.

First, let's find out how many words are in the book: 
45 pages * 200 words per page = 9000 words

Next, let's find out how long it will take Toby to read the book:
9000 words / 300 words per minute = 30 minutes

Now, let's add the time it takes to get to the airport:
30 minutes (reading time) + 10 minutes (travel time) = 40 minutes

Since Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes, we subtract the total time from the time he has to be there:
60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes

Toby will be 20 minutes early."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to first determine the number of employees and their total hours worked in each month.

In May, the company hired 40 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours per week for 4 weeks, so the total hours worked by each employee in May is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in May is 160 * $15 = $2400.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 1/4 * 40 = 10 employees left. So, the remaining number of employees is 40 - 10 = 30. Each of these employees worked 160 hours in June, and the total amount paid to each employee in June is 160 * $15 = $2400.

The total amount paid to the employees in May is 40 * $2400 = $96,000. The total amount paid to the employees in June is 30 * $2400 = $72,000.

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000.

The final answer is: $168,000."
"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought and subtract that from the initial amount of money she had.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The sale is ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means that for every 2 pounds of taffy, she pays $3 for the first pound and $1.50 for the second pound (since it's half off). So, the cost of 2 pounds of taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the magnets. She bought 4 magnets at $0.25 each, so the total cost of the magnets is 4 x $0.25 = $1.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items: $4.50 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1 (magnets) = $7.

Sally initially had $10, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from the initial amount: $10 - $7 = $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To find the total amount spent by Tim, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks and the finale firework separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of the two packs of fireworks. The first pack costs $400, and the second pack costs twice that much, which is 2 * $400 = $800. The total cost of the two packs is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Since Tim gets a 20% discount on the two packs of fireworks, we need to find 20% of $1200. 20% is equal to 0.20, so the discount is 0.20 * $1200 = $240. The cost of the two packs after the discount is $1200 - $240 = $960.

Now, let's add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the cost of the fireworks. The total cost is $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To determine the number of dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we need to calculate the total number of cookies she will eat in 30 days and then divide that by the number of cookies her recipe makes.

Shannon eats 2 cookies per night, so in 30 days, she will eat 2 * 30 = 60 cookies.

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies she will eat by 12 to find out how many dozens she needs to make. 

60 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 5 dozens.

Therefore, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. 

First, let's find the number of candles that smell like wet dog. Since 5% of the candles have this defect, we can calculate it as follows:

Number of candles that smell like wet dog = Total number of candles * (Percentage of candles with the defect / 100)
= 50000 * (5 / 100)
= 2500

Now, we need to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. Since Marcy guarantees that 99% of the candles will not explode, the percentage of candles that will explode is 1% (100% - 99%). However, this 1% is out of the total number of candles, not the number of candles that smell like wet dog. 

To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to find 1% of the number of candles that smell like wet dog:

Number of candles that smell like wet dog and explode = Number of candles that smell like wet dog * (Percentage of candles that will explode / 100)
= 2500 * (1 / 100)
= 25

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we first need to find the price of each blouse after the 30% discount. 

The discount amount is 30% of the regular price, which is 0.3 * $20 = $6. 

So, the discounted price of each blouse is $20 - $6 = $14.

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses is 4 * $14 = $56.

The final answer is: $56"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathered from the tallest trees as T, from the average trees as A, and from the shortest trees as S. 

Given that Joanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees, we have T = 30.

Since Joanne gathered half the amount from the shortest trees, we have S = 30 / 2 = 15.

The total number of apples Joanne gathered is the sum of the apples from the three types of trees, which is T + A + S. We are given that the combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. 

Let's denote the number of apples Joanne's sister gathered from the tallest trees as 2T, from the shortest trees as 3S, and from the average trees as 0 (since she didn't take any). The total number of apples her sister gathered is 2T + 3S.

The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, so we can write the equation: T + A + S + 2T + 3S = 500.

Substituting the values of T and S, we get 30 + A + 15 + 2(30) + 3(15) = 500.

Combine like terms: 30 + A + 15 + 60 + 45 = 500.

Combine the constants: 150 + A = 500.

Subtract 150 from both sides: A = 350.

The number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees is 350.

The final answer is: $\boxed{350}$"
"Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D. We are given two pieces of information:

1. The total number of heads is 180, which means C + D = 180.
2. The total number of bumps is 304, which means 2C + D = 304 (since camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump).

We can solve this system of linear equations by subtracting the first equation from the second equation:

(2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can find the number of dromedaries by substituting C into the first equation:

D = 180 - C
D = 180 - 124
D = 56

Therefore, there are 56 dromedaries in the herd.

The final answer is: 56"
"To find the total distance traveled by Tom, we need to break down the information given.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day. So, the total distance covered in the first 4 days is 4 * 200 = 800 kilometers.

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. 30% of 800 kilometers is 0.3 * 800 = 240 kilometers. So, the total distance covered in the next two days is 240 kilometers.

On the next day, he wasn't traveling at all, so the distance covered is 0 kilometers.

During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total distance covered in the second week is 7 * 300 = 2100 kilometers.

Now, let's add up the distances covered in each period: 
- First 4 days: 800 kilometers
- Next two days: 240 kilometers
- Next day: 0 kilometers
- Second week: 2100 kilometers

Total distance = 800 + 240 + 0 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.

The final answer is: 3140"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the size of Timothy's locker in cubic inches. 

First, we know that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches and it is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. To find Zack's locker size, we can multiply Peter's locker size by 4.

Zack's locker size = 5 * 4 = 20 cubic inches

Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can multiply Zack's locker size by 2 to find Timothy's locker size.

Timothy's locker size = 20 * 2 = 40 cubic inches

"To find the elevation where Stanley's comb fell, we need to subtract the distance it fell from Stanley's initial elevation. 

Stanley's initial elevation: 10,000 feet
Distance the comb fell: 4,000 feet
Elevation where the comb fell: 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet

Now, we need to find the difference between the elevation where the comb fell and Oliver's elevation to determine how much Oliver needs to climb.

Elevation where the comb fell: 6,000 feet
Oliver's elevation: 3,000 feet
Distance Oliver must climb: 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we know that the first bank gave Mr. Josue $4000. The second bank gave him twice as much, so the second bank gave him 2 * $4000 = $8000.

Now, we need to find the total amount of money Mr. Josue received from both banks. This is $4000 + $8000 = $12000.

Initially, Mr. Josue had $5000 in capital. To find the total capital he has now, we need to add the initial capital to the amount he received from the banks. So, the total capital is $5000 + $12000 = $16000.

The final answer is: $16000"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock.
2. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each. So, the total number of cats taken away is 4 * 5 = 20.
3. After the boats took away 20 cats, the remaining number of cats on the rock is 50 - 20 = 30.
4. Then, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find 3/5 of 30, we multiply 30 by 3/5, which is (30 * 3) / 5 = 90 / 5 = 18.
5. So, 18 cats ran after the mouse, leaving 30 - 18 = 12 cats on the rock.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into the different periods and calculate the cost for each period.

1. The first 6 months were $8 a month, so the cost for this period is 6 * $8 = $48.
2. The next 8 months were $12 a month, so the cost for this period is 8 * $12 = $96.
3. After that, the price increased to $14 a month. Since 2 years is 24 months, and we've already accounted for 14 months, there are 24 - 14 = 10 months left. The cost for this period is 10 * $14 = $140.

Now, we add up the costs for each period to find the total cost: $48 + $96 + $140 = $284.

The final answer is: $284"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the cost of the jogger jeans as J and the cost of the tattered jeans as T. We know that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so we can write an equation:

J = T - 6

We also know that the total savings is $6, and Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. This means that the savings from the jogger jeans is 1/3 of $6, which is $2, and the savings from the tattered jeans is 2/3 of $6, which is $4.

Since the savings from the jogger jeans is $2, we can write an equation:

J - (T - 6) = 2

Simplifying the equation, we get:

J - T + 6 = 2

J - T = -4

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can substitute the first equation (J = T - 6) into the second equation:

(T - 6) - T = -4

Simplifying the equation, we get:

-6 = -4

This is not possible, so we need to re-examine our equations. Let's go back to the first equation (J = T - 6) and the fact that the tattered jeans cost $28. We can substitute T = 28 into the first equation:

J = 28 - 6
J = 22

Now we know that the jogger jeans cost $22. We can find the difference between the cost of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans:

Difference = J - T
= 22 - 28
= -6

However, the question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, the jogger jeans originally cost $6 less.

The final answer is: $6"
"To find the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and then add them together.

The capacity of the 4 buses is 4 x 60 = 240 employees.
The capacity of the 6 minibusses is 6 x 30 = 180 employees.
The capacity of the 10 minivans is 10 x 15 = 150 employees.

Now, we add the capacities together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

The final answer is: 570"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder and then calculate the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden.

Let's denote the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders as x. Since the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is x + 10.

Lillian has 3 store-bought feeders and 3 homemade feeders. The total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3x, and the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3(x + 10).

The total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden is the sum of the birds attracted to the store-bought and homemade feeders: 3x + 3(x + 10).

We are given that each bird feeder attracts 20 birds throughout the day. Since Lillian has 6 feeders in total, the total number of birds attracted to all feeders is 6 * 20 = 120.

We can set up an equation to represent the situation: 3x + 3(x + 10) = 120.

Simplifying the equation, we get 3x + 3x + 30 = 120, which becomes 6x + 30 = 120.

Subtracting 30 from both sides of the equation, we get 6x = 90.

Dividing both sides of the equation by 6, we get x = 15.

Now that we know x = 15, we can find the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders: x + 10 = 15 + 10 = 25.

The total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden is 3x + 3(x + 10) = 3(15) + 3(25) = 45 + 75 = 120.

However, this is the number of birds attracted to the store-bought and homemade feeders separately. Since the total number of birds attracted to all feeders is 120, and we know that each feeder attracts 20 birds, we can simply multiply the number of feeders by 20 to get the total number of birds.

The total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden is 6 * 20 = 120.

However, this is the number of birds attracted to all feeders, not the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders. We know that the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, so the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 20 + 10 = 30.

Since there are 3 homemade feeders, the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3 * 30 = 90.

The total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden is the sum of the birds attracted to the store-bought and homemade feeders: 120 + 90 = 210.

"To find the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The bagel costs $4. 
The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. To find 25% of $4, we multiply $4 by 0.25, which is $1. Then, we add this to the cost of the bagel: $4 + $1 = $5. 
The cake costs half the price of the bagel, which is $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, we add the costs of all the items together: $4 (bagel) + $5 (soup) + $2 (cake) = $11.

The final answer is: $11"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much money Kenny needs to make from selling his cards to reach the total of $100 for the amusement park ticket. Since he already has $50, he needs to make $100 - $50 = $50 from selling his cards.

Since each card sells for $1.5, we can find the number of cards he needs to sell to make $50 by dividing $50 by $1.5. 

Number of cards to sell = $50 / $1.5 = 33.33

However, Kenny can't sell a fraction of a card, so he must have had more than 33.33 cards to begin with. Since he keeps 1/3 of his cards, let's denote the total number of cards as 'x'. Then, the number of cards he sells is 2/3x.

We know that 2/3x = 33.33. To find 'x', we can multiply both sides by 3/2 to isolate 'x'.

x = 33.33 * (3/2)
x = 50

So, Kenny started with 50 cards. 

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, the caterer prepared enough hot dogs for half of the guests to have two hot dogs. Since there are 36 guests, half of them would be 36 / 2 = 18. So, the caterer prepared enough hot dogs for 18 guests to have two hot dogs each.

This means the caterer prepared 18 * 2 = 36 hot dogs for the first 18 guests. However, since the caterer prepared enough for 18 guests to have two hot dogs, the total number of hot dogs prepared is 36.

Now, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hot dog. This means that the 18 guests who were initially supposed to have two hot dogs got their second hot dog, and the remaining 22 guests (40 - 18 = 22) also got a second hot dog.

However, the caterer only prepared 36 hot dogs. Since 18 guests got two hot dogs each, that's 36 hot dogs. The remaining 22 guests also got a second hot dog, but there are not enough hot dogs for them. This means that the 22 guests who showed up after the initial 18 guests will not get a second hot dog.

Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hot dog is 22.

"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the total cost of the items before the discount and then apply the 20% discount.

1. The set of pot and pans costs $120.00.
2. The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
3. The 5 separate utensils cost $5.00 each, so the total cost of the utensils is 5 x $5.00 = $25.00.
4. The total cost of the items before the discount is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.
5. To apply the 20% discount, we need to find 20% of $165.00, which is 0.20 x $165.00 = $33.00.
6. The discount amount is $33.00, so we subtract this from the total cost before the discount: $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

The total cost of the items is: $6 (skipping rope) + $11 (board game) + $2 (playground ball) = $19.

Dora has a total of $2 (her allowance) + $16 (from her mother) = $18.

To find out how much more money she needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost: $19 (total cost) - $18 (amount she has) = $1.

Therefore, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball.

"To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we first need to determine how much gas was in one container. Since 15 gallons were equally divided into 5 containers, we can divide 15 gallons by 5 to find the amount in each container.

15 gallons / 5 containers = 3 gallons per container

Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we can convert the 3 gallons to pints by multiplying 3 by 8.

3 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 24 pints

Josey needed 1/4 of a container, so we need to find 1/4 of 24 pints.

1/4 * 24 pints = 6 pints

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money George had initially. Since he had 1% of his money left after spending $5, we can set up an equation to find the initial amount.

Let's denote the initial amount of money George had as 'x'. Since he had 1% of his money left after spending $5, we can write the equation as:

x - 5 = 0.01x

To solve for x, we can add 5 to both sides of the equation:

x = 5 / (1 - 0.01)
x = 5 / 0.99
x = 5.05

Now that we know George had $5.05 initially, we can find out how much he spent on chips. Since he bought 3 bags of chips for 40 cents each, the total amount spent on chips is:

3 * 0.40 = $1.20

Now, we can subtract the amount spent on chips from the initial amount to find out how much he spent on candy bars:

$5.05 - $1.20 = $3.85

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can divide the amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar to find out how many candy bars he bought:

$3.85 / 0.75 = 5.13

Since we can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can buy 5 candy bars with $3.75 and have $0.10 left, which is not enough to buy another candy bar. Therefore, George bought 5 candy bars.

"To find out how many lollipops each of Ray's friends received, we need to first determine how many lollipops he shared with his friends. 

Ray had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself, so the number of lollipops he shared is 25 - 5 = 20.

Since he shared the lollipops equally among his four friends, we need to divide the number of lollipops shared by the number of friends: 20 / 4 = 5.

So, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

"To find the remaining weight of the cake, we first need to determine the total weight of the pieces that Rory and her mom each have. 

Since there are 8 pieces in total and each piece is equal in weight, we can divide the total weight of the cake by the number of pieces to find the weight of each piece. 

Weight of each piece = Total weight of the cake / Number of pieces
Weight of each piece = 20 ounces / 8
Weight of each piece = 2.5 ounces

Now, since Rory and her mom each have a piece, we need to find the total weight of the two pieces they have. 

Total weight of the pieces they have = Weight of each piece * 2
Total weight of the pieces they have = 2.5 ounces * 2
Total weight of the pieces they have = 5 ounces

To find the remaining weight of the cake, we subtract the total weight of the pieces they have from the total weight of the cake.

Remaining weight of the cake = Total weight of the cake - Total weight of the pieces they have
Remaining weight of the cake = 20 ounces - 5 ounces
Remaining weight of the cake = 15 ounces

"To find out how many oranges each person will get, we need to first calculate the total number of oranges Sitti and Juris have. 

Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges. 

Total oranges = 34 + 22 = 56

Since they are sharing the oranges with 6 other friends, including themselves, the total number of people sharing the oranges is 8 (Sitti, Juris, and 6 friends).

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people.

Oranges per person = Total oranges / Total people

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, which costs 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.

Since it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, and Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's, we can calculate Bernadette's drive time as follows:

Bernadette's drive time = 4 * Wayne's drive time
= 4 * 4 minutes
= 16 minutes

Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, and it takes her 16 minutes to get to the theater, we need to find out how much time she needs to leave before Wayne to arrive 5 minutes before him.

Let x be the time Wayne leaves. Then, Bernadette needs to leave x - 5 minutes before Wayne.

The time it takes Bernadette to get to the theater is 16 minutes, so we can set up the equation:

x - 5 + 16 = x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 11 = x

Subtracting x from both sides, we get:

11 = 0

This equation doesn't make sense, as it implies that Bernadette will arrive at the same time as Wayne. However, we know that Bernadette needs to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. 

Let's re-evaluate the situation. If Bernadette arrives 5 minutes before Wayne, and it takes her 16 minutes to get to the theater, then she needs to leave 16 + 5 = 21 minutes before Wayne.

So, Bernadette should leave 21 minutes before Wayne to arrive 5 minutes before him.

The final answer is: $\boxed{21}$"
"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we first need to find the width of the room. We know the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards. 

First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length in feet is 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet.

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is length * width = area. We can rearrange this formula to find the width: width = area / length. 

Substituting the values we know, we get width = 360 square feet / 9 feet = 40 feet.

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter of the room using the formula: perimeter = 2 * (length + width). 

Substituting the values we know, we get perimeter = 2 * (9 feet + 40 feet) = 2 * 49 feet = 98 feet.

The final answer is: 98"
"To find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we need to calculate the total number of beads each sister has.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, Elizabeth has:
1 pack of red beads = 1 x 20 = 20 beads
2 packs of clear beads = 2 x 20 = 40 beads
Total beads Elizabeth has = 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, Margareth has:
3 packs of blue beads = 3 x 20 = 60 beads
4 packs of red beads = 4 x 20 = 80 beads
Total beads Margareth has = 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, we need to find the difference between the total number of beads each sister has:
Difference = Total beads Margareth has - Total beads Elizabeth has
Difference = 140 - 60
Difference = 80

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the final temperature of the house, we need to calculate the temperature increase due to the oven and the temperature decrease due to the open window.

First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to the oven. The oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour, and Marcus bakes for 3 hours. So, the total temperature increase is 5 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 15 degrees.

Now, let's calculate the temperature decrease due to the open window. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Since the window is open for 30 minutes, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are there in 30 minutes. 30 minutes / 10 minutes = 3 intervals. So, the total temperature decrease is 2 degrees/interval * 3 intervals = 6 degrees.

Now, let's subtract the temperature decrease from the temperature increase: 15 degrees (increase) - 6 degrees (decrease) = 9 degrees.

The initial temperature of the house was 40 degrees. So, the final temperature is 40 degrees + 9 degrees = 49 degrees.

The final answer is: 49"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total time it took Jon to complete the triathlon. 

Jon's total time = 40 minutes (swim) + 80 minutes (1 hour 20 minutes) + 50 minutes (run) = 170 minutes.

Since James finishes the swim 10% faster, we need to find 10% of Jon's swim time and subtract it from Jon's swim time. 

10% of 40 minutes = 0.1 * 40 = 4 minutes. 
James' swim time = 40 - 4 = 36 minutes.

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike, so his bike time is 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

We know that Jon won by 10 minutes, so James' total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time. 

James' total time = 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

Now, we can find James' run time by subtracting his swim and bike times from his total time.

James' run time = 180 - 36 - 85 = 59 minutes.

The final answer is: 59"
"To find the length of Movie A, we need to first find the length of Movie B and then calculate one-fourth of that length.

Movie C is 1.25 hours, which is equal to 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes.

Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so Movie B is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes.

Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, so Movie A is 80 / 4 = 20 minutes.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost of hay, we first need to determine how many miles the horse ran. Since the horse ran for 30 minutes at 32MPH, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. 

30 minutes is 0.5 hours (since 1 hour = 60 minutes). 

Now, we can calculate the distance traveled by multiplying the speed by the time: 
Distance = Speed * Time = 32MPH * 0.5 hours = 16 miles.

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, the total hay consumed is:
Total Hay = 16 miles * 1/2 bail/mile = 8 bails.

Each bail costs $3, so the total cost of hay is:
Total Cost = 8 bails * $3/bail = $24.

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of:
Total Money = 6 * $5 = $30.

To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the total money:
Change = Total Money - Total Cost = $30 - $24 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To find out how many eggs Rozanne has in total, we need to calculate the number of eggs from the cases and the loose eggs separately. 

4 dozen eggs is equal to 4 * 12 = 48 eggs. 

Adding the 2 loose eggs, Rozanne has a total of 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Since each glass needs 5 eggs, we can find out how many glasses Rozanne can make by dividing the total number of eggs by 5. 

50 eggs / 5 eggs per glass = 10 glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, we can find out how many trays Rozanne can put out by dividing the total number of glasses by 5.

10 glasses / 5 glasses per tray = 2 trays.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many points Joey is winning by, we need to calculate the difference between his final score and Marcy's final score.

"To find the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total revenue from the sale of the sneakers and subtract the initial cost.

First, let's calculate the revenue from the flash sale on Monday. The salesman sold 17 sneakers for $20 each, so the revenue from the flash sale is:
17 * $20 = $340

Next, let's calculate the revenue from the sale to the department store. The salesman sold the remaining 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers for $25 each. So, the revenue from the department store sale is:
31 * $25 = $775

The total revenue from both sales is:
$340 + $775 = $1115

The initial cost of the case of sneakers was $576. To find the profit, we subtract the initial cost from the total revenue:
$1115 - $576 = $539

The salesman's profit is $539.

The final answer is: $539"

6 packets * 8 crayons/packet = 48 crayons

Next, let's calculate the total number of crayons in the four packets with sixteen pieces each:
4 packets * 16 crayons/packet = 64 crayons

Now, we add the total number of crayons from both types of packets to find the overall total:
48 crayons + 64 crayons = 112 crayons

The final answer is: 112"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The super ticket costs $20 and includes a movie ticket, one popcorn, and one soda.
2. The super ticket also includes an extra popcorn and soda for $1.
3. The soda costs $3.
4. If you didn't buy the super ticket and ended up saving $2, it means the total cost without the super ticket is $20 - $2 = $18.
5. The cost of the movie ticket is $12.
6. The cost of the soda is $3.
7. Let's assume the cost of the popcorn is x.

The total cost without the super ticket is the cost of the movie ticket plus the cost of the popcorn and the soda: $12 + x + $3 = $18.

Simplifying the equation: x + $15 = $18.

Subtracting $15 from both sides: x = $3.

The regular price of popcorn is $3. 

The final answer is: $3"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the cost of filling one balloon before the price increase. 

Let's denote the original cost of filling one balloon as 'x'. The total cost of filling 20 balloons is $900, so we can write the equation as 20x = 900. 

To find the value of 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 20: x = 900 / 20 = 45. 

This means the original cost of filling one balloon was $45. 

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20, so the new cost of filling one balloon is 45 + 20 = 65.

Now, we need to find the total cost of filling 170 balloons at the new price. The total cost is 170 * 65 = 10,950.

The final answer is: $10,950"
"To find the average speed of the car during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled at 60 mph for 2 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 60 mph x 2 hours
Distance = 120 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled at 30 mph for 1 hour:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 30 mph x 1 hour
Distance = 30 miles

Now, let's find the total distance traveled:
Total Distance = 120 miles + 30 miles
Total Distance = 150 miles

The total time taken is the sum of the time taken at 60 mph and 30 mph:
Total Time = 2 hours + 1 hour
Total Time = 3 hours

Finally, we can calculate the average speed:
Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
Average Speed = 150 miles / 3 hours
Average Speed = 50 mph

"To find the total value of Jenna's jewels, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires and rubies separately and then add them together.

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. Each sapphire is worth $800, so the total value of her sapphires is 8 * $800 = $6400.

Jenna trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. This means she now has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left. The value of the sapphires she traded is 3 * $800 = $2400.

The value of the 2 rubies she received is 2 * $1200 = $2400.

The total value of her jewels is the sum of the value of the sapphires and the rubies: $6400 + $2400 - $2400 = $6400.

The total value of Jenna's jewels is $6400."
"To find the total number of apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of apples they eat per day and then multiply it by 30.

Marin and Nancy each eat 4 apples a day. So, together they eat 4 + 4 = 8 apples per day.

Now, we multiply the total number of apples they eat per day by 30 to find the total number of apples they eat in 30 days: 8 * 30 = 240.

"To find the total volume of soil needed, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed and then multiply it by the number of beds. The volume of a rectangular prism (such as a raised bed) is calculated by multiplying its length, width, and height.

Volume of one raised bed = length * width * height
Volume of one raised bed = 8 * 2 * 2
Volume of one raised bed = 32 cubic feet

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:
Total volume of soil needed = volume of one raised bed * number of beds
Total volume of soil needed = 32 * 10
Total volume of soil needed = 320 cubic feet

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. To find the number of bags needed, we divide the total volume of soil needed by the volume of one bag:
Number of bags needed = total volume of soil needed / volume of one bag
Number of bags needed = 320 / 2
Number of bags needed = 160

Each bag of potting soil costs $12. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of bags needed by the cost per bag:
Total cost = number of bags needed * cost per bag
Total cost = 160 * 12
Total cost = 1920

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of green cards first, then the number of yellow cards, and finally, add up the number of cards of all three colors.

Given that there are 15 red cards and 60% more green cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:

Number of green cards = 15 + (60% of 15)
= 15 + (0.6 * 15)
= 15 + 9
= 24

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards:

Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
= 15 + 24
= 39

Finally, to find the total number of cards, we add up the number of cards of all three colors:

Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
= 15 + 24 + 39
= 78

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies.

After 20 minutes, one of her friends saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the fairies that were there. This means her friend saw 50 / 2 = 25 fairies. So, the total number of fairies now is 50 (initial fairies) + 25 (new fairies) = 75.

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. To find the remaining number of fairies, we subtract 30 from the total number of fairies: 75 - 30 = 45.

"To find the total weight of the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and add them together.

The total weight of sugar cubes is 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds.

The total weight of carrots is 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds.

The total weight of hay is 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds.

The total weight of oats is 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds.

The total weight of all the feed is 2 pounds + 48 pounds + 3150 pounds + 1300 pounds = 3400 pounds.

Since the farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, we need to divide the total weight of the feed by the truck's capacity to find the number of trips needed.

3400 pounds / 2250 pounds/trip = 1.51 trips.

Since the farmer cannot make a fraction of a trip, he will need to make 2 trips to transport all the feed.

"To find out how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate the total earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the earnings from aluminum cans. Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans a week, and each can is worth 2 cents. So, her weekly earnings from aluminum cans are 3 cans/week * 2 cents/can = 6 cents/week. 

For a four-week month, her earnings from aluminum cans would be 6 cents/week * 4 weeks = 24 cents.

Next, let's calculate the earnings from plastic bottles. Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles a week, and each bottle is worth 3 cents. So, her weekly earnings from plastic bottles are 5 bottles/week * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents/week.

For a four-week month, her earnings from plastic bottles would be 15 cents/week * 4 weeks = 60 cents.

Now, let's add the earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles to find the total earnings. Total earnings = 24 cents (aluminum cans) + 60 cents (plastic bottles) = 84 cents.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the number of plants Shondra has, we need to first determine the number of plants Toni has, and then subtract 7 from that number.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as 'x'. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, which is x/2. He also gets two extra cookies for cleaning his room. So, the total number of cookies he gets is x/2 + 2.

We are given that Matt wants to eat five cookies in total. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x/2 + 2 = 5.

To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable x. First, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: x/2 = 5 - 2, which simplifies to x/2 = 3.

Next, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction: x = 3 * 2, which simplifies to x = 6.

"To find the combined length of the remoras, we need to convert the length of the shark and the remoras to the same unit. Since the shark's length is given in feet, we'll convert the remoras' length from inches to feet. 

1 foot = 12 inches
6 inches = 6 / 12 = 0.5 feet

There are 2 remoras, each 0.5 feet long, so the combined length of the remoras is 2 * 0.5 = 1 foot.

Now, we need to find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy. 

Combined length of remoras = 1 foot
Length of the shark = 10 feet

Percentage = (Combined length of remoras / Length of the shark) * 100
= (1 / 10) * 100

(1/4)x = 20

To solve for 'x', we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4 to isolate 'x':

x = 20 * 4
x = 80

Therefore, there are 80 students at that grade level.

Total number of books = Total amount spent / Cost of each book
Total number of books = $300 / $15
Total number of books = 20

Since Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, we can divide the total number of books by 4 to find out how many books each child got.

Number of books per child = Total number of books / 4
Number of books per child = 20 / 4
Number of books per child = 5

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we need to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. 

First, let's find the total number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts. This can be done by adding the number of kids allergic to dairy and the number of kids allergic to peanuts, then subtracting the number of kids allergic to both (to avoid double-counting).

Number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts = Number of kids allergic to dairy + Number of kids allergic to peanuts - Number of kids allergic to both
= 9 + 6 - 3
= 12

Now, we know that there are 32 kids in the class. To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts from the total number of kids.

Number of kids not allergic to anything = Total number of kids - Number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts
= 32 - 12
= 20

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total number of people going on the tour, we need to calculate the total number of employees and the total number of tour guides.

First, let's calculate the total number of employees: 
There are 3 groups of 200 employees each, so the total number of employees is 3 * 200 = 600.

Next, let's calculate the total number of tour guides: 
There are 3 groups, and each group has 7 tour guides, so the total number of tour guides is 3 * 7 = 21.

Now, we add the total number of employees and the total number of tour guides to find the total number of people going on the tour: 
Total number of people = Total number of employees + Total number of tour guides
Total number of people = 600 + 21
Total number of people = 621

The final answer is: 621"
"To find the total cost of the trip, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel.

The cost of the plane tickets is $5000 each, and since there are two people, the total cost of the plane tickets is 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

The hotel is 20% more expensive than normal, so the new price is 1.2 * $1500 = $1800 per day. Since they are there for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is the sum of the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel, which is $10,000 + $5400 = $16,400.

The final answer is: $16,400."
"To find out how many tubes of paint Jasper has, we need to determine the number of tubes of blue and yellow paint he has.

Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint. Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, so Jasper has 4 / 2 = 2 tubes of blue paint.

Ben has 3 tubes of yellow paint. Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, so Jasper has 3 * 3 = 9 tubes of yellow paint.

To find the total number of tubes of paint Jasper has, we add the number of blue and yellow tubes: 2 (blue) + 9 (yellow) = 11.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we first need to find the weight of the 2010 penny. 

Given that the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can express this as an equation: 

Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * Weight of 1959 penny

Since the 1959 penny weighs 48 grains, we can substitute this value into the equation:

Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * 48
Weight of 2010 penny = 36 grains

Now, we can find the combined weight of the two pennies by adding their individual weights:

Combined weight = Weight of 1959 penny + Weight of 2010 penny
Combined weight = 48 + 36
Combined weight = 84 grains

The final answer is: 84"
"To find out how much more they need to earn, we need to calculate the total amount they have already earned and subtract that from their goal.

Keegan earned $83 and Tasha earned $91, so together they earned $83 + $91 = $174.

Their goal is to raise $200, so we subtract the amount they have already earned from the goal: $200 - $174 = $26.

Therefore, they need to earn $26 more to reach their goal.

The final answer is: $26"
"To find out how many songs Luri can add to his player, we need to first determine how many songs he currently has. Since Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, and Gabriel has 20 songs, Luri has 3 * 20 = 60 songs.

Now, we need to find out how many songs each can add to their player. Since the player can store up to 100 songs, Gabriel can add 100 - 20 = 80 songs, and Luri can add 100 - 60 = 40 songs.

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add than Gabriel, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add: 80 - 40 = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the total amount of money Stetson gave up, we first need to determine how many oranges he ate. Since Stetson ate 2/5 of the oranges and they picked 60 oranges, we can calculate the number of oranges he ate as follows:

Number of oranges eaten = (2/5) * 60
= (2 * 60) / 5
= 120 / 5
= 24

Since Stetson gave up $10 for each orange he ate, we can multiply the number of oranges eaten by the amount he gave up per orange:

Total amount given up = Number of oranges eaten * Amount per orange
= 24 * 10
= 240

The final answer is: $240"
"To find the cost of Jillian's handbag, we need to first calculate 3 times the cost of her shoes. 

Cost of shoes = $80
3 times the cost of shoes = 3 * $80 = $240

Since the handbag cost $20 less than 3 times the cost of her shoes, we subtract $20 from $240.

Cost of handbag = 3 times the cost of shoes - $20
= $240 - $20
= $220

The final answer is: $220"
"To find the total number of hours James runs per week, we need to calculate the total distance he runs in a week and then divide it by his speed.

James runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week, so the total distance he runs in a week is:
12 miles/day * 5 days/week = 60 miles/week

Since James runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour, we can find the total hours he runs per week by dividing the total distance by his speed:
60 miles/week / 10 miles/hour = 6 hours/week

The final answer is: 6"
"To determine the total amount of oats needed, we first need to calculate the daily consumption of oats by Uncle Ben's horses. 

Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and there are two meals per day. So, the daily consumption per horse is 5 pounds/meal * 2 meals = 10 pounds/day.

Since Uncle Ben has four horses, the total daily consumption is 10 pounds/day * 4 horses = 40 pounds/day.

To find the total consumption for five days, we multiply the daily consumption by 5: 40 pounds/day * 5 days = 200 pounds.

Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats, so to find the number of bags needed, we divide the total consumption by the weight of each bag: 200 pounds / 50 pounds/bag = 4 bags.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the number of girl Pomeranians, we first need to find the total number of Pomeranians. Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can calculate this as follows:

Total puppies = 27
Pomeranians = (2/3) * Total puppies
Pomeranians = (2/3) * 27
Pomeranians = 18

Now, we need to find the number of girl Pomeranians. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we can calculate this as follows:

Girl Pomeranians = (1/3) * Pomeranians
Girl Pomeranians = (1/3) * 18
Girl Pomeranians = 6

"To find the average highest temperature, we need to add up the highest temperatures of the three countries and divide by 3.

First, let's add up the highest temperatures:

-48 (Southlandia) + 21 (Northlandia) + (-3) (Midlandia) = -30

Now, we divide the sum by 3:

-30 / 3 = -10

The average highest temperature of the three countries is -10 degrees Fahrenheit."
"To find out how many days it will take for the child to save the remaining amount, we need to calculate the difference between the cost of the toy car and the amount he already has.

Cost of the toy car: $12
Amount already saved: $4
Remaining amount needed: $12 - $4 = $8

Since he promises to save $2 daily from his allowance, we can divide the remaining amount by the daily savings to find out how many days it will take:

$8 (remaining amount) / $2 (daily savings) = 4 days

Therefore, it will take the child 4 days to save the remaining amount of money.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many eggs Jaime won't be able to place on the tray, we need to calculate the total capacity of the trays and subtract the number of eggs he has.

Each tray can hold 24 eggs, and Jaime has 2 trays. So, the total capacity of the trays is 24 * 2 = 48 eggs.

Jaime has 64 eggs, but the trays can only hold 48 eggs. To find out how many eggs won't fit, we subtract the capacity from the number of eggs: 64 - 48 = 16.

So, Jaime won't be able to place 16 eggs on the tray.

"To find the cost per individual razor after the discount, we need to calculate the total cost of 2 packs of razors with the sale and coupon applied.

First, let's calculate the cost of 2 packs of razors at the sale price. Since it's buy one get one free, Heather will only pay for 1 pack. The cost of 1 pack is $4.00. 

Now, let's apply the $2.00 coupon to the cost of 1 pack. The new cost is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since Heather buys 2 packs, but only pays for 1 pack after the sale, the total cost is $2.00.

Now, let's find the total number of razors in 2 packs. 2 packs * 4 razors per pack = 8 razors.

To find the cost per individual razor, we divide the total cost by the total number of razors. $2.00 * 100 cents/dollar = 200 cents. Now, divide the total cost in cents by the total number of razors: 200 cents / 8 razors = 25 cents per razor.

"To find the total height of the human pyramid, we need to calculate the height of each level and add them up.

The 4 girls on the bottom are 64"" tall each. 
4 * 64"" = 256""

The 3 girls on top of the 4 are also 64"" tall each. 
3 * 64"" = 192""

The 2 girls on top of the 3 are also 64"" tall each. 
2 * 64"" = 128""

The shortest girl at the top is 60"" tall.

Now, we add up the heights of all the levels:
256"" + 192"" + 128"" + 60"" = 636""

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches):
636"" / 12 = 53 feet

The final answer is: 53"
"To find the total number of minutes Charisma walked, we need to calculate the total number of 5-minute breaks she took in a day and then multiply it by the number of days she worked.

Charisma works 8 hours a day and takes a 5-minute break every hour. So, the total number of breaks she takes in a day is 8 hours * 1 break per hour = 8 breaks.

Since each break is 5 minutes long, the total number of minutes she walked in a day is 8 breaks * 5 minutes per break = 40 minutes.

Charisma worked for 5 days, so the total number of minutes she walked is 40 minutes per day * 5 days = 200 minutes.

The final answer is: 200"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine Brett's age in four years. Since Brett is currently 14 years old, in four years, he will be 14 + 4 = 18 years old.

According to the problem, in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. Since Brett is currently 14 years old, three times his current age is 3 * 14 = 42 years old.

Since Angela will be 42 years old in four years, we need to subtract 4 from 42 to find her current age. Angela's current age is 42 - 4 = 38 years old.

"To find out how many Greek orange pies Brianne and Ashley can make, we need to calculate the total number of oranges they have and then divide that by the number of oranges needed for one pie.

Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so she has 5 * 10 = 50 oranges.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so she has 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

In total, they have 50 + 70 = 120 oranges.

Since one Greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, the number of pies they can make is 120 / 3 = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'. The cost for the first venue is a flat fee of $200, plus $5 per guest, so the total cost is 200 + 5x. The cost for the second venue is $25 per guest, so the total cost is 25x.

To find the number of guests for which the two venues are equal in cost, we set the two expressions equal to each other:

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtracting 5x from both sides gives us:

200 = 20x

Dividing both sides by 20 gives us:

10 = x

"To solve this problem, let's start by assigning variables to the unknowns. Let's say the number of insects David found is D, the number of insects Bodhi found is B, and the number of insects Lily found is L.

We know that Lily found 7 more than David, so we can write an equation: L = D + 7.

We also know that David found half of what Bodhi found, so we can write another equation: D = B/2.

We are also given that together they collected 43 insects, so the sum of the insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43: L + D + B = 43.

Now we can substitute the first equation into the third equation: (D + 7) + D + B = 43.

Combine like terms: 2D + B + 7 = 43.

Subtract 7 from both sides: 2D + B = 36.

Now we can substitute the second equation into this one: 2(D) + B = 36, and since D = B/2, we can substitute D with B/2: 2(B/2) + B = 36.

Simplify the equation: B + B = 36.

Combine like terms: 2B = 36.

Divide both sides by 2: B = 18.

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects David found: D = B/2 = 18/2 = 9.

Finally, we can find the number of insects Lily found: L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16.

"To find the total yards of yarn used, we need to calculate the yards used by Mariah and her grandma separately and then add them together.

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, and there are 364 yards in a skein. To find the yards used by Mariah, we multiply 364 yards by 1/4.

364 yards * 1/4 = 364 yards * 0.25 = 91 yards

Her grandma used 1/2 of a skein, which is the same as 2/4. To find the yards used by her grandma, we multiply 364 yards by 2/4.

364 yards * 2/4 = 364 yards * 0.5 = 182 yards

Now, we add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma together.

91 yards + 182 yards = 273 yards

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as 'x'. Since Suzie bought two packs of strawberry gum, the total cost for these packs would be 2x.

The cost of the pack of grape gum is given as $2.

The cost of the small pack of green apple gum is half the cost of the grape gum, which is $2 / 2 = $1.

The total cost of all four packs of gum is $7. So, we can set up the equation: 2x + 2 + 1 = 7.

Combine the constants on the left side of the equation: 2x + 3 = 7.

Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with the variable: 2x = 4.

Divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for x: x = 2.

The cost of each pack of strawberry gum is $2."
"To find the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to determine which type of lumber to buy and how many pieces to buy with his budget of $24.

First, let's calculate the cost per stick for each type of lumber:

- For a 2 x 4, Frederick can get 200 sticks for $4, so the cost per stick is $4 / 200 = $0.02 per stick.
- For a 2 x 8, Frederick can get 400 sticks for $6, so the cost per stick is $6 / 400 = $0.015 per stick.

Since the 2 x 8 lumber is cheaper per stick, Frederick should buy the 2 x 8 lumber.

Now, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces Frederick can buy with his budget of $24:

$24 / $6 = 4

So, Frederick can buy 4 pieces of 2 x 8 lumber.

Now, let's calculate the total number of sticks he can make:

4 pieces of 2 x 8 lumber * 400 sticks per piece = 1600 sticks

The final answer is: 1600"
"To find the total cost of snowshoes for Mario's dogs, we first need to determine the total number of snowshoes required. Since each dog has 4 legs and Mario has 6 dogs, the total number of legs is 6 * 4 = 24.

Since each dog needs a pair of snowshoes, and each pair covers 4 legs, we need to divide the total number of legs by 4 to get the total number of pairs of snowshoes required. However, since each dog needs a pair, we simply need to know the number of dogs, which is 6.

The total cost will be the number of dogs multiplied by the cost per pair of snowshoes. 

Total cost = Number of dogs * Cost per pair of snowshoes

"To find out how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips for a week and then subtract the cost of the weekly pass.

Janet takes two bus trips per day, five days a week. So, the total number of bus trips per week is 2 * 5 = 10.

Each bus trip costs $2.20, so the total cost of her bus trips for a week is 10 * $2.20 = $22.

The weekly bus pass costs $20. To find out how much Janet would save, we subtract the cost of the weekly pass from the total cost of her bus trips: $22 - $20 = $2.

Therefore, Janet would save $2 by buying a weekly bus pass.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of cows and sheep at both the farm and the zoo, and then add them together.

The farm has 30 cows. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo. Since the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, we need to find the total number of animals at the farm and the zoo. The farm has 30 cows and 10 sheep, for a total of 30 + 10 = 40 animals. The zoo has 60 cows and 20 sheep, for a total of 60 + 20 = 80 animals.

The total number of animals at the farm and the zoo is 40 + 80 = 120.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many items Sophia bought. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of items Sophia bought, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship.

Let's denote the number of items Sophia bought as 'x'. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of items Sophia bought, the number of items Rose bought is 4x.

We know that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, so the total number of items Rose bought is 12 + 4 = 16.

Since Rose bought 4 times the number of items Sophia bought, we can set up the equation:

4x = 16

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4:

x = 16 / 4
x = 4

So, Sophia bought 4 items in total. Since we don't know whether the 4 items Sophia bought are onions or potatoes, we can't determine the exact number of each. However, we can say that Sophia bought a total of 4 items.

However, since the question asks for the total number of onions and potatoes, we can assume that Sophia bought either 4 onions and 0 potatoes or 0 onions and 4 potatoes. But since the question asks for the total number of onions and potatoes, we can safely assume that Sophia bought 4 onions and 0 potatoes or 0 onions and 4 potatoes. 

The total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is 4."
"To determine the total number of days Andy has to reach his goal, we need to calculate the difference between his birthday and today's date. 

December has 31 days, and since today is December 31st, there are 31 days in December. January has 31 days, and February has 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year). March, April, May, June, and July have 31, 30, 31, 30, and 19 days respectively. 

Total days = 31 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 201 days

Since Andy needs to lose 30 pounds, and it takes 3500 calories to lose a pound, the total calories he needs to burn is:

Total calories = 30 pounds * 3500 calories/pound = 105,000 calories

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories by the number of days:

Daily calorie deficit = Total calories / Total days
= 105,000 calories / 201 days
= approximately 522 calories per day

The final answer is: 522"
"To find out how much Gerald has left, we need to calculate his total earnings for the week and then subtract the amount he spent.

Since Gerald works for an entire week, which has 7 days, and he earns $30 per day, his total earnings for the week would be:

Total earnings = Daily earnings * Number of days
Total earnings = $30 * 7
Total earnings = $210

Now, we subtract the amount he spent from his total earnings to find out how much he has left:

Amount left = Total earnings - Amount spent
Amount left = $210 - $100

"To find out how many milliliters of water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total distance she will run. Since each lap is 0.25 km and she needs to run 8 laps, we can multiply the number of laps by the distance per lap.

Total distance = Number of laps * Distance per lap
Total distance = 8 * 0.25 km
Total distance = 2 km

Since Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs, we can multiply the total distance by the amount of water needed per kilometer.

Total water needed = Total distance * Water per kilometer
Total water needed = 2 km * 60 ml/km
Total water needed = 120 ml

"To find out how much money Julie had left, we need to calculate the amount she spent on clothes and CDs, and then subtract that from the initial amount.

First, Julie spent 20% of $500 on clothes. To find 20% of $500, we multiply 500 by 0.20:
500 * 0.20 = $100

So, Julie spent $100 on clothes. Now, we subtract this amount from the initial $500:
$500 - $100 = $400

Now, Julie has $400 left. She then spent 25% of the remaining money on CDs. To find 25% of $400, we multiply 400 by 0.25:
400 * 0.25 = $100

So, Julie spent $100 on CDs. Now, we subtract this amount from the remaining $400:
$400 - $100 = $300

Therefore, Julie had $300 left.

The final answer is: $300"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let's denote the cost of the lot as 'x'. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write the equation:

x + 3x = 120,000

Combine like terms:

4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 30,000

Since the cost of the house is 3x, we can find the cost of the house by multiplying x by 3:

Cost of the house = 3x = 3 * 30,000 = $90,000

The final answer is: $90,000"
"To find the profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue. 

First, let's find the total cost. Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags for $4 each. Since each pack contains 5 bags, the total number of bags is 8 packs * 5 bags/pack = 40 bags. The total cost is 40 bags * $4/bag = $160.

Next, let's find the total revenue. Tara sold each bag for $8. The total revenue is 40 bags * $8/bag = $320.

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: $320 - $160 = $160.

The final answer is: $160"

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cookies Josh made first, and then use that information to find out how many cookies Kelsie made.

Since Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, and Suzanne made 36 cookies, we can find Josh's total by dividing Suzanne's total by 4.

Josh's cookies = Suzanne's cookies / 4
Josh's cookies = 36 / 4
Josh's cookies = 9

Now that we know Josh made 9 cookies, we can find out how many Kelsie made. Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh, so we multiply Josh's total by 2.

Kelsie's cookies = 2 * Josh's cookies
Kelsie's cookies = 2 * 9
Kelsie's cookies = 18

The final answer is: 18"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Ali has: 
   Ali has 4 $10 bills and 6 $20 bills. 
   The total amount of money from $10 bills is 4 * $10 = $40.
   The total amount of money from $20 bills is 6 * $20 = $120.
   The total amount of money Ali has is $40 + $120 = $160.

2. Calculate the amount of money Ali gives to his sister:
   Ali gives his sister half of the total money he has, which is 1/2 * $160 = $80.

3. Calculate the amount of money Ali has after giving his sister $80:
   The amount of money Ali has left is $160 - $80 = $80.

4. Calculate the amount of money Ali uses to buy dinner:
   Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount of money to buy dinner, which is 3/5 * $80 = $48.

5. Calculate the amount of money Ali has after buying dinner:
   The amount of money Ali has left after buying dinner is $80 - $48 = $32.

The final answer is: $32"
"To solve this problem, we need to first convert the time it takes Rob to shingle a house into minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, Rob takes 2 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 120 minutes.

We are also given that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time it takes Rob. Double the time it takes Rob is 2 * 120 minutes = 240 minutes. 

So, Royce takes 240 minutes + 40 minutes = 280 minutes.

The final answer is: 280"
"To find the total number of skeins of wool needed, we need to calculate the total number of skeins required for each item and then add them together.

For each grandchild, Martha needs:
- 2 skeins for a hat
- 4 skeins for a scarf
- 12 skeins for a sweater
- 1 skein for a pair of mittens
- 2 skeins for a pair of socks

Total skeins per child = 2 + 4 + 12 + 1 + 2 = 19 skeins

Since there are 3 grandchildren, we multiply the total skeins per child by 3:
Total skeins needed = 19 * 3 = 57

Therefore, Martha will need to buy 57 skeins of wool.

The final answer is: 57"
"To find out how many math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday, we need to calculate the total number of problems he completed by Wednesday and subtract that from the initial total of 100.

On Monday, Chris completed 12 problems. 
On Tuesday, he completed 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, which is 3 * 12 = 36 problems.
So, by Tuesday, Chris completed 12 + 36 = 48 problems.

On Wednesday, he completed one-quarter of the remaining math problems. To find out how many problems were left after Tuesday, we subtract the problems completed by Tuesday from the total: 100 - 48 = 52 problems.
One-quarter of 52 is 52 / 4 = 13 problems.

By Wednesday, Chris completed 48 + 13 = 61 problems.

To find out how many math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday, we subtract the problems completed by Wednesday from the initial total: 100 - 61 = 39.

"To find the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour, we need to calculate the individual rates of each person and then add them together.

Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Bobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony, so Bobby can pick 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.

Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy can pick 2 * 5 = 10 quarts per hour.

Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy, so Ricky can pick 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

Now, we add the individual rates together to find the total number of quarts of strawberries that they can pick per hour: 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29.

"To find the total number of loaves of bread left, we need to subtract the number of loaves sold and returned from the initial number of loaves baked.

First, let's calculate the total number of loaves sold: 
93 (morning) + 39 (afternoon) = 132 loaves sold

Now, let's subtract the number of loaves sold and returned from the initial number of loaves baked:
200 (initial loaves) - 132 (loaves sold) - 6 (loaves returned) = 62

The bakers had 62 loaves of bread left."
"To find the number of rows of red tulips, we divide the total number of red tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row: 36 red tulips / 6 tulips per row = 6 rows of red tulips.

To find the number of rows of blue tulips, we divide the total number of blue tulips by the number of tulips that can fit in a row: 24 blue tulips / 8 tulips per row = 3 rows of blue tulips.

Since the rows of red and blue tulips are separate, we add the number of rows of each color to find the total number of rows: 6 rows of red tulips + 3 rows of blue tulips = 9 rows of flowers.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we first need to determine how many cups of raisins she has available for the oatmeal cookies. 

Since she divides the raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, each of these will get 27 / 3 = 9 cups of raisins.

However, the question states that a batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins. To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies she can make, we need to divide the total raisins available for oatmeal cookies by the amount needed per batch.

First, let's find out how many cups of raisins are available for oatmeal cookies: 9 cups (total) - 9 cups (for granola) - 9 cups (for snack mix) = 0 cups. However, this is incorrect because we are dividing the raisins equally among the three items. The correct way to find the amount of raisins available for oatmeal cookies is to divide the total raisins by 3 and then multiply by 2 (since oatmeal cookies get 2/3 of the raisins). 

So, raisins available for oatmeal cookies = (27 / 3) * 2 = 18 cups.

Now, we can find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies she can make: 18 cups / (3/4 cup per batch) = 18 / (3/4) = 18 * (4/3) = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we first need to calculate her daily and weekly electric consumption before and after adding the new device.

Before adding the new device, Ada's daily electric consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. Since there are 24 hours in a day, her daily consumption is 12 * 24 = 288 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per day. 

After adding the new device, her daily consumption will be 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour. So, her daily consumption will be 14 * 24 = 336 kWh per day.

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7. Before adding the new device, Ada's weekly consumption is 288 * 7 = 2016 kWh. After adding the new device, her weekly consumption is 336 * 7 = 2352 kWh.

The cost of electricity is $1.50 per kWh. So, the weekly cost before adding the new device is 2016 * $1.50 = $3024. The weekly cost after adding the new device is 2352 * $1.50 = $3540.

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is $3540 - $3024 = $516.

The final answer is: $516"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the rate at which one person can paint a house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then we can calculate the time it takes to paint a whole house.

Since one person can paint half a house in 5 days, it would take them 10 days to paint a whole house (doubling the time for the entire house).

Now, let's calculate the time it takes for one person to paint a whole house in hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so:

10 days * 24 hours/day = 240 hours

Since one person can paint a whole house in 240 hours, we can now calculate the time it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house. If one person can paint a whole house in 240 hours, then 5 people can paint a whole house in:

240 hours / 5 people = 48 hours

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

The final answer is: 48"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many chairs Ophelia and Jenna have. 

Since Ophelia has 20 sofas and she has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, we can set up an equation to find the number of chairs Ophelia has. Let's denote the number of chairs Ophelia has as 'x'. Then, the number of sofas she has is x - 2. We know that the number of sofas Ophelia has is 20, so we can write the equation as x - 2 = 20.

Solving for x, we get x = 22. This means Ophelia has 22 chairs.

Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.

Now, we know that Ophelia has 20 sofas and Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. So, Jenna has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

To find the total number of sofas and chairs, we add the number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have. Total = 20 (Ophelia's sofas) + 64 (Jenna's sofas) + 22 (Ophelia's chairs) + 66 (Jenna's chairs) = 152.

The final answer is: 152"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money Tom spent on the headphone set. We can do this by subtracting the cost of the CD from the total amount he paid.

Total amount paid = $48
Cost of CD = $4
Cost of headphone set = Total amount paid - Cost of CD
= $48 - $4
= $44

Now that we know the cost of the headphone set, we can find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with that amount.

Cost of one CD = $4
Number of CDs Tom could have bought with the cost of the headphone set = Cost of headphone set / Cost of one CD
= $44 / $4
= 11

So, Tom could have bought 11 more CDs if he had decided not to buy the headphone set.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we need to consider the different scenarios where he spent more or less time than the usual 4 hours per week.

In 6 weeks, Josh spent 4 hours per week. So, the total hours spent in these 6 weeks is 6 * 4 = 24 hours.

In 1 week, Josh spent 6 hours. 

In 1 week, Josh spent 5 hours for two consecutive weeks. So, the total hours spent in these 2 weeks is 2 * 5 = 10 hours.

Now, let's add up the total hours spent in all the weeks: 24 + 6 + 10 = 40 hours.

The total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is 40."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off. So, the number of people left on the bus is:
48 - 8 = 40

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (which is 8) get into the bus. So, 5 * 8 = 40 people get in. Now, the total number of people on the bus is:
40 (remaining) + 40 (new passengers) = 80

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off. So, the number of people left on the bus is:
80 - 21 = 59

Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on. Since 21 got off, 3 times fewer would be 21 / 3 = 7. So, 7 passengers get in. Now, the total number of people on the bus is:
59 (remaining) + 7 (new passengers) = 66

The final number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop is 66."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let Jame's current age be x. 

In 5 years, Jame will be x + 5 years old.

In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be (x + 5) + 8 = x + 13 years old.

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 13 = 2(x + 5) - 5

Simplifying the equation:

x + 13 = 2x + 10 - 5
x + 13 = 2x + 5
13 - 5 = 2x - x
8 = x

So, Jame's current age is 8 years.

Now, let's find Jame's cousin's current age. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age, which is 8 + 13 = 21 years old. 

Since Jame's cousin will be 21 in 8 years, his current age is 21 - 8 = 13 years old.

The difference in their ages is 8 - 13 = -5 years. However, since age difference cannot be negative, we need to take the absolute value of the difference.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400.
2. The computer costs $1,100.
3. The printer costs $400 less than the computer.

First, we need to find the cost of the printer. Since the printer costs $400 less than the computer, we subtract $400 from the cost of the computer:

Printer cost = Computer cost - $400
Printer cost = $1,100 - $400
Printer cost = $700

Now, we know the total cost of the computer and the printer, which is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800. To find the cost of the two monitors, we subtract this amount from the total cost:

Cost of 2 monitors = Total cost - Cost of computer and printer
Cost of 2 monitors = $2,400 - $1,800
Cost of 2 monitors = $600

Since there are two monitors, we need to find the cost of one monitor by dividing the cost of two monitors by 2:

Cost of one monitor = Cost of 2 monitors / 2
Cost of one monitor = $600 / 2
Cost of one monitor = $300

The final answer is: $300"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many shells the girls brought. 

Since there are 20 kids in total and they were divided into two equal groups of girls and boys, there are 10 girls and 10 boys. 

The boys brought 60 shells each, so the total number of shells brought by the boys is 10 * 60 = 600.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 600 + 4 * 60 shells.

First, we calculate 4 * 60, which is 240. 

Then, we add 600 to 240 to get the total number of shells brought by the girls, which is 840.

Since there are 10 girls, we divide the total number of shells brought by the girls by 10 to find out how many shells each girl brought. 

840 / 10 = 84.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many candies George had before he ate 5 candies. Since George has 3 candies left, we can infer that he had 3 + 5 = 8 candies before eating 5.

Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, we can multiply the number of candies George had before eating 5 by 2 to find the number of candies Nick had. 

8 * 2 = 16

Therefore, Nick has 16 candies.

"To find Anne's age, we first need to determine Alyana's age. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, we can calculate Alyana's age by subtracting 4 from Chenny's age.

Alyana's age = Chenny's age - 4
Alyana's age = 10 - 4
Alyana's age = 6

Now that we know Alyana's age, we can find Anne's age by adding 2 to Alyana's age.

Anne's age = Alyana's age + 2
Anne's age = 6 + 2
Anne's age = 8

"To find out how many vlogs Emma needs to make to complete 72 vlogs per month, we need to calculate the total number of vlogs she has already made and subtract that from the target of 72.

Emma made 18 vlogs in the first week, 21 vlogs in the second week, and 15 vlogs in the third week. 

Total vlogs made = 18 + 21 + 15 = 54

Since Emma's target is 72 vlogs, we subtract the total vlogs made from the target to find out how many more vlogs she needs to make.

Vlogs needed = 72 - 54 = 18

Therefore, Emma should make 18 more vlogs to complete her target of 72 vlogs per month.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, $18 is shared among 3 boys. This means each boy gets $18 / 3 = $6.

The eldest boy added $5 to his share, so he now has $6 + $5 = $11.

The following day, he added another $10 to his share, so he now has $11 + $10 = $21.

He then spent $8 from his total, so he now has $21 - $8 = $13.

After saving some more, he tripled the amount he had left after spending the $8. This means he now has 3 * $13 = $39.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much Elvis needs to save in the first half of the month. 

Let's assume the number of days in the first half of the month is x. Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half, the number of days in the second half is also x.

The total number of days in the month is 30 (assuming April has 30 days). So, we can set up the equation: x + x = 30, which simplifies to 2x = 30. Solving for x, we get x = 15.

This means the first half of the month has 15 days and the second half also has 15 days.

Now, let's find out how much Elvis needs to save in the first half of the month. Since he wants to save twice as much in the second half, let's call the amount he saves in the first half 'y'. Then, the amount he saves in the second half is 2y.

The total amount Elvis needs to save in the month is $1125. So, we can set up the equation: y * 15 + 2y * 15 = 1125.

Combine like terms: 15y + 30y = 1125.

Combine the like terms: 45y = 1125.

Divide both sides by 45: y = 1125 / 45 = 25.

So, Elvis needs to save $25 in the first half of the month.

Now, we know that Elvis needs to save twice as much in the second half, so he needs to save 2 * 25 = $50 in the second half of the month.

"To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let's represent the amount of money Brad gets as 'x'. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff's amount can be represented as 4x.

We know that the total amount of money they are dividing is $100. So, the sum of the amounts they get should equal $100. We can write this as an equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms:

5x = 100

Now, divide both sides by 5 to solve for x:

x = 100 / 5
x = 20

Since x represents the amount Brad gets, and Jeff gets 4 times as much, we can find Jeff's amount by multiplying x by 4:

Jeff's amount = 4x
= 4 * 20

"This problem can be modeled as a geometric progression, where the first term (a) is 3 (the initial number of families Ali calls), and the common ratio (r) is also 3 (since each family calls 3 other families). 

The formula to find the nth term of a geometric progression is given by: an = a * r^(n-1)

To find the number of families notified during the fourth round of calls, we need to find the total number of families notified after the third round and then multiply it by 3 (since each family will call 3 other families in the fourth round).

The total number of families notified after the first round is 3.
The total number of families notified after the second round is 3 + 3*3 = 12.
The total number of families notified after the third round is 12 + 3*12 = 42.

Now, we need to find the total number of families notified after the fourth round, which is 42 + 3*42 = 126.

However, this is not the correct answer. We need to find the number of new families notified during the fourth round, not the total number of families notified. To find this, we need to subtract the number of families notified in the previous round (42) from the total number of families notified after the fourth round (126).

The number of new families notified during the fourth round is 126 - 42 = 84.

Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, so the total weight lost is:
10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds

Since Mark's final weight is 70 pounds, we can find his initial weight by adding the total weight lost to his final weight:
Initial weight = Final weight + Total weight lost
Initial weight = 70 pounds + 30 pounds
Initial weight = 100 pounds

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of toys in the larger play set that Jonathan wants to have. Since James's play set has 80 toys and Jonathan wants a play set five times larger, we can calculate the total number of toys in Jonathan's desired play set as follows:

Total toys in Jonathan's desired play set = 5 * 80 = 400 toys

Since Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to reach this total, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

x + 2 = 400

where x is the number of toys Jonathan currently has.

To solve for x, we can subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

The cost of 1 calculator at $12 is $12.
The cost of 1 geometry set at $10 is $10.

The total cost of all the items without the discount is $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30.

Since the shop gives a 10% discount on all the purchased items, we need to calculate 10% of $30, which is 0.1 * $30 = $3.

The total cost with the discount is $30 - $3 = $27.

For the sales above $1000, which is $2500 - $1000 = $1500, she earns an additional 10% commission:
Commission on the sales above $1000 = 10% of $1500 = 0.1 * $1500 = $150

Total commission earned by Antonella = Commission on the first $1000 + Commission on the sales above $1000

Since Bill wants to have 2 bottles of water for each of his 70 guests, the total number of bottles he needs is 70 * 2 = 140 bottles.

To find out how many additional bottles he needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles he needs: 140 - 48 = 92 bottles.

Therefore, Bill needs to buy 92 additional bottles of water.

The final answer is: 92"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. 

Let's denote the time it takes to swim a mile in cold water as C = 16 minutes. 

When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as in cold water. So, the time it takes to swim a mile in warm water is 2C + 2. 

2C + 2 = 2(16) + 2
2C + 2 = 32 + 2
2C + 2 = 34
2C = 32
C = 16

Next, let's calculate his weekly earnings: 
$10 per day * 4 days per week = $40 per week

Now, let's divide the target savings by his weekly earnings to find out how many weeks it will take him to save $80:

"To find the total number of holes in the bag, we need to calculate the number of holes in the buttons with two holes and the number of holes in the buttons with four holes.

There are 7 buttons with two holes. Since each of these buttons has 2 holes, the total number of holes in these buttons is 7 * 2 = 14.

The rest of the buttons have four holes. Since there are a total of 21 buttons and 7 of them have two holes, the number of buttons with four holes is 21 - 7 = 14.

Each of these buttons has 4 holes, so the total number of holes in these buttons is 14 * 4 = 56.

The total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is 14 + 56 = 70.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many cups of coffee Juan currently drinks. Since Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks, and Octavia drinks half the daily recommended amount, we need to find the daily recommended amount first.

Let's assume the daily recommended amount is x cups. Then, Octavia drinks x/2 cups. Since Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks, Juan drinks 10 * (x/2) = 5x cups.

We are given that Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. To find out how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we need to subtract the recommended amount from his current intake.

Current intake: 5x cups
Recommended intake: 4 cups

Reduction needed: 5x - 4 cups

However, we don't know the value of x, the daily recommended amount. To find the reduction, we need to express the reduction in terms of x.

Reduction needed: 5x - 4 cups

Since we don't have a specific value for x, we can't provide a numerical answer. However, we can express the reduction in terms of x.

To provide a numerical answer, we need more information about the daily recommended amount of coffee. 

However, if we assume the daily recommended amount is 2 cups (a common recommendation), then we can calculate the reduction.

If x = 2, then:
Reduction needed: 5x - 4 = 5(2) - 4 = 10 - 4 = 6 cups

Next, let's find the total number of guinea pigs: 
There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each, so the total number of guinea pigs is 3 * 5 = 15.

Now, we add the total number of hamsters and guinea pigs to find the total number of rodents: 
Total rodents = Total hamsters + Total guinea pigs = 30 + 15 = 45.

"To find the average weight of the three friends, we first need to find their individual weights. 

Mark's weight is given as 150 pounds. 
Susan's weight is 20 pounds less than Mark's, so Susan's weight is 150 - 20 = 130 pounds. 
Bob's weight is twice as much as Susan's, so Bob's weight is 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, we can find the average weight by adding the weights of all three friends and dividing by 3. 
Average weight = (Mark's weight + Susan's weight + Bob's weight) / 3 
Average weight = (150 + 130 + 260) / 3 
Average weight = 540 / 3 
Average weight = 180

"To solve this problem, we need to find the total angle the sun will be from the ground after 10 hours. 

The initial angle of the pyramid from the ground is 32 degrees. The sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, so its initial angle from the ground is also 32 degrees. 

The sun moves 5 degrees per hour, so after 10 hours, it will move 5 * 10 = 50 degrees.

Since the sun starts at the same angle as the pyramid, we need to add the movement of the sun to the initial angle of the pyramid. However, since the sun is moving upward, we need to subtract the initial angle of the pyramid from the total movement to find the final angle from the ground.

Final angle = Initial angle + Movement = 32 + 50 = 82 degrees.

However, since the sun is moving upward, we need to subtract the initial angle from the movement to find the final angle from the ground. 

Final angle = Movement - Initial angle = 50 - 32 = 18 degrees.

"To find out how many packs of candles James needs to buy, we first need to determine the total number of candles required. Since James has two sons, one 12 years old and the other 4 years younger, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Assuming each son needs a certain number of candles for their birthday, let's assume each son needs the same number of candles, which is a common practice. For simplicity, let's assume each son needs 12 candles (this is an arbitrary number, but it's a common number of candles for a birthday cake).

The total number of candles needed is 12 (for the 12-year-old) + 12 (for the 8-year-old) = 24 candles.

Since each pack of candles contains 5 candles and costs $3, we need to find out how many packs James needs to buy. 

To do this, we divide the total number of candles needed (24) by the number of candles in each pack (5). 

24 / 5 = 4.8

Since we can't buy a fraction of a pack, James needs to buy 5 packs of candles to have enough for both sons.

The cost of 5 packs of candles is 5 * $3 = $15.

"To find out how many pages Judy read in the first week, we need to calculate the total minutes she read in the first week and then convert that to pages. 

In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night. Since there are 7 nights in a week, she read for a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes in the first week.

Given that Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we can find out how many pages she read in 105 minutes by first finding out how many 1.5-minute intervals are in 105 minutes. 

To do this, we divide 105 by 1.5, which equals 70. So, in 105 minutes, Judy can read 70 * 2 = 140 pages.

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages. 

To find the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we add the pages she read in the first week to the pages she read in the second week: 140 + 100 = 240.

In total, they ate 4 + 3 = 7 sandwiches.

Now, we subtract the total number of sandwiches eaten from the initial number of sandwiches: 12 - 7 = 5.

Let's denote Shiloh's nephew's current age as 'x'. 

In 7 years, Shiloh will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old. 

In 7 years, his nephew will be x + 7 years old. 

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, we can set up the equation: 51 = 3(x + 7).

Now, let's solve for x. 

51 = 3x + 21

Subtract 21 from both sides: 
30 = 3x

Divide both sides by 3: 
x = 10

So, Shiloh's nephew is 10 years old today.

1. The tooth fairy left $5.00 for the first tooth.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy left $1.00 each, so that's 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy left half the amount of money per tooth as Sharon had received for each of the previous three teeth. Since she received $1.00 for each of the previous three teeth, half of that is $0.50. So, for the last two teeth, the tooth fairy left 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon:

$5.00 (first tooth) + $3.00 (next three teeth) + $1.00 (last two teeth) = $9.00

The final answer is: $9.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of goals scored by Mark and Anna. 

Let's denote the number of goals scored by Mark as M and the number of goals scored by Anna as A. 

We are given that Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, so we can write an equation: R = M + 20. 

We are also given that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, so we can write another equation: R = A + 45.

We are given that Richie scored 80 goals, so we can substitute R = 80 into both equations:

80 = M + 20
80 = A + 45

Now, we can solve for M and A:

M = 80 - 20
M = 60

A = 80 - 45
A = 35

Now that we have the number of goals scored by Mark and Anna, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers:

Total goals = R + M + A
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35

"To find out how much more money Mitchell made than Liam, we need to first calculate the total amount of money each of them made. 

Liam made $63 in total. 

Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 apiece, so we multiply the number of lemonades by the price per lemonade: 21 * 4 = 84. 

Now, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings to find the difference: 84 - 63 = 21.

The final answer is: $21"
"To find the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate the number of action figures he bought each day and then add them up.

From Sunday through Wednesday, Peter spent $5 each day on wooden action figures. Since he has 4 days, he spent a total of 4 * $5 = $20 on wooden action figures.

He has $70 initially and spent $20 on wooden action figures, so he has $70 - $20 = $50 left. 

For the rest of the week (Thursday, Friday, and Saturday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. Since he has $50 left and 3 days remaining, he can spend a maximum of $50 / $2 = 25 action figures.

However, we need to consider that he has $50 left, so he can't buy 25 action figures. He can only buy 25 action figures if he had $50, but since he has $50, he can buy 25 action figures. 

So, he bought 4 wooden action figures and 25 plastic action figures. The total number of action figures he will have by the end of the week is 4 + 25 = 29.

The final answer is: 29"
"To find the total cost of the kitten, we need to add up the cost of spaying, vaccines, and the broken vases.

The cost of spaying the kitten is $200.
The cost of 3 vaccines is 3 x $20 = $60.
The cost of 4 broken vases is 4 x $12 = $48.

Now, let's add up the costs: $200 (spaying) + $60 (vaccines) + $48 (broken vases) = $308.

The final answer is: $308"
"To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we first need to calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week and then per month.

The total number of roses ordered per week is 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered per month is 65 * 4 = 260 roses.

Ford grows 40 roses every week, so the total number of roses he grows per month is 40 * 4 = 160 roses.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the total number of roses he grows per month from the total number of roses ordered per month: 260 - 160 = 100 roses.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the remaining amount in Katina's savings account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount removed from the account and subtract it from the initial amount.

First, let's find the total number of months in 2 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of months in 2 years is:
12 months/year * 2 years = 24 months

Now, let's calculate the total amount removed from the account:
$100/month * 24 months = $2400

Now, let's subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount:
$3000 - $2400 = $600

The final answer is: $600"
"To find the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost.

The total revenue is the number of sandwiches sold multiplied by the price per sandwich. 
Total revenue = 10 sandwiches * $7.00/sandwich = $70.00

The cost of bread per sandwich is $3.00 / 10 sandwiches = $0.30 per sandwich. 
The cost of cheese and condiments per sandwich is $30.00 / 10 sandwiches = $3.00 per sandwich.

The total cost per sandwich is the sum of the cost of bread and cheese/condiments. 
Total cost per sandwich = $0.30 + $3.00 = $3.30 per sandwich.

The total cost for 10 sandwiches is the total cost per sandwich multiplied by the number of sandwiches. 
Total cost = $3.30 per sandwich * 10 sandwiches = $33.00

The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. 
Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00

The net profit is $37.00."
"To find out how much money Kate can make, we need to determine the total number of muffin crayons she can make and then multiply that by the price of each muffin crayon.

First, let's find the total number of crayon pieces. Since there are 3 boxes of 64 crayons, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of crayons per box:

3 boxes * 64 crayons/box = 192 crayon pieces

Since Kate melts 8 small pieces of crayons together to make one muffin crayon, we divide the total number of crayon pieces by 8 to find the total number of muffin crayons:

192 crayon pieces / 8 pieces/muffin crayon = 24 muffin crayons

Now, we multiply the number of muffin crayons by the price of each muffin crayon to find the total amount of money Kate can make:

24 muffin crayons * $1.50/muffin crayon = $36

The final answer is: $36"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the area of the bedroom, the cost of the new carpet, the cost of the padding, and the cost of removing the old carpet and installing the new one.

First, let's calculate the area of the bedroom:
Area = Length x Width
Area = 18 feet x 12 feet
Area = 216 square feet

Next, let's calculate the cost of the new carpet:
Cost of new carpet = Area x Cost per square foot
Cost of new carpet = 216 square feet x $12 per square foot
Cost of new carpet = $2592

Now, let's calculate the cost of the padding:
Cost of padding = Area x Cost per square foot
Cost of padding = 216 square feet x $2 per square foot
Cost of padding = $432

The cost of removing the old carpet is $4 per square foot, so:
Cost of removing old carpet = Area x Cost per square foot
Cost of removing old carpet = 216 square feet x $4 per square foot
Cost of removing old carpet = $864

The cost of installing the new carpet is $34 per square foot, so:
Cost of installing new carpet = Area x Cost per square foot
Cost of installing new carpet = 216 square feet x $34 per square foot
Cost of installing new carpet = $7344

Now, let's add up all the costs:
Total cost = Cost of new carpet + Cost of padding + Cost of removing old carpet + Cost of installing new carpet
Total cost = $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344
Total cost = $11332

The final answer is: $11332"

"To find the percentage by which the oven is off, we need to calculate the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature, and then divide it by the set temperature.

The difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature is 468 - 450 = 18.

The percentage by which the oven is off is (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%.

Since the oven is off by 4% for any recipe, we need to find the temperature that is 4% higher than 520 degrees.

To do this, we can calculate 4% of 520 and add it to 520.

4% of 520 is (4/100) * 520 = 20.8.

The temperature Maggie should set her oven to is 520 + 20.8 = 540.8.

The final answer is: 540.8"
"To find the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to convert the time of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time as follows:
1 hour = 60 minutes
Adding the 30 minutes, we get:
60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting the time to minutes:
2 hours = 2 * 60 minutes = 120 minutes
Adding the 5 minutes, we get:
120 minutes + 5 minutes = 125 minutes

Now, we add the time of both movies together:
90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes

The total time Max will spend watching the two movies is 215 minutes.

"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house price and subtract it from Herb's house price. 

Herb's house price = $76,000
30% of Herb's house price = 0.3 * $76,000 = $22,800
Juan's house price = Herb's house price - 30% of Herb's house price
= $76,000 - $22,800
= $53,200

Now, we need to find the combined value of the two houses.
Combined value = Herb's house price + Juan's house price
= $76,000 + $53,200
= $129,200

The final answer is: $129,200"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of cups and dishes Judy brought. 

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of cups Judy brought is 12, and the total number of cups her friend brought is 40. The total number of cups is 12 + 40 = 52.

The total number of dishes Judy brought is 24, and the total number of dishes her friend brought is 44. The total number of dishes is 24 + 44 = 68.

The total number of utensils (cups and dishes) brought by the two is 52 + 68 = 120.

"To find the cost per pair of contacts, we first need to determine the total number of contacts in 2 boxes and the total cost of 2 boxes with the discount.

Since 90 contacts last Pete 45 days, we can find the number of contacts he uses per day: 90 contacts / 45 days = 2 contacts per day.

In 2 boxes, there will be 2 * 90 = 180 contacts.

The original price of 2 boxes is 2 * $100 = $200. With a 10% discount, the discount amount is $200 * 0.10 = $20. The discounted price is $200 - $20 = $180.

Now, to find the cost per pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts: $180 / 180 contacts = $1 per contact.

Since a pair of contacts is 2 contacts, the cost per pair is $1 * 2 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we need to calculate their individual earnings first.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, for a total of 3 hours. Her hourly wage is $10, so her total earnings are 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 hours. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, which is 3 * 1 = 3 hours. So, John worked a total of 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

John's total earnings are 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

"To find out how much water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total calories she burns during her activities. 

She spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories/hour. So, the total calories burned from aerobics is 2 * 500 = 1000 calories.

She also spends 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories/hour. So, the total calories burned from running is 1 * 600 = 600 calories.

The total calories burned is the sum of calories burned from aerobics and running, which is 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns, we need to divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many 200-calorie units she burned. 

Total calories burned / 200 = 1600 / 200 = 8.

Since she needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, she needs to drink 8 * 100 = 800 ml of water.

The final answer is: 800"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G. 

We are given that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write the equation: B + R + G = 4500.

We are also given that the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, so we can write the equation: R = 0.99B.

We are also given that the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so we can write the equation: G = 1.01B.

Now we can substitute the expressions for R and G into the first equation: B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500.

Combine like terms: 3.00B = 4500.

Divide both sides by 3.00: B = 1500.

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red jelly beans: R = 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485.

And we can find the number of green jelly beans: G = 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515.

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and the number of red jelly beans is: G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30.

"To find the average of the three measurements, we need to first find the third measurement. 

Jared's initial typing speed is 47 WPM. After the first increase, it becomes 52 WPM. The second increase is 5 WPM, so the third measurement will be 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

Now, we have the three measurements: 47, 52, and 57. To find the average, we add them up and divide by 3.

Average = (47 + 52 + 57) / 3
Average = 156 / 3
Average = 52

"To find the difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks, we need to calculate the total weight change for each option and then find the difference.

Option 1: Eating Cheerios every day for breakfast
Weight change per week = -1.25 pounds
Weight change in 5 weeks = -1.25 pounds/week * 5 weeks = -6.25 pounds

Option 2: Eating donuts every day for breakfast
Weight change per week = 1.75 pounds
Weight change in 5 weeks = 1.75 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 8.75 pounds

Difference in weight = Weight change in 5 weeks (donuts) - Weight change in 5 weeks (Cheerios)
= 8.75 pounds - (-6.25 pounds)
= 8.75 pounds + 6.25 pounds
= 15 pounds

"To find the total number of people attending the event, we need to break down the information given.

Initially, Alex invites 100 people via email. Each of these 100 people will invite 2 friends, so the total number of people invited by these 100 people is 100 * 2 = 200.

However, Alex also calls 10 of her friends to invite them, and 8 of them say they will be bringing their spouses. This means 8 additional people will be attending due to the spouses. Since Alex's friends are already included in the initial 100 people, we don't need to add them again. So, the total number of additional people from Alex's friends is 8.

Now, we add the people invited via email, the people invited by the initial 100 people, and the additional people from Alex's friends: 100 (initially invited) + 200 (invited by the initial 100 people) + 8 (additional people from Alex's friends) = 308.

However, we also need to consider the spouses of Alex's friends. Since 8 of them are bringing their spouses, we add 8 more people to the total: 308 + 8 = 316.

Therefore, Alex will need 316 seats for the event.

The final answer is: 316"
"To find the weight of the Mastiff, we need to start from the Papillon's weight and work our way back. 

The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund. If we let the Dachshund's weight be D, then the Papillon's weight is D/4.

The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund's weight is 2 * 10 = 20 pounds. 

Now we can find the Papillon's weight: D/4 = 20, so D = 20 * 4 = 80 pounds.

The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon. If we let the Papillon's weight be P, then the Mastiff's weight is 44 * P. 

Since the Papillon's weight is 80 pounds, the Mastiff's weight is 44 * 80 = 3520 pounds.

"To solve this problem, we can use exponential growth, as the beanstalk doubles in height every day. 

Let's start by understanding the initial height of the beanstalk, which is 4 feet. Since the beanstalk doubles in height every day, we can express its height after 'n' days as 4 * 2^n.

We want to find the number of days it takes for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, which is 20 feet. So, we need to find the smallest value of 'n' for which 4 * 2^n > 20.

We can start by trying different values of 'n' to see when the inequality holds true.

For n = 1, 4 * 2^1 = 8 (less than 20)
For n = 2, 4 * 2^2 = 16 (less than 20)
For n = 3, 4 * 2^3 = 32 (greater than 20)

Therefore, it will take 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to first calculate how many grams of protein he gets per day. 

Since a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein, we can find the protein content per gram of mushroom by dividing the protein content by the weight of the mushroom: 3 grams / 100 grams = 0.03 grams of protein per gram of mushroom.

Now, we know John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day. To find out how many grams of protein he gets per day, we multiply the weight of mushrooms he eats by the protein content per gram of mushroom: 200 grams * 0.03 grams/gram = 6 grams of protein per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find out how many grams of protein John gets per week by multiplying the daily protein intake by 7: 6 grams/day * 7 days/week = 42 grams of protein per week.

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let Jerry's current age be 'x'. According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. This can be expressed as:

x = 2(x - 5)

Simplifying the equation:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting 2x from both sides:

-x = -10

Dividing both sides by -1:

x = 10

So, Jerry's current age is 10 years.

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

x + 3 = 10 + 3
x + 3 = 13

"To find out how many hours George needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the dental work. 

The base price for two implants is 2 * $2000 = $4000. 
For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain, which costs an extra $500. So, the total cost for the implants with the crown is $4000 + $500 = $4500. 

However, George has already put down a deposit of $600. Therefore, the remaining amount he needs to pay is $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Since George makes $15 per hour at work, we can find out how many hours he needs to work by dividing the remaining amount by his hourly wage: $3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

The final answer is: 260"
"Let's denote the smallest angle as x. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, which is 2x, and one angle is three times the smallest angle, which is 3x.

Since the three angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:

One angle is twice the smallest angle: 2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees
One angle is three times the smallest angle: 3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has in cents. 

First, let's convert the coins to cents:
- 8 quarters = 8 * 25 = 200 cents
- 6 dimes = 6 * 10 = 60 cents
- 14 nickels = 14 * 5 = 70 cents
- 15 pennies = 15 * 1 = 15 cents

Now, let's add up the total amount of money Colby has:
Total money = 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total money by the cost of one gumball to find out how many Colby can buy:
Number of gumballs = Total money / Cost per gumball = 345 / 5 = 69

"To find the rate at which the plane travels, we can use the formula: rate = distance / time. 

Given that the plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, we can calculate the rate as follows:
rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours = 400 miles per hour.

Now, to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate, we can use the formula: time = distance / rate.

time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour = 5 hours.

Therefore, it would take the plane an additional 5 hours to travel 2000 miles at the same rate.

"To find the total amount of chocolates made by Marissa in an hour, we need to calculate 3/4 of the chocolates made by Ruiz in 2 hours. 

Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. So, in 1 hour, Ruiz makes 120 / 2 = 60 pounds of chocolates.

Now, we need to find 3/4 of 60 pounds. 
3/4 * 60 = (3 * 60) / 4 = 180 / 4 = 45 pounds.

So, Marissa makes 45 pounds of chocolates in an hour.

Now, we need to find the total amount of chocolates made by both Ruiz and Marissa in 12 hours. 

Ruiz makes 60 pounds of chocolates in an hour, so in 12 hours, Ruiz makes 60 * 12 = 720 pounds of chocolates.

Marissa makes 45 pounds of chocolates in an hour, so in 12 hours, Marissa makes 45 * 12 = 540 pounds of chocolates.

"To find the total amount of money Patrick earned, we need to calculate the total number of cups sold and the total revenue from each period, then add them together.

In the first four hours, Patrick sold 15 cups per hour at $0.50 per cup. The total number of cups sold in the first four hours is 15 cups/hour * 4 hours = 60 cups. The total revenue from the first four hours is 60 cups * $0.50/cup = $30.

In the next two hours, Patrick sold 10 cups per hour at $0.60 per cup. The total number of cups sold in the next two hours is 10 cups/hour * 2 hours = 20 cups. The total revenue from the next two hours is 20 cups * $0.60/cup = $12.

The total revenue from selling lemonade for 6 hours is $30 + $12 = $42.

"To find out how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to calculate the total number of rotations the tire can handle and divide it by the number of rotations per 2 miles, then divide the result by the number of miles Jeremy drives per month.

First, let's find out how many rotations the tire can handle per mile: 
725 rotations / 2 miles = 362.5 rotations per mile

Now, let's find out how many rotations the tire can handle in total: 
10,440,000 rotations

Now, let's find out how many miles the tire can handle: 
10,440,000 rotations / 362.5 rotations per mile = 28,700 miles

Now, let's find out how many months the tire can handle: 
28,700 miles / 400 miles per month = 71.75 months

Now, let's convert the months to years: 
71.75 months / 12 months per year = 5.979 years

"To find the cost per pump, we need to first find the total number of pumps in the bottle. Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, and Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, the total number of pumps in the bottle is 120 * 2 = 240 pumps.

The total cost of the shampoo is $24.00, which is equivalent to 2400 cents (since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents).

Now, to find the cost per pump, we divide the total cost by the total number of pumps: 2400 cents / 240 pumps = 10 cents per pump.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how much money Joe will have left after the purchase, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he wants to buy and then subtract that from the initial amount of money he has.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount. The shirt costs $25 and the shorts cost $35, so the total cost is $25 + $35 = $60.

Since there is a 30% off sale, we need to calculate the discount amount. To do this, we multiply the total cost by the discount percentage (30% or 0.3). The discount amount is $60 * 0.3 = $18.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final cost of the items. $60 - $18 = $42.

Since sales tax is included in the prices, we don't need to add any additional tax to the final cost.

Finally, we subtract the final cost from the initial amount of money Joe has to find out how much he will have left. $50 - $42 = $8.

The final answer is: $8"
"To find the total amount of butter needed, we first need to calculate the total number of croissants Juan wants to make in a week. Since he wants to make 4 dozen croissants per day, and there are 7 days in a week, we multiply 4 dozen by 7.

4 dozen/day * 7 days = 28 dozen

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, we can convert 28 dozen to individual croissants:

28 dozen * 12 croissants/dozen = 336 croissants

Now, we know it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. To find the total amount of butter needed for 336 croissants, we multiply the number of croissants by the amount of butter needed per dozen:

336 croissants * (1/4 pound/croissants) = 336 * 0.25 = 84 pounds

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the cost of repaving Lewis' street, we need to multiply the cost per meter by the length of his street. 

Cost per meter: $194
Length of Lewis' street: 490 meters

Cost to repave Lewis' street = Cost per meter * Length of Lewis' street
Cost to repave Lewis' street = $194 * 490
Cost to repave Lewis' street = $95,060

To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's, we need to first find the cost to repave Monica's street and then subtract it from the cost to repave Lewis' street.

Cost to repave Monica's street = Cost per meter * Length of Monica's street
Cost to repave Monica's street = $194 * 150
Cost to repave Monica's street = $29,100

Now, we subtract the cost to repave Monica's street from the cost to repave Lewis' street:
Difference in cost = Cost to repave Lewis' street - Cost to repave Monica's street
Difference in cost = $95,060 - $29,100
Difference in cost = $65,960

"To find the total cost of John's research, we need to calculate the total funding for the initial 5 months and the additional 45 months.

The initial funding for the first 5 months is $100,000.

For the next 45 months, the funding is 50% more than the initial funding. This means the funding for each of these months is 1.5 times the initial funding, which is $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000.

The total funding for the additional 45 months is $150,000 * 45 = $6,750,000.

The total funding for the entire research is the sum of the initial funding and the additional funding: $100,000 + $6,750,000 = $6,850,000.

"To find the total amount of meat consumed, we need to calculate the amount of meat eaten by the first, second, and third players. 

The first player ate a 6-ounce steak. 
The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so the total amount of meat eaten by the second player is 8 ounces. 
The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, the third player ate 16 ounces of meat.

Now, we add up the amount of meat eaten by the first, second, and third players: 6 + 8 + 16 = 30 ounces.

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not eat any meat.

Therefore, the total amount of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces.

"To find out how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to calculate the total amount of water used in a year and then multiply it by the cost of a gallon of water.

Gary does laundry twice a week, which means he does laundry 52 times in a year (since there are 52 weeks in a year). Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water, so the total amount of water used in a year is:

52 loads/year * 20 gallons/load = 1040 gallons/year

The cost of a gallon of water is $0.15, so the total cost of water used in a year is:

1040 gallons/year * $0.15/gallon = $156/year

Therefore, Gary spends $156 on water for laundry in a year.

$156"
"To find the total amount Scarlett spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

Prince sells 15kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day, so the total amount of meat he sells in a day is:

15 kg/hour * 10 hours = 150 kg/day

Now, we need to divide the total weight of the bull's meat (750 kg) by the amount of meat Prince sells in a day (150 kg):

750 kg / 150 kg/day = 5 days

Therefore, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull.

"To find the number of students, we first need to find the total number of seats occupied by the administrators, parents, and students.

Total number of seats in the auditorium = 4 rows * 18 seats/row = 72 seats

One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators. 
Number of seats occupied by administrators = 1/4 * 72 = 18 seats

Remaining seats = Total seats - Seats occupied by administrators = 72 - 18 = 54 seats

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents.
Number of seats occupied by parents = 1/3 * 54 = 18 seats

Remaining seats (occupied by students) = 54 - 18 = 36 seats

Therefore, the number of students in the school auditorium = 36 seats.

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to first convert her speed from kb/s to Mb/s and then multiply it by the number of seconds in an hour.

1 Mb = 1000 kb
Ashley's speed in kb/s = 20 kb/s

To convert kb/s to Mb/s, we divide by 1000:
Ashley's speed in Mb/s = 20 kb/s / 1000 = 0.02 Mb/s

There are 3600 seconds in an hour. To find Ashley's speed in Mb/h, we multiply her speed in Mb/s by the number of seconds in an hour:

"To find out how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to calculate the difference between the required height (4 feet) and Adam's current height (40 inches), and then divide that by his annual growth rate (2 inches).

First, let's convert the required height from feet to inches: 1 foot = 12 inches, so 4 feet = 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Now, let's calculate the difference between the required height and Adam's current height: 48 inches - 40 inches = 8 inches.

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we can divide the difference by his growth rate to find out how many years it will take for him to reach the required height: 8 inches / 2 inches/year = 4 years.

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To find out how much James made, we need to calculate the profit from selling the cars, then apply his commission to that profit.

First, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the cars:
10 cars * $25,000 each = $250,000

Next, we need to find out how much the company paid to acquire the cars:
30% of $25,000 = 0.3 * $25,000 = $7,500 per car
Total cost to acquire the cars = 10 cars * $7,500 = $75,000

Now, let's calculate the total profit:
Profit = Total revenue - Total cost to acquire the cars
Profit = $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000

James gets a 10% commission on the profit:
Commission = 10% of $175,000
Commission = 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500

Therefore, James made $17,500."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that 25% of the 100 riders can stay upright on the wave. This means 0.25 * 100 = 25 riders can stay upright.

Next, we are told that 60% of these 25 riders are women. To find the number of women, we multiply 25 by 0.6, which gives us 15 women.

Since there are 25 riders in total who can stay upright, and 15 of them are women, the remaining riders who can stay upright are men. So, the number of men who can stay upright is 25 - 15 = 10.

"To find the total price for all three jewels, we need to first find the prices of the gold and silver jewels.

Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, and the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond jewel, we can calculate the price of the gold jewel as follows:

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * Price of diamond jewel
= (4/5) * $2000
= $1600

The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold, so we can calculate the price of the silver jewel as follows:

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
= $1600 - $400
= $1200

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of truck and rose stamps Max bought. 

Let's start with the snowflake stamps. Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.

Since Max bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, the number of truck stamps is 16 + 3 = 19.

Now, we know that Max bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. So, the number of rose stamps is 19 - 9 = 10.

To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we add the number of snowflake, truck, and rose stamps: 16 + 19 + 10 = 45.

The final answer is: 45"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the relative speed between Bob and Tom. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract Tom's speed from Bob's speed to get the relative speed.

Relative speed = Bob's speed - Tom's speed
Relative speed = 55 mph - 70 mph
Relative speed = -15 mph

However, since we are dealing with a time problem, we need to consider the absolute value of the relative speed, which is the actual speed at which Tom is closing the gap.

Absolute relative speed = 15 mph

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed

The distance Tom needs to cover to catch up with Bob is the initial distance between them, which is 75 miles.

Time = Distance / Absolute relative speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

Darren's catch = Naomi's catch - 6
Darren's catch = 17 - 6
Darren's catch = 11

Now that we know Darren caught 11 fish, we can calculate Tommy's catch by adding 3 to Darren's total.

Tommy's catch = Darren's catch + 3
Tommy's catch = 11 + 3
Tommy's catch = 14

"To find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to determine the maximum number of classes he can attend without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Let's denote the number of classes Manny can miss as 'x'. Since there are 10 total classes, the number of classes he will attend is 10 - x.

The total cost of the classes is $60. If each class costs $10, then the total cost of the classes he attends is 10 * (10 - x).

The cost of the classes he misses is x * $10 (assuming each class costs $10).

Since the total cost is $60, we can set up the equation:

10 * (10 - x) + 10x = 60

Simplifying the equation:

100 - 10x + 10x = 60
100 = 60

However, this equation doesn't make sense because it simplifies to a statement that is always true, regardless of the value of x. This is because the equation is based on the total cost being $60, which is the cost of all 10 classes. 

To find the number of classes Manny can miss, we need to consider the cost of the classes he attends. If he attends 9 classes, the cost will be 9 * $10 = $90, which is more than $60. Therefore, he can attend at most 8 classes.

The number of classes Manny can miss is 10 - 8 = 2.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Let's denote the distance Lynn ran as 'x' miles.
2. Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, so Reggie's distance is x + 3 miles.
3. Reggie also ran 5 times what Paisley ran, and Paisley ran 4 miles. So, Reggie's distance is also 5 * 4 = 20 miles.
4. Since Reggie's distance is x + 3 miles and also 20 miles, we can set up the equation: x + 3 = 20.
5. To solve for x, we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation: x = 20 - 3.
6. Therefore, x = 17 miles.

"To find the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges, we need to first find the cost of one apple and one orange. 

The cost of 4 apples is $5.20, so the cost of one apple is $5.20 / 4 = $1.30. 

The cost of 3 oranges is $3.30, so the cost of one orange is $3.30 / 3 = $1.10.

Now, we can find the cost of 5 apples: 5 apples * $1.30/apple = $6.50.

Next, we can find the cost of 5 oranges: 5 oranges * $1.10/orange = $5.50.

Finally, we can find the total cost by adding the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges: $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add them to the base price.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade costs $7,500.

The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of the leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of the running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the features and the base price:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

"To find the age of Steve's son's wife, we need to determine the ages of Steve's son and his wife.

1. Steve is 60 years old, and his wife is 4 years older than him, so his wife's age is 60 + 4 = 64 years.

2. Their son is half as old as his mom, so his age is 64 / 2 = 32 years.

3. Steve's son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, so her age is 32 - 3 = 29 years.

The final answer is: 29"
"To find the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions, we need to first find the total amount of flour in one bag and then multiply it by 3.

Since the bag is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, the total amount of flour in one bag can be found by multiplying the number of portions by the weight of each portion:

8 portions * 2 kilograms/portion = 16 kilograms

Now, we multiply the total amount of flour in one bag by 3 to find the total amount in three bags:

16 kilograms/bag * 3 bags = 48 kilograms

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley, we need to calculate the distance each of them biked and then add them together.

Alisa biked at a speed of 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours. To find the distance she biked, we multiply her speed by the time:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 12 miles/hour x 4.5 hours
Distance = 54 miles

Stanley biked at a speed of 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours. To find the distance he biked, we multiply his speed by the time:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour x 2.5 hours
Distance = 25 miles

Now, we add the distances biked by Alisa and Stanley to find the total distance:

Total Distance = Distance biked by Alisa + Distance biked by Stanley
Total Distance = 54 miles + 25 miles
Total Distance = 79 miles

The final answer is: 79"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay separately, and then add them together.

Time to dig through soil: 
Bill can dig 4 feet/hour through soil. He needs to dig 24 feet of soil. 
Time = Distance / Rate = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours

Time to dig through clay: 
Bill can dig half as fast through clay, so his rate is 4 feet/hour / 2 = 2 feet/hour. He needs to dig 8 feet of clay. 
Time = Distance / Rate = 8 feet / 2 feet/hour = 4 hours

Total time = Time to dig through soil + Time to dig through clay = 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, Fishio received 2000 likes on her selfie. Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times as many as the initial number of likes. This means the number of likes after three weeks is 70 * 2000 = 140000.

Now, Fishio received 20000 more new likes recently. To find the total number of likes, we need to add the new likes to the previous total. 

Total likes = 140000 + 20000 = 160000.

The final answer is: 160000"
"To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost of the pomegranates on each day and then subtract the two amounts.

On the first day, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, but she got a $2 discount. So, the total cost for the first day is:

20 pomegranates * $20 = $400
Discount: $2
Total cost for the first day = $400 - $2 = $398

On the second day, the price of each pomegranate is $30, and there's a 10% discount on the total cost. So, the total cost for the second day is:

20 pomegranates * $30 = $600
Discount: 10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
Total cost for the second day = $600 - $60 = $540

Now, we can find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days:

Difference = Total cost for the second day - Total cost for the first day
= $540 - $398
= $142

The final answer is: $142"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find the total sales from green hats in the first month. Since the sales from red hats were half the total amount she earned from selling green hats, let's denote the total sales from green hats as G. Then, the sales from red hats, which is half of G, is G/2. We are given that G/2 = $400. 

To find G, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2, which gives us G = 2 * 400 = $800.

Now, we know that the total sales in the first month is the sum of the sales from red and green hats, which is G + G/2. Substituting the value of G, we get 800 + 400 = $1200.

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. So, the sales in the second month are (3/4) * 1200 = $900.

The total amount she made in two months is the sum of the sales in the first and second months, which is 1200 + 900 = $2100.

The final answer is: $2100"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the number of paid hours and the total cost for those hours.

James hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. However, he gets 1 hour free, so he only pays for 3 hours.

The first paid hour costs $15. Each subsequent hour costs twice the previous hour, so the second hour costs $15 * 2 = $30, and the third hour costs $30 * 2 = $60.

The total cost is the sum of the costs of the three paid hours: $15 + $30 + $60 = $105.

The final numerical answer is: $105"
"To find out how much was withheld from Sally's wage, we need to determine the total amount she should have received if she earned her full wage. Since her bank account now holds $420 and it initially held $200, the amount she earned this week is $420 - $200 = $220.

However, her weekly wage should be $300. To find out how much was withheld, we subtract the amount she earned from her full wage: $300 - $220 = $80.

"To find out how many deviled egg halves Lori's guests will eat, we need to multiply the number of guests by the number of deviled egg halves each guest will eat. 

Number of guests: 16
Number of deviled egg halves per guest: 3

Total deviled egg halves: 16 * 3 = 48

Since Lori needs 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves, we need to find out how many deviled egg halves she needs to make in total. 

Total deviled egg halves needed: 48

Now, we need to divide the total deviled egg halves needed by 2 to find out how many whole eggs she needs.

Total deviled egg halves needed: 48
Eggs per 2 deviled egg halves: 1

Total eggs needed: 48 / 2 = 24

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens of eggs Lori needs.

Total eggs needed: 24
Eggs per dozen: 12

Total dozens of eggs needed: 24 / 12 = 2

"To find out how many pages Shiela has left to write, we need to determine the total number of pages she has already written and subtract that from the total required pages.

Since Shiela has finished writing 1/3 of the paper, we can calculate the number of pages she has written as follows:

1/3 of 15 pages = (1/3) * 15 = 5 pages

Now, we subtract the number of pages she has written from the total required pages:

15 pages (total) - 5 pages (written) = 10 pages

So, Shiela has 10 pages left to write.

"To find the total cost of the plane for the first year, we need to calculate the cost of the plane itself, the hanger rental, and the fuel costs.

The cost of the plane is $150,000.

The hanger rental is $5000 per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total hanger rental cost for the first year is $5000 * 12 = $60,000.

The fuel cost is twice the hanger rental, which is $5000 * 2 = $10,000 per month. The total fuel cost for the first year is $10,000 * 12 = $120,000.

The total cost of the plane for the first year is the sum of the cost of the plane, the hanger rental, and the fuel costs: $150,000 + $60,000 + $120,000 = $330,000.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the cooking time for pork and beans. 

Let's denote the cooking time for rice as R, pork as P, and beans as B. We are given that R = 30 minutes.

We are also given that P = R + 20, so P = 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

We are given that B = (P + R) / 2, so B = (50 + 30) / 2 = 40 minutes.

Now, we need to find the total cooking time, which is the sum of the cooking times for rice, pork, and beans. 

Total cooking time = R + P + B = 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes.

"Let's denote the number of sheep as S and the number of geese as G. Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, we can set up the following equation based on the total number of legs:

4S + 2G = 70

We are also given that the total number of animal heads is 20. Since each sheep and goose has one head, we can set up another equation:

S + G = 20

We can solve this system of equations by multiplying the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of G in both equations the same:

2S + 2G = 40

Now, we can subtract this equation from the first equation to eliminate G:

(4S + 2G) - (2S + 2G) = 70 - 40
2S = 30

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

S = 15

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee and the cost of the donut. 

First, let's find the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more. 

20% of $5 is 0.2 * $5 = $1. 
So, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

Since Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day and he buys a week's worth, he buys 7 pounds of coffee. 

The cost of the more expensive coffee is 7 * $6 = $42. 
The cost of the donut is $2.

The total cost is $42 + $2 = $44.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the amount of money Kassidy and Rayna have. 

First, we know Aurelia has $120. Since Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, we can calculate Kassidy's amount by multiplying Aurelia's amount by 3/4.

Kassidy's money = 3/4 * 120 = 90 dollars

Now, we know Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy. So, we can calculate Rayna's amount by adding 60 to Kassidy's amount.

Rayna's money = 90 + 60 = 150 dollars

Now that we have the amounts for all three, we can add them together and divide by 3 to find the total amount they would have if they shared it equally.

Total money = 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 dollars

Now, we divide the total money by 3 to find the amount each would have.

Let's represent the number of books Sally has as 'x'. We can then write an equation based on the given information:

Janey's books = 2 * Sally's books + 3
21 = 2x + 3

Now, we need to solve for 'x'. To do this, we'll first subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

21 - 3 = 2x + 3 - 3
18 = 2x

Next, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 2 to isolate 'x':

18 / 2 = 2x / 2
9 = x

So, Sally has 9 books.

"To find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches, we need to first convert the initial height from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so we multiply 20 feet by 12 inches per foot.

20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now, we know the bamboo grows 30 inches per day and its current height is 240 inches. To find out how many days it will take to reach 600 inches, we subtract the current height from the target height and divide by the growth rate.

600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Now, we divide the remaining height by the growth rate:

360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs. This means each dog has 1 toy. When 8 more dogs arrive, James needs 8 more toys to bring the total to 12 dogs with 1 toy each. So, he buys 8 more toys.

Now, there are 12 dogs, and James goes back to find that there are twice as many more dogs, which means there are 2 * 8 = 16 more dogs. Since each dog needs 1 toy, James needs 16 more toys.

However, when James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs those toys. This means he needs 16 - 3 = 13 more toys.

Initially, James had 4 toys. He bought 8 more toys, then 16 more toys, and finally 13 more toys. So, the total number of toys James needs is 4 + 8 + 16 + 13 = 41.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of cookies Max and Summer have. 

Since Katarina has 68 cookies and she has 5 less than Max, Max must have 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.

Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, but we don't know how many cookies the Cookie Monster has. However, we can express the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has as x. Then, Max has x + 12 cookies.

Since we already know Max has 73 cookies, we can set up the equation x + 12 = 73. Solving for x, we get x = 73 - 12 = 61. So, the Cookie Monster has 61 cookies.

Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, and we know Max has 73 cookies. Therefore, Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Now, we can find the total number of cookies by adding the number of cookies Katarina, Max, and Summer have: 68 + 73 + 96 = 237.

"To find the original length of the dress, we need to consider the two changes made to the dress: the extension by 50% and the addition of 20cm.

Let's denote the original length of the dress as 'x'. When Shania extends the dress by 50%, the new length becomes x + 0.5x = 1.5x.

Then, she adds 20cm to the bottom of the dress, making the final length 1.5x + 20.

We are given that the final design is 140cm long, so we can set up the equation:

1.5x + 20 = 140

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. First, subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

1.5x = 140 - 20
1.5x = 120

Next, divide both sides by 1.5:

x = 120 / 1.5
x = 80

The original length of the dress was 80cm.

"To find the total number of cookies, we first need to determine how many cookies each person bakes. Greta bakes 30 cookies, and Celinda bakes twice as many, so Celinda bakes 2 * 30 = 60 cookies. 

The total number of cookies is the sum of the cookies baked by Greta and Celinda, which is 30 + 60 = 90 cookies.

After eating 10 cookies, the number of cookies left is 90 - 10 = 80 cookies.

The final answer is: 80"
"Let's denote the age of the younger twin as T, the age of the older twin as T+7, and the age of the triplet as t. 

Since there are two twins and one triplet, the total age can be represented as 2T + t = 44.

We also know that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so we can express the age of the older twin as t + 7.

Now we have two equations:

1) 2T + t = 44
2) T = t + 7

We can substitute the second equation into the first one to solve for t:

2(t + 7) + t = 44
2t + 14 + t = 44
3t + 14 = 44

Subtract 14 from both sides:
3t = 30

Divide both sides by 3:
t = 10

Now that we know the age of the triplet, we can find the age of the older twin:
T = t + 7
T = 10 + 7
T = 17

The final answer is: 17"
"To find out how many minutes John has to nap, we need to calculate the total time he spends on homework and subtract that from the total time available before dinner.

Now, let's calculate the total time John spends on homework: 
- Math homework: 20 minutes
- Reading homework: 40 minutes
- History homework: 20 minutes
Total homework time: 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes

Now, let's subtract the total homework time from the total time available before dinner: 
180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes

John has 100 minutes to nap."
"To find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we first need to find the cost of one candy. 

We know that Manolo bought 5 lollipops and 4 candies for $3.20. The cost of 5 lollipops is 5 * $0.40 = $2. 

Now, we subtract the cost of 5 lollipops from the total cost to find the cost of 4 candies: $3.20 - $2 = $1.20. 

The cost of one candy is $1.20 / 4 = $0.30.

Now, we can find the total cost of 10 lollipops: 10 * $0.40 = $4.

The total cost of 10 candies is 10 * $0.30 = $3.

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $4 + $3 = $7.

The final answer is: $7"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many coins Rong and Neil save per month. Rong saves 20 coins per month. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, which is 2/5 * 20 = 8 coins more than Rong. So, Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Now, let's calculate the total number of coins they save in a year. Rong saves 20 * 12 = 240 coins per year. Neil saves 28 * 12 = 336 coins per year.

Since they started saving 10 years ago, we need to multiply the number of coins they save per year by 10. Rong has saved 240 * 10 = 2400 coins in 10 years. Neil has saved 336 * 10 = 3360 coins in 10 years.

The total number of coins they have is the sum of the coins saved by Rong and Neil, which is 2400 + 3360 = 5760.

The final answer is: 5760"
"To find the total bill, we first need to calculate the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check. The cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40. 

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, which means the remaining 40% is the cost of the vaccines. Let's represent the total bill as 'x'. Then, 40% of 'x' is $40. We can set up the equation: 0.4x = 40.

To find 'x', we divide both sides by 0.4: x = 40 / 0.4 = 100. 

So, the total bill is $100. The heartworm check is 60% of $100, which is 0.6 * 100 = $60. 

The total cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check is $40 + $60 = $100. 

John brought $125 with him, so he leaves with $125 - $100 = $25.

The final answer is: $25"
"To find the price of the crate, we need to calculate the total cost of the individual fruits and then add them together.

First, let's find the cost of one banana. Since one banana costs twice as much as an apple, and one apple costs $0.5, the cost of one banana is 2 * $0.5 = $1.

Next, we find the cost of one orange. Since one orange costs three times as much as a banana, and one banana costs $1, the cost of one orange is 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the crate. The crate contains 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges. 

The cost of 5 bananas is 5 * $1 = $5.
The cost of 12 apples is 12 * $0.5 = $6.
The cost of 7 oranges is 7 * $3 = $21.

The total cost of the crate is $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

The final answer is: $32"
"To find the total number of square feet in Brittany's comforter, we need to calculate the total number of squares and multiply it by the area of each square (1 foot * 1 foot).

First, let's find the number of blue squares. Since there are 4 more blue squares than red squares, and there are 14 red squares, the number of blue squares is 14 + 4 = 18.

Next, let's find the number of green squares. Since there are 6 more green squares than blue squares, and there are 18 blue squares, the number of green squares is 18 + 6 = 24.

Now, let's find the number of white squares. Since there are 12 fewer white squares than green squares, and there are 24 green squares, the number of white squares is 24 - 12 = 12.

Now, let's add up the total number of squares: 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68.

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 * 1 * 1 = 68 square feet.

The final answer is: 68"
"To find out how many chairs Mia needs, we first need to determine the total number of chairs she has. Since there are 8 high chairs and the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs, we can calculate the number of regular chairs by multiplying 8 by 5.

8 high chairs * 5 = 40 regular chairs

Now, we add the number of high chairs and regular chairs to find the total number of chairs.

8 high chairs + 40 regular chairs = 48 chairs

Since there will be 42 adults and 15 babies attending, we need to find the total number of chairs required. Babies will use high chairs, so we add the number of adults and babies.

42 adults + 15 babies = 57 people

Since each person needs a chair, we need 57 chairs in total. To find out how many more chairs Mia needs, we subtract the number of chairs she has from the total number of chairs required.

57 total chairs - 48 available chairs = 9 more chairs

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the number of 8-point bucks, we first need to find the total number of bucks in the field. Since 50% of the deer are bucks, we can calculate this as follows:

Total deer = 50
Percentage of bucks = 50%
Number of bucks = Total deer * Percentage of bucks
= 50 * 0.5
= 25

Next, we need to find the number of 8-point bucks. Since 20% of the bucks are 8-point, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of 8-point bucks = Number of bucks * Percentage of 8-point bucks
= 25 * 0.2
= 5

Therefore, there are 5 8-point bucks in the field.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the total points collected by Adam, Betty, Martha, and Tom, and then subtract this total from the minimum threshold of 400 points.

First, let's find Betty's points. Since Betty collected 30% more points than Adam, we can calculate this as follows:

Betty's points = Adam's points + (30% of Adam's points)
Betty's points = 50 + (0.3 * 50)
Betty's points = 50 + 15
Betty's points = 65

Next, we know that Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so we can calculate Tom's points as follows:

Tom's points = Betty's points - 30
Tom's points = 65 - 30
Tom's points = 35

We also know that Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom, so we can calculate Martha's points as follows:

Martha's points = 3 * Tom's points
Martha's points = 3 * 35
Martha's points = 105

Now, we can find the total points collected by the class:

Total points = Adam's points + Betty's points + Martha's points + Tom's points
Total points = 50 + 65 + 105 + 35
Total points = 255

Finally, we can find the points the class is missing to go on the trip by subtracting the total points from the minimum threshold:

Points missing = Minimum threshold - Total points
Points missing = 400 - 255
Points missing = 145

The final answer is: 145"

"To find the number of pairs of pencils in the box, we first need to determine the total number of pencils in the box. Since there are 4 pencils missing, we subtract 4 from the total capacity of the box, which is 20.

Total pencils in the box = 20 - 4 = 16

Now, to find the number of pairs of pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by 2, since a pair consists of 2 pencils.

Number of pairs = Total pencils in the box / 2

"To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we first need to calculate the total number of fireworks set off in the city and then find 40% of that number. 

The city is setting off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks set off in the city is 15 * 20 = 300.

40% of 300 is 0.4 * 300 = 120.

Hannah will also set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each in her backyard, which is 3 * 5 = 15 fireworks.

So, the total number of fireworks Hannah will see is 120 (from the city) + 15 (from her backyard) = 135.

"To find the total amount spent on snacks and drinks, we first need to determine the total number of people and the total number of items (drinks and snacks) they buy.

Aiden and his 12 friends make 13 people. When they meet up with 7 more friends, the total number of people becomes 13 + 7 = 20.

Each person buys enough drinks and snacks to fill the seats, which means each person buys 2 drinks and 3 snacks. So, the total number of drinks and snacks bought is 20 * 2 (drinks) + 20 * 3 (snacks) = 40 drinks + 60 snacks = 100 items.

Since each item costs $2, the total amount spent on snacks and drinks is 100 items * $2 = $200.

The final answer is: $200"
"To find out how many pounds of gravel Gary's truck can carry, we need to first determine the capacity of Gordy's truck. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, and Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds, Gordy's truck can haul 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.

Now, we know that the combined capacity of all three trucks is 11,600 pounds. We already know that Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds and Gordy's truck can haul 4,800 pounds. To find out how much Gary's truck can haul, we subtract the combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity of all three trucks.

Gary's truck capacity = Total capacity - (Gissela's capacity + Gordy's capacity)
Gary's truck capacity = 11,600 - (4,000 + 4,800)
Gary's truck capacity = 11,600 - 8,800
Gary's truck capacity = 2,800

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of dumplings each male ate. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, and each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

There are 8 males in the group, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32.

There are 6 females in the group, and each female ate 3 dumplings, so the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.

The total number of dumplings eaten by the group is 32 (males) + 18 (females) = 50.

Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is equal to the total number of dumplings eaten by the group, which is 50.

"To find out how much money Gerald had initially, we need to determine the total parts in the ratio and Gerald's share. The ratio is 3:2, so the total parts are 3 + 2 = 5.

Gerald's share is 3 out of 5 parts, so we can find his initial amount by multiplying the total amount ($100) by his share (3/5).

Gerald's initial amount = (3/5) * $100 = $60

Since Gerald spent $10 on a book, we need to subtract this from his initial amount to find out how much he has left.

Gerald's remaining amount = $60 - $10 = $50

"To find the speed of the turtle, we need to divide the speed of the cat by 5, since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle. 

Speed of the cat = 15 feet/second
Speed of the turtle = Speed of the cat / 5
Speed of the turtle = 15 / 5
Speed of the turtle = 3 feet/second

Now, we can find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds by multiplying its speed by the time.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 3 feet/second * 40 seconds
Distance = 120 feet

"To find the total number of hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we need to first determine the amount they need to raise per hour to reach their goal. 

The total amount they need to raise is $6300, and they have already raised $2100 in 3 hours. 

The amount they need to raise in total is $6300 - $2100 = $4200.

Since they have already raised $2100 in 3 hours, the amount they need to raise per hour is $2100 / 3 = $700.

To find the total number of hours they need to fundraise, we can divide the remaining amount they need to raise ($4200) by the amount they need to raise per hour ($700).

$4200 / $700 = 6 hours.

They have already fundraised for 3 hours, so the total number of hours they need to fundraise is 6 + 3 = 9 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the rate at which the factory makes chocolate and vanilla ice cream per hour.

For chocolate ice cream, the factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours. To find the rate per hour, we divide the total quarts by the number of hours:

100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts per hour (chocolate)

For vanilla ice cream, the factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours. To find the rate per hour, we divide the total quarts by the number of hours:

50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts per hour (vanilla)

Now, we need to find the total quarts made in 48 hours. We can multiply the rate per hour for each flavor by the total number of hours:

Chocolate: 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts
Vanilla: 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts

To find the total quarts made, we add the quarts of chocolate and vanilla ice cream:

First, let's calculate the total cost of each item:

- 5 croissants at $3.00 apiece: 5 x $3.00 = $15.00
- 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each: 4 x $2.50 = $10.00
- 3 mini quiches at $4.00 apiece: 3 x $4.00 = $12.00
- 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 apiece: 13 x $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
$15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Since Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him 10% off his purchase, we need to calculate the discount amount:
10% of $50.00 = 0.10 x $50.00 = $5.00

Total chairs initially = 170 + 23 = 193

Normal chairs sent for repair = 20
Baby chairs sent for repair = 13
Total chairs sent for repair = 20 + 13 = 33

Total chairs left = Total chairs initially - Total chairs sent for repair
Total chairs left = 193 - 33
Total chairs left = 160

The final answer is: 160"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of slices eaten by Bryce and his friends. 

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 5 people in total, including Bryce, and 2 of them ate 2/3 of their pizzas, we can consider them as a group. The total number of slices eaten by this group is 2/3 * 5 * 12 = 40 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 friends, the total number of slices eaten by them is 3/4 * 2 * 12 = 9 slices.

Now, we add the slices eaten by both groups: 40 + 9 = 49 slices.

Since there were a total of 5 * 12 = 60 slices, we subtract the slices eaten from the total to find the number of slices left: 60 - 49 = 11 slices.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the average time the cat and dog take to eat the sausages, we first need to determine the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages. 

The cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes. Since the dog eats the same number of sausages in 2/3 the amount of time the cat takes, we can calculate the dog's time as follows:

Dog's time = (2/3) * Cat's time
Dog's time = (2/3) * 30 minutes
Dog's time = 20 minutes

Now, we have the time taken by both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages: 
Cat's time = 30 minutes
Dog's time = 20 minutes

To find the average time, we add the times taken by both the cat and the dog and divide by 2:

Average time = (Cat's time + Dog's time) / 2
Average time = (30 + 20) / 2
Average time = 50 / 2
Average time = 25 minutes

The final answer is: 25"
"To solve this problem, we need to first convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so we multiply 8 feet by 12 and add 4 inches.

8 feet * 12 inches/foot = 96 inches
Adding 4 inches to this gives us a total of 100 inches for the length of one of Topher's shoes.

Now, we are told that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. We can represent this as an equation:

Length of Topher's shoe = 9 * Length of Bobby's shoe + 10

Substituting the value of the length of Topher's shoe, we get:

100 = 9 * Length of Bobby's shoe + 10

Now, we can solve for the length of Bobby's shoe by subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation:

100 - 10 = 9 * Length of Bobby's shoe
90 = 9 * Length of Bobby's shoe

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 9 to isolate the length of Bobby's shoe:

90 / 9 = Length of Bobby's shoe
10 = Length of Bobby's shoe

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of windows smashed by Hannah, we need to calculate the number of windows from students' cars and teachers' cars separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of windows from students' cars. There are 64 students' cars with 4 windows each. So, the total number of windows from students' cars is 64 * 4 = 256.

Next, let's find the number of windows from teachers' cars. There are 32 teachers' cars with 2 windows each. Since Hannah smashed 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows, we need to calculate 3/4 * 32 * 2. 

3/4 * 32 * 2 = (3/4) * 64 = 48

Now, we add the number of windows from students' cars and teachers' cars to get the total number of windows smashed by Hannah.

256 + 48 = 304

"To find the total number of blue spools, we need to add the number of light blue and dark blue spools. 

Total blue spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60

Next, we need to find the total number of spools. 

Total spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 150

Now, we can find the percentage of blue spools by dividing the total number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of blue spools = (60 / 150) * 100 = 40%

The final answer is: 40"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, 5000 people were in line at 8:00. By midday, 2/5 of them had voted. 

2/5 of 5000 is (2/5) * 5000 = 2000 people who voted by midday.

So, the number of people remaining by midday is 5000 - 2000 = 3000.

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. 

2/3 of 3000 is (2/3) * 3000 = 2000 people who voted by 16:00.

The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is the remaining people minus those who voted by 16:00, which is 3000 - 2000 = 1000.

The final answer is: 1000"
"To find out how many packs of gum Parker will need, we need to calculate the total number of pieces of gum he will chew in 30 days and then divide that by the number of pieces in a pack.

Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day. To find the total number of pieces he will chew in 30 days, we multiply the number of pieces he chews per day by 30:

4 pieces/day * 30 days = 120 pieces

Now, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces in a pack to find out how many packs he will need:

120 pieces / 15 pieces/pack = 8 packs

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the number of boxes of graham crackers needed, we first need to calculate the total number of s'mores required. 

9 kids want 2 s'mores each, so the total number of s'mores for kids is 9 * 2 = 18. 
6 adults will eat 1 s'more each, so the total number of s'mores for adults is 6 * 1 = 6. 
The total number of s'mores needed is 18 (for kids) + 6 (for adults) = 24.

Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 large s'mores, we need to divide the total number of s'mores by 8 to find out how many sleeves are needed. 
24 s'mores / 8 s'mores per sleeve = 3 sleeves.

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we need to divide the total number of sleeves needed by 3 to find out how many boxes are required. 
3 sleeves / 3 sleeves per box = 1 box.

Therefore, they will need 1 box of graham crackers.

The final answer is: 1"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the ages of Dora's father and mother.

Given that Dora is 15 years old, we can find her father's age by using the information that her father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. 

Let's denote Dora's father's age as F and Dora's age as D. We have the equation: F = 2D + 8. Substituting D = 15 into the equation, we get F = 2(15) + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38.

Now, we know that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. Let's denote Dora's mother's age as M. We have the equation: M = F - 4. Substituting F = 38 into the equation, we get M = 38 - 4 = 34.

Now that we have the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother, we can find the total combined age by adding their ages together: D + F + M = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87.

The final answer is: 87"
"To find out how much money each of Greg's siblings got, we need to divide the total amount of money ($20) by the number of siblings (3).

"To find the number of votes candidate C received, we first need to determine the number of votes candidate B received. 

Candidate A received 20% of the votes, which is 0.2 * 100 = 20 votes.

Candidate B received 50% more than candidate A's votes, so the number of votes candidate B received is 20 + (50% of 20) = 20 + (0.5 * 20) = 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

The total number of votes is 100, and the sum of votes for candidates A and B is 20 + 30 = 50. 

Therefore, the number of votes candidate C received is 100 - 50 = 50.

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many apples Beck has initially. Since Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, and Boris has 100 apples, we can calculate Beck's initial number of apples as follows:

Beck's initial apples = Boris's apples - 23
Beck's initial apples = 100 - 23
Beck's initial apples = 77

Now, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. So, Beck's new number of apples is:

Beck's new apples = Beck's initial apples + 10
Beck's new apples = 77 + 10
Beck's new apples = 87

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris. Boris still has 100 apples, and Beck has 87 apples. So, the difference is:

Difference = Boris's apples - Beck's new apples
Difference = 100 - 87
Difference = 13

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many books Steven has, and then compare Clara's and Alice's book counts.

Since Clara has two times as many books as Steven, and Clara has 20 books, we can set up the equation:

2 * Steven's books = 20

To find Steven's books, we divide both sides by 2:

Steven's books = 20 / 2
Steven's books = 10

Now that we know Steven has 10 books, we can find out how many books Alice has. Alice has 6 more books than Steven, so:

Alice's books = Steven's books + 6
Alice's books = 10 + 6
Alice's books = 16

Now that we know both Clara and Alice's book counts, we can find out how many more books Clara has than Alice:

Difference = Clara's books - Alice's books
Difference = 20 - 16
Difference = 4

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the cost of a half-gallon jar. Since a gallon jar costs $5 and it is $2 more than a half-gallon jar, we can set up the following equation:

Gallon jar = Half-gallon jar + $2
5 = Half-gallon jar + 2
Half-gallon jar = 5 - 2
Half-gallon jar = 3

Now that we know the cost of a half-gallon jar, we can calculate the total cost of 16 half-gallon jars:
16 * 3 = 48

Next, we need to find the cost of a 10-gallon jar. Since a gallon jar costs $5, a 10-gallon jar will cost 10 times the cost of a gallon jar:
10 * 5 = 50

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money Cecelia spent on 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars:
Total cost = Cost of 10-gallon jars + Cost of 16 half-gallon jars
Total cost = 50 + 48
Total cost = 98

"Let's break down the information given:

- Total students = 50
- Students who like to bake = 10
- Students who like to play basketball = 5
- Students who like to play music = 2 * (students who like to play basketball) = 2 * 5 = 10

We know that the rest of the students like to either play video games or play music. So, the number of students who like to play video games or music is the total number of students minus the students who like to bake and basketball.

Students who like to play video games or music = Total students - Students who like to bake - Students who like to play basketball
= 50 - 10 - 5
= 35

Since we know that the number of students who like to play music is 10, the number of students who like to play video games is the total number of students who like to play video games or music minus the number of students who like to play music.

Students who like to play video games = Students who like to play video games or music - Students who like to play music

"To find the number of boys in each class, we first need to determine the total number of girls in both classes. Since 40% of the students in each class are girls, and there are 80 students in total, we can set up an equation to find the number of students in each class.

Let x be the number of students in each class. Then, 2x = 80 (since there are two classes with the same number of students).

Solving for x, we get x = 80 / 2 = 40.

Now that we know there are 40 students in each class, we can find the number of girls in each class. 40% of 40 is 0.4 * 40 = 16 girls in each class.

Since there are 40 students in each class and 16 are girls, the number of boys in each class is 40 - 16 = 24.

"To find the total profit Mark made, we need to calculate the total cost of the packs and the total value of the cards he obtained.

The total cost of the packs is 3 packs * $1800 per pack = $5400.

The total value of the cards he obtained is $4000 + $1000 + (30 cards * $50 per card) = $4000 + $1000 + $1500 = $6500.

The total value of the cards is greater than the total cost of the packs, so Mark made a profit. To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total value: $6500 - $5400 = $1100.

"To find out how much money the tomato vendor saves a week, we need to first calculate the daily savings and then multiply it by 7.

The vendor used to buy 500 tomatoes a day at $.5 each, so his daily cost was 500 * $.5 = $250.

With the new vendor, he buys the same 500 tomatoes at $.4 each, so his new daily cost is 500 * $.4 = $200.

The daily savings is the difference between the old cost and the new cost: $250 - $200 = $50.

To find the weekly savings, we multiply the daily savings by 7: $50 * 7 = $350.

Cal's marbles = 2 * 56
Cal's marbles = 112

Now, we know that Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. 

Carl's marbles = 4 * Sean's marbles
Carl's marbles = 4 * 56
Carl's marbles = 224

Now that we know how many marbles Carl and Cal have, we can find out how many marbles they have combined by adding their marbles together.

54 students / 6 groups = 9 students per group

However, the problem states that the activity requires 12 groups. To find the total number of students needed for 12 groups, we can multiply the number of students per group by the number of groups.

9 students per group * 12 groups = 108 students

Since there are only 54 students, we need to find out how many more students are required to form 12 groups. 

108 students (required) - 54 students (available) = 54 students

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, Lorraine has 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

1. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
   90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
   Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons from trading small stickers.

2. She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
   50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
   Since each large sticker is worth one large button, she gets 20 large buttons from trading large stickers.

3. She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. 
   She had 40 large stickers initially and traded 20 for large buttons, so she has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.
   Since each large sticker is worth three small stickers, she can trade 20 large stickers for 20 * 3 = 60 small stickers.
   Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 60 small buttons from trading large stickers.

Now, let's calculate the total number of buttons she has:
- Small buttons: 27 (from small stickers) + 60 (from large stickers) = 87 small buttons
- Large buttons: 20 (from large stickers)

Total buttons = 87 (small buttons) + 20 (large buttons) = 107 buttons

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as x. Since the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, the number of votes in favor can be represented as 2x.

We know that the total number of council members is 33. Since each member has one vote, the sum of votes in favor and against the new regulation should equal 33.

We can set up the equation: x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms: 3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3: x = 11

Now that we know the number of votes against the new regulation (x = 11), we can find the number of votes in favor by multiplying x by 2: 2x = 2 * 11 = 22

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given. We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. 

Let's denote the total number of Pomeranians as P. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we can set up the equation:

1/3 * P = 6

To solve for P, we can multiply both sides by 3:

P = 6 * 3
P = 18

So, there are 18 Pomeranians. Now, we know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Let's denote the total number of puppies as J. We can set up the equation:

2/3 * J = 18

To solve for J, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

J = 18 * (3/2)
J = 27

"To find out how much more Jayden needs to buy the camera, we first need to calculate how much money he has after receiving the money from his sister. 

Jayden initially had $70. His sister gave him half of her $90 allowance, which is $45. 

So, Jayden now has $70 + $45 = $115.

The camera costs $200. To find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the amount he has from the cost of the camera: $200 - $115 = $85.

Therefore, Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera.

The final answer is: $85"
"To solve this problem, we can start by assigning variables to the number of cases of shingles each house needs. Let's say the second house needs x cases of shingles. Since the first house needs 1/2 of what the second house needs, the first house needs x/2 cases of shingles. The third house needs double the first house, so it needs 2 * (x/2) = x cases of shingles.

We know that the total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. We can write an equation to represent this:

x + x/2 + x = 250

To simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + x + 2x = 500

Combine like terms:

5x = 500

Now, divide both sides by 5:

x = 100

Since the third house needs x cases of shingles, and we found that x = 100, the third house needs 100 cases of shingles.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of each person's purchase and then add them together.

Leila buys 3 cucumbers at $2 each, so her total cost is 3 * $2 = $6.

Jack buys 5 tomatoes at $1 each, so his total cost is 5 * $1 = $5.

Chase buys 1 head of lettuce at $3, so his total cost is $3.

Now, we add the costs together: $6 (Leila) + $5 (Jack) + $3 (Chase) = $14.

"To find the number of pears George has, we need to calculate 45% of the number of bananas and add it to the number of bananas. 

First, let's find 45% of 200 bananas:
45% of 200 = 0.45 * 200 = 90

Now, let's add 90 to the number of bananas:
200 + 90 = 290

Since George has 45% more pears than bananas, the number of pears is 290.

To find the total number of fruits, we need to add the number of bananas and pears:
200 (bananas) + 290 (pears) = 490

The final answer is: 490"
"To find out how many candy bars Marissa bought for Jimmy, we need to subtract the cost of the ball from the amount of money Marissa had initially. 

Marissa had $80 initially and spent $20 on the ball. 

$80 (initial amount) - $20 (cost of the ball) = $60

Now, we need to find out how many candy bars Marissa can buy with $60, given that each candy bar costs $5.

$60 (remaining amount) / $5 (cost of each candy bar) = 12

So, Marissa bought 12 candy bars for Jimmy.

12"
"To find out how much money Sam needs to spend to make 4 liters of juice, we first need to determine how many kilograms of oranges are required to make 4 liters of juice. Since Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges to make 1 liter of juice, we can multiply this by 4 to find the total amount of oranges needed for 4 liters.

5 kilograms/orange * 4 liters/orange = 20 kilograms/orange

Now, we know that each kilogram of oranges costs $3. To find the total cost, we multiply the total amount of oranges needed by the cost per kilogram.

20 kilograms/orange * $3/kilogram = $60

Therefore, Sam would have to spend $60 to make 4 liters of juice.

The final answer is: $60"
"To find out how many books Ahmed read, we need to divide the number of books Ezra read by 2, since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed. 

Ezra read 300 books, so Ahmed read 300 / 2 = 150 books.

Now, we need to add the number of books Ezra decided to read to the number of books he has already read. Ezra decided to read 150 more books, so the total number of books Ezra will read is 300 + 150 = 450.

To find the total number of books they have read altogether, we need to add the number of books Ezra will read to the number of books Ahmed read. 

Total books read = 450 (Ezra) + 150 (Ahmed) = 600.

The final answer is: 600"
"To find Tanya's total earnings, we need to calculate her earnings from the hourly wage and the daily bonus.

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Since she earns $15 per hour, her total earnings from the hourly wage for Monday are 5 hours * $15/hour = $75.

Additionally, she teaches more than 3 classes on Monday, so she earns a daily bonus of $5. Therefore, her total earnings for Monday are $75 (hourly wage) + $5 (daily bonus) = $80.

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Her total earnings from the hourly wage for Wednesday are 2 hours * $15/hour = $30.

Since she teaches less than 3 classes on Wednesday, she does not earn a daily bonus.

Tanya's total earnings for the two days are $80 (Monday) + $30 (Wednesday) = $110.

The final answer is: $110"
"To find the difference in the number of vanilla scents sold compared to the fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of each type of scent sold.

The company sold 5 vanilla scents and there are 4 vanilla scents available, so the total number of vanilla scents sold is 5 * 4 = 20.

The company sold 2 fruity scents and there are 8 fruity scents available, so the total number of fruity scents sold is 2 * 8 = 16.

Now, we need to find the difference between the total number of vanilla scents sold and the total number of fruity scents sold. 

Difference = Total vanilla scents sold - Total fruity scents sold
Difference = 20 - 16
Difference = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total amount of money Bennet makes from selling the eggplants. 

The total amount from selling eggplants = Number of eggplants * Price per eggplant
Total amount from eggplants = 20 * $3
Total amount from eggplants = $60

Now, we know that Bennet wants to make a total of $135. Since he already made $60 from selling the eggplants, we need to find out how much he needs to make from selling the corn.

Total amount needed from corn = Total desired amount - Total amount from eggplants
Total amount needed from corn = $135 - $60
Total amount needed from corn = $75

Since Bennet has 25 ears of corn, we can find the price per ear of corn by dividing the total amount needed from corn by the number of ears of corn.

Price per ear of corn = Total amount needed from corn / Number of ears of corn
Price per ear of corn = $75 / 25
Price per ear of corn = $3

"To find the percentage of Tatiana's weekend spent playing soccer, we first need to determine the total time she has available and the time she spends on other activities.

Tatiana has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, for a total of 12 hours.

She reads for 3 hours, leaving 12 - 3 = 9 hours for soccer and video games.

She plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time, which is 1/3 * 9 = 3 hours.

This leaves 9 - 3 = 6 hours for soccer.

To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we divide the time spent playing soccer by the total time available and multiply by 100:

(6 / 12) * 100 = 50%

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how many pencils Anthony kept, we need to follow the steps of the problem.

Initially, Anthony had 50 pencils.

He gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon. To find out how many pencils he gave to Brandon, we multiply 50 by 1/2:
50 * 1/2 = 25 pencils given to Brandon.

Now, Anthony has 50 - 25 = 25 pencils left.

He then gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. To find out how many pencils he gave to Charlie, we multiply 25 by 3/5:
25 * 3/5 = 15 pencils given to Charlie.

Now, Anthony has 25 - 15 = 10 pencils left.

Therefore, Anthony kept 10 pencils.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time it takes for him to drive to the museum, the time he spends at the museum, and the time it takes for him to drive back home.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Jack to drive to the museum. Since the distance to the museum is 150 miles and he drives at 75 mph, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 150 miles / 75 mph
Time = 2 hours

Since the distance to the museum is the same as the distance back home, the time it takes for him to drive back home is also 2 hours.

Now, we add the time it takes to drive to the museum, the time he spends at the museum, and the time it takes to drive back home:

Total time = Time to drive to the museum + Time at the museum + Time to drive back home
Total time = 2 hours + 6 hours + 2 hours
Total time = 10 hours

"To find the total number of wheels needed for the toys, we need to calculate the number of wheels required for the cars and the motorcycles separately and then add them together.

For the cars, Henry needs 4 wheels for each of the 57 cars, so the total number of wheels needed for the cars is 57 * 4 = 228.

For the motorcycles, Henry needs 2 wheels for each of the 73 motorcycles, so the total number of wheels needed for the motorcycles is 73 * 2 = 146.

The total number of wheels needed for both the cars and the motorcycles is 228 + 146 = 374.

Since Henry has a box with 650 wheels in it, the number of wheels that will be left after assembling all the toys is 650 - 374 = 276.

The final answer is: 276"

So, you have to pay $800 after the 20% discount.

The final answer is: $800"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how many movies are in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of movies in series = Total movies / 3
= 600 / 3
= 200 movies

Now, let's find out how many movies are not in series. This will be the remaining movies after subtracting the movies in series from the total:

Remaining movies = Total movies - Movies in series
= 600 - 200
= 400 movies

Next, let's find out how many of the remaining movies are older movies. Since 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of older movies = 40% of 400
= 0.4 * 400
= 160 movies

Now, let's find out how many movies are normal movies. This will be the remaining movies after subtracting the older movies from the remaining movies:

Normal movies = Remaining movies - Older movies
= 400 - 160
= 240 movies

Now, let's calculate the cost of the movies in series. Since they cost $6 each, we can calculate this as follows:

Cost of movies in series = Number of movies in series * Cost per movie
= 200 * $6
= $1200

Next, let's calculate the cost of the older movies. Since they cost $5 each, we can calculate this as follows:

Cost of older movies = Number of older movies * Cost per movie
= 160 * $5
= $800

Finally, let's calculate the cost of the normal movies. Since they cost $10 each, we can calculate this as follows:

Cost of normal movies = Number of normal movies * Cost per movie
= 240 * $10
= $2400

Now, let's add up the costs of all the movies to find the total cost:

Total cost = Cost of movies in series + Cost of older movies + Cost of normal movies
= $1200 + $800 + $2400
= $4400

The final numerical answer is: $38.00"
"To find the distance to the vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance traveled by driving and hiking separately, and then add them together.

First, let's find the speed at which they hiked. They drove at an average of 50 miles per hour, and they hiked at an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Half of 50 is 25, and 5 miles per hour less than that is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

Now, let's calculate the distance traveled by driving. They drove for 6 hours at 50 miles per hour, so the distance traveled by driving is 6 * 50 = 300 miles.

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled by hiking. They hiked for 1.5 hours at 20 miles per hour, so the distance traveled by hiking is 1.5 * 20 = 30 miles.

The total distance to the vacation spot is the sum of the distance traveled by driving and hiking, which is 300 + 30 = 330 miles.

The final answer is: 330"
"To find the difference in their scores, we need to calculate the points each of them earns from enemies, berries, and the time left on the timer.

Let's assume Emma's score from enemies is x. Since Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, Ava's score from enemies will be x + 8.

Emma's score from berries is 3 (since she collects 3 berries), and Ava collects 3 + 3 = 6 berries.

Now, let's consider the time left on the timer. Let's assume Emma finishes the level in t seconds. Since Ava finishes 4 seconds slower, Ava's time will be t + 4.

The points for the time left on the timer are 30 points per second. So, Emma's points from the timer will be 30t, and Ava's points from the timer will be 30(t + 4).

The total score for Emma will be x + 3 + 30t, and the total score for Ava will be (x + 8) + 6 + 30(t + 4).

Now, we need to find the difference between their scores. The difference will be (x + 8 + 6 + 30t + 120) - (x + 3 + 30t).

Simplifying the expression, we get (x + 14 + 30t + 120) - (x + 3 + 30t) = x - x + 14 + 30t - 3 - 30t = 11.

So, the difference between their scores is 11.

"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we first need to determine the total cost of the two pizzas that are already known. Since two pizzas cost 30 dollars each, the total cost of these two pizzas is 2 * 30 = 60 dollars.

Now, we subtract the cost of these two pizzas from the total cost of all four pizzas to find the total cost of the other two pizzas. The total cost of all four pizzas is 64 dollars, so the total cost of the other two pizzas is 64 - 60 = 4 dollars.

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we can find the cost of each pizza by dividing the total cost of the other two pizzas by 2. The cost of each of the other two pizzas is 4 / 2 = 2 dollars.

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes on usual days and the two extra days.

On usual days, they ride their bikes 3 times a day for 5 days. So, the total number of times they ride on usual days is 3 * 5 = 15.

On the two extra days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, which is 2 * 3 = 6 times a day. Since there are two extra days, the total number of times they ride on these days is 6 * 2 = 12.

Now, we add the total number of times they ride on usual days and the two extra days to get the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week. 

Total number of times = 15 + 12 = 27.

"Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as 'w' and the number of orange fish Bob bought as 'o'. 

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After buying 'w' white fish and 'o' orange fish, he had a total of 3 + o + w orange fish and 4 + w white fish.

Since he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up the equation: 3 + o + w = 2(4 + w).

Simplifying the equation, we get 3 + o + w = 8 + 2w.

Subtracting w from both sides, we get 3 + o = 8 + w.

Subtracting 3 from both sides, we get o = 5 + w.

We also know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17, so o + w = 17.

Substituting o = 5 + w into the equation o + w = 17, we get 5 + w + w = 17.

Combining like terms, we get 5 + 2w = 17.

Subtracting 5 from both sides, we get 2w = 12.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get w = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To calculate the weekly fuel consumption, we need to determine the total miles driven per week and then divide it by the car's fuel efficiency.

The one-way distance between home and office is 5 miles, and Andy drives to and from work, so the total distance per day is 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles.

Since Andy drives to work from Monday to Friday, the total miles driven per week is 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.

Now, we can calculate the fuel consumption per week by dividing the total miles driven by the car's fuel efficiency: 50 miles/week / 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week.

The price of regular gas is $3/gallon, so the weekly fuel cost is 5 gallons/week * $3/gallon = $15/week.

Total money received = $200 + $35 = $235

Carrie spent all the quarters, which is $35, and 3/5 of the twenties. To find 3/5 of the twenties, we multiply $200 by 3/5:

3/5 x $200 = (3/5) x 200 = 3 x 40 = $120

Carrie spent $120 from the twenties and $35 from the quarters, for a total of:

$120 + $35 = $155

The total amount of money Carrie paid for lunch is $155.

"To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we first need to determine the total percentage of TVs that are not OLED. 

The percentage of smart TVs is 1/4, which is equivalent to 25%. The percentage of analog TVs is 1/8, which is equivalent to 12.5%. 

The total percentage of smart and analog TVs is 25% + 12.5% = 37.5%. 

Since the total percentage of all TVs is 100%, the percentage of OLED TVs is 100% - 37.5% = 62.5%.

Now, we can find the number of OLED TVs sold by multiplying the total number of TVs sold (40) by the percentage of OLED TVs (62.5% or 0.625).

Number of OLED TVs sold = 40 * 0.625 = 25

"To find out how much money John is missing, we need to first determine how much the school will cover and then subtract the amount John has from the total cost of the trip.

The school will cover half the cost of the trip, which is $300 / 2 = $150.

The total cost of the trip is $300, and John has $50. To find out how much he is missing, we subtract the amount he has from the total cost: $300 - $50 = $250.

However, since the school is covering half the cost, we need to subtract the amount the school is covering from the total cost to find out how much John needs to cover: $300 - $150 = $150.

Since John has $50, he is missing $150 - $50 = $100.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the temperature at night and then calculate how many logs Carson needs to burn to raise the temperature to 32 degrees.

First, let's find the temperature at night. It's 33 degrees colder during the night compared to the day, and the day temperature is 45 degrees. 

Night temperature = Day temperature - 33
Night temperature = 45 - 33
Night temperature = 12 degrees

Since the pipes will freeze at 32 degrees, Carson needs to raise the temperature from 12 degrees to 32 degrees. 

Temperature to be raised = 32 - 12
Temperature to be raised = 20 degrees

Each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees. To find the number of logs needed, we divide the temperature to be raised by the temperature increase per log.

Number of logs = Temperature to be raised / Temperature increase per log
Number of logs = 20 / 5
Number of logs = 4

"To find the total number of seashells brought back, we first need to determine the number of groups formed and then calculate the number of groups that brought back seashells.

The total number of people is 90, and they are divided into 9-person groups. To find the number of groups, we divide the total number of people by the number of people per group:

90 people / 9 people per group = 10 groups

Since 3/5 of the groups brought back seashells, we need to find 3/5 of the total number of groups:

3/5 * 10 groups = 6 groups

Each of these 6 groups brought back 2 seashells. To find the total number of seashells, we multiply the number of groups by the number of seashells each group brought back:

"To find Nikita's score, we first need to calculate half of Pierson's score. Half of 278 is 278 / 2 = 139. 

Nikita scored 11 more than half of Pierson's score, so Nikita's score is 139 + 11 = 150.

To find the total score, we add Pierson's score and Nikita's score: 278 + 150 = 428.

The final answer is: 428"
"To find the total number of trees planted by the students, we need to calculate the total number of students and multiply it by 1 (since each student plants 1 tree). 

The total number of students is the product of the number of classes and the average number of students per class: 
40 classes * 25 students/class = 1000 students

Now, we multiply the total number of students by 1 to find the total number of trees planted by the students:
1000 students * 1 tree/student = 1000 trees

To find the total number of trees planted by the teachers, we need to calculate the total number of teachers and multiply it by 2 (since each teacher plants 2 trees). 

The total number of teachers is the product of the number of classes and the average number of teachers per class:
40 classes * 3 teachers/class = 120 teachers

Now, we multiply the total number of teachers by 2 to find the total number of trees planted by the teachers:
120 teachers * 2 trees/teacher = 240 trees

To find the total number of trees planted, we add the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers:
1000 trees (students) + 240 trees (teachers) = 1240 trees

The final answer is: 1240"
"To find the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy, we first need to find the total number of stuffed animals she currently has. 

The total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has is the sum of the number of stuffed puppies, koalas, zebras, and frogs. 

Total number of stuffed animals = 3 (puppies) + 5 (koalas) + 2 (zebras) + 4 (frogs) = 14

Now, we need to find the number of stuffed goats that will make up 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. 

Let's denote the number of stuffed goats as 'x'. The total number of stuffed animals after buying 'x' goats will be 14 + x. 

We want 30% of the total number of stuffed animals to be goats, so we can set up the equation:

(30/100) * (14 + x) = x

To solve for 'x', we can multiply both sides by 100 to get rid of the fraction:

0.3 * (14 + x) = x

Now, we can distribute 0.3 to 14 and x:

4.2 + 0.3x = x

Next, we can subtract 0.3x from both sides to get:

4.2 = 0.7x

Now, we can divide both sides by 0.7 to solve for 'x':

x = 4.2 / 0.7
x = 6

So, Bubbles needs to buy 6 stuffed goats to make up 30% of her total number of stuffed animals.

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total hours Kris has played and subtract that from the target of 30 hours.

First, let's calculate the hours Kris played in the first 2 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, 2 weeks is 2 * 7 = 14 days. If Kris plays for half an hour every day, she plays 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours in the first 2 weeks.

Next, let's calculate the hours Kris played in the next week. If Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week, she plays 7 * 2 = 14 hours in the next week.

Now, let's add the hours Kris played in both periods: 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours.

To find out how many hours Kris still needs to play, we subtract the total hours played from the target of 30 hours: 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time.

The first car travels at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel:
Distance = Speed x Time = 60 miles/hour x 2 hours = 120 miles

The second car travels at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel:
Distance = Speed x Time = 70 miles/hour x 2 hours = 140 miles

Since the second car was initially passing the first car, we need to find the distance between them after 2 hours. The second car has traveled 140 miles, and the first car has traveled 120 miles. The distance between them is the difference between the two distances:
Distance = 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost James paid for the ring, we need to calculate the premium and add it to the total cost of the diamond and gold.

The total cost of the diamond and gold is $600 + $300 = $900.

The premium is 30% of $900, which is 0.3 x $900 = $270.

To find the total cost, we add the premium to the total cost of the diamond and gold: $900 + $270 = $1170.

The final numerical answer is: $1170"
"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school.

First, let's find the number of students who passed in each grade:

- Third-graders: 340 out of 500 passed
- Fourth-graders: 40 out of 100 passed
- Fifth-graders: The pass rate is twice the fourth-graders', so it's 2 * 40 = 80 out of 100 passed

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who passed:
340 (third-graders) + 40 (fourth-graders) + 80 (fifth-graders) = 460 students passed

Next, let's calculate the total number of students in the school:
500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000 students

Now, we can find the overall pass rate:
(460 students passed / 1000 total students) * 100 = 46%

The final answer is: 46"
"To find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we first need to determine how many square inches of mosaic he can make with the glass chips he has. 

Since it takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic, and each bag holds 72 chips, we can calculate the total number of chips Milo has: 2 bags * 72 chips/bag = 144 chips.

Now, we need to find out how many square inches of mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make 1 square inch, we divide the total number of chips by 12: 144 chips / 12 chips/square inch = 12 square inches.

Since the mosaic is three inches tall, and we know the area of the mosaic (12 square inches), we can find the length by dividing the area by the height: 12 square inches / 3 inches = 4 inches.

Therefore, Milo can make a mosaic that is 4 inches long.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total amount of tea consumed, we need to calculate the amount of tea each group of students drank and then add them together.

The first group of 4 students drank 1.5 quarts each, so the total amount of tea they drank is 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts.

The second group of 16 students drank 2 quarts each, so the total amount of tea they drank is 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

The total amount of tea consumed is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 10 quarts of tea left, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is 38 + 10 = 48 quarts.

To convert quarts to gallons, we know that 1 gallon is equal to 4 quarts. So, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party in gallons is 48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to first determine the total number of candies he has. 

Initially, Dale had 100 candies. He sold 150, so he was left with 100 - 150 = -50 candies. However, this is not possible since you can't have a negative number of candies. This means that Dale must have sold more candies than he initially had. 

Let's re-evaluate the situation: Dale initially had 100 candies, sold 150, and then ordered 100 more. So, he now has 100 (initial candies) + 100 (new order) = 200 candies. 

Since he sold 150 candies, he still needs to sell 200 - 150 = 50 candies to sell all of his candy.

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students on campus at the end of May. 

At the beginning of the year, there are 10 students. 

- At the end of January, the number of students doubles, so there are 10 * 2 = 20 students.
- At the end of February, the number of students doubles again, so there are 20 * 2 = 40 students.
- At the end of March, the number of students doubles again, so there are 40 * 2 = 80 students.
- At the end of April, the number of students doubles again, so there are 80 * 2 = 160 students.
- At the end of May, the number of students doubles again, so there are 160 * 2 = 320 students.

To find the number of additional students who joined by the end of May, we subtract the initial number of students from the total number of students at the end of May: 320 - 10 = 310.

The final answer is: 310"
"To find the total number of branches Felix climbed, we need to divide the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch. 

Total money made = $105
Cost per branch = $0.25

Total branches climbed = Total money made / Cost per branch
Total branches climbed = $105 / $0.25
Total branches climbed = 420

Since Felix worked during the week, which has 5 days, we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day.

Average branches per day = Total branches climbed / Number of days
Average branches per day = 420 / 5
Average branches per day = 84

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the total number of petals in the vase, we need to calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers and then subtract the petals that were dropped.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers:

- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 * 5 = 15 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 * 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 * 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 * 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add up the total number of petals from all the flowers: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 petal from each set of flowers, we need to subtract 4 petals (1 from each set) from the total: 101 - 4 = 97 petals

The final answer is: 97"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many marshmallows are left in the bag after John and DeSean make their S'mores and drop some on the ground.

Initially, there are 35 marshmallows in the bag.

John and DeSean each make 9 S'mores, so together they make 9 + 9 = 18 S'mores. Each S'more uses one marshmallow, so they use 18 marshmallows.

They also drop 3 marshmallows on the ground, so the total number of marshmallows used or dropped is 18 + 3 = 21.

To find the number of marshmallows left, we subtract the number of marshmallows used or dropped from the initial number of marshmallows: 35 - 21 = 14.

Since there are 14 marshmallows left, and there are two kids, we need to divide the remaining marshmallows by 2 to find out how many each kid can have: 14 / 2 = 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time each person plays and then determine how many quarters are used.

Jack can play for 20 minutes. His two friends who are worse can play for half as long, which is 20 / 2 = 10 minutes. The friend who is better can play for 1.5 times as long, which is 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes.

Since they play for 4 hours, we need to convert this to minutes: 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the total time each person plays:

- Jack: 240 minutes
- Two worse friends: 2 * 10 minutes = 20 minutes each, so 2 * 20 minutes = 40 minutes total
- Better friend: 240 minutes

Now, let's calculate the total time played by all friends: 240 (Jack) + 40 (worse friends) + 240 (better friend) = 520 minutes.

Since Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter, we need to calculate how many 20-minute intervals are in 520 minutes: 520 / 20 = 26.

However, we need to account for the fact that the better friend plays for 240 minutes, which is 12 intervals of 20 minutes. The two worse friends play for 40 minutes, which is 2 intervals of 20 minutes. Jack plays for 240 minutes, which is 12 intervals of 20 minutes.

So, the total number of intervals is 12 (better friend) + 2 (worse friends) + 12 (Jack) = 26 intervals.

Since each interval costs 1 quarter, the total amount of money used is 26 quarters.

To convert this to dollars, we multiply by the value of a quarter (0.25): 26 * 0.25 = 6.5 dollars.

The final answer is: $6.50"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the amount of citrus zest as Z, the amount of fragrance as F, the amount of salt as S, the amount of sugar as S (since it's the same as salt), and the amount of oil as O.

We know that Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, so F = Z.

We also know that she uses twice as much salt as zest, so S = 2Z.

Since she uses twice as much oil as salt, O = 2S.

Substituting S = 2Z into O = 2S, we get O = 2(2Z) = 4Z.

We know that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, and it's a combination of Z, F, S, S, and O. Since F = Z and S = 2Z, we can rewrite the total amount as Z + Z + 2Z + 2Z + 4Z = 10.

Combining like terms, we get 10Z = 10.

Dividing both sides by 10, we get Z = 1.

Now that we know Z = 1, we can find O by substituting Z into O = 4Z. O = 4(1) = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total amount of money John spent, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows separately and then add them together.

The cost of the goats is 3 * $500 = $1500.
The cost of the cows is 2 * $1500 = $3000.

Now, we add the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows to find the total amount spent: $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

The final answer is: $4500"
"To find out how many more cupcakes Paul needs to buy, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs.

Total cupcakes needed = 63
Cupcakes already available = 8 (chocolate) + 40 (toffee) = 48

Number of cupcakes Paul needs to buy = Total cupcakes needed - Cupcakes already available

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

2. Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find 20% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.2: 40 * 0.2 = 8. So, Joe sells 8 cars.

3. Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars to his mother.

4. Now, we need to find out how many cars Joe has left. Initially, he had 40 cars. He sold 8 and gave away 16. So, the total number of cars he gave away or sold is 8 + 16 = 24.

5. To find out how many cars Joe has left, we subtract the total number of cars he gave away or sold from the initial number of cars: 40 - 24 = 16.

Therefore, Joe remains with 16 cars after selling and giving some to his mother.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to first determine the total amount raised by the students. Since the charity raised a total of $175,000 and $50,000 came from organizations, the amount raised by the students is $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000.

Now, we know that there are 20 students and they all raised the same amount. To find the amount each student raised, we divide the total amount raised by the number of students: $125,000 / 20 = $6,250.

The final answer is: $6,250."
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the first day and the second day, and then add them together.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. 

On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she walked on the first day, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

To find the total time in minutes, we need to convert the hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes
4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes

The total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 480 + 240 = 720 minutes.

"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to first determine the total number of cars in the parking lot after the first break. Initially, there were 50 cars. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, so the total number of cars after the first break is 50 + 20 = 70.

When Hunter got out of class for the lunch break, he realized that 1/2 the number of cars in the parking lot had gone. This means that 1/2 of 70 cars left, and the remaining 1/2 stayed. To find the number of cars that left, we multiply 70 by 1/2, which is 35. 

Since 35 cars left, the number of cars that stayed is 70 - 35 = 35. However, the question asks for the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, which is the number of cars that left plus the number of cars that stayed. Therefore, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is 35 (cars that left) + 35 (cars that stayed) = 70.

The final answer is: 70"
"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of tasks he completes in a day and then multiply it by the number of days he works in a week.

John does 30 cycles of work a day, and each cycle has 5 different tasks. So, the total number of tasks he completes in a day is:
30 cycles/day * 5 tasks/cycle = 150 tasks/day

Since each task pays $1.20, the total amount John makes in a day is:
150 tasks/day * $1.20/task = $180/day

John works a full 7-day week, so the total amount he makes in a week is:
$180/day * 7 days/week = $1260/week

"To find the total points scored by Sasha, we need to calculate her points in both games. 

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. 

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points in the first game. 

Now, we know Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game, so Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

To find the total points scored by Sasha, we add her points from both games: 14 + 4 = 18.

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as x. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We know that the total number of cards is 341. Therefore, we can write the equation: x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341.

Combine like terms: 7x + 12 = 341.

Subtract 12 from both sides: 7x = 329.

Divide both sides by 7: x = 47.

Since PJ has x cards, Smendrick has 3x = 3 * 47 = 141 cards. Becca has 3x + 12 = 3 * 47 + 12 = 147 cards.

Cindy had 5 green eggs. 
She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.
She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.
She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had (1/3) * 9 = 3 yellow eggs.

"To find out how much Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total cost of shipping the book and subtract the refund amount from the purchase price.

First, let's calculate the shipping cost:

Shipping cost per pound: $0.35
Total weight of the book: 4 pounds
Shipping cost = 4 pounds * $0.35/pound = $1.40

Shipping cost per mile: $0.08
Distance to the distribution center: 20 miles
Additional shipping cost = 20 miles * $0.08/mile = $1.60

Total shipping cost = $1.40 + $1.60 = $2.00

Now, let's calculate the refund amount:

Purchase price of the book: $32
Refund percentage: 75%
Refund amount = $32 * 0.75 = $24

Now, let's calculate the total loss:

Total loss = Total shipping cost - Refund amount
Total loss = $2.00 - $24
However, since the refund amount is greater than the shipping cost, the total loss will be the difference between the shipping cost and the refund amount.

Total loss = $2.00 - $24 = -$22.00
However, since the loss cannot be negative, we need to recalculate the total loss by considering the shipping cost as a loss.

Total loss = $2.00

The final answer is: $2.00"

"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the production for the first three weeks and then determine the pattern.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.

In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.

In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Now, let's calculate the total production for the first three weeks: 
8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in a month, we can find the production for the fourth week by subtracting the total production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production:
50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

"To find the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends on TikTok in a week and then multiply it by 4.

First, let's calculate the time Britany spends on TikTok in a week:

1. Time spent recording videos: 18 videos * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes
2. Time spent writing songs: 2 hours = 120 minutes
3. Time spent doing makeup: 15 minutes * 6 days = 90 minutes

Total time spent on TikTok in a week = 72 + 120 + 90 = 282 minutes

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly time by 4:

Total time spent on TikTok in a month = 282 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 1128 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

1128 minutes / 60 = 18.8 hours

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the initial installation and the cost of the additional items.

The initial installation includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. However, Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures that she needs installed. Since the initial installation already includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, and 1 chandelier, we only need to consider the additional items.

Angela has 6 - 4 = 2 additional mirrors, 2 - 1 = 1 additional chandelier, and 20 - 10 = 10 additional pictures.

The cost of the additional items is 2 mirrors * $15.00 = $30.00, 1 chandelier * $15.00 = $15.00, and 10 pictures * $15.00 = $150.00.

The total cost of the additional items is $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00.

The initial installation cost is $129.00. Therefore, the total cost is $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the ratio of Naruto's lifting ability to Pompei's lifting ability. 

First, we know that Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift 12 inches. 

Next, Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Then, Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 480 inches to feet by dividing by 12: 480 / 12 = 40 feet.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the time it takes for one kangaroo to travel across the highway. Since three kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, one kangaroo would take three times as long, which is 18 * 3 = 54 hours.

Now, we know that the turtles travel at half the speed of a kangaroo. If one kangaroo takes 54 hours to travel across the highway, then one turtle would take twice as long, which is 54 * 2 = 108 hours.

Since there are four turtles, and they are traveling at the same speed, we need to divide the time it takes for one turtle by the number of turtles. So, the time it takes for four turtles to travel across the highway is 108 / 4 = 27 hours.

The final answer is: 27"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many dishes Jada and Rory made. 

Since Kora made 20 dishes, and Rory made 20 more than Kora, Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.

Jada made twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

Now, we need to add up the number of dishes made by all three: Kora (20), Rory (40), and Jada (80).

Total dishes = 20 + 40 + 80 = 140

The final answer is: 140"
"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has after receiving her payment and her mom's contribution, and then subtract the amount she still needs to buy the laptop.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Erika has after receiving her payment and her mom's contribution: $150 (payment) + $80 (mom's contribution) = $230.

Since Erika thinks the deal is good and agrees to trade in her old laptop, the price of the new laptop is reduced by $200. So, the price of the new laptop after the trade-in is $600 - $200 = $400.

Erika now only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, which means she has $400 (price after trade-in) - $50 (amount she still needs) = $350.

Now, we subtract the amount she has from the total amount she has after receiving her payment and her mom's contribution to find out how much money she had initially: $230 (total after payment and mom's contribution) - $350 (amount she has now) is incorrect, we need to find the initial amount she had before receiving the payment and her mom's contribution.

Let's call the initial amount she had in her purse 'x'. After receiving her payment and her mom's contribution, she had $230. So, we can set up the equation: x + $150 (payment) + $80 (mom's contribution) = $230. 

Simplifying the equation, we get: x + $230 = $230. 

Subtracting $230 from both sides, we get: x = $0.

However, this is not possible since Erika had some savings in her purse. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

We know that after receiving her payment and her mom's contribution, she had $230. We also know that she had some savings in her purse, and after receiving her payment and her mom's contribution, she had $350. So, we can set up the equation: x + $150 (payment) + $80 (mom's contribution) = $350.

Simplifying the equation, we get: x + $230 = $350.

Subtracting $230 from both sides, we get: x = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To find the total number of apple slices, we first need to calculate the total number of slices from the large and small apples. 

For 3 large apples, each sliced into 5 pieces, the total number of slices is 3 * 5 = 15. 
For 5 small apples, each sliced into 3 pieces, the total number of slices is 5 * 3 = 15.

The total number of slices from both large and small apples is 15 + 15 = 30.

Since Adam eats 15 slices, the number of slices left is 30 - 15 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how many cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to determine the total amount of milk the farmer currently produces. Since he extracts 5 liters of milk a day from each cow and he has 3 cows, the total amount of milk he currently produces is:

5 liters/cow * 3 cows = 15 liters/day

Now, we need to find out how many cows he needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day. We can set up an equation to represent this situation:

5x = 25

where x is the number of cows needed to produce 25 liters of milk a day. To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 5:

x = 25 / 5
x = 5

However, this is the number of cows needed to produce 25 liters of milk a day, not the number of additional cows the farmer needs. To find the number of additional cows needed, we subtract the number of cows the farmer currently has from the number of cows needed:

Additional cows needed = 5 - 3
Additional cows needed = 2

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the unused portion of each glue stick and add them together.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, which means it has 5/6 used. Since the original length is 12 mm, the used portion is (5/6) * 12 = 10 mm. The unused portion is 12 - 10 = 2 mm.

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, which means it has 1/3 used. The used portion is (1/3) * 12 = 4 mm. The unused portion is 12 - 4 = 8 mm.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, which means it has 1/2 used. The used portion is (1/2) * 12 = 6 mm. The unused portion is 12 - 6 = 6 mm.

Now, we add the unused portions of all three glue sticks: 2 mm + 8 mm + 6 mm = 16 mm.

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 16 mm."
"To find out how much money Gabriel still needs, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has and subtract it from the total cost of the items he wants to buy.

Gabriel has $5000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200, so he has a total of $5000 + $200 = $5200.

The total cost of the items he wants to buy is $10000 (car) + $800 (phone) = $10800.

Now, let's subtract the amount of money Gabriel has from the total cost: $10800 - $5200 = $5600.

So, Gabriel still needs $5600 to buy the car and the phone.

The final answer is: $5600"
"To find the change Thea received, we need to calculate the total amount she paid and subtract it from the amount she gave the craftsman.

Thea gave the craftsman four $20 bills, which is a total of 4 x $20 = $80.

"To find out how much money Craig has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent and subtract it from the initial amount he had.

Craig initially had 2 twenty-dollar bills, which is 2 * $20 = $40.

He bought 6 squirt guns for $2 each, so the total cost of the squirt guns is 6 * $2 = $12.

He also bought 3 packs of water balloons for $3 each, so the total cost of the water balloons is 3 * $3 = $9.

The total amount Craig spent is $12 + $9 = $21.

To find out how much money he has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $40 - $21 = $19.

The final answer is: $19"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so the number of socks Jack has is 60 / 2 = 30 socks.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has 2 * 30 = 60 socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:
Total socks = Jack's socks + Peter's socks = 30 + 60 = 90 socks
Total dishes = Jack's dishes + Peter's dishes = 60 + 30 = 90 dishes

The total number of socks and dishes they have together is 90 + 90 = 180."
"To find the number of students good at math, we need to consider the total number of students and the number of students good at both subjects. 

Let's denote the number of students good at both math and English as x. We know that the total number of students is 20, and the number of students good at math only is 5, and the number of students good at English only is 8.

We can set up the equation: 5 (math only) + 8 (English only) + x (both) = 20 (total)

Simplifying the equation, we get: 13 + x = 20

Subtracting 13 from both sides, we get: x = 7

This means that 7 students are good at both math and English. To find the total number of students good at math, we need to add the number of students good at math only (5) and the number of students good at both subjects (7).

Total number of students good at math = 5 (math only) + 7 (both) = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total number of groups that can perform, we need to calculate the total available time for performances and then divide it by the time required for each group to perform, including getting on and off the stage.

The total available time for performances is the total concert time minus the intermission time. 

Total concert time = 2 hours = 2 * 60 minutes = 120 minutes
Intermission time = 10 minutes
Total available time for performances = 120 - 10 = 110 minutes

Each group requires 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit the stage. So, the total time required for each group is 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes.

Now, we can calculate the number of groups that can perform:
Number of groups = Total available time for performances / Time required for each group
= 110 minutes / 10 minutes
= 11

The final answer is: 11"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand that it's a simple interest scenario. The interest rate is given as three-quarters of the original amount per year, which can be expressed as 0.75x, where x is the original amount. However, in this case, the interest rate is actually 0.75 times the principal amount, not the original amount. 

The correct interpretation of the interest rate is 75% of the principal amount, not the original amount. So, the interest rate is 0.75 * 300 = 225 dollars per year.

The formula for simple interest is I = P * r * t, where I is the interest, P is the principal amount, r is the interest rate, and t is the time period in years.

Given that the principal amount (P) is $300, the interest rate (r) is 225/300 = 0.75, and the time period (t) is 3 years, we can calculate the total amount after 3 years.

The interest earned in 3 years is I = 300 * 0.75 * 3 = 675 dollars.

The total amount after 3 years will be the principal amount plus the interest earned, which is 300 + 675 = 975 dollars.

The final answer is: $975"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

First, we need to find the number of white shirts with collars and the number of floral shirts with buttons.

Since half of the white shirts have collars, the number of white shirts with collars is 40 / 2 = 20.

The number of floral shirts with buttons is given as 20.

Now, let's find the number of white shirts with no collars. Since 20 out of 40 white shirts have collars, the number of white shirts with no collars is 40 - 20 = 20.

Next, let's find the number of floral shirts with no buttons. The total number of floral shirts is 50, and 20 of them have buttons, so the number of floral shirts with no buttons is 50 - 20 = 30.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars. This is 30 - 20 = 10.

"To find out how much the farmer will earn, we need to determine the number of trays he can fill with 900 eggs. 

Since each tray holds 30 eggs, we can divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs per tray to find the number of trays:

900 eggs / 30 eggs per tray = 30 trays

Now, we can multiply the number of trays by the price per tray to find the total earnings:

30 trays * $2.5 per tray = $75

From Farm X, Mr. Smith sold 10 goats. 
From Farm Y, he sold twice as many goats as from Farm X, which is 2 * 10 = 20 goats.

Now, let's calculate the number of goats left in each farm:
- Farm X: 55 - 10 = 45 goats
- Farm Y: 45 - 20 = 25 goats

To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the number of goats in Farm X and Farm Y:
45 (Farm X) + 25 (Farm Y) = 70 goats

"To find the average cost of each pair of shoes, we need to divide the total amount spent on shoes per year by the number of pairs bought per year.

First, let's calculate the number of pairs James buys per year. Since he buys 2 pairs of shoes a month, and there are 12 months in a year, he buys 2 * 12 = 24 pairs of shoes per year.

Now, we can divide the total amount spent on shoes per year ($2640) by the number of pairs bought per year (24) to find the average cost per pair:

Average cost per pair = Total amount spent per year / Number of pairs bought per year
= $2640 / 24

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food, then subtract the discount for the red baskets.

The cost of 3 baskets of green food is 3 * $25 = $75.

The cost of 3 baskets of red food is 3 * $18 = $54.

The total cost before discount is $75 + $54 = $129.

Since you get $2 off for each basket of red food, and you bought 3 baskets, the total discount is 3 * $2 = $6.

The total cost after discount is $129 - $6 = $123.

The final numerical answer is: $123"
"To find the time it takes to clean one-half of the rooms, we first need to determine the number of rooms that is half of 90. 

90 / 2 = 45 rooms

Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, we multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room.

45 rooms * 20 minutes/room = 900 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours

"Let's denote my age as 'x'. Since I am three years younger than my brother, my brother's age is x + 3. My sister is 2 years younger than me, so her age is x - 2.

My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, which can be expressed as 3(x + 3) - 1.

The sum of all our ages is 87, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + 3(x + 3) - 1 = 87.

Combine like terms: 5x + 10 + 3x - 1 = 87.

Combine the x terms and the constants: 8x + 9 = 87.

Subtract 9 from both sides: 8x = 78.

Divide both sides by 8: x = 9.75.

Since age cannot be a fraction, we need to find the closest integer that satisfies the given conditions. We can test x = 9 and x = 10.

If x = 9, then my brother's age is 9 + 3 = 12, my sister's age is 9 - 2 = 7, and my mom's age is 3(12) - 1 = 35. The sum of our ages is 9 + 12 + 7 + 35 = 63, which is less than 87.

If x = 10, then my brother's age is 10 + 3 = 13, my sister's age is 10 - 2 = 8, and my mom's age is 3(13) - 1 = 38. The sum of our ages is 10 + 13 + 8 + 38 = 69, which is still less than 87.

If x = 11, then my brother's age is 11 + 3 = 14, my sister's age is 11 - 2 = 9, and my mom's age is 3(14) - 1 = 41. The sum of our ages is 11 + 14 + 9 + 41 = 75, which is still less than 87.

If x = 12, then my brother's age is 12 + 3 = 15, my sister's age is 12 - 2 = 10, and my mom's age is 3(15) - 1 = 44. The sum of our ages is 12 + 15 + 10 + 44 = 81, which is still less than 87.

If x = 13, then my brother's age is 13 + 3 = 16, my sister's age is 13 - 2 = 11, and my mom's age is 3(16) - 1 = 47. The sum of our ages is 13 + 16 + 11 + 47 = 87.

"To find out how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of glue sticks required and then divide that by the number of glue sticks in each pack.

Since each student needs 2 glue sticks and there are 27 students, the total number of glue sticks required is 27 * 2 = 54.

Each pack of glue sticks contains 8 sticks. To find out how many packs are needed, we divide the total number of glue sticks required by the number of glue sticks in each pack: 54 / 8 = 6.75.

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he will need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, he will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water passing through the river at the given point over the three days.

On the first day, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

On the second day, the amount of water passing through the river doubles, so it becomes 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.

On the third day, the amount of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons, so it becomes 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

To find the total amount of water passing through the river at that point over the three days, we need to add the amounts of water passing through the river each day:

Total amount of water = 4000 + 8000 + 14000 = 24000 gallons.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Claire earns 1 badge per month.
- Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge than Claire, so Amber earns 1/2 badge per month.
- Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so Wendy earns 3 badges per month.

In a 1-year time frame (12 months), the number of badges earned by each person would be:
- Claire: 1 badge/month * 12 months = 12 badges
- Amber: 0.5 badges/month * 12 months = 6 badges
- Wendy: 3 badges/month * 12 months = 36 badges

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a 1-year time frame, we subtract the number of badges earned by Amber from the number of badges earned by Wendy:

"To find the total number of coins Gretchen has, we need to determine the number of silver coins first. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, and Gretchen has 70 gold coins, we can set up an equation to represent the relationship between the number of gold and silver coins.

Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. Then, the number of gold coins can be represented as 'x + 30'. We know that the number of gold coins is 70, so we can set up the equation:

x + 30 = 70

To solve for 'x', we subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:

x = 70 - 30
x = 40

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins. To find the total number of coins, we add the number of gold coins and silver coins:

Total coins = Number of gold coins + Number of silver coins
Total coins = 70 + 40
Total coins = 110

"To find the number of yellow cars, we need to first determine the number of green and blue cars. 

Let's start with the number of green cars. We are told that there are 2 fewer green cars than red cars. Since there are 12 red cars, the number of green cars is 12 - 2 = 10.

Next, we are told that there are 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars. Since there are 10 green cars, the number of blue cars is 3 * 10 = 30.

Now, we know the total number of red, green, and blue cars: 12 (red) + 10 (green) + 30 (blue) = 52 cars.

Since the rink has 75 cars in total, the number of yellow cars can be found by subtracting the total number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars: 75 - 52 = 23.

"Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as F, the number of books Anne has as A, and the number of books Sofie has as S. 

We are given the following information:
1. S = A + 25 (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
2. A = F - 12 (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)
3. S + A + F = 85 (Together, they have 85 books)

We can substitute the first equation into the third equation to get:
(A + 25) + A + F = 85
Combine like terms:
2A + 25 + F = 85

Now, substitute the second equation into the above equation:
2(F - 12) + 25 + F = 85
Expand the equation:
2F - 24 + 25 + F = 85
Combine like terms:
3F + 1 = 85

Subtract 1 from both sides:
3F = 84

Divide both sides by 3:
F = 28

First, let's calculate Keenan's monthly expenditure: 
Total monthly expenditure = $400
Madeline's monthly expenditure = 60% of $400 = 0.6 * $400 = $240
Keenan's monthly expenditure = Total monthly expenditure - Madeline's monthly expenditure
Keenan's monthly expenditure = $400 - $240 = $160

Now, we need to find out how much Keenan spends per week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we can divide Keenan's monthly expenditure by 4:
Keenan's weekly expenditure = Keenan's monthly expenditure / 4
Keenan's weekly expenditure = $160 / 4
Keenan's weekly expenditure = $40

The final answer is: $40"
"To find out how many pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he ate on each day and add them up.

On the first day, he ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces. To find 2/5 of 60, we multiply 60 by 2 and divide by 5:
(2/5) * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

So, on the first day, he ate 24 pieces.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces. To find the remaining pieces after the first two days, we subtract the pieces eaten on the first two days from the total:
60 - 24 - 10 = 26

Now, we need to find 7/13 of 26:
(7/13) * 26 = (7 * 26) / 13 = 182 / 13 = 14

So, on the third day, he ate 14 pieces.

Now, we add up the pieces eaten on each day:
24 + 10 + 14 = 48

Therefore, Tobias has eaten 48 pieces so far.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water, we first need to determine the cost per bottle of soda and the cost per bottle of water.

The cost of 7 bottles of soda is $21.00, so the cost per bottle of soda is $21.00 / 7 = $3.00 per bottle.

The cost of 4 bottles of water is $8.00, so the cost per bottle of water is $8.00 / 4 = $2.00 per bottle.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:

Cost of 3 bottles of soda = 3 * $3.00 = $9.00
Cost of 2 bottles of water = 2 * $2.00 = $4.00
Total cost = $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00

The total cost will be $13.00."
"To find out how much money David has left after buying the bolts, we need to calculate the total cost of the bolts and subtract that from the initial amount of money he has.

The cost of each bolt is $0.03, and David wants to buy 16 bolts. 

Total cost of bolts = Number of bolts * Cost per bolt
Total cost of bolts = 16 * $0.03
Total cost of bolts = $0.48

Now, we subtract the total cost of the bolts from the initial amount of money David has:

Initial amount of money = $12.48
Total cost of bolts = $0.48
Money left = Initial amount of money - Total cost of bolts
Money left = $12.48 - $0.48
Money left = $12.00

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To find out how much Ella would earn after 12 hours of dog walking at the same rate, we need to first determine her hourly wage. 

We can do this by dividing the amount she earned ($33) by the number of hours she worked (3). 

Hourly wage = Total earnings / Number of hours worked
Hourly wage = $33 / 3
Hourly wage = $11

Now that we know her hourly wage, we can calculate her earnings after 12 hours by multiplying her hourly wage by the number of hours she will work.

Earnings after 12 hours = Hourly wage * Number of hours worked
Earnings after 12 hours = $11 * 12
Earnings after 12 hours = $132

The final answer is: $132"
"To find out how many marbles Paul has left, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, Paul has 52 marbles. His friend gave him 28 marbles, so we add 28 to 52:

52 + 28 = 80

Then, Paul lost 1/4 of his marbles. To find 1/4 of 80, we multiply 80 by 1/4 or divide by 4:

80 / 4 = 20

Since Paul lost 20 marbles, we subtract 20 from the total number of marbles he had after receiving the gift:

80 - 20 = 60

Therefore, Paul has 60 marbles left.

60"
"To find Amy's total score, we need to calculate the points she scored from each type of question and add them together.

First, let's calculate the points from the multiple-choice questions. Amy correctly answers 80% of the 10 multiple-choice questions, so she answers 0.8 * 10 = 8 questions correctly. Since each multiple-choice question is worth 1 point, she scores 8 points from the multiple-choice questions.

Next, let's calculate the points from the true/false questions. Amy correctly answers 90% of the 20 true/false questions, so she answers 0.9 * 20 = 18 questions correctly. Since each true/false question is worth 1 point, she scores 18 points from the true/false questions.

Finally, let's calculate the points from the long-answer questions. Amy correctly answers 60% of the 5 long-answer questions, so she answers 0.6 * 5 = 3 questions correctly. Since each long-answer question is worth 5 points, she scores 3 * 5 = 15 points from the long-answer questions.

Now, let's add the points from each type of question to find Amy's total score: 8 + 18 + 15 = 41.

The final answer is: 41"
"To find out how much money Isaias bought the chickens for, we first need to determine how many chickens he plans to sell. Since he has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them, we can calculate the number of chickens he plans to sell as follows:

Number of chickens to sell = 300 * (3/5)
= 300 * 0.6
= 180 chickens

Next, we know that Isaias needs to make a profit of $2000 by selling these chickens at $50 each. To find the total revenue, we multiply the number of chickens by the selling price:

Total revenue = Number of chickens to sell * Selling price
= 180 * $50
= $9000

Since Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000, we can set up the equation:

Total revenue - Total cost = Profit
$9000 - Total cost = $2000

To find the total cost, we subtract the profit from the total revenue:

Total cost = Total revenue - Profit
= $9000 - $2000
= $7000

Therefore, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for sale for $7000.

The final answer is: $7000"
"To find out how many glasses Micah and Mitchell sold, we need to divide the total number of glasses sold by 2, since they sold an equal number of glasses. 

Total glasses sold = 32
Number of people selling glasses (excluding Julie) = 2

Glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell = Total glasses sold / 2
Glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell = 32 / 2
Glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell = 16

Now, we need to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah. To do this, we subtract the number of glasses sold by Micah from the number of glasses sold by Julie.

Glasses sold by Julie = 14
Glasses sold by Micah = 16

Difference in glasses sold by Julie and Micah = Glasses sold by Julie - Glasses sold by Micah
Difference in glasses sold by Julie and Micah = 14 - 16
Difference in glasses sold by Julie and Micah = -2

The negative sign indicates that Micah sold more glasses than Julie. However, the question asks for the difference, which is a positive number. Therefore, we take the absolute value of the difference.

Difference in glasses sold by Julie and Micah = | -2 |
Difference in glasses sold by Julie and Micah = 2

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total amount Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the cost of each service and add them together.

The cost of the hair service is $400.

The cost of the manicure is 1/4 of the cost of the hair service, which is (1/4) * $400 = $100.

The cost of the pedicure is 3/4 of the cost of the manicure, which is (3/4) * $100 = $75.

Now, we add the costs of all three services together: $400 (hair) + $100 (manicure) + $75 (pedicure) = $575.

The final answer is: $575"
"To find out how much money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope, we need to calculate the total amount of money she will get from selling the rope and then subtract the cost of the new rope.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Sarah will get from selling the rope. The rope is 20 meters long, and her friend wants to buy it for $2 a meter. 

Total money from selling the rope = Length of the rope * Price per meter
Total money from selling the rope = 20 * $2
Total money from selling the rope = $40

Now, let's calculate the cost of the new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 a meter, and Sarah wants to buy a rope of the same length (20 meters).

Cost of the new rope = Length of the new rope * Price per meter
Cost of the new rope = 20 * $1.5
Cost of the new rope = $30

Now, let's subtract the cost of the new rope from the total money Sarah will get from selling the rope to find out how much money she will have left over.

Money left over = Total money from selling the rope - Cost of the new rope
Money left over = $40 - $30
Money left over = $10

"To solve this problem, we need to first find Melanie's current age. Since in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old, we can subtract 10 from 18 to find her current age.

Melanie's current age = 18 - 10 = 8 years old.

Now, we need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her present age. Let's assume the number of years required is 'x'. 

In 'x' years, Melanie's age will be her current age + 'x'. This should be equal to three times her current age.

Current age + x = 3 * Current age
8 + x = 3 * 8
8 + x = 24
x = 24 - 8
x = 16

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's find the cost of the chicken. Since each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, and the 5 packs of bacon cost $10, the cost of one pack of bacon is $10 / 5 = $2. Therefore, the cost of one packet of chicken is $2 * 2 = $4. Since Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, the total cost of the chicken is 6 * $4 = $24.

Next, let's find the cost of the strawberries. Each pack of strawberries costs $4, and Kelly has 3 packs, so the total cost of the strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.

Now, let's find the cost of the apples. Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is $4 / 2 = $2. Since Kelly has 7 packs of apples, the total cost of the apples is 7 * $2 = $14.

The total cost of all the items in Kelly's cart is $10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60.

Kelly's budget is $65, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget: $65 - $60 = $5.

The final answer is: $5"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Let the runtime of Elaina's usual concerts be 'x' minutes. 

Since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, its runtime is 2x minutes. 

At the end of the concert, she performs a 15-minute encore. So, the total runtime of the final concert is 2x + 15 minutes.

We are given that the total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

2x + 15 = 65

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x' on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 15 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 65 - 15
2x = 50

Next, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for 'x':

x = 50 / 2
x = 25

So, Elaina's usual concerts run for 25 minutes.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how many toys Argo has now, we need to subtract the number of toys he gave away from the total number of toys he initially had.

Initially, Argo had 200 toys.

He gave away 40 toys to Alyssa, 80 toys to Bonnie, and 30 toys to Nicky. 

Total toys given away = 40 + 80 + 30 = 150

Now, let's subtract the total toys given away from the initial number of toys:

200 - 150 = 50

So, Argo has 50 toys now.

"To find the number of pairs of microphones that can be arranged, we first need to find the total number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs. Since 20% of the microphones won't fit, we can find the number of microphones that won't fit by calculating 20% of 50.

20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10

So, 10 microphones won't fit. This means that 50 - 10 = 40 microphones will be arranged in pairs.

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, we can find the number of pairs by dividing the number of microphones that will be arranged in pairs by 2.

Number of pairs = 40 / 2 = 20

"To find the total number of birds, we need to calculate the number of birds in each group and add them together.

First, Jerry counts 6 birds nesting in the bushes.

Next, 2/3rd of the number of birds nesting in the bushes are flying overhead. To find this number, we multiply 6 by 2/3:
6 * (2/3) = 4

So, there are 4 birds flying overhead.

Then, Jerry sees 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. To find the total number of birds in these groups, we multiply 8 by 3:
8 * 3 = 24

Now, we add the number of birds in each group together:
6 (nesting) + 4 (flying) + 24 (feeding) = 34

"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to determine the speed of the thingamabob first. Since the whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob, and the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, we can set up an equation to find the speed of the thingamabob.

Let's denote the speed of the thingamabob as x. Then, the speed of the whatchamacallit is 11x. We know that the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, so we can set up the equation:

11x = 121

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 11:

x = 121 / 11
x = 11

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob is 11 meters per second, we can find the speed of the whirligig. The whirligig spins at five times the speed of the thingamabob, so we multiply the speed of the thingamabob by 5:

Speed of whirligig = 5 * 11
Speed of whirligig = 55

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the price of one carrot as 'c'. Since the yogurt is half the price of the salad, the price of the yogurt is $6 / 2 = $3.

Ellen eats two carrots every day, so the total cost of carrots is 2c.

The total cost of the salad and yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9.

Since Ellen pays a total of $11 for her goods, the cost of the carrots can be found by subtracting the cost of the salad and yogurt from the total cost: 2c = $11 - $9 = $2.

To find the price of one carrot, we divide the total cost of carrots by 2: c = $2 / 2 = $1.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn. Let's denote the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. 

Since she mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as Joe's, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times. 

The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.

The total number of lawns she mowed is the sum of the lawns she mowed each week, which is 3x + x + 5x = 9x.

We know that she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn, and since she mowed Joe's lawn 'x' times, she made a total of $6x from mowing lawns.

We also know that she made $80 in total from both lemonade sales and mowing lawns. So, we can set up the equation:

"To find John's total monthly income from renting out his car, we need to calculate the total number of hours he rents his car and multiply it by his hourly rate.

He rents his car 10 times a month for 3 hours each time, so the total number of hours is:
10 rentals/month * 3 hours/rental = 30 hours/month

His hourly rate is $25, so his total monthly income is:
30 hours/month * $25/hour = $750/month

To find his profit, we need to subtract his car payment from his total monthly income:
Profit = Total monthly income - Car payment
Profit = $750 - $500
Profit = $250

The final answer is: $250"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Martha initially had an unknown number of notebooks, but we know that Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha. If we denote Martha's initial number of notebooks as 'x', then Joseph had 3x notebooks.

After buying 5 more notebooks, Martha now has a total of 7 notebooks. This means that her initial number of notebooks (x) plus the 5 notebooks she bought equals 7. We can write this as an equation: x + 5 = 7.

To find the value of x, we subtract 5 from both sides of the equation: x = 7 - 5, which gives us x = 2. This means Martha initially had 2 notebooks.

Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, and Martha initially had 2 notebooks, Joseph had 3 * 2 = 6 notebooks.

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph. Martha has 7 notebooks, and Joseph has 6 notebooks. The difference between their notebooks is 7 - 6 = 1.

"To find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we first need to determine the distance rowed by Anis. 

Dijana rowed 50 miles. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. To find 1/5 of Dijana's distance, we multiply 50 by 1/5, which is 10 miles. 

Since Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, we add the 1/5 of Dijana's distance to Dijana's distance. So, Anis rowed 50 + 10 = 60 miles.

Now, we add the distances rowed by Dijana and Anis to find the total distance. The total distance is 50 + 60 = 110 miles.

The final answer is: 110"
"To find out how many cookies each of Susan's nephews will get, we first need to determine the total number of cookies available after her husband took some. 

Initially, Susan had 100 cookies. Her husband took 4 cookies, so the total number of cookies left is 100 - 4 = 96.

Since Susan wants to divide the cookies equally among her 6 nephews, we need to divide the remaining cookies by 6. 

96 ÷ 6 = 16

So, each of Susan's nephews will get 16 cookies.

"To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we need to calculate the total number of pages each of them read.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. 

Today, Denise read 5 more than as many pages as Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read 5 + 13 = 18 pages today.

So, Denise's total pages read is 10 (yesterday) + 18 (today) = 28 pages.

Daniel's total pages read is 13 (yesterday) + 0 (today) = 13 pages.

The difference in the number of pages read by Denise and Daniel is 28 - 13 = 15.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of bowls that can be filled with the leftover soup and then divide that by the number of child-sized bowls.

Since the pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls, we can assume that the capacity of the pot is equivalent to 8 child bowls.

Calvin, his wife, and their two children will eat a total of 3 adult bowls (Calvin and his wife) + 2 child bowls (the two children) = 5 bowls.

Since the pot can fill 8 child bowls, the leftover soup will be 8 - 5 = 3 child bowls.

To find out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, we divide the leftover child bowls by the number of children: 3 / 2 = 1.5.

Since we can't have a fraction of a bowl, we can say that each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch once, and there will be half a bowl left over.

However, if we are looking for the number of times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, we can say that each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch 1 time.

"To find out how much material Jo needs, we need to calculate the total amount of material required for small and large masks separately and then add them together.

For small masks, Jo needs 2 yards of material to make 4 masks. To find out how much material is needed for 20 small masks, we can set up a proportion:

2 yards / 4 masks = x yards / 20 masks

Cross-multiplying, we get:
2 * 20 = 4x
40 = 4x
Dividing both sides by 4, we get:
x = 10 yards

So, Jo needs 10 yards of material to make 20 small masks.

For large masks, Jo needs 2.25 yards of material to make 3 masks. To find out how much material is needed for 8 large masks, we can set up a proportion:

2.25 yards / 3 masks = x yards / 8 masks

Cross-multiplying, we get:
2.25 * 8 = 3x
18 = 3x
Dividing both sides by 3, we get:
x = 6 yards

So, Jo needs 6 yards of material to make 8 large masks.

Now, we add the material needed for small and large masks together:
10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards

"To find Harold's free time, we need to calculate the total time he spends on activities and subtract that from the total hours in a day (24 hours).

Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night. 
He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for 10 - 2 = 8 hours a day.
He walks his dog for 1 hour a day.

Total time spent on activities = 10 (sleep) + 8 (work) + 1 (walking dog) = 19 hours

Free time = Total hours in a day - Total time spent on activities
Free time = 24 - 19
Free time = 5 hours

So, Tim used 3 red shoeboxes for fishing.

Now, let's find out how many blue shoeboxes are left. 
Total blue shoeboxes = 7
Blue shoeboxes used = 3
Blue shoeboxes left = 7 - 3 = 4

Now, let's find out how many red shoeboxes are left.

"To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we need to first calculate how many marbles he gave away. 

Dean gives 1/5 of his marbles to Jamie. Since Dean has 30 marbles, we can calculate 1/5 of 30 as follows: 
1/5 * 30 = 30 / 5 = 6

So, Dean gives 6 marbles to Jamie. 

Then, he gives 10 marbles to Donald. 

Now, we need to find out how many marbles Dean has left. We can do this by subtracting the total number of marbles given away from the initial number of marbles Dean had. 
Total marbles given away = 6 (to Jamie) + 10 (to Donald) = 16
Initial marbles = 30
Marbles left = Initial marbles - Total marbles given away
Marbles left = 30 - 16
Marbles left = 14

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Duncan's current age as D and Adam's current age as A.

We are given that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. This can be expressed as:

D - 8 = 2(A - 4)

We are also given that Duncan's current age is 60. So, we can substitute D = 60 into the equation:

60 - 8 = 2(A - 4)

Simplifying the equation:

52 = 2(A - 4)

Divide both sides by 2:

26 = A - 4

Add 4 to both sides:

30 = A

So, Adam's current age is 30.

To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

30 + 8 = 38

"To find out how much Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday, we need to calculate the total number of packages he completes in that time and then multiply it by his hourly wage.

First, let's find out how many packages Colby completes in an hour. He completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, so we can write this as:

Packages per hour = 50 - 10
Packages per hour = 40

Now, let's calculate the total number of packages Colby completes in an 8-hour workday:

Total packages per day = Packages per hour * 8
Total packages per day = 40 * 8
Total packages per day = 320

Since Colby gets paid $0.20 for every package he completes, we can multiply the total number of packages by his hourly wage to find his daily earnings:

Daily earnings = Total packages per day * $0.20
Daily earnings = 320 * $0.20
Daily earnings = $64

The final answer is: $64"
"To find out how many bottles of water John drinks, we need to calculate the time it takes to solve the extreme sudoku and then divide it by the time it takes to drink one bottle of water.

A normal sudoku takes 45 minutes, and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long, so the time to solve an extreme sudoku is 45 * 4 = 180 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we need to convert the time to solve the extreme sudoku to hours and then divide by 0.5 (since there are 2 half hours in an hour). 

180 minutes is equal to 3 hours (180 / 60 = 3). 

Now, we divide 3 hours by 0.5 to find out how many half hours are in 3 hours: 3 / 0.5 = 6.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, he drinks 6 bottles of water in 3 hours.

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of yellow balloons as 'y'. We know that Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces at each yellow balloon. Since there are 20 red balloons, the total number of bologna pieces thrown at red balloons is 2 * 20 = 40. 

The total number of bologna pieces thrown at all balloons is 58. Since Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, the total number of bologna pieces thrown at yellow balloons is 3y. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 40 + 3y = 58.

Now, we can solve for 'y' by subtracting 40 from both sides of the equation: 3y = 58 - 40, which simplifies to 3y = 18. 

To find the value of 'y', we divide both sides of the equation by 3: y = 18 / 3, which simplies to y = 6.

"To find out how many tune-ups Jon needs in a 30-day month, we need to calculate the total miles driven in that time. 

Since Jon drives 100 miles a day, the total miles driven in 30 days is 100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles.

Given that Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we can divide the total miles driven by the interval between tune-ups to find out how many tune-ups are needed.

3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3 tune-ups.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount of money Julia and Nadine had, and then divide it by 2 to find out how much each of them received as allowance.

First, let's calculate the cost of the balloons. 1 dozen balloons is equal to 12 balloons. Since 2 balloons cost $0.5, we can find the cost of 1 balloon by dividing $0.5 by 2, which is $0.25. Now, we can find the cost of 12 balloons by multiplying the cost of 1 balloon by 12, which is $0.25 * 12 = $3.

The total cost of the cake and the balloons is $11 + $3 = $14. The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is $7 * 2 = $14. Since the total cost of the cake, balloons, and ice cream is $14, this means that the remaining money was used to buy these items, and the total amount of money they had was $14 + $14 = $28.

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowance to buy these items, the total amount of money they had is the total cost of the items they bought, which is $28. To find out how much each of them received as allowance, we need to divide the total amount of money by 2, which is $28 / 2 = $14.

Since Martha started collecting shells at 5 years old and we want to know the total by her 10th birthday, we need to consider the months from her 5th birthday to her 10th birthday.

There are 12 months in a year. From her 5th birthday to her 10th birthday, Martha would have been 5 years old for 1 year, 6 years old for 1 year, 7 years old for 1 year, 8 years old for 1 year, and 9 years old for 1 year. 

So, the total number of months is 5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months.

Since Martha collects one shell every month, the total number of shells she has collected is equal to the total number of months she has been collecting shells.

Therefore, Martha has collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday.

Since Lana creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, the number of mint tea cups in each row will be half of the total cups in each row.

9 cups per row / 2 = 4.5 cups of mint tea per row

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a cup, we can assume that Lana will make whole cups of tea. This means that she will make 4 cups of mint tea in each row and 5 cups of chamomile tea in each row, as the total number of cups in each row is 9.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip. 

Let's denote the number of berries the sloth picks up per trip as 'x'. Since the sloth takes 4 hours for a round trip, in 8 hours, he can make 8/4 = 2 trips. 

Since the sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, and he makes 2 trips, the total number of berries he picks up in 8 hours is 2x. 

We can set up the equation 2x = 24 to find the minimum number of berries he can pick up per trip. 

Solving for x, we get x = 24/2 = 12.

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3 of that, so the calories of a mini blueberry muffin are 450 * (1/3) = 150 calories.

Now, we can calculate the total calories of each type of pastry. The total calories of the mini cinnamon rolls are 200 * 200 = 40,000 calories. The total calories of the mini blueberry muffins are 150 * 300 = 45,000 calories.

The total calories of all the pastries are the sum of the calories of the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins, which is 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories.

The final answer is: 85000"
"To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed and then divide it by the number of days.

On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday, she removed twice as many as Monday, so 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs.
On Wednesday, she removed twice as many as Tuesday, so 2 * 78 = 156 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 78 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 378

There are 5 days in total. 

Average number of Junebugs removed per day = Total Junebugs removed / Number of days
= 378 / 5
= 75.6

The final answer is: 75.6"
"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to calculate the total distance each vehicle traveled.

The bus travels at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours. To find the distance traveled by the bus, we multiply the speed by the time: 60 miles/hour * 5 hours = 300 miles.

The car travels at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours. To find the distance traveled by the car, we multiply the speed by the time: 30 miles/hour * 8 hours = 240 miles.

Now, we need to find the difference in distance between the bus and the car. To do this, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus: 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles.

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car.

"To find the number of bouncy balls, we need to subtract the total number of toys Sophie had before buying the bouncy balls from the total number of toys she has now. 

The total number of toys before buying the bouncy balls is the sum of the blocks, stuffed animals, and stacking rings. 

Total toys before = 31 (blocks) + 8 (stuffed animals) + 9 (stacking rings) = 48

Now, we subtract this from the total number of toys after buying the bouncy balls to find the number of bouncy balls.

Number of bouncy balls = Total toys after - Total toys before
= 62 - 48
= 14

The final answer is: 14"
"Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as p, and John's age as j. 

We are given that Paul is 10 years older than John, so we can write an equation: p = j + 10.

We are also given that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age, so we can write another equation: P = p + j.

We are also given that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and John is 100 years old, so we can write a third equation: P + p + j = 100.

Now we can substitute the first equation into the second equation to get: P = (j + 10) + j.

Simplifying the equation, we get: P = 2j + 10.

Now we can substitute the expression for P into the third equation: (2j + 10) + (j + 10) + j = 100.

Combine like terms: 4j + 20 = 100.

Subtract 20 from both sides: 4j = 80.

Divide both sides by 4: j = 20.

Now that we know John's age, we can find Paul's age using the first equation: p = j + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30.

Finally, we can find Peter's age using the second equation: P = p + j = 30 + 20 = 50.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total number of balloons, we need to calculate the initial number of balloons and then add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, Maria had 1 water balloon, and each of her 4 friends had 2 water balloons. So, the total number of balloons initially is:
1 (Maria's balloon) + (4 friends * 2 balloons per friend) = 1 + 8 = 9 balloons

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional balloons is:
5 people * 3 balloons per person = 15 balloons

Now, we add the initial number of balloons to the additional balloons:
9 (initial balloons) + 15 (additional balloons) = 24 balloons

The final answer is: 24"
"To find out how many tables they need, we first need to calculate the total number of boxes of stuff they have. 

10 people donate 5 boxes each, so they have 10 * 5 = 50 boxes from donations. 
They already have 10 boxes, so the total number of boxes is 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

Since they can fit 2 boxes per table, they will need 60 / 2 = 30 tables.

However, they already own 15 tables. To find out how many new tables they need, we subtract the number of tables they own from the total number of tables needed: 30 - 15 = 15.

Therefore, they need 15 new tables.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the average total distance spat, we need to calculate the total distance spat by each person and then divide it by the total number of seeds spat.

Zoey spits 40 seeds, each 10 feet, so the total distance spat by Zoey is 40 * 10 = 400 feet.

Sydney spits 35 seeds, each 12 feet, so the total distance spat by Sydney is 35 * 12 = 420 feet.

The total distance spat by both Zoey and Sydney is 400 + 420 = 820 feet.

The total number of seeds spat is 40 + 35 = 75.

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the total distance spat by the total number of seeds spat: 820 / 75 = 10.93 (rounded to two decimal places).

The final answer is: 10.93"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine in a month and then find the difference in revenue.

First, let's calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine in a month:

"To find out how much Cameron would save, we first need to calculate the cost of his stay with the option of adding 70 pesos for every hour after the 12-hour mark and then compare it to the cost of paying for a 24-hour stay.

Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours. Since the first 12 hours are already included in the initial charge, he needs to pay for the additional 5 hours.

The cost for the additional 5 hours is 5 * 70 = 350 pesos.

The total cost for Cameron's stay would be 1000 (initial 12-hour charge) + 350 (additional 5 hours) = 1350 pesos.

Now, let's compare this to the cost of paying for a 24-hour stay, which is 1600 pesos.

The amount Cameron would save is 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

The final numerical answer is: 250"
"To find the total amount of hay needed, we first need to calculate the amount each sheep needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds and each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, we can calculate the amount each sheep needs as follows:

Each goat needs 5 pounds, so twice that amount is 5 * 2 = 10 pounds. Three pounds less than that is 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep separately:

For the goats: 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds
For the sheep: 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds

To find the total amount of hay needed, we add the amount needed for the goats and the sheep:

75 pounds (goats) + 84 pounds (sheep) = 159 pounds

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate John's total earnings, subtract his expenses, and then determine how much money he has left to spend on pens and pencils.

First, let's calculate John's total earnings: 
50 dollars/hour * 6 hours = 300 dollars

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the pencils: 
5 pencils * 10 dollars/pencil = 50 dollars

Now, let's subtract John's gas expenses and the cost of the pencils from his total earnings: 
300 dollars - 50 dollars - 50 dollars = 200 dollars

John wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so we subtract that from his remaining money: 
200 dollars - 100 dollars = 100 dollars

Finally, let's determine how many 25 dollar pens John can buy with the remaining money: 
100 dollars / 25 dollars = 4

"To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has left, we first need to determine the total number of bottles she has initially and then subtract the number of bottles given to the students.

The teacher has 9 coupons, each redeemable for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles she has initially is 9 * 100 = 900 bottles.

Each of the 29 students receives 2 bottles of apple juice, so the total number of bottles given to the students is 29 * 2 = 58 bottles.

To find out how many bottles the teacher has left, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles she initially had: 900 - 58 = 842.

"To find the total amount Patty charged, we need to calculate the labor cost and add it to the cost of parts. 

The labor cost is $35 per hour, and the job took 2.25 hours. Since the labor is charged per hour or part thereof, we need to round up to the nearest hour for the labor cost. However, in this case, 2.25 hours is less than 3 hours, so we can simply multiply 2.25 hours by $35 per hour.

Labor cost = 2.25 hours * $35 per hour = $78.75

The cost of parts is $60.

Total cost = Labor cost + Cost of parts
Total cost = $78.75 + $60
Total cost = $138.75

"To find out how much James spent on the CDs, we need to calculate the original price and then subtract the discount. 

The original price of each CD is $15. Since James bought 10 CDs, the total original price is 10 * $15 = $150.

James gets a 40% discount on the total price. To find the discount amount, we multiply the total original price by the discount percentage (40% or 0.4): $150 * 0.4 = $60.

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the price James paid: $150 - $60 = $90.

James decides to sell 5 CDs for $40 each. To find the total amount he gets from selling these CDs, we multiply the number of CDs by the selling price: 5 * $40 = $200.

To find out how much money James was out, we subtract the amount he got from selling the CDs from the price he paid for all the CDs: $90 - $200 = -$110.

However, since James can't be out a negative amount of money, this means he actually lost money. The correct interpretation is that he spent $110 more than he got back.

The final answer is: $110"

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's calculate the time James takes to swim 60% of the distance. The total distance is 20 miles, and 60% of that is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles. 

Since James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time taken to swim 12 miles is 12 / 2 = 6 hours.

After swimming 12 miles, James rests for half the time he spent swimming. So, he rests for 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

Now, James has to swim the remaining 20 - 12 = 8 miles. However, he swims at half the speed, which is 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour. 

The time taken to swim the remaining 8 miles is 8 / 1 = 8 hours.

The total time taken is the sum of the swimming time, resting time, and the time taken to swim the remaining distance. So, the total time is 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.

"To find out how many points Azibo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Bahati and Dinar. 

Let's denote the points scored by Dinar as x. Since Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, Bahati's points can be represented as x + 10. 

We also know that Azibo scored 20 more points than Bahati, so Azibo's points can be represented as (x + 10) + 20 = x + 30.

The total points scored by the team is 45, which is the sum of the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar. Therefore, we can write the equation: x + (x + 10) + (x + 30) = 45.

Subtract 40 from both sides: 3x = 5.

Divide both sides by 3: x = 5/3.

However, x represents the points scored by Dinar, which cannot be a fraction. This indicates that the initial assumption of x being the points scored by Dinar is incorrect. 

Let's re-evaluate the problem. If Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, and 10 more points than Dinar, we can represent Bahati's points as x + 10 and Azibo's points as (x + 10) - 20 = x - 10.

The total points scored by the team is 45, which is the sum of the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar. Therefore, we can write the equation: (x + 10) + (x - 10) + Dinar's points = 45.

Since Dinar's points are not known, let's represent them as y. The equation becomes: x + 10 + x - 10 + y = 45.

Let's re-evaluate the problem again. We know that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo and 10 more points than Dinar. This means that the difference between Bahati's and Azibo's points is 20, and the difference between Bahati's and Dinar's points is 10.

Let's represent Dinar's points as x. Then Bahati's points can be represented as x + 10.

The total points scored by the team is 45, which is the sum of the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar. Therefore, we can write the equation: (x + 10) + Azibo's points + x = 45.

Let's represent Azibo's points as y. The equation becomes: x + 10 + y + x = 45.

Combine like terms: 2x + y + 10 = 45.

Subtract 10 from both sides: 2x + y = 35.

We also know that the difference between Bahati's and Azibo's points is 20, and the difference between Bahati's and Dinar's points is 10. This means that Azibo's points are 10 less than Bahati's points, and 20 less than Dinar's points.

Let's represent Azibo's points as x. Then Bahati's points can be represented as x + 10, and Dinar's points can be represented as x + 30.

The total points scored by the team is 45, which is the sum of the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar. Therefore, we can write the equation: (x + 10) + x + (x + 30) = 45.

Combine like terms: 3x + 40 = 45.

Subtract 40 from both sides: 3x = 5.

Divide both sides by 3: x = 5/3.

The total points scored by the team is 45, which is the sum of the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar. Therefore, we can write the equation: (x + 20) + x + Dinar's points = 45.

Since Dinar's points are not known, let's represent them as y. The equation becomes: x + 20 + x + y = 45.

Combine like terms: 2x + y + 20 = 45.

Subtract 20 from both sides: 2x + y = 25.

We also know that the difference between Bahati's and Azibo's points is 20, and the difference between Bahati's and Dinar's points is 10. This means that Azibo's points are 10 less than Bahati's points, and 20 less than Dinar's points.

Let's represent Azibo's points as x. Then Bahati's points can be represented as x + 20, and Dinar's points can be represented as x + 30.

The total points scored by the team is 45, which is the sum of the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar. Therefore, we can write the equation: (x + 20) + x + (x + 30) = 45.

Combine like terms: 3x + 50 = 45.

Subtract 50 from both sides: 3x = -5.

Divide both sides by 3: x = -5/3.

"To find the total number of pages in the book, we need to calculate the total number of pages per inch and then multiply it by the thickness of the book in inches.

Since each paper is 100 pages to the inch and each paper is printed on both sides, we have 200 pages per inch (100 pages per side). 

Given that the book is 1.5 inches thick, we can multiply the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book:

200 pages/inch * 1.5 inches = 300 pages

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the total number of reports Vince stapled, we need to calculate the total time he spent stapling reports and then multiply it by the rate at which he staples reports.

First, let's find the total time Vince spent stapling reports. He stapled from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is a total of 15 hours.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 15 hours by 60 minutes to get the total minutes:
15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Now, we know that Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find the total number of reports he stapled, we need to multiply the total minutes by the rate at which he staples reports and then divide by the time it takes him to staple 30 reports.

First, let's find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes:
900 minutes / 15 minutes = 60 intervals

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we multiply the number of intervals by 30:
60 intervals * 30 reports/interval = 1800 reports

The final answer is: 1800"
"To find the total time Kim slept on her bed, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m., which is a total of 8 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she usually sleeps for 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, that day she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 5:55 a.m. instead of 6 a.m. This means she slept from 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m., which is a total of 7 hours and 55 minutes. Converting this to minutes, we get 7 * 60 + 55 = 455 minutes.

Now, we need to subtract the time she was sleepwalking, which was from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. This is a total of 23 minutes.

So, the total time she slept on her bed that day is 455 - 23 = 432 minutes.

The final answer is: 432"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many measuring spoons Jonathan has initially. 

Since Jonathan has two dozen cups, and one dozen equals 12, he has 2 * 12 = 24 measuring cups.

It is given that Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. So, the number of measuring spoons he has is 2/3 * 24 = 16.

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, Jonathan is left with 16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons.

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is the sum of the measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons, which is 24 + 10 = 34.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we first need to calculate the number of occupied beds and then subtract it from the total capacity.

The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 of them are occupied. 

1/5 of 1000 is 100. So, the number of occupied beds is 100.

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, we need to calculate the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks is 14 days.

The total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks is 50 * 14 = 700.

Now, we add the initial occupied beds (100) to the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks (700) to get the total occupied beds after 2 weeks.

Total occupied beds = 100 + 700 = 800

Now, we subtract the total occupied beds from the total capacity to get the number of unoccupied beds.

Total unoccupied beds = 1000 - 800 = 200

The final answer is: 200"
"To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we first need to determine the number of non-work emails she sends. 

She sends 16 emails a day, and 7 of them are work emails. So, the number of non-work emails is 16 - 7 = 9.

Two-thirds of the remainder (non-work emails) are to her family. This means 2/3 * 9 = 6 emails are to her family.

The remaining non-work emails (after subtracting the ones to her family) are to her boyfriend. Since 6 emails are to her family, the number of emails to her boyfriend is 9 - 6 = 3.

The final answer is: 3"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Shawna's age, and then use that to find her father's age.

Given that Aliya is 3 years old, and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, we can find Shawna's age by multiplying Aliya's age by 3.

Shawna's age = 3 * Aliya's age
Shawna's age = 3 * 3
Shawna's age = 9

Now that we know Shawna's age, we can find her father's age by multiplying Shawna's age by 5.

Shawna's father's age = 5 * Shawna's age
Shawna's father's age = 5 * 9
Shawna's father's age = 45

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number reported by Courtney and subtract it from her total.

Let's denote the actual number of people as 'x'. Since Courtney reported 48 people, and Kelly said she overstated by 20%, we can set up the equation:

48 = x + (20% of x)

To find 20% of x, we multiply x by 0.20:

48 = x + 0.20x

Combine like terms:

48 = 1.20x

Now, divide both sides by 1.20 to solve for x:

x = 48 / 1.20
x = 40

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations. Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey picked up as x. Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jason picked up 2x balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan picked up 2 * 2x = 4x balls.

We know that the total number of balls picked up by the three boys is equal to the sum of the balls each of them picked up. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + 4x = total number of balls

Since Jason had picked up 2 balls, we can substitute 2 for 2x in the equation:

x + 2 + 4x = total number of balls

Combine like terms:

5x + 2 = total number of balls

We also know that the total number of balls is equal to the sum of the balls each of them picked up, which is 2 (Jason) + 4x (Jeffrey) + 2x (Jason) + x (Jeffrey). Since Jason had picked up 2 balls, we can substitute 2 for 2x in the equation:

2 + 4x + 2 + x = total number of balls

Combine like terms:

6x + 4 = total number of balls

Now we have two equations:

5x + 2 = total number of balls
6x + 4 = total number of balls

Since both equations are equal to the total number of balls, we can set them equal to each other:

5x + 2 = 6x + 4

Subtract 5x from both sides:

2 = x + 4

Subtract 4 from both sides:

-2 = x

Since the number of balls cannot be negative, we made an error in our previous steps. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

We know that Jason had picked up 2 balls, and Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey. Therefore, Jeffrey picked up 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, Jordan picked up 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

Now we can find the total number of balls:

Total number of balls = 1 (Jeffrey) + 2 (Jason) + 4 (Jordan)
Total number of balls = 7

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day and then determine how many holes were dug on the fourth day.

The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day, 13 holes on the second day, and 8 holes on the third day. However, they filled in 2 holes on the third day. So, the total number of holes at the end of the third day is:

10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29

The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is:

4 * 10 = 40

Since there were 29 holes at the end of the third day, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:

40 - 29 = 11

Therefore, the pirates dug 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.

The final answer is: 11"
"Let's denote the number of corn chips that Amora and Lainey got as 'x'. Since Collins got 15 more corn chips than the others, Collins got x + 15 corn chips.

We are given that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, so we can set up the equation:

x = 70

Since Collins got x + 15 corn chips, we can set up the equation for Collins' share as well:

x + 15 = 70 + 15 (since Amora and Lainey got 70 each)

Simplifying the equation for Collins' share, we get:

x + 15 = 85

Now, we can solve for x by subtracting 15 from both sides of the equation:

x = 85 - 15
x = 70

This confirms that Amora and Lainey indeed got 70 corn chips each.

Now, let's find the total number of corn chips. We know that Collins got 85 corn chips, and Amora and Lainey got 70 each. So, the total number of corn chips is:

Total = x + (x + 15) + x
Total = 70 + 85 + 70
Total = 225

The final answer is: 225"
"To find the cost of travel, we need to determine the total cost of supplies and then calculate 50% more than that amount.

The total cost of supplies is $400. 

To find 50% of $400, we multiply $400 by 0.5 (since 50% is equivalent to 0.5). 
$400 * 0.5 = $200

Now, we add the 50% more to the original cost of supplies to find the total cost of travel.
$400 + $200 = $600

The cost of travel is $600."
"Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, Stan as S, and Alex as X. We are given the following information:

1. X + S + A = 339 (Total number of Pokémon caught)
2. X = S + 5 (Alex has caught 5 more than Stan)
3. S = 4A - 13 (Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe)

From equation (3), we can express S in terms of A: S = 4A - 13.

Now, substitute S in equation (2) with 4A - 13: X = (4A - 13) + 5
X = 4A - 8

Now, substitute X and S in equation (1) with their expressions in terms of A: (4A - 8) + (4A - 13) + A = 339
Combine like terms: 9A - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides: 9A = 360

Divide by 9: A = 40

Now that we have A, we can find S: S = 4A - 13
S = 4(40) - 13
S = 160 - 13
S = 147

The final answer is: 147"
"To find the total number of episodes, we need to determine the number of episodes that is half the length of a single episode. Since each episode is 20 minutes long, half of that would be 20 / 2 = 10 minutes. However, this is the length of a single episode, not the number of episodes. 

Let's denote the number of episodes as 'x'. Since there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, we can set up the equation: x = 20 / 2. However, this equation is incorrect because it's asking for the number of episodes, not the length of an episode. 

The correct equation should be: x = 20 / x. This equation is based on the fact that there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. Solving for x, we get x^2 = 20. 

Taking the square root of both sides, we get x = √20. Simplifying the square root, we get x = √(4*5) = √4 * √5 = 2√5. 

However, the number of episodes must be a whole number, so we need to find the number of episodes that is closest to 2√5. Since 2√5 is approximately 4.47, the number of episodes is 5 (rounding up to the nearest whole number).

Now that we know the number of episodes, we can find the total number of minutes John will spend watching the show. The total number of minutes is the number of episodes multiplied by the length of each episode: 5 * 20 = 100 minutes.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in the southerly direction and then add it to the distance traveled in the northerly direction.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled in the southerly direction for the first 10 hours at 30 miles per hour:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 10 hours
Distance = 300 miles

Then, the bird flies towards the north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour. Since this is in the opposite direction, we subtract this distance from the previous distance:

Distance traveled in the southerly direction = 300 miles
Distance traveled in the northerly direction = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours = 36 miles
Net distance traveled in the southerly direction = 300 miles - 36 miles = 264 miles

Finally, the bird flies towards the south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour. We add this distance to the net distance traveled in the southerly direction:

Net distance traveled in the southerly direction = 264 miles
Distance traveled in the final southerly direction = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours = 110 miles
Total distance = 264 miles + 110 miles = 374 miles

"To find the total number of brownies Greta had left over, we need to calculate the total number of brownies she received and subtract the number of brownies eaten.

Greta made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies for herself, which is 12 brownies. 

At her office, they sent her home with 1/2 a dozen brownies, which is 6 brownies. 

Her friends had 4 dozen brownies waiting at home, which is 48 brownies.

So, the total number of brownies Greta received is 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies.

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies.

To find the number of brownies Greta had left over, we subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies she received: 66 - 18 = 48.

"To find the total age of all three family members, we need to find the age of Nani's brother and sister first.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 2 * 8 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means her age is 75% of Nani's age. To find 75% of Nani's age, we multiply his age by 0.75: 8 * 0.75 = 6 years.

Now, we have the ages of all three family members: Nani (8 years), his brother (16 years), and his sister (6 years). 

The total age of all three family members is 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first two phones and the cost of the remaining phones. 

The first two phones cost the full price of $600 each, so the total cost for the first two phones is 2 * $600 = $1200.

The remaining phones are 2 (for the kids and the wife), and each of these phones is half the price of the first two. So, the price of each of these phones is $600 / 2 = $300.

The total cost for the remaining phones is 2 * $300 = $600.

The total cost for all phones is the sum of the cost of the first two phones and the cost of the remaining phones: $1200 + $600 = $1800.

"To find the total number of players in both teams, we first need to determine the number of players on Zeke's team. Since Carlton's team has 13 players and Zeke's team has 7 more players, we can calculate the number of players on Zeke's team by adding 7 to 13.

Number of players on Zeke's team = 13 + 7 = 20

Now, to find the total number of players in both teams, we add the number of players on Zeke's team to the number of players on Carlton's team.

Total number of players = 20 (Zeke's team) + 13 (Carlton's team) = 33

"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2l + 2w, where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the length (l) is 15 feet and the width (w) is 10 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

P = 2(15) + 2(10)
P = 30 + 20
P = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

Total slats = 50 * 2
Total slats = 100

"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we first need to determine the total number of oranges she had initially. Since she bought 12 boxes of oranges, and each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges is:

12 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 240 oranges

Next, Mrs. Harrington gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes each, which is a total of 4 boxes. Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges given away is:

4 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 80 oranges

Now, we subtract the number of oranges given away from the total number of oranges to find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington had left:

240 oranges - 80 oranges = 160 oranges

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the remaining oranges, which is:

160 oranges * 1/4 = 40 oranges

To find out how many oranges she sold, we subtract the number of oranges she kept from the remaining oranges:

160 oranges - 40 oranges = 120 oranges

Mrs. Harrington sold 120 oranges.

"To solve this problem, we need to know the number of states in the USA and India. The USA has 50 states. 

First, let's find half the number of states in the USA: 50 / 2 = 25.

Since India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, we add 4 to 25: 25 + 4 = 29.

Now, we know India has 29 states. To find the total number of states in both countries together, we add the number of states in the USA and India: 50 + 29 = 79.

"To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books. 

The total cost of the books is the sum of the cost of the dictionary, the dinosaur book, and the children's cookbook. 

Total cost = $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39

Since Tyler has already saved $14 from his allowance, we need to subtract this from the total cost to find out how much more he needs to earn.

Amount needed to earn = Total cost - Amount saved = $39 - $14 = $25

Now, we can find out how many hours Tyler needs to work by dividing the amount he needs to earn by his hourly wage.

Hours needed to work = Amount needed to earn / Hourly wage = $25 / $5 = 5 hours

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many cherries Richard and Jerry have. 

Since Robert has 30 cherries and has 10 more than Richard, we can set up an equation to find out how many cherries Richard has. Let's denote the number of cherries Richard has as R. Then, we have:

R + 10 = 30

Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation, we get:

R = 20

So, Richard has 20 cherries.

Now, we know that the total number of cherries is 60, and Robert and Richard have 30 and 20 cherries respectively. To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we can subtract the total number of cherries Robert and Richard have from the total number of cherries:

60 - (30 + 20) = 60 - 50 = 10

So, Jerry has 10 cherries.

Now, we can find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry by subtracting the number of cherries Jerry has from the number of cherries Robert has:

30 - 10 = 20

Therefore, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many boxes of gingerbread and apple pie Sunny sold on both days and then calculate the total earnings.

Let's denote the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday as G and the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday as A.

We know that on Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread, so G = 10.

We also know that on Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday, and on Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie. This means that A = 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie were sold on Saturday.

On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday is G + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15.

Now we have the number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie sold on both days: 
- Saturday: G = 10, A = 11
- Sunday: G = 15, A = 15

To find the total earnings, we need to multiply the number of boxes sold by the price of each item and add the results together.

The total earnings from gingerbread are (10 * 6) + (15 * 6) = 60 + 90 = 150 dollars.
The total earnings from apple pie are (11 * 15) + (15 * 15) = 165 + 225 = 390 dollars.

The total earnings for two days are 150 + 390 = 540 dollars.

"To determine the total amount of sunscreen needed, we need to calculate the total number of ounces Pamela will use over the 8 days. 

Since she reapplies sunscreen every hour and will be outside 4 hours a day, she will reapply sunscreen 4 times a day. 

Over 8 days, she will reapply sunscreen 4 times/day * 8 days = 32 times.

Since each application is 1 ounce, she will need 32 ounces of sunscreen.

Each bottle contains 8 ounces, so to find out how many bottles she needs, we divide the total ounces needed by the ounces per bottle: 32 ounces / 8 ounces/bottle = 4 bottles.

Therefore, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the price of the red car, we need to calculate 40% of the price of the blue car and subtract it from the price of the blue car.

First, let's find 40% of the price of the blue car:
40% of $100 = 0.4 * $100 = $40

Now, subtract $40 from the price of the blue car to find the price of the red car:
$100 - $40 = $60

So, the price of the red car is $60.

To find the total cost of both cars, add the prices of the red and blue cars:
$60 + $100 = $160

The final numerical answer is: $160"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Emil is 19 years old now.
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
3. When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.

From point 3, we can infer that Emil's brother is currently half of Emil's age when Emil turns 24. Since Emil is 19 now, when he turns 24, he will be 24 - 19 = 5 years older. Therefore, his brother's age when Emil turns 24 will be 5 / 2 = 2.5 years.

Now, we know that when Emil turns 24, his brother will be 2.5 years old. This means that his brother is currently 2.5 - 5 = -2.5 years old when Emil is 19. However, age cannot be negative, so this is a logical contradiction. This means that the initial assumption that Emil's brother is 2.5 years old when Emil turns 24 is incorrect.

Let's re-evaluate the information. If Emil is 19 now and will be half the age of his dad when he turns 24, then his dad's age when Emil turns 24 will be 24 * 2 = 48 years.

Since Emil is 19 now, his dad's current age is 48 - 19 = 29 years.

Now, let's re-evaluate the information that Emil will be twice as old as his brother when he turns 24. If Emil is 24, then his brother will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old. This means that when Emil is 19, his brother is 12 - 5 = 7 years old.

Now we have the ages of Emil's dad and brother: Emil's dad is 29 years old, and his brother is 7 years old.

The sum of their ages is 29 + 7 = 36.

The final answer is: 36"
"To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we need to calculate the number of beads she received from her mother, sister, and friend, and then add them together.

Adrianne's mother gave her 20 beads.
Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the beads together: 20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the total amount of crawfish Joe caught, we need to calculate the amount he caught each day and add them together.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.

On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the amount of crawfish Joe caught each day: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can find the total number of servings by dividing the total amount of crawfish by the serving size: 21 / 3 = 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the number of students leaving early, we first need to find the number of football players, and then add the number of cheerleaders or band members.

First, let's find the number of football players. 20% of 30 students are football players. 

20% of 30 = 0.20 * 30 = 6

So, there are 6 football players.

Next, we need to find the number of remaining students. Since 6 students are football players, the remaining students are 30 - 6 = 24.

Now, 25% of the remaining 24 students are cheerleaders or band members.

25% of 24 = 0.25 * 24 = 6

So, there are 6 cheerleaders or band members.

The total number of students leaving early is the sum of football players and cheerleaders or band members.

6 (football players) + 6 (cheerleaders or band members) = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we need to first find the size of Charlie's boots. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie's boots are size 5, we can multiply 5 by 5 to find Charlie's boot size.

Charlie's boot size = 5 * 5 = 25

Now, we need to find the average size of the two boots. To do this, we add the sizes of the two boots and divide by 2.

Average size = (Sophie's size + Charlie's size) / 2
Average size = (5 + 25) / 2
Average size = 30 / 2
Average size = 15

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to calculate the total space available for plants. Since Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between every plant, we need to subtract the space between plants from the total length of the flower bed.

First, let's convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches, since the width of the plants is given in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches

Now, let's calculate the total space available for plants. We need to subtract the space between plants from the total length of the flower bed. Since there are 17 plants, there will be 16 spaces between them. The space between each plant is 1.5 feet, which is 18 inches (1.5 * 12 = 18). 

Total space available for plants = 1332 inches - (16 * 18 inches) = 1332 - 288 = 1044 inches

Now, let's calculate the number of plants that can fit in the flower bed. The width of each plant is 12 inches, so:

Number of plants = Total space available for plants / Width of each plant
= 1044 / 12
= 87

However, Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she only needs to buy the remaining plants. The number of plants she needs to buy is:

Number of plants to buy = 87 - 17
= 70

Each plant costs $6, so the total amount Pat will spend at the store is:

Total cost = Number of plants to buy * Cost per plant
= 70 * 6
= 420

The final answer is: $420"
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day, we need to calculate 1/2 of the number of pretzels Edgar eats in a day. 

Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day. 
1/2 of 18 is 18 / 2 = 9 pretzels.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we need to multiply the number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day by 7 to find out how many he eats in a week.

9 pretzels/day * 7 days/week = 63 pretzels/week

The final answer is: 63"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of petunias: 
5 baskets * 3 petunias per basket = 15 petunias
Cost of 15 petunias = 15 * $3.00 = $45.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of sweet potato vines:
5 baskets * 2 sweet potato vines per basket = 10 sweet potato vines
Cost of 10 sweet potato vines = 10 * $2.50 = $25.00

Now, let's add the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines together:
Total cost = $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00

The final answer is: $70.00"
"To find out how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we first need to determine how much soil is left after planting the sunflowers and carnations.

The total amount of soil used for sunflowers is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.
The total amount of soil used for carnations is 10 * 1.5 = 15 pounds.
The total amount of soil used for both sunflowers and carnations is 12 + 15 = 27 pounds.

Since they started with a 30-pound bag of soil, the amount of soil left is 30 - 27 = 3 pounds.

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil, so the number of roses they can plant is 3 / 1 = 3.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we first need to calculate how much she sets aside each month for shoes. 

Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month and sets 25% of her paycheck aside for shoes. To find 25% of $2,000.00, we multiply $2,000.00 by 0.25 (since 25% is equivalent to 0.25).

$2,000.00 * 0.25 = $500.00

So, Jessica sets aside $500.00 each month for shoes.

Next, we need to find out how many months are in a year. There are 12 months in a year.

Now, we need to calculate how much Jessica can save for shoes in a year. We multiply the monthly savings by the number of months in a year.

$500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00

Since each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, we can find out how many pairs she can buy by dividing the total savings by the cost of one pair.

$6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two separate tasks: peeling and cooking. 

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp. Emily can peel 6 shrimp a minute, so to find the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp, we divide 90 by 6. 

90 / 6 = 15 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp. Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, so to find the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp, we need to find out how many batches of 30 shrimp she needs to cook. 

90 / 30 = 3 batches

Since each batch takes 10 minutes, we multiply the number of batches by the time per batch.

3 batches * 10 minutes/batch = 30 minutes

However, we need to add the time it takes to peel the shrimp to the time it takes to cook them. 

15 minutes (peeling) + 30 minutes (cooking) = 45 minutes

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

The final answer is: 45"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net change in temperature after the air conditioner has been running and turned off.

First, let's calculate the temperature change when the air conditioner is running on low for 3 hours:

Temperature change on low = -2 degrees/hour * 3 hours = -6 degrees

Next, let's calculate the temperature change when the air conditioner is running on high for 4 hours:

Temperature change on high = -3 degrees/hour * 4 hours = -12 degrees

Now, let's calculate the total temperature change when the air conditioner is running:

Total temperature change while running = -6 degrees + (-12 degrees) = -18 degrees

The air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours, and during this time, the room warmed up at 2 degrees/hour:

Temperature change while off = 2 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 4 degrees

Now, let's calculate the net temperature change:

Net temperature change = Total temperature change while running + Temperature change while off
= -18 degrees + 4 degrees
= -14 degrees

Since the net temperature change is -14 degrees, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the age of Bill's father when Bill saw the comet for the second time. 

Let's denote the age of Bill's father when he saw the comet as 'x'. Since Bill saw the comet when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet, Bill's age at that time is 3x.

We are given that Bill saw the comet for the second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. Since Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old, the time difference between the two sightings is 75 years. 

So, the age of Bill's father when Bill saw the comet for the second time is 30 + 75 = 105 years.

Now, we can set up the equation: 3x = 105, where x is the age of Bill's father when he saw the comet.

Solving for x, we get x = 105 / 3 = 35.

This means Bill's father was 35 years old when he saw the comet. 

Since Bill was 30 years old when his father saw the comet, the age of Bill when his father was 35 is 30 + (35 - 30) = 35.

However, this is the age of Bill when his father saw the comet, not when Bill saw the comet for the first time. 

Since the time between the two sightings is 75 years, we need to subtract 75 from 35 to find the age of Bill when his father saw the comet. However, this is incorrect as we are looking for the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time.

We need to find the age of Bill when his father was 30 years old.

2. Checks for the gas bill: Similarly, since Buford writes a check once per month, he writes 12 checks for the gas bill per year.
3. Checks to the church: Buford writes a check twice per month, so in a year, he writes 2 * 12 = 24 checks to the church.
4. Checks to the pest and lawn service: Buford writes a check quarterly, which means 4 times per year. So, he writes 4 checks to the pest and lawn service per year.

Now, let's add the total number of checks: 
12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn service) = 52

The final answer is: 52"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the total number of flights made by the first plane as 'x'. Since the second plane makes 44 flights, which is half the number of flights made by the first plane, the first plane makes 2 * 44 = 88 flights per day.

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so the number of flights to Greece is (3/4) * 88 = 66.

The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of flights to France is (1/2) * (88 - 66) = (1/2) * 22 = 11.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the individual howling times and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. 
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, we add the individual howling times together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to determine the total amount of money he received from his parents and subtract that from the cost of the trousers.

Adam's mother gave him $6. 
His father gave him twice as much as his mother, so his father gave him 2 * $6 = $12.

The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Since the trousers cost $30, we subtract the amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers to find out how much he had to contribute from his savings: $30 - $18 = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To solve this problem, we can start by representing the ages of the children as variables. Let's denote the age of Wilfred as W. We know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. If we let A be the average age of the group, then Helene's age is 2A.

We are given that the total age of the children is 20. Since there are four children, the average age of the group is the total age divided by 4. Therefore, A = 20/4 = 5.

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group, Helene's age is 2A = 2(5) = 10.

We are also given that Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old. The total age of the group is the sum of the ages of all four children, which is A + A + A + A + W = 20. Since we know A = 5, we can substitute this value into the equation to get 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + W = 20.

Simplifying the equation, we get 20 + W = 20. Subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation, we get W = 0.

However, this result doesn't make sense in the context of the problem, as it implies that Wilfred is 0 years old. Let's re-examine the problem and the equation. The correct equation should be A + A + A + A + W = 20, which is equivalent to 4A + W = 20. We know that A = 5, so we can substitute this value into the equation to get 4(5) + W = 20.

Simplifying the equation, we get 20 + W = 20. Subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation, we get W = 0. However, this result is still incorrect.

Let's re-examine the problem again. We know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group, and the average age of the group is 5. This means that Helene's age is 2(5) = 10.

"To find out how much Walter's lawyer will contribute, we need to calculate the total amount collected from Walter's neighbors and the online fund, and then multiply it by 3.

Walter collects $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. 

Total amount collected so far = $500 + $1500 = $2000

Walter's friend donates $200, but this is not included in the amount that the lawyer will base his donation on. The lawyer will donate three times the amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund, which is $2000.

Lawyer's contribution = 3 * $2000 = $6000

"To find the total number of cookies, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies brought by the guests. Since each guest brought 15 cookies and there were 100 guests, the total number of cookies is 100 * 15 = 1500.

The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door. So, the number of cookies given to the church is 1/2 * 1500 = 750.

Since each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, we can find the number of people in the church by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received. 

Number of people in the church = Total cookies given to the church / Cookies per person
= 750 / 15
= 50

"To solve this problem, let's assume the total number of slices the watermelon is divided into is 'x'. Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices is 2 + 4 = 6.

Let's denote the number of slices each kid gets as 'k'. Since each adult gets twice as big a slice as each kid, the number of slices each adult gets is 2k.

The total number of slices the adults get is 2 * 2k = 4k. The total number of slices the kids get is 4 * k = 4k.

Since the total number of slices is 'x', we can set up the equation: 4k + 4k = x. This simplifies to 8k = x.

Now, we know that the adults get 4k slices, and the total number of slices is 8k. To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to divide the number of slices each adult gets by the total number of slices and multiply by 100.

The percentage of the watermelon each adult gets is (4k / 8k) * 100 = 50%.

Therefore, each adult gets 50% of the watermelon.

"To find out how many hours Doctor Jones has left to update his records, we first need to calculate the total time he spends on rounds and appointments.

Time spent on rounds: 
- Number of inpatients: 9
- Time per inpatient: 20 minutes
- Total time spent on rounds: 9 * 20 = 180 minutes

Time spent on appointments: 
- Number of appointments: 10
- Time per appointment: 30 minutes
- Total time spent on appointments: 10 * 30 = 300 minutes

Total time spent on rounds and appointments: 180 + 300 = 480 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we need to convert the total time spent to hours:
480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Doctor Jones spends 9 hours at the clinic, so we subtract the time spent on rounds and appointments from his total time:
9 - 8 = 1 hour

Therefore, Doctor Jones has 1 hour left to update his records.

"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake, including cooling and frosting. 

First, let's add the time it takes to make the cake batter and bake the cake: 20 minutes (batter) + 30 minutes (baking) = 50 minutes.

Next, we add the time it takes for the cake to cool: 2 hours (cooling) = 120 minutes.

Then, we add the time it takes to frost the cake: 10 minutes (frosting).

Now, we add all the times together: 50 minutes (baking and batter) + 120 minutes (cooling) + 10 minutes (frosting) = 180 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 180 minutes to hours: 180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours.

So, the total time required to make the cake is 3 hours.

To be ready to serve the cake at 5:00 pm, Jordan should start making the cake at 2:00 pm, which is 3 hours before 5:00 pm.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2:00 pm}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as 'x'. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, so she sold 3.5x chocolate bars. 
Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so he sold 4.5x chocolate bars. 
Together, they sold 64 chocolate bars, so the equation is 3.5x + 4.5x = 64.

Combine like terms: 8x = 64.

Now, divide both sides by 8 to solve for x: x = 64 / 8.

x = 8.

The number of chocolate bars in a box is 8.

"To find the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the total cost of the students per session, then multiply it by the number of sessions in a month.

The studio is rented 3 days a week, and there are approximately 4 weeks in a month. So, the total number of sessions in a month is 3 days/week * 4 weeks/month = 12 sessions/month.

The cost of renting the studio per session is $25, and the cost per student per session is $1.50. With 10 students, the total cost per session is $25 (rent) + $1.50 * 10 (students) = $25 + $15 = $40 per session.

The total cost per session is $40, and there are 12 sessions in a month. So, the total cost per month is $40 * 12 = $480.

However, this is the total cost, not the earnings. To find the earnings, we need to consider the revenue generated from the students. Since there are 10 students and each pays an unknown amount per session, let's assume the cost per student per session is $1.50. 

The total revenue per session is $1.50 * 10 (students) = $15 per session. The total revenue per month is $15 * 12 = $180.

The total earnings per month are the total revenue minus the total cost: $180 (revenue) - $480 (cost) = -$300. However, this is a loss, which doesn't make sense in this context. 

Let's re-evaluate the problem. The question asks for the expected earnings, but it doesn't specify the amount each student pays per session. We can assume the students pay a fixed amount per session, or we can assume the students pay a monthly fee. 

If we assume the students pay a fixed amount per session, we can calculate the earnings as follows:

Let x be the amount each student pays per session. The total revenue per session is $1.50 * 10 (students) + x * 10 (students) = $15 + 10x. The total revenue per month is ($15 + 10x) * 12 = $180 + 120x.

The total cost per month is $480. The total earnings per month are the total revenue minus the total cost: ($180 + 120x) - $480 = -$300 + 120x.

To find the minimum amount each student must pay per session to make a profit, we set the earnings greater than zero: -$300 + 120x > 0.

Solving for x, we get 120x > 300, x > 2.5.

So, each student must pay more than $2.50 per session to make a profit.

However, if we assume the students pay a monthly fee, we can calculate the earnings as follows:

Let x be the monthly fee per student. The total revenue per month is 10 * x = 10x. The total earnings per month are the total revenue minus the total cost: 10x - $480.

To find the minimum monthly fee per student to make a profit, we set the earnings greater than zero: 10x - $480 > 0.

Solving for x, we get 10x > $480, x > $48.

So, each student must pay more than $48 per month to make a profit.

Since the question asks for the expected earnings, we need more information about the amount each student pays per session or per month to provide a numerical answer.

However, if we assume the students pay a fixed amount per session, and we want to find the minimum amount each student must pay to break even, we can set the earnings equal to zero: -$300 + 120x = 0.

Solving for x, we get 120x = $300, x = $2.50.

If we assume the students pay a monthly fee, and we want to find the minimum amount each student must pay to break even, we can set the earnings equal to zero: 10x - $480 = 0.

Solving for x, we get 10x = $480, x = $48.

Since we can't provide a numerical answer without more information, I'll provide the minimum amount each student must pay to break even in both scenarios:

If students pay a fixed amount per session: $2.50
If students pay a monthly fee: $48

However, if we assume the students pay a fixed amount per session, and we want to find the total earnings, we can use the minimum amount each student must pay to break even ($2.50) and calculate the total revenue and earnings.

The total revenue per session is $1.50 * 10 (students) + $2.50 * 10 (students) = $15 + $25 = $40 per session. The total revenue per month is $40 * 12 = $480.

The total cost per month is $480. The total earnings per month are the total revenue minus the total cost: $480 - $480 = $0.

"To find the number of female porcupines, we multiply the total population by 3/5. 

Number of female porcupines = 50 * (3/5) = 30

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, the total number of babies born in a month is 30 * 4 = 120.

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is 120 * 12 = 1440.

The total number of porcupines after a year will be the sum of the initial population and the number of babies born in a year. 

Total porcupines after a year = 50 + 1440 = 1490

Area = 350 square feet

Now, we need to multiply the area by the depth to find the volume:
Volume = Area * depth
Volume = 350 * 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company instructed them to multiply the volume by 7.48 (not 5.9) to get the volume in gallons, we need to make a correction. 
Volume in gallons = Volume * 7.48
Volume in gallons = 1400 * 7.48
Volume in gallons = 10472 gallons

Now, we can calculate the cost to fill the pool:
Cost = Volume in gallons * cost per gallon
Cost = 10472 * 0.10
Cost = 1047.2

The final answer is: $1047.20"
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to determine the number of blue and yellow sticks in addition to the 9 red sticks.

First, we know there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks. Since there are 9 red sticks, the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14.

Next, we are told that the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks. So, the number of yellow sticks is 14 - 3 = 11.

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks: 9 (red) + 14 (blue) + 11 (yellow) = 34.

The final answer is: 34"
"To find the distance traveled by Matteo, we multiply his speed by the time he traveled: 55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles.

To find the distance traveled by Shandy, we multiply his speed by the time he traveled: 45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles.

Now, we subtract the distance traveled by Matteo from the distance traveled by Shandy to find the difference: 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles.

The final answer is: 230"
"To find the number of female students, we need to first find the number of students over 16 and under 16, and then calculate the number of female students in each group.

Let's start by finding the number of students over 16 years old. Since half of the students are over 16, we can calculate this as:

3000 / 2 = 1500 students over 16 years old

Now, let's find the number of male students over 16 years old. Since one-fourth of the students over 16 are male, we can calculate this as:

1500 / 4 = 375 male students over 16 years old

Now, let's find the number of female students over 16 years old. Since the remaining students over 16 are female, we can calculate this as:

1500 - 375 = 1125 female students over 16 years old

Next, let's find the number of students under 16 years old. Since the remaining half of the students are under 16, we can calculate this as:

3000 / 2 = 1500 students under 16 years old

Now, let's find the number of male students under 16 years old. Since one-half of the students under 16 are male, we can calculate this as:

1500 / 2 = 750 male students under 16 years old

Now, let's find the number of female students under 16 years old. Since the remaining students under 16 are female, we can calculate this as:

1500 - 750 = 750 female students under 16 years old

Finally, let's find the total number of female students by adding the number of female students over 16 and under 16:

1125 + 750 = 1875

The final answer is: $\boxed{1875}$"
"To find the number of laps each person can run, we need to calculate their individual lap counts based on the given information.

Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.

Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.

Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.

Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

To find the difference in the number of laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract Quinn's lap count from Bethany's lap count: 10 - 5 = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank and subtract it from the tank's capacity.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped into the tank is 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 12000 gallons. 

The remaining amount of water needed to fill the tank is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is: 6000"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as 'x'. 

During the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining will be 100% - (9% * 5) = 100% - 45% = 55%.

Now, for the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining will be 55% - (7% * 3) = 55% - 21% = 34%.

However, we are given that the final charge remaining is 28%. This means that the 34% charge remaining after 8 hours is reduced to 28% after the additional 3 hours. To find the rate at which the charge is lost during these 3 hours, we can set up the equation:

34% - (rate * 3) = 28%

Solving for the rate, we get:
rate = (34% - 28%) / 3 = 6% / 3 = 2% per hour.

Now, we know that the power bank loses 2% of its capacity each hour for the last 3 hours. To find the charge remaining after 5 hours, we can use the equation:

55% - (2% * 3) = 55% - 6% = 49%.

However, we are given that the final charge remaining is 28%. This means that the 49% charge remaining after 5 hours is reduced to 28% after the additional 3 hours. To find the rate at which the charge is lost during these 3 hours, we can set up the equation:

49% - (rate * 3) = 28%

Solving for the rate, we get:
rate = (49% - 28%) / 3 = 21% / 3 = 7% per hour.

However, we already know that the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour for the last 3 hours. This means that the rate we calculated is correct.

Now, we can use the equation:

55% - (7% * 3) = 55% - 21% = 34%.

However, we are given that the final charge remaining is 28%. This means that the 34% charge remaining after 5 hours is reduced to 28% after the additional 3 hours. To find the initial charge, we can set up the equation:

x - (9% * 5) = 34%

Solving for x, we get:
x = 34% + (9% * 5)
x = 34% + 45%
x = 79%

The final answer is: 79%"
"To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment, we first need to calculate her total weekly earnings. 

Janet makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, so her total hourly earnings are $10 + $15 = $25 per hour.

Since she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are $25 * 40 = $1000.

Next, we need to find out how much Janet needs to save for the down payment. She wants to save 20% of the cost of a $10,000 car, so the down payment amount is 20% of $10,000, which is 0.20 * $10,000 = $2000.

Now, we can divide the down payment amount by Janet's weekly earnings to find out how many weeks she needs to work: $2000 / $1000 = 2.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has spent so far and subtract that from his initial $10.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items he has already purchased:

- 3 peaches at $0.5 each: 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
- 4 pears at $0.5 each: 4 * $0.5 = $2
- 2 kiwis at $1 each: 2 * $1 = $2
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Total cost so far: $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25

Now, let's subtract the total cost from Jamaar's initial $10:

$10 - $9.25 = $0.75

Since plums cost $0.25 each, we can divide the remaining amount by the cost of one plum to find out how many plums Jamaar can buy:

$0.75 / $0.25 = 3

So, Jamaar can buy 3 plums.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received, we first need to determine the total number of packs she gave away. Since Anne kept 2 packs for herself, she gave away 15 - 2 = 13 packs.

Next, we need to find out how many packs each friend received. Since Anne gave the packs to her 10 friends equally, we divide the total number of packs given away (13) by the number of friends (10). 

13 packs / 10 friends = 1.3 packs per friend.

Since each pack contains 60 pieces, we multiply the number of packs each friend received by the number of pieces in each pack to find the total number of pieces each friend received.

1.3 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 78 pieces.

However, since we cannot divide packs into fractions, we can round down to 1 pack per friend and give the remaining packs to the friends with more than 1 pack. But in this case, we will consider the 1.3 packs as 1 pack and 0.3 packs. 

0.3 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 18 pieces.

So, each of the 3 friends who received 1 pack will get 60 pieces, and the remaining 7 friends will get 1 pack (60 pieces) and 18 pieces (0.3 packs * 60 pieces).

The final answer is: 78"
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the increase in price each year and add it to the original price.

Year 1: 
Original price = $120
Increase in price = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Original price = $126
Increase in price = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Original price = $132.30
Increase in price = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
Price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many pictures Olivia put into each album. Since she put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide the total number of pictures by 8.

Total pictures = 72
Pictures per album = Total pictures / Number of albums
Pictures per album = 72 / 8
Pictures per album = 9

Since 3 albums were selfies only and 2 albums were portraits, the remaining 3 albums must be a mix of both selfies and portraits. However, we are not given any information about the mix of selfies and portraits in these 3 albums. 

But we can still find the total number of selfies and portraits. Since 3 albums were selfies only, the total number of selfies is 3 * 9 = 27. Similarly, since 2 albums were portraits only, the total number of portraits is 2 * 9 = 18.

The final answer is: 
27

"To find the total time James spends reading, we need to determine how many sets of 3 pages he reads and then multiply that by the time it takes him to read one set of 3 pages. 

Since James reads 18 pages, we can divide 18 by 3 to find the number of sets of 3 pages he reads: 18 / 3 = 6. 

Now, we multiply the number of sets by the time it takes to read one set: 6 * 10 = 60 minutes.

The final answer is: 60"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, the hotel had 100 guests.

24 guests checked out early, so the number of guests remaining is 100 - 24 = 76.

15 guests opted for a late checkout, so the number of guests remaining is still 76.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout, which is 2 * 15 = 30. So, the number of guests now is 76 + 30 = 106.

After dinner, 7 more people checked in, so the final number of guests is 106 + 7 = 113.

The final number of guests in the hotel is 113."
"To find the total number of bananas John has, we need to calculate the bananas he picked each day and add them together.

On Wednesday, John picked 4 bananas.
On Thursday, John picked 6 bananas.
On Friday, John picked triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 bananas.

Now, let's add the bananas he picked each day: 4 (Wednesday) + 6 (Thursday) + 12 (Friday) = 22 bananas.

"To find the number of points Aries is sure to get, we need to calculate the number of questions in each category and then find the total points.

First, let's find the number of questions in each category:
- Easy questions: 40% of 60 = 0.4 * 60 = 24 questions
- Average and difficult questions: 60 - 24 = 36 questions
- Since the rest are equally divided as average and difficult questions, we have 36 / 2 = 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

Now, let's find the number of questions Aries is sure to get in each category:
- Easy questions: 75% of 24 = 0.75 * 24 = 18 questions
- Average questions: 50% of 18 = 0.5 * 18 = 9 questions
- Difficult questions: 50% of 18 = 0.5 * 18 = 9 questions

Now, let's find the total points Aries is sure to get:
- Easy questions: 18 * 1 = 18 points
- Average questions: 9 * 0.5 = 4.5 points
- Difficult questions: 9 * 0.5 = 4.5 points
Total points = 18 + 4.5 + 4.5 = 27

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote the number of small stuffed animals as 's' and the number of large stuffed animals as 'l'. We know that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so we can write an equation:

s = 2l

We also know that the price of a small stuffed animal is $4. Since Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small ones, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.

The total earnings from the sales are $120. We can write an equation based on the earnings:

4s + 12l = 120

Substituting s = 2l into the equation, we get:

4(2l) + 12l = 120
8l + 12l = 120
20l = 120

Now, we can solve for l:

l = 120 / 20
l = 6

Since s = 2l, we can find the number of small stuffed animals:

s = 2 * 6
s = 12

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total number of sandwiches the family eats in one week, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches each family member eats in a week and then add them together.

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, so in a week (7 days), he eats 5 * 7 = 35 sandwiches.

The wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, so in a week (7 days), she eats 4 * 7 = 28 sandwiches.

The son eats 2 sandwiches per day, so in a week (7 days), he eats 2 * 7 = 14 sandwiches.

Now, let's add the total number of sandwiches each family member eats in a week: 35 (man) + 28 (wife) + 14 (son) = 77 sandwiches.

The family eats 77 sandwiches in one week.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe and then multiply it by 40 dwarves and 30 days.

First, let's find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with an iron pickaxe. Since he can mine twice as much with an iron pickaxe as with his bare hands, he can mine 2 * 12 = 24 pounds of ore per day with an iron pickaxe.

Next, let's find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe. Since he can mine 50% more with a steel pickaxe than with an iron pickaxe, he can mine 24 + (0.5 * 24) = 24 + 12 = 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe.

Now, let's find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day with steel pickaxes. Since one dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe, 40 dwarves can mine 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds of ore per day.

Finally, let's find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in 30 days with steel pickaxes. Since they can mine 1440 pounds of ore per day, they can mine 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds of ore in 30 days.

"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of proportionality. Let's denote the price of the third package with 8 sandwiches as x.

We know that the price of the first package with 2 sandwiches is $3, and the price of the second package with 4 sandwiches is $6. Since the prices are proportional, we can set up a proportion to relate the number of sandwiches to their respective prices.

Let's set up the proportion:

(2 sandwiches / $3) = (4 sandwiches / $6) = (8 sandwiches / x)

We can simplify the proportion by cross-multiplying:

2x = 3 * 4
2x = 12

Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 2:

x = 12 / 2
x = 6

Therefore, the price of the package with 8 sandwiches is $6.

"To find out how much Tom has to pay per month, we need to first calculate the remaining amount he owes after using the money from selling his old bedroom set.

Initial cost of the bedroom set: $3000
Amount Tom gets from selling his old bedroom: $1000
Remaining amount owed: $3000 - $1000 = $2000

Since Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month, we need to calculate 10% of $2000.

10% of $2000 = 0.1 * $2000 = $200

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month. 

The final answer is: $200"
"To find the number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons after each event.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

First, 40% of the red balloons burst. 40% of 25 is 0.4 * 25 = 10. So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

Next, Sally released half of the yellow balloons. Half of 12 is 12 / 2 = 6. So, 6 yellow balloons were released, leaving 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.

Then, she found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch. 75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6. So, she added 6 blue balloons to her clutch.

Now, let's calculate the total number of balloons she carried into the school. She had 15 red balloons, 7 green balloons, 6 yellow balloons, and 6 blue balloons. 

Total number of balloons = 15 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 34

"To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to consider the scenarios where he won't get an extension. 

First, let's consider the scenario where the substitute teacher is present. In this case, there's a 50% chance of the substitute teacher being present, and since the homework won't be collected in this scenario, the probability of having to turn in the homework is 0.

Next, let's consider the scenario where the normal teacher is present. In this case, there's a 60% chance (100% - 40% extension chance) that the class won't get an extension. Within this scenario, there's a 80% chance (100% - 20% chance of getting a personal extension) that Marcus won't get a personal extension.

Now, we can calculate the probability of each scenario and multiply them together to find the overall probability of having to turn in the homework.

Probability of substitute teacher: 0.5
Probability of not getting an extension with substitute teacher: 1 (since homework won't be collected)
Probability of normal teacher: 0.5
Probability of not getting an extension with normal teacher: 0.6
Probability of not getting a personal extension with normal teacher: 0.8

The overall probability of having to turn in the homework is the sum of the probabilities of the two scenarios:
(0.5 * 1) + (0.5 * 0.6 * 0.8) = 0.5 + 0.24 = 0.74

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100:
0.74 * 100 = 74%

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the different sizes of jelly beans. 

Let's start by defining the number of large beans as L, the number of medium beans as M, and the number of small beans as S. 

We are given that it takes 75 large beans to fill Grandpa up, so L = 75.

We are also given that Grandpa can eat twice as many medium beans as large beans, so M = 2L. Substituting L = 75, we get M = 2 * 75 = 150.

Lastly, we are given that eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium bean, so S = 3 * M. Substituting M = 150, we get S = 3 * 150 = 450.

Therefore, Grandpa can eat 450 small beans.

"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to first determine the total number of soda bottles he will place along the driveway. 

Given that the driveway is 24 feet wide and Richard wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet, we can calculate the total number of bottles as follows:

Total number of bottles = Total length of driveway / Distance between each bottle
Total number of bottles = 24 feet / 3 feet
Total number of bottles = 8

Since it takes Richard 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, we can calculate the total time by multiplying the number of bottles by the time it takes to set off each one:

Total time = Total number of bottles * Time per bottle
Total time = 8 * 5 seconds

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim lost due to loans and lost income while in college. 

First, let's calculate the total amount of loans he took: 
4 years * $50,000/year = $200,000

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money he lost due to not working while in college. 
His income before college was $25,000/year. 
His income after college is $25,000/year * 3 = $75,000/year. 
The difference in income is $75,000/year - $25,000/year = $50,000/year. 
The total amount of money he lost due to not working while in college is $50,000/year * 4 years = $200,000.

The total amount of money he needs to earn is the sum of the loans and the lost income: 
$200,000 (loans) + $200,000 (lost income) = $400,000.

Now, let's calculate how long it will take him to earn this amount at his new income of $75,000/year:
Time = Total amount / Annual income
Time = $400,000 / $75,000
Time = 5.33 years

The final answer is: 5.33"
"To find the total area of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the two pieces of fabric. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide, so the fabric pieces will be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than that.

The length of the fabric pieces will be 6 + 2 = 8 feet (original length) + 2 = 10 feet.
The width of the fabric pieces will be 8 + 2 = 10 feet.

Now, we can calculate the area of one fabric piece: 
Area = length * width = 10 * 10 = 100 square feet.

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
Total area = 2 * 100 = 200 square feet.

The final answer is: 200"
"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then add them together.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. One-fifth of 425 is 425 / 5 = 85. 17 more than that is 85 + 17 = 102. So, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. Twice as many as Tuesday is 102 * 2 = 204. 5 more than that is 204 + 5 = 209. So, on Wednesday, they delivered 209 letters.

Now, let's add the number of letters delivered each day: 425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736.

The final answer is: 736"
"To find the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad separately and then add them together.

The cost of the chicken salad is 10 people * $6.50 per person = $65.
The cost of the pasta salad is 6 people * $6 per person = $36.

Now, we add the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad together: $65 + $36 = $101.

The total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $101."
"To find the average loss, we need to calculate the total loss and then divide it by the number of races. 

First, let's calculate the amount Johnny's dad lost and won in each race:

1. Loss in the first race: -$5
2. Win in the second race: 2 * (-$5) + $1 = -$9 + $1 = -$8
3. Loss in the third race: 1.5 * (-$8) = -$12

Now, let's calculate the total loss:
Total loss = -$5 + (-$8) + (-$12) = -$25

There were 3 races. To find the average loss, we divide the total loss by the number of races:
Average loss = Total loss / Number of races = -$25 / 3 = -$8.33

"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we first need to calculate their current heights. 

Xavier's initial height was 4 feet, which is equivalent to 48 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches). He grew 3 inches over the summer, so his current height is 48 + 3 = 51 inches.

Cole's initial height was 50 inches, and he grew 2 inches over the summer, so his current height is 50 + 2 = 52 inches.

The difference in height between Cole and Xavier is 52 - 51 = 1 inch.

The final answer is: 1"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the share of the first person as x. 

Since the second person took $80 more than the first, the second person's share is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is 2(x + 80).

The total amount is $1920, and the sum of their shares is equal to this amount. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920

Combine like terms again:

4x + 240 = 1920

Subtract 240 from both sides:

4x = 1680

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 420

The share of the first person is $420. 

420"
"To find the total hours worked by each painter, we need to calculate the total hours worked in 3 weeks and then divide it by the number of painters and the number of days they worked.

First, let's convert 3 weeks to days: 3 weeks = 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Since they worked 3/8ths of a day every day, we need to find the fraction of a day in hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3/8 of a day is (3/8) * 24 = 9 hours.

Now, we multiply the hours worked per day by the number of days: 9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours.

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4: 189 hours / 4 = 47.25 hours.

The final answer is: 47.25"
"Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. 

Since Rory retrieved four more balls in the first set than in the second, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set, which is given as 19. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for x, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Expanding the equation:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

Number of balls in the first set = x + 4
= 6 + 4
= 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the price of the car in the year 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation of the car from 2007 to 2010.

The car was bought in 2007 for $20,000. 

The depreciation rate is 21% per year. 

We need to calculate the price of the car in 2008, 2009, and 2010.

In 2008, the price of the car will be:
$20,000 * (1 - 0.21) = $20,000 * 0.79 = $15,800

In 2009, the price of the car will be:
$15,800 * (1 - 0.21) = $15,800 * 0.79 = $12,502

In 2010, the price of the car will be:
$12,502 * (1 - 0.21) = $12,502 * 0.79 = $9,900.18

The price of the car in the year 2010 is $9,900.18."
"To find the number of Spanish books, we first need to determine the total number of books that are not written in English. 

Since half of the books are written in English, the number of English books is 50 / 2 = 25.

The number of books written in German is 10% of 50, which is 0.1 * 50 = 5.

Now, to find the number of books written in Spanish, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books: 50 - 25 - 5 = 20.

The number of Spanish books is 20."
"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we need to subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance. 

First, let's calculate the total distance Bernice has driven: 
Distance driven = 325 kilometers/day * 4 days = 1300 kilometers

Now, let's subtract the distance driven from the total distance:
Total distance = 1955 kilometers
Distance driven = 1300 kilometers
Distance left = Total distance - Distance driven
Distance left = 1955 - 1300
Distance left = 655 kilometers

"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to first calculate how many cups of water she drinks in 30 days. 

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. To find out how many cups she drinks in 30 days, we multiply the number of cups she drinks per day by 30.

8 cups/day * 30 days = 240 cups

Now, we need to convert the total number of cups to gallons. There are 16 cups in a gallon. To find out how many gallons, we divide the total number of cups by 16.

240 cups / 16 cups/gallon = 15 gallons

Therefore, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Romeo boards the train with 120 people.

At the first stop, 20 more people board the train. So, the total number of people on the train becomes:
120 (initial people) + 20 (new people) = 140

At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, and twice that number (100 people) board the train. So, the total number of people on the train becomes:
140 (people after the first stop) - 50 (people who descended) = 90
90 + 100 (new people) = 190

At the third stop, 80 more people descend from the train. So, the total number of people on the train becomes:
190 (people after the second stop) - 80 (people who descended) = 110

The total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110."
"To find the total amount Alison spent on athletic gear, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

1. The tank top costs $10.
2. The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $10 + $5 = $15.
3. The tennis shoes were originally $48 but were on sale for half price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $24.
4. The athletic socks cost $8, and she had a coupon for $2 off, so they cost $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items:

$10 (tank top) + $15 (shorts) + $24 (tennis shoes) + $6 (socks) = $55

"To find the total cost of renovating the kitchen floor, we need to calculate the total number of tiles required and then multiply it by the cost of each tile.

First, we need to find the area of a single tile. Since each tile is a square with a side length of 1 ft, the area of a single tile is 1 ft * 1 ft = 1 SqFt.

Next, we need to find the total number of tiles required to cover the kitchen floor. We can do this by dividing the total area of the kitchen floor (200 SqFt) by the area of a single tile (1 SqFt).

Total number of tiles = Total area of kitchen floor / Area of a single tile
Total number of tiles = 200 SqFt / 1 SqFt
Total number of tiles = 200

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the total number of tiles by the cost of each tile ($12).

Total cost = Total number of tiles * Cost of each tile
Total cost = 200 * $12
Total cost = $2400

The final answer is: $2400"
"To find the increased cost of the insurance, we need to calculate 60% of the normal cost and add it to the normal cost. 

60% of $120 is calculated as 0.6 * 120 = $72. 

The increased cost is then $120 + $72 = $192 per month.

To find the yearly cost, we multiply the monthly cost by 12. 

$192 * 12 = $2304 per year.

The final answer is: $2304"
"To find the total number of loads of laundry Greg does in a week, we need to calculate the total number of twin and king size sheets he puts on the beds and divide that by the number of sheets he can wash at a time.

Greg puts 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed, which means he puts 4 + 1 = 5 sets of sheets on the beds every week. 

Since he can wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set at a time, we need to find the number of sets he can wash in a week. He can wash 2 twin sets (2 * 2 = 4) and 1 king set (1 * 1 = 1) in a week, which is a total of 4 + 1 = 5 sets.

However, since he has 5 sets of sheets to wash and can only wash 5 sets in a week, he needs to do 1 load of laundry per week.

To find the total number of loads of laundry he does in a year, we multiply the number of loads he does in a week by the number of weeks in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total number of loads of laundry he does in a year is 1 * 52 = 52.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many slices Jake and Silvia ate. 

Since Becky ate 10 slices and she ate 3 more slices than Jake, Jake must have eaten 10 - 3 = 7 slices.

Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate 2 * 7 = 14 slices.

Now, we know that Becky ate 10 slices, Jake ate 7 slices, and Silvia ate 14 slices. To find the total number of slices they ate, we add these numbers together: 10 + 7 + 14 = 31.

"Let's denote the time Donovan took to make his part as 'x'. Since Betsy took 18 minutes longer than Donovan, the time Betsy took can be represented as (x + 18).

The total time taken to make the meal is the sum of the time taken by both Betsy and Donovan, which is given as 98 minutes. So, we can write the equation as:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:
2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Since x represents the time Donovan took, and Betsy took 18 minutes longer, Betsy's part took 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

"To find the total number of pizzas left, we first need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club and the football team.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. To find 70% of 20, we multiply 20 by 0.7:
20 * 0.7 = 14 pizzas eaten by the glee club.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. They ate 80% of them. To find 80% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.8:
40 * 0.8 = 32 pizzas eaten by the football team.

Now, we add the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club and the football team to find the total number of pizzas eaten:
14 + 32 = 46 pizzas eaten in total.

Since the glee club and the football team ordered a total of 20 + 40 = 60 pizzas, we subtract the total number of pizzas eaten from the total number of pizzas ordered to find the number of pizzas left:
60 - 46 = 14 pizzas left.

"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of big coupons. Since Anthony wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, and he is sending out 700 small coupons, the number of big coupons is 2 * 700 = 1400.

The cost of mailing the small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents.

The cost of mailing the big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons: 3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100: 24500 / 100 = 245 dollars.

"To find the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we first need to determine the number of trucks that did not experience mechanical failures. 

Since a quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures, we can calculate the number of trucks that failed as follows:

Number of trucks dispatched = 20
Number of trucks with mechanical failures = 20 * (1/4) = 5

Now, we subtract the number of trucks with mechanical failures from the total number of trucks dispatched to find the number of trucks that reached the farmers:

Number of trucks that reached the farmers = 20 - 5 = 15

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. To find the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we multiply the number of trucks that reached the farmers by the tons of fertiliser each truck carried:

Total tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers = 15 * 20 = 300

"To find the total cost of the butter, we first need to determine how much Dennis needs to buy. Since he needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants and he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter.

Since the grocery store has a promotion for buy one pound of butter get one half off, we can calculate the cost as follows:

- For the first pound of butter, the cost is $4.00.
- For the second pound of butter, the cost is $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00 (since it's half off).
- For the third pound of butter, the cost is $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00 (since it's half off).
- For the fourth pound of butter, the cost is $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00 (since it's half off).
- For the fifth pound of butter, the cost is $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00 (since it's half off).
- For the sixth pound of butter, the cost is $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00 (since it's half off).

The total cost of the butter is $4.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 = $12.00.

"To find the total cost of the party, we need to calculate the number of additional guests beyond the initial 20 and then multiply that by the cost per additional guest. 

First, let's find the total number of guests: 
Kayla invited 25 classmates + 7 dance class girls + 13 family members = 45 guests. 
However, 4 people said they could not come, so the total number of guests is 45 - 4 = 41.

Since the initial 20 guests are included in the rental fee, we need to find the number of additional guests: 
41 total guests - 20 initial guests = 21 additional guests.

Now, we can calculate the cost for the additional guests: 
21 additional guests * $6 per guest = $126.

Adding the initial rental fee to the cost for the additional guests, we get: 
$125 (rental fee) + $126 (additional guests) = $251.

"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we first need to determine how many bananas the first and second monkeys eat each day. 

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day.

Since there are three monkeys in total, the total number of bananas they eat each day is 10 + 14 + x, where x is the number of bananas the third monkey eats. However, we know that the total number of bananas is 315, and they last for a week, which is 7 days. 

So, the total number of bananas eaten in a week is 315 * 7 = 2205 bananas. 

Since the first two monkeys eat 10 + 14 = 24 bananas each day, the total number of bananas they eat in a week is 24 * 7 = 168 bananas. 

Now, we can find the number of bananas the third monkey eats in a week by subtracting the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total number of bananas: 2205 - 168 = 2037 bananas. 

However, this is the total number of bananas the third monkey eats in a week, not per day. To find the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day, we divide the total number of bananas eaten by the third monkey in a week by 7: 2037 / 7 = 291. 

However, this is incorrect because we know that the total number of bananas is 315, and the first two monkeys eat 24 bananas each day. So, the third monkey eats the rest of the bananas, which is 315 - 24 = 291 bananas per week. 

Now, we can find the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day by dividing the total number of bananas eaten by the third monkey in a week by 7: 291 / 7 = 41.57. However, this is incorrect because the number of bananas must be a whole number.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. We know that the first monkey eats 10 bananas each day, and the second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 14 bananas each day. The total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys is 10 + 14 = 24 bananas each day.

Since the total number of bananas is 315, and they last for a week, the total number of bananas eaten in a week is 315 * 7 = 2205 bananas. 

The total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a week is 24 * 7 = 168 bananas. 

Now, we can find the number of bananas the third monkey eats in a week by subtracting the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total number of bananas: 2205 - 168 = 2037 bananas. 

However, this is the total number of bananas the third monkey eats in a week, not per day. To find the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day, we divide the total number of bananas eaten by the third monkey in a week by 7: 2037 / 7 = 291.

Since the total number of bananas is 315, and they last for a week, the total number of bananas eaten in a week is 315 * 7 = 2205 bananas. 

The total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a week is 24 * 7 = 168 bananas. 

Now, we can find the number of bananas the third monkey eats in a week by subtracting the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total number of bananas: 2205 - 168 = 2037 bananas. 

However, this is the total number of bananas the third monkey eats in a week, not per day. To find the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day, we divide the total number of bananas eaten by the third monkey in a week by 7: 2037 / 7 = 291. 

However, this is incorrect because we know that the total number of bananas is 315, and the first two monkeys eat 24 bananas each day. So, the third monkey eats the rest of the bananas, which is 315 - 24 = 291 bananas per week.

"To find out how many puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we need to determine how many pieces he placed in total and then subtract the pieces he placed before the hour. 

Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, which means he placed 500 / 2 = 250 pieces before the hour. 

Then, he finished another 500 piece puzzle within the hour. 

So, the total number of pieces he placed during the hour is 500 (from the second puzzle) + 250 (from the first puzzle) = 750 pieces.

The final answer is: 750"
"To find out how much Jenny spent on roses, we need to determine whether she bought the roses by the dozen or individually. 

Since she bought 15 roses, and a dozen is 12 roses, she bought 1 dozen and 3 individual roses. 

The cost of 1 dozen roses is $15. The cost of 3 individual roses is 3 * $2 = $6. 

So, the total cost of the roses is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny arrived with 5 $5 bills, which is a total of 5 * $5 = $25.

To find out how much change she should get, we subtract the cost of the roses from the amount she arrived with: $25 - $21 = $4.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the $4 into quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so there are 4 * 4 = 16 quarters in $4.

Jenny leaves with 16 quarters.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to calculate the revenue from each item and then add them together.

The revenue from sodas is 20 * $1.50 = $30.

Now, we add the revenues together: $33 + $99 + $30 = $162.

The final answer is: $162"
"To find the time Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the time from the moment he arrives at the station to the moment the fourth train arrives.

The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the first train leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes after the first train arrives. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes after the first train arrives. The third train leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it also leaves at 125 minutes.

The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes after the first train arrives.

Since Paul arrives at the station at time 0, the time he waits for his train is 145 minutes.

The final answer is: 145"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many toothpicks Melanie has saved so far and then determine how many more weeks it will take her to reach 200 toothpicks.

Melanie saved 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. To find the total number of toothpicks she has saved, we multiply the number of toothpicks saved per week by the number of weeks:

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Since Melanie needs 200 toothpicks for the sculpture, we subtract the number of toothpicks she has saved from the total required:

200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Now, we need to find out how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect the remaining 80 toothpicks. Since she saves 10 toothpicks per week, we divide the remaining number of toothpicks by the number saved per week:

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

Therefore, Melanie will need 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to first find the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch and then the price at which he sold it to his friend.

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price, so the price he paid is:

2000 * 0.75 = $1500

Then, he sold it to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, so the price his friend paid is:

1500 * 1.20 = $1800

Now, to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to find the difference between the original price and the price his friend paid, and then divide it by the original price and multiply by 100:

(2000 - 1800) / 2000 * 100 = 10%

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours and then multiply it by the rate at which the springs create jellyfish.

There are 60 minutes in an hour and 60 seconds in a minute. So, the total number of seconds in 4 hours is:

60 minutes/hour * 60 seconds/minute * 4 hours = 14400 seconds

Since each spring creates a new jellyfish every second, the total number of jellyfish created by one spring in 14400 seconds is 14400.

Now, if we have 5 springs working at the same rate, the total number of jellyfish created in 14400 seconds is:

14400 * 5 = 72000

So, 5 springs working at the same rate would create 72000 jellyfish in 4 hours.

The final answer is: 72000"
"To find Frankie's score, we need to first calculate twice Binkie's score and then add 15 to it. 

Binkie's score is 90. Twice Binkie's score is 2 * 90 = 180. 

Now, we add 15 to twice Binkie's score to find Frankie's score: 180 + 15 = 195.

The final answer is: 195"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the time it took James to walk to the store and the time it took him to walk back home.

First, let's find the time it took James to walk to the store. Since he walked halfway to the store and then turned back, he effectively walked the entire distance to the store. The distance to the store is 4 miles, and he walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour. 

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 1 hour

However, this is the time it took him to walk to the store and back home. Since he walked back home, we need to double the time to get the total time.

Total Time = 2 * Time
Total Time = 2 * 1 hour
Total Time = 2 hours

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total cost of buying bananas individually, we need to calculate the cost of 10 bunches of bananas with 4 bananas each. 

First, let's find the total number of bananas: 10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch = 40 bananas.

The cost of buying 40 bananas individually would be 40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.00.

Now, let's find the cost of buying the bananas in bunches: 10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00.

To find the amount saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as 'x'. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry's share can be represented as 'x + 60'.

We know that the total length of the fence is 100 feet, and it is split between Sam and Harry. Therefore, the sum of their shares should equal the total length of the fence:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

This means Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. To find out how much is left over for Sam, we need to subtract his share from the total length of the fence:

100 - 20 = 80

So, there are 80 feet left over for Sam.

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the rate of growth per year, we need to divide the growth in inches by the number of years. 

Growth rate per year = 8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches/year

Now, we can multiply the growth rate per year by the number of years to find the total growth in 13 years.

Total growth in 13 years = 2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches

The final answer is: 26"
"To find the total earnings, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply it by its price.

Let's start by finding the number of each type of bike sold:

- Total bikes sold: 300
- Trekking bikes: 300 / 2 = 150
- BMX bikes: 300 * 0.15 = 45
- MTB bikes: 300 - (150 + 45) = 105

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each type of bike:
- Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500
- BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250 (since BMX is half the price of MTB, which is $500, so BMX is $500 / 2 = $250)
- MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500

Now, let's add up the earnings from each type of bike to find the total earnings:
$67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250

The final answer is: $131,250"
"To find the number of bales left in the field, we need to determine the net change in the number of bales over the 6-hour period. 

The farmer produces 5 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the farmer will produce 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the truck will pick up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

The net change in the number of bales is the difference between the number of bales produced and the number of bales picked up, which is 30 - 18 = 12 bales.

Since the farmer starts with 0 bales in the field, the number of bales left in the field after 6 hours is 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total time John spends learning, we need to calculate the time spent in classes, and the time spent on Saturday and Sunday.

First, let's calculate the time spent in classes. John takes 2 extra classes, each 40 minutes long, 5 days a week. 

Time spent in classes per day = 2 * 40 minutes = 80 minutes
Time spent in classes per week = 80 minutes * 5 days = 400 minutes

Next, we need to calculate the time spent on Saturday and Sunday. John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on these days. 

First, we need to find the total minutes in a week. There are 24 hours in a day, and 7 days in a week, so there are 24 * 7 = 168 hours in a week. 

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, there are 168 * 60 = 10080 minutes in a week.

Now, we can find the time spent on Saturday and Sunday. 

Time spent on Saturday and Sunday = 1/16 * 10080 minutes = 630 minutes

Now, we can find the total time spent learning by adding the time spent in classes and the time spent on Saturday and Sunday.

Total time spent learning = 400 minutes + 630 minutes = 1030 minutes

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60.

Total time spent learning = 1030 minutes / 60 = 17.17 hours

"To find the height of the ball on its second bounce, we need to calculate the height of the ball after the first bounce and then multiply it by 2/3.

The initial height of the ball is the height of the third floor, which is 24 feet. 

On the first bounce, the ball reaches 2/3 of its initial height, so the height after the first bounce is (2/3) * 24 = 16 feet.

On the second bounce, the ball reaches 2/3 of the height it had after the first bounce, so the height after the second bounce is (2/3) * 16 = 10.67 feet.

"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the height of each child in inches. 

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the first child's height in inches is 6 * 12 = 72 inches.

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child's height is 72 + 2 = 74 inches.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child's height is 74 - 5 = 69 inches.

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child's height is 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

The final answer is: 72"
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to determine the number of bags sold and then multiply that by the price per bag.

Since the orchard sold a total of 2000 apples and each bag contains 10 apples, we can find the number of bags sold by dividing the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag:

Number of bags sold = Total apples / Apples per bag
= 2000 / 10
= 200

Now, we can find the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags sold by the price per bag:

Total earnings = Number of bags sold * Price per bag
= 200 * $5
= $1000

The final answer is: $1000"
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the amount of meat left after the Allosaurus ate. 

Let's start with the amount of meat left after the Allosaurus ate: 270 kilograms. 

Since the Allosaurus ate the last of the meat, the amount of meat left after the velociraptors scavenged was twice the amount left after the Allosaurus ate, because the velociraptors ate half of what was left. 

So, the amount of meat left after the velociraptors scavenged = 2 * 270 = 540 kilograms.

Since the velociraptors ate half of what was left, the amount of meat left after the T-Rex ate was twice the amount left after the velociraptors scavenged.

So, the amount of meat left after the T-Rex ate = 2 * 540 = 1080 kilograms.

Since the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, the total amount of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate was twice the amount left after the T-Rex ate.

So, the total amount of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate = 2 * 1080 = 2160 kilograms.

"To find the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted and then divide it by the coverage of a gallon of paint to find out how many gallons are needed. After that, we can multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon to get the total cost.

First, let's calculate the area of each wall:
- North wall: 10 x 8 = 80 square feet
- South wall: 10 x 8 = 80 square feet
- East wall: 5 x 8 = 40 square feet
- West wall: 5 x 8 = 40 square feet

The total area of the walls is: 80 + 80 + 40 + 40 = 240 square feet

Since a gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, we need to divide the total area by the coverage of a gallon:
240 / 20 = 12 gallons

Now, we multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon:
12 gallons * $12/gallon = $144

The final answer is: $144"
"To find the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to determine the probability of her choosing a shaken can out of the remaining cans.

Initially, there were 12 sodas. Ellen shook 3 of them, so there are 3 shaken sodas and 9 unshaken sodas. Ellen took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 8 unshaken sodas and 3 shaken sodas.

Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 2 shaken sodas and 6 unshaken sodas.

Now, there are 2 shaken sodas and 6 unshaken sodas. The total number of sodas is 8.

The probability of Ellen's friend choosing a shaken can is the number of shaken cans divided by the total number of cans: 2/8 = 0.25.

To express this as a percentage, multiply by 100: 0.25 * 100 = 25%.

The final answer is: 25"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the distance each train travels in 3 hours and then add those distances together.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. To find the distance it travels in 3 hours, we multiply its speed by the time:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour x 3 hours
Distance = 180 miles

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. To find the distance it travels in 3 hours, we multiply its speed by the time:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour x 3 hours
Distance = 90 miles

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, we add the distances they traveled to find the total distance between them:

Total Distance = Distance of first train + Distance of second train
Total Distance = 180 miles + 90 miles
Total Distance = 270 miles

The final answer is: 270"
"To find the total number of people Billy can help, we first need to determine the number of days he works. 

March has 31 days, and April has 19 days (since April 19th is the last day). The total number of days between March 1st and April 19th is 31 + 19 = 50 days.

Billy takes 20% of these days off, which is 0.20 * 50 = 10 days. Therefore, he works 50 - 10 = 40 days.

Since Billy can help 2 people per hour and works 3 hours a day, he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

The total number of people he can help in 40 days is 6 * 40 = 240.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find the total number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people that were transported by the buses and the cars, and then subtract that from the total number of people that were present.

First, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the buses. There were 12 buses, and each bus carried 35 people. 

Total people transported by buses = Number of buses * Number of people per bus
Total people transported by buses = 12 * 35
Total people transported by buses = 420

Next, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the cars. There were 20 cars, and each car carried 3 people.

Total people transported by cars = Number of cars * Number of people per car
Total people transported by cars = 20 * 3
Total people transported by cars = 60

Now, let's add the total number of people transported by the buses and the cars to find the total number of people that were outside the church.

Total people outside the church = Total people transported by buses + Total people transported by cars
Total people outside the church = 420 + 60
Total people outside the church = 480

Since the question asks for the number of people inside the church, we need to subtract the total number of people outside the church from the total number of people present. However, the total number of people present is not given in the question. 

To find the total number of people present, we need to make an assumption. Let's assume that the total number of people present is the sum of the people transported by buses and cars, and the people inside the church.

Total people present = Total people transported by buses + Total people transported by cars + People inside the church
We can rewrite this equation as:
People inside the church = Total people present - Total people transported by buses - Total people transported by cars

However, we still need to find the total number of people present. Since the question does not provide this information, we can make an assumption that the total number of people present is equal to the sum of the people transported by buses and cars, and the people inside the church. 

Let's denote the total number of people present as 'x'. Then, we can write the equation as:
x = 420 + 60 + People inside the church

We can rewrite this equation as:
x = 480 + People inside the church

Now, we can substitute this expression for 'x' in the previous equation:
People inside the church = x - 420 - 60
People inside the church = (480 + People inside the church) - 420 - 60
People inside the church = 480 - 420 - 60 + People inside the church
People inside the church = 0 + People inside the church

This equation is a contradiction, as it implies that the number of people inside the church is equal to itself. This means that our initial assumption that the total number of people present is equal to the sum of the people transported by buses and cars, and the people inside the church, is incorrect.

However, we can make another assumption. Let's assume that the total number of people present is equal to the sum of the people transported by buses and cars.

Total people present = Total people transported by buses + Total people transported by cars
Total people present = 420 + 60
Total people present = 480

Now, we can find the number of people inside the church by subtracting the total number of people transported by buses and cars from the total number of people present.

People inside the church = Total people present - Total people transported by buses - Total people transported by cars
People inside the church = 480 - 420 - 60
People inside the church = 0

However, this result is also incorrect, as it implies that there are 0 people inside the church. This is not possible, as Mary and John got married, and there must be at least 2 people inside the church.

Let's re-examine the problem. We know that the total number of people present is equal to the sum of the people transported by buses and cars, and the people inside the church. We can write this as:

Total people present = Total people transported by buses + Total people transported by cars + People inside the church

We can rewrite this equation as:
x = 420 + 60 + People inside the church

We can also write the equation as:
x = 480 + People inside the church - 20

Now, we can substitute this expression for 'x' in the previous equation:
People inside the church = x - 420 - 60
People inside the church = (480 + People inside the church - 20) - 420 - 60
People inside the church = 480 - 20 - 420 - 60 + People inside the church
People inside the church = 0 + People inside the church - 200

This equation is still a contradiction, as it implies that the number of people inside the church is equal to itself minus 200. This means that our initial assumption that the total number of people present is equal to the sum of the people transported by buses and cars, and the people inside the church, is still incorrect.

However, we can make another assumption. Let's assume that the total number of people present is equal to the sum of the people transported by buses and cars, and the people inside the church, and that the total number of people present is a multiple of 20.

Total people present = Total people transported by buses + Total people transported by cars + People inside the church
Total people present = 420 + 60 + People inside the church

We can rewrite this equation as:
x = 480 + People inside the church

We can also write the equation as:
x = 20n, where n is an integer.

Now, we can substitute this expression for 'x' in the previous equation:
People inside the church = x - 420 - 60
People inside the church = 20n - 420 - 60
People inside the church = 20n - 480

We can rewrite this equation as:
People inside the church = 20(n - 24)

Since the number of people inside the church must be an integer, 'n - 24' must also be an integer. This means that 'n' must be greater than or equal to 24.

Now, we can find the minimum value of 'n' that satisfies this condition. Since 'n' must be an integer, the minimum value of 'n' is 24.

Now, we can find the number of people inside the church by substituting 'n = 24' in the equation:
People inside the church = 20(n - 24)
People inside the church = 20(24 - 24)
People inside the church = 20(0)
People inside the church = 0

However, this result is still incorrect, as it implies that there are 0 people inside the church. This is not possible, as Mary and John got married, and there must be at least 2 people inside the church.

"To find Jeff's age, we need to determine Martha's age first. Since Mike is 24 years old and Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, we can calculate Martha's age by subtracting 4 from Mike's age.

Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
Martha's age = 24 - 4
Martha's age = 20

Now that we know Martha's age, we can find Jeff's age since he is 10 years older than Martha.

Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
Jeff's age = 20 + 10
Jeff's age = 30

"To find the time it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of each slide by the speed at which people slide down.

For the biggest slide: 
Time = Length / Speed
Time = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute
Time = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide:
Time = Length / Speed
Time = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute
Time = 3 minutes

To find the difference in time, we subtract the time it takes to ride the second biggest slide from the time it takes to ride the biggest slide:

"To find the total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks, we need to calculate the total time spent per day and then multiply it by 5.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 x 15-minute breaks per day. The total time spent on breaks is 2 x 15 = 30 minutes. 

So, the total time spent per day is 30 (lunch) + 30 (breaks) = 60 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60. 

60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour.

Since Bobby works for 5 days, we multiply the daily time by 5.

1 hour/day * 5 days = 5 hours.

The total time spent on lunch and breaks after 5 days is 5 hours.

Now that we know Micah's miles, we can subtract the total miles run by Amber and Micah from the total miles to find Ahito's miles.

Total miles = 52
Amber's miles = 8
Micah's miles = 28
Ahito's miles = Total miles - (Amber's miles + Micah's miles)

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total amount she spent after returning the item and then add it to the initial charge.

1. Initial charge: $85.00
2. Return: -$15.00 (since she returned an item)
   New balance after return: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

3. Frying pan purchase: 20% off $20.00

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. 

A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is x/5.

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (x/5) * (1/3) = x/15.

The problem states that 6 jellyfish changed color, so we can set up the equation x/15 = 6.

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 15, which gives us x = 6 * 15 = 90.

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate Lauren's total savings required for retirement and then determine how many years she needs to work to achieve this goal.

First, let's calculate Lauren's annual expenses in retirement. Since she plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary, her annual expenses will be:

40% of $100,000 = 0.4 * $100,000 = $40,000

Since Lauren plans to live for 20 years in retirement, her total expenses will be:

$40,000 * 20 = $800,000

Now, let's calculate Lauren's annual savings. She saves 20% of her current annual salary, which is:

20% of $100,000 = 0.2 * $100,000 = $20,000

To determine how many years Lauren needs to work to save $800,000, we can use the formula:

Number of years = Total savings / Annual savings
= $800,000 / $20,000
= 40 years

However, this is the total number of years she needs to work to save for retirement, but we need to subtract the 20 years she plans to live in retirement. Therefore, the number of years Lauren needs to work is:

40 - 20 = 20 years

where x is the total population of the school.

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.4:

x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

Now that we know the total population of the school is 600, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total population:

Number of girls = Total population - Number of boys
= 600 - 240

"To find the total amount spent, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items before applying the coupon. 

The cost of the set of pots is $19, and the cost of the sack of garden soil is $26. 

Total cost before coupon = cost of pots + cost of soil
Total cost before coupon = $19 + $26
Total cost before coupon = $45

Now, we need to subtract the coupon value from the total cost before coupon to find the final amount spent.

Final amount spent = Total cost before coupon - coupon value
Final amount spent = $45 - $7
Final amount spent = $38

The total height of the heels for the women wearing 2-inch heels is 3 * 2 = 6 inches.

The total height of all the heels is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.

The average height of heels is the total height of all the heels divided by the total number of women, which is 18 / 6 = 3 inches.

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike, we first need to calculate the total number of days in June. June has 30 days.

Since Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in 30 days, we can calculate her required daily hike by dividing the total miles by the number of days:

9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

Soledad plans to hike 125 miles twice a day, which is a total of 250 miles per day. To find out how many more miles per day she needs to hike, we subtract her planned daily hike from the required daily hike:

310 miles per day - 250 miles per day = 60 miles per day

So, Soledad must hike 60 more miles per day to complete her journey on time.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the total amount the store will receive after selling all the balls, we need to calculate the total revenue from each color of ball and add them together.

The store has 3 red balls, each costing $9. So, the total revenue from red balls is 3 * $9 = $27.

The store has 11 blue balls, each costing $5. So, the total revenue from blue balls is 11 * $5 = $55.

The store has 25 green balls, each costing $3. So, the total revenue from green balls is 25 * $3 = $75.

Now, we add the revenues from all the colors together: $27 + $55 + $75 = $157.

The final numerical answer is: $157"
"To find out how much James will have left, we first need to determine how much Pierre and Paul will take. 

Pierre wants a quarter of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/4 = 3 kg. 

Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/3 = 4 kg.

The total amount taken by Pierre and Paul is 3 + 4 = 7 kg.

Since there are three people (Pierre, Paul, and Jacques), and we are assuming Jacques is the one left, we need to find out how much he will have. However, the question does not mention Jacques initially having any apples. 

Given the context, it seems like Jacques is the one left after Pierre and Paul take their portions. Therefore, Jacques will have the remaining amount, which is 12 - 7 = 5 kg.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the temperature in the morning, we need to subtract the temperature drop from the initial temperature and then add the temperature increase.

Initial temperature = 2 degrees Celsius
Temperature drop = 8 degrees Celsius
Temperature increase = 3 degrees Celsius

Temperature in the morning = Initial temperature - Temperature drop + Temperature increase
= 2 - 8 + 3
= -3

The final answer is: -3"
"To find out how much money Raymond has left, we need to subtract the amount he spent from the initial amount he had, and then add the amount he saved.

Raymond initially had $21. He saved $11, so we add that to his initial amount: $21 + $11 = $32.

Then, he spent $5 on a comic book and $19 on a puzzle, so we subtract the total amount he spent from the new total: $32 - ($5 + $19) = $32 - $24 = $8.

Therefore, Raymond has $8 left.

The final answer is: $8"
"To find the cost of each book, we need to first determine how much money Anna spent on the books. Since she had a budget of $16 and has $2 left, she spent $16 - $2 = $14 on the books.

Since Anna bought 2 books and they cost the same amount of money, we can divide the total amount spent ($14) by 2 to find the cost of each book.

Cost of each book = Total amount spent / Number of books
Cost of each book = $14 / 2
Cost of each book = $7

The final answer is: $7"
"To find the number of students enrolled this year, we need to calculate 20% of the previous year's enrollment and add it to the previous year's enrollment.

Previous year's enrollment: 50 students
20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 students

Add the increase to the previous year's enrollment: 50 + 10 = 60 students

Therefore, there are 60 students enrolled in the calligraphy class this year.

60"
"To find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times, we need to first determine the rate at which the light blinks. 

The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. To find the rate, we divide the number of blinks by the time: 255 blinks / 5 minutes = 51 blinks per minute.

Now, we can use this rate to find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times. We divide the total number of blinks by the rate: 459 blinks / 51 blinks per minute.

459 / 51 = 9 minutes.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the difference between the number of female and male fishes, we need to calculate the total number of each gender after the purchase.

Initially, there are:
- 4 male guppies and 7 female guppies, making a total of 11 guppies.
- 3 male goldfishes and 5 female goldfishes, making a total of 8 goldfishes.

Tate buys:
- 2 male guppies and 1 female guppy, making a total of 3 guppies.
- 2 male goldfishes and 3 female goldfishes, making a total of 5 goldfishes.

After the purchase, the total number of fishes is:
- 11 (initial guppies) + 3 (guppies bought) = 14 guppies
- 8 (initial goldfishes) + 5 (goldfishes bought) = 13 goldfishes

The total number of male fishes is:
- 4 (initial male guppies) + 2 (male guppies bought) + 3 (male goldfishes bought) = 9

The total number of female fishes is:
- 7 (initial female guppies) + 1 (female guppy bought) + 5 (female goldfishes bought) = 13

The difference between the number of female and male fishes is 13 - 9 = 4. 

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total time they all took to do their chores, we need to calculate the time each person took and add them together.

Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia, so Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours to walk the dog.

Dior took over 4 hours longer than Amalia, so Dior took 4 + 4 = 8 hours to do laundry.

Now, let's add the time each person took to do their chores: 4 (Amalia) + 6 (Megan) + 8 (Dior) = 18 hours.

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 18 hours.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the total distance John drives in a month, we need to calculate the round-trip distance for one visit and then multiply it by the number of visits.

The round-trip distance for one visit is 2 hours * 70 mph = 140 miles.

Since John visits his parents twice a month, the total distance driven in a month is 140 miles * 2 visits = 280 miles.

The final numerical answer is: 280"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how far Sofie will walk in 7 days. Since Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, we can multiply the number of miles she walks per day by the number of days:

10 miles/day * 7 days = 70 miles

Since Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship:

Sofie's distance = 2 * Brian's distance

We know that Sofie's distance is 70 miles, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

70 miles = 2 * Brian's distance

To find Brian's distance, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

Brian's distance = 70 miles / 2
Brian's distance = 35 miles

Therefore, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

The final answer is: 35"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers and then find out how many toys the fifth worker must produce to meet the remaining demand.

First, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the 2 workers who produce 6 toys an hour:

2 workers * 6 toys/hour * 10 hours = 120 toys

Next, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour:

2 workers * 4 toys/hour * 10 hours = 80 toys

Now, let's add the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers:

120 toys + 80 toys = 200 toys

Since the manufacturer still needs 20 toys to meet the order, the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers should be 400 - 20 = 380 toys.

Now, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers:

200 toys (from the first 4 workers) + 20 toys (remaining demand) = 220 toys (this is not correct, we need to find the total production of all 5 workers)

Let's recalculate the total production of the first 4 workers and add the remaining demand:

Total production of the first 4 workers = 200 toys
Remaining demand = 20 toys
Total production of all 5 workers = 400 - 20 = 380 toys

Now, let's find the total production of the first 4 workers and the fifth worker:

200 toys (from the first 4 workers) + x toys (from the fifth worker) = 380 toys

x = 380 - 200
x = 180 toys

Now, let's find the production rate of the fifth worker:

x toys / 10 hours = 180 toys / 10 hours
Production rate of the fifth worker = 18 toys/hour

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the total weight of Elijah's dogs, we first need to find the weight of each of his dogs. 

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so we multiply 60 by 1/4 to find the weight of Elijah's first dog: 60 * (1/4) = 15 pounds.

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so we multiply 60 by 1/2 to find the weight of Elijah's second dog: 60 * (1/2) = 30 pounds.

Now, we add the weights of Elijah's two dogs to find the total weight of his dogs: 15 + 30 = 45 pounds.

To find the total weight of all three dogs, we add the weight of Kory's dog to the total weight of Elijah's dogs: 60 + 45 = 105 pounds.

The final answer is: 105"
"To solve this problem, let's work backwards from the information given.

Kris had 7 stickers left after giving some to Rob. Before that, Kris had 7 + 9 = 16 stickers.

Luis gave the rest of the stickers to Kris, so Kris had 16 stickers that were given to him by Luis. Since Kris kept 9 stickers, Luis must have given him 16 - 9 = 7 stickers.

Luis had half of the stickers that Seth gave him. So, Seth gave Luis 7 * 2 = 14 stickers.

Since Seth gave Luis 14 stickers, Seth had 14 * 2 = 28 stickers in the beginning.

The final answer is: 28"
"To find the total number of M&M's John has, we need to calculate the total weight of the M&M's and then multiply it by the number of M&M's per ounce. 

First, we find the total weight of the M&M's: 3 large bags * 10 ounces = 30 ounces.

Since an ounce of M&M's has 30 M&M's, the total number of M&M's is 30 ounces * 30 M&M's/ounce = 900 M&M's.

Now, we need to find out how many small bags John can make. Each small bag contains 10 M&M's. 

To find the total number of small bags, we divide the total number of M&M's by the number of M&M's per small bag: 900 M&M's / 10 M&M's/small bag = 90 small bags.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we need to first calculate half of the circumference of the earth. 

The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. Half of the circumference would be 40,000 / 2 = 20,000 kilometers.

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take Alfie to cover this distance. Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. 

To find the number of days, we divide the total distance (20,000 kilometers) by the distance Alfie flies per day (400 kilometers). 

20,000 / 400 = 50 days.

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the speed of the 2nd fastest car first, and then use that to find the speed of the fastest car.

Given that the average car can go 120 miles per hour, and the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, we can calculate the speed of the 2nd fastest car as follows:

Speed of 2nd fastest car = 5 * Speed of average car
= 5 * 120
= 600 miles per hour

Now, we know that the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. We can calculate the speed of the fastest car as follows:

Speed of fastest car = 1.25 * Speed of 2nd fastest car
= 1.25 * 600
= 750 miles per hour

The final answer is: 750"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Liam's age two years ago and then use that information to find Vince's age at that time. 

Liam's current age is 16 years. Two years ago, Liam's age would be 16 - 2 = 14 years.

It is given that two years ago, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince. So, two years ago, Vince's age would be 14 / 2 = 7 years.

Since we are asked to find Vince's current age, we need to add 2 years to his age two years ago. Vince's current age is 7 + 2 = 9 years.

The final answer is: 9"
"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold as A, Madeline as M, Camden as C, and Sarah as S. We know that A = M, C + S = 30, and C = S + 12.

From the equation C + S = 30, we can express S as S = 30 - C. Substituting this into the equation C = S + 12, we get C = (30 - C) + 12. Simplifying this, we get C = 42.

Now that we know C = 42, we can find S by substituting C into the equation S = 30 - C. This gives us S = 30 - 42 = -12. However, since the number of eggs cannot be negative, this is an error in our previous steps. We need to re-evaluate our equations.

Let's re-evaluate the equation C = S + 12. We can express S as S = C - 12. Substituting this into the equation C + S = 30, we get C + (C - 12) = 30. Simplifying this, we get 2C - 12 = 30. Adding 12 to both sides, we get 2C = 42. Dividing both sides by 2, we get C = 21.

Now that we know C = 21, we can find S by substituting C into the equation S = C - 12. This gives us S = 21 - 12 = 9.

Since A = M, we can find the total number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline by adding A + M. Since A = M, this is equivalent to 2A. We know that the total number of eggs painted by all four people is 56, so the total number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline is 56 - (C + S) = 56 - 30 = 26. Therefore, 2A = 26, and A = 13.

Now that we know A = 13 and C = 21, we can find the difference between the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold by subtracting A from C. This gives us C - A = 21 - 13 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we first need to determine the total number of boxes and the total weight of the crayons. 

Since Nik wants to put the crayons into groups of 8, we can divide the total number of crayons by 8 to find the number of boxes: 200 / 8 = 25 boxes.

Each box weighs 8 ounces, and there are 25 boxes, so the total weight of the boxes is 8 * 25 = 200 ounces.

Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, and there are 200 crayons, so the total weight of the crayons is 1 * 200 = 200 ounces.

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 200 ounces (boxes) + 200 ounces (crayons) = 400 ounces.

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we can convert the total weight from ounces to pounds by dividing by 16: 400 / 16 = 25 pounds.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how much John makes, we need to calculate the total number of planks he can make and then multiply it by the price of each plank.

First, let's find out how many logs John can make from the tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, and the tree is 80 feet long, we can calculate the length of the usable part of the tree:

80% of 80 feet = 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet

Since each log is 4 feet long, we can divide the length of the usable part of the tree by the length of each log to find the number of logs:

64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs

Now, let's find out how many planks John can make from each log. Since he cuts 5 planks from each log, and he has 16 logs, we can multiply the number of logs by the number of planks per log:

16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks

Finally, let's calculate the total amount of money John makes by selling each plank for $1.2:

80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96

The final answer is: $96"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the combined salary of Valerie and her brother, and then add her mother's salary to it.

Let's start by finding Valerie's brother's salary. Since Valerie earns 1/2 of what her brother earns, we can represent her brother's salary as 2 times Valerie's salary. 

Valerie's salary = $5000
Brother's salary = 2 * Valerie's salary = 2 * $5000 = $10,000

Now, we need to find the combined salary of Valerie and her brother. 

Combined salary of Valerie and brother = Valerie's salary + Brother's salary = $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so we can represent her salary as 2 times the combined salary of Valerie and her brother.

Mother's salary = 2 * Combined salary of Valerie and brother = 2 * $15,000 = $30,000

Now, we can find the total amount of money they all have together by adding their individual salaries.

Total amount of money = Valerie's salary + Brother's salary + Mother's salary = $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000

"To solve this problem, we need to first find Grandma's speed on the beach and on the sidewalk. 

Let's denote Grandma's speed on the beach as x miles per minute. Since she walks at twice the rate on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.

We know that she walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. The time spent on the beach is 40 minutes. We can use the formula: time = distance / speed to find the time spent on the sidewalk.

Time spent on the beach = 2 miles / x miles/minute = 2/x minutes
Time spent on the sidewalk = 1 mile / 2x miles/minute = 1/(2x) minutes

Since the total time spent on the beach is 40 minutes, we can set up the equation: 2/x = 40. Solving for x, we get x = 1/20 miles/minute.

Now that we have Grandma's speed on the beach, we can find her speed on the sidewalk: 2x = 2 * (1/20) = 1/10 miles/minute.

Now, we can find the time spent on the sidewalk: 1/(2x) = 1/(2 * 1/10) = 5 minutes.

The total time spent on the entire walk is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk: 40 minutes + 5 minutes = 45 minutes.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find out how many more weeks it will take Jane to save a total of $60, we first need to calculate how much she has saved so far. 

Jane has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so the total amount she has saved is 4 * 8 = $32.

Since she wants to save a total of $60, we need to find out how much more she needs to save. This is 60 - 32 = $28.

Since she saves $4 per week, we can find out how many weeks it will take her to save $28 by dividing 28 by 4. 

28 / 4 = 7.

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"To find the total number of blue birds, we need to calculate the number of blue birds in each group of trees and then add them together.

First, we have 3 trees with 7 blue birds each. The total number of blue birds in these trees is 3 * 7 = 21.

Next, we have 2 trees with 4 blue birds each. The total number of blue birds in these trees is 2 * 4 = 8.

Finally, we have 1 tree with 3 blue birds.

To find the total number of blue birds, we add the number of blue birds in each group: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many marbles Bob initially has. We know that if he receives 2 dozen (24) more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. 

Let's denote the initial number of marbles Bob has as 'x'. Then, the equation can be written as:

x + 24 = 60

To find 'x', we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 24 from both sides:

x = 60 - 24
x = 36

So, Bob initially has 36 marbles. Now, if he loses 10 marbles, we need to subtract 10 from 36 to find the final number of marbles he has:

36 - 10 = 26

The final answer is: 26"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum temperature of the second bottle of water. 

Let's denote the temperature of the second bottle as x degrees. 

When Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle into his water bottle, the total volume of water in the bottle is 5 ounces. 

Since the temperature of the mixture is at least 40 degrees, we can set up the following equation:

(33 * 4 + x * 1) / 5 >= 40

Simplifying the equation:

132 + x >= 200

Subtracting 132 from both sides:

x >= 68

So, the second bottle must be at least 68 degrees.

The final answer is: 68"
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately and then add them together.

Melanie's father starts with 50 cows. Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, in one week, they bring 20 * 7 = 140 cows. In three weeks, they bring 140 * 3 = 420 cows. So, the total number of cows after three weeks is 50 + 420 = 470 cows.

Melanie's father starts with 20 chickens. Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. In one week, they bring 10 * 7 = 70 chickens. In three weeks, they bring 70 * 3 = 210 chickens. So, the total number of chickens after three weeks is 20 + 210 = 230 chickens.

The total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is the sum of the total number of cows and chickens, which is 470 + 230 = 700.

"To find the cost of each single bagel after the discount, we need to first calculate the total cost of the 4 packs of bagels before the discount, and then subtract the discount amount. 

The cost of 4 packs of bagels before the discount is 4 packs * $10.00 per pack = $40.00.

The discount amount is 10% of $40.00, which is 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00.

The total cost after the discount is $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Since each pack has 9 bagels, the total number of bagels is 4 packs * 9 bagels per pack = 36 bagels.

To find the cost of each single bagel, we divide the total cost after the discount by the total number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00 per bagel.

The final answer is: $1.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. We know that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops, so we can write an equation:

Scoops = 23 - 5
Scoops = 18

Now, let's find out how many potatoes it takes to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes. We know that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops, so we can write an equation:

Potatoes per scoop = (6 - 3) / (3 - 1)
Potatoes per scoop = 3 / 2
Potatoes per scoop = 1.5

Now that we know how many potatoes it takes to make 1 scoop, we can find out how many potatoes Gomer ate. We can multiply the number of scoops by the number of potatoes per scoop:

Potatoes = Scoops * Potatoes per scoop
Potatoes = 18 * 1.5
Potatoes = 27

"To find the total number of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we need to calculate the number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days separately, and then add them together.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days is 3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs.

In the next 30 days, Chester increases his egg consumption to 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in the next 30 days is 5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs.

Now, we add the total number of eggs from both periods: 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens: 240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozen eggs.

"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we first need to determine the total number of red jellybeans. We are given that there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans, and there are 17 green jellybeans. 

So, the number of red jellybeans = 2 * 17 = 34.

We know that the total number of jellybeans is 60. We already have 17 green jellybeans and 34 red jellybeans, which adds up to 51 jellybeans. 

To find the number of blue jellybeans, we subtract the total number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans: 
60 - 51 = 9.

Therefore, the number of blue jellybeans is 9.

"To find the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade, we need to calculate the total number of lemons he collects in one year and then multiply it by 10.

First, let's find the total number of lemons he collects in one year. Since he has 5 trees and each tree produces 6 lemons per year, we multiply the number of trees by the number of lemons per tree:

5 trees * 6 lemons/tree = 30 lemons/year

Now, we multiply the number of lemons collected in one year by 10 to find the total number of lemons collected in a decade:

30 lemons/year * 10 years = 300 lemons

"To find the number of women who remained on the bus, we first need to find the total number of women on the bus initially. 

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, we can let the number of men be 5x and the number of women be 9x. 

Since the total number of passengers is 84, we can set up the equation 5x + 9x = 84 to represent the total number of passengers.

Combine like terms: 14x = 84

Divide both sides by 14: x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the initial number of women on the bus: 9x = 9 * 6 = 54

After 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining is: 54 - 20 = 34

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many sunflowers and bouquets Faraday sold per day. 

Let's denote the number of sunflowers sold per day as 's' and the number of bouquets sold per day as 'b'. We know that each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, so the total number of sunflowers sold per day is 12b + s.

We are given that Faraday earned $26 from the sunflowers and $56 from the bouquets per day. Since each sunflower costs $2 and each bouquet costs $8, we can set up the following equations:

2s + 8b = 26 (equation 1)
8b = 56 (equation 2)

From equation 2, we can solve for b:
b = 56 / 8
b = 7

Now that we know the number of bouquets sold per day, we can substitute this value into equation 1 to solve for s:
2s + 8(7) = 26
2s + 56 = 26
2s = -30 (this is incorrect, we made a mistake in our previous steps)

Let's re-evaluate our equations. We know that 8b = 56, so b = 7. We also know that 2s + 8b = 26. We can substitute b = 7 into this equation:
2s + 8(7) = 26

"To find out how much money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks he buys, the revenue from selling 60% of the rocks, and then find the difference between the two.

First, let's find out how many rocks Adam can buy with $100. Since each rock costs $5, we divide the total amount by the cost per rock:

$100 / $5 = 20 rocks

Now, Adam sells 60% of his inventory, which is 60% of 20 rocks:

60% of 20 = 0.6 * 20 = 12 rocks

The revenue from selling 12 rocks at $7 each is:

12 rocks * $7/rock = $84

The cost of buying 20 rocks is:

20 rocks * $5/rock = $100

Since Adam only sells 12 rocks, he still has 8 rocks left, which he didn't sell. The cost of these unsold rocks is:

8 rocks * $5/rock = $40

The total cost of the rocks is the cost of the rocks he sold plus the cost of the rocks he didn't sell:

$100 (total cost) = $84 (cost of rocks sold) + $16 (cost of rocks not sold)

However, we need to find the cost of the rocks he didn't sell, which is $40. The total cost of the rocks is $100, and the cost of the rocks he sold is $84, so the cost of the rocks he didn't sell is $100 - $84 = $16.

The total revenue is $84, and the total cost is $100. The loss is the difference between the total cost and the total revenue:

Loss = Total cost - Total revenue
Loss = $100 - $84
Loss = $16

However, this is not the correct answer. We need to find the loss from the unsold rocks. The correct loss is the cost of the unsold rocks, which is $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of days it takes Lauren to complete each type of picture scene. 

First, let's find the number of days it takes Lauren to complete each type of picture scene:

- Large-sized picture scenes: 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days
- Medium-sized picture scenes: 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days
- Small-sized picture scenes: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days

Now, we need to find the LCM of 9, 6, and 7. 

The prime factorization of 6 is 2 * 3.
The prime factorization of 7 is 7.
The prime factorization of 9 is 3^2.

To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the numbers:
- The highest power of 2 is 2^1 (from 6).
- The highest power of 3 is 3^2 (from 9).
- The highest power of 7 is 7^1 (from 7).

The LCM is 2^1 * 3^2 * 7^1 = 2 * 9 * 7 = 126.

Therefore, it will take Lauren 126 days to complete all the picture scenes.

The final answer is: 126"
"To find out how many eggs each child receives, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of children.

"To find out how much Jen spends on food for her fish in May, we need to calculate the total cost of food for a month. 

First, we need to determine the number of days in May. May has 31 days. 

Since each fish needs $1 worth of food a day, and Jen has 3 fish, the daily cost of food for all her fish is 3 * $1 = $3.

To find the total cost for the month, we multiply the daily cost by the number of days in May: $3 * 31 = $93.

Therefore, Jen spends $93 on food for her fish in the month of May.

"To find out how many roses Patricia has now, we need to first determine how many roses she had after giving some to her mother. 

Initially, Patricia had 30 roses. She gave 24 roses to her mother, so we subtract 24 from 30 to find out how many roses she had left: 30 - 24 = 6.

Then, Patricia bought 15 more roses. To find out how many roses she has now, we add the 15 new roses to the 6 she had left: 6 + 15 = 21.

Therefore, Patricia now has 21 roses.

The final answer is: 21"
"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken. 

The total distance traveled is the sum of the two distances: 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles.

The total time taken is the sum of the two times: 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours.

The average speed is calculated by dividing the total distance by the total time: average speed = total distance / total time = 250 miles / 5 hours = 50 miles per hour.

"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning. 

The probability of the first ticket winning is 20% or 0.2. 
The probability of the second ticket winning is three times more likely, so it's 3 * 0.2 = 0.6.

Now, we multiply the probabilities of both tickets winning: 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

The final answer is: 12"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many seashells Carrey collected. Let's denote the number of seashells Carrey collected as 'x'. Since Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, Carlos collected 2x seashells. We are given that Jim collected 5 more than Carlos, so Jim collected 2x + 5 seashells.

We know that the total number of seashells collected is the sum of the seashells collected by each person, which is x + 2x + (2x + 5) = 5x + 5.

Since they divided the seashells equally among themselves, the total number of seashells is also equal to 3 times the number of seashells each person got. So, we can set up the equation: 5x + 5 = 3y, where y is the number of seashells each person got.

To find the value of x, we need to know that the total number of seashells is 27 + 5 = 32. So, 5x + 5 = 32. Subtracting 5 from both sides, we get 5x = 27. Dividing both sides by 5, we get x = 5.4. However, since x represents the number of seashells Carrey collected, it must be a whole number. This means our initial assumption that the total number of seashells is 32 is incorrect.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. We know that Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected. So, Carlos collected 27 - 5 = 22 seashells. Since Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, Carrey collected 22 / 2 = 11 seashells.

The total number of seashells is 27 + 22 + 11 = 60. Since they divided the seashells equally among themselves, each person got 60 / 3 = 20 seashells.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the number of carrots he eats on weekdays and add the number of carrots he eats on the weekend.

Mason eats 4 carrots each on 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday). So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is 4 * 5 = 20.

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is 5 + 5 = 10.

Now, we add the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend to find the total number of carrots he eats in a week: 20 + 10 = 30.

"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song and then add it to the length of the first song.

The first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. To find 60% of 5 minutes, we multiply 5 by 0.6 (which is the decimal form of 60%).

5 * 0.6 = 3 minutes

So, the second song is 3 minutes longer than the first song. To find the total length of the second song, we add 3 minutes to the length of the first song.

5 + 3 = 8 minutes

Now, we add the length of the first song to the length of the second song to find the total time of the cassette.

5 + 8 = 13 minutes

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes.

"To find the total profit, we need to calculate the profit from each day and then add them together.

On Monday, Linus bought 2 devices for $20 each. So, the total cost price for Monday is 2 * $20 = $40. He sold each device for twice the original price, which is 2 * $20 = $40. So, the total selling price for Monday is 2 * $40 = $80. The profit for Monday is $80 - $40 = $40.

On Tuesday, Linus bought 4 devices for $20 each. So, the total cost price for Tuesday is 4 * $20 = $80. He sold each device for twice the original price, which is 2 * $20 = $40. So, the total selling price for Tuesday is 4 * $40 = $160. The profit for Tuesday is $160 - $80 = $80.

The total profit is the sum of the profit from Monday and Tuesday, which is $40 + $80 = $120.

"To find the length of Carl's cane, we need to determine Carl's height first. We know that Isabel is 7 feet tall and Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel. 

Isabel's height = 7 feet
Ned's height = Isabel's height - 2 feet
Ned's height = 7 - 2
Ned's height = 5 feet

Since Carl is one foot taller than Ned, we can calculate Carl's height as follows:
Carl's height = Ned's height + 1 foot
Carl's height = 5 + 1
Carl's height = 6 feet

We are given that Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. Therefore, we can calculate the length of Carl's cane as follows:
Cane's length = Carl's height / 2
Cane's length = 6 / 2
Cane's length = 3 feet

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of bottles required to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people. 

First, we need to find out how many bottles are required to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of one person. Since each juice can cover 20% of one person's daily energy demand, we need 5 bottles to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand (100% / 20% = 5).

Next, we need to find out how many bottles are required to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people. We multiply the number of people by the number of bottles required to satisfy one person's daily energy needs: 2300 * 5 = 11500.

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we need to find out how many more bottles it needs to produce to meet the demand of 11500 bottles. We subtract the production capacity from the required number of bottles: 11500 - 4200 = 7300.

The final answer is: 7300"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find the number of babies wearing purple and blue. Since Carla has 8 identical octuplets, 3/4 of them wear purple, and 1/4 wear blue.

Number of purple-wearers = 8 * (3/4) = 6
Number of blue-wearers = 8 * (1/4) = 2

Next, we need to find the number of babies wearing bows. All the blue-wearers wear bows, and 1/3 of the purple-wearers also wear bows.

Number of blue-wearers wearing bows = 2
Number of purple-wearers wearing bows = 6 * (1/3) = 2

Now, we need to find the total number of babies wearing bows. This is the sum of the number of blue-wearers wearing bows and the number of purple-wearers wearing bows.

Total number of babies wearing bows = 2 + 2 = 4

The probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is the number of purple-wearers wearing bows divided by the total number of babies wearing bows.

Probability = (Number of purple-wearers wearing bows) / (Total number of babies wearing bows) = 2 / 4 = 0.5

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100.

Percentage chance = 0.5 * 100 = 50%

Now, let's find the total number of reports received on Wednesday by subtracting the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday. However, we need to subtract the reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received last week to get the reports received on Wednesday.

Reports received on Wednesday = Total reports received last week - (Reports received on Monday and Tuesday + Reports received on Thursday and Friday)
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - (1907 + 2136)
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - 4043
Reports received on Wednesday = 1125

The final answer is: 1125"
"To find the total amount of money Abraham will earn, we need to calculate the amount of money he earned from each sale and add them together.

First, Abraham sold half of his land for $50. Since he owns 80 square meters, half of that is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters. 

Next, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. Since he owns 80 square meters, 1/4 of that is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters. 

Now, we need to find out how much land he has left. He sold 40 + 20 = 60 square meters, so he has 80 - 60 = 20 square meters left.

He sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, the amount of money he earned from selling the remaining land is 20 * 3 = $60.

Now, let's add up the money he earned from each sale: $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

The final answer is: $140"
"To find Geb's age, we need to first calculate half of Haley's age. Haley is 26 years old, so half of her age would be 26 / 2 = 13.

Since Geb is 10 less than half of Haley's age, we subtract 10 from 13 to find Geb's age. 

Geb's age = 13 - 10 = 3."
"To find out how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to first determine how many face masks he uses in a day. 

Since Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out and he goes out three times a day, the total number of face masks he uses in a day is 2 * 3 = 6.

Now, to find out how many face masks he uses in 2 days, we multiply the number of face masks he uses in a day by 2. 

6 * 2 = 12

Therefore, Tyrion uses 12 face masks every 2 days."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Cole hid 3 dozen eggs. Since a dozen is 12, 3 dozen is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

2. Lamar finds 5 eggs.

3. Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 2 * 5 = 10 eggs.

4. Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.

5. Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

6. To find the total number of eggs found, we add the number of eggs each person found: 5 (Lamar) + 10 (Stacy) + 8 (Charlie) + 4 (Mei) = 27 eggs.

7. To find the number of eggs still hidden, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the initial number of eggs: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the total amount John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of apartments and the total amount he gets paid per week.

First, let's find the total number of apartments in the first two complexes:
200 apartments * 2 = 400 apartments

The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, so we need to find 60% of 400 and add it to 400:
60% of 400 = 0.6 * 400 = 240
Total apartments in the last complex = 400 + 240 = 640
Total apartments in all complexes = 400 + 400 + 640 = 1440

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so the total number of collections per week is:
1440 apartments * 3 collections/week = 4320 collections/week

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so the total amount he makes per week is:
4320 collections/week * $0.40/collection = $1728/week

The final answer is: $1728"
"To find the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and add them up.

- In the 5th year, the tree produces 50 fruits.
- In the 6th year, it produces 3 times the initial amount, which is 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
- In the 7th year, it produces 7 times the initial amount, which is 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
- In the 8th year, it produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree, but we don't know the production of a 10-year-old tree yet. Let's denote the production of a 10-year-old tree as 'x'. So, in the 8th year, it produces x - 200 fruits.
- In the 9th year, the tree doesn't produce any fruit.
- In the 10th year, a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now, we need to find the production of a 10-year-old tree to calculate the production in the 8th year. We know that a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 1000 fruits. We also know that a 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount, which is 350 fruits. Since the production increases by a factor of 3 from the 6th year to the 7th year, it should increase by a factor of 4 from the 7th year to the 10th year (because 3 * 4 = 12, but we know the 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, so it's actually 5 times the 7-year-old tree's production). Therefore, the production of a 10-year-old tree is 5 * 350 = 1750 fruits.

Now that we know the production of a 10-year-old tree, we can find the production in the 8th year, which is 1750 - 200 = 1550 fruits.

Now, let's add up the production of the tree for all 10 years:
50 + 150 + 350 + 1550 + 0 + 1750 = 3750

The final answer is: 3750"
"To find out how much money Jack has now, we need to calculate the amount Sophia gave him and add it to his initial amount.

Sophia gave Jack 1/5 of her $100. To find 1/5 of $100, we multiply $100 by 1/5.

1/5 * $100 = $20

Now, we add the amount Sophia gave Jack to his initial amount:

$100 (initial amount) + $20 (amount given by Sophia) = $120

So, Jack now has $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as B, the length of the yellow rope as Y, and the length of the red rope as R. We are given that R = 4B and B = Y - 7.

We can express Y in terms of B: Y = B + 7.

We are also given that R + B + Y = 37. Substituting R = 4B and Y = B + 7 into this equation, we get:

4B + B + (B + 7) = 37

Combine like terms: 
6B + 7 = 37

Subtract 7 from both sides: 
6B = 30

Divide both sides by 6: 
B = 5

Now that we know B, we can find R: 
R = 4B = 4 * 5 = 20

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's assume Ronnie was given $5 initially. Since Rissa was given thrice as much, Rissa was given 3 * $5 = $15.

After giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, let's call the amount given to the little sister 'x'. So, Ronnie is left with $5 - x and Rissa is left with $15 - x.

According to the problem, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. This means (15 - x) = (4/5) * 15. 

To find the value of x, we can solve the equation: 
(15 - x) = (4/5) * 15
15 - x = 12
x = 3

Now that we know x, we can find out how much money Ronnie has left. Ronnie is left with $5 - x = $5 - 3 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the amount of red, white, and purple paint as R, W, and P, respectively. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, we can say that R = W = P.

We are given that half the mural is yellow, which means the other half is painted with red, white, and purple. Since the total amount of paint used is 12 pints, and half of it is yellow, the other half is also 6 pints (12 / 2 = 6).

Since the other half is painted with red, white, and purple, and there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple, we can say that R + W + P = 6.

We also know that R = W = P, so we can substitute W and P with R in the equation: R + R + R = 6.

Combine like terms: 3R = 6.

Divide both sides by 3: R = 2.

So, the amount of red paint used is 2 pints.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To find the total area of the house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house, then add them together.

First, let's find the area of one bedroom: 
Area of one bedroom = length * width = 20 * 12 = 240 square feet.

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms = 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area = 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is given as 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas together: 
Total area = area of bedrooms + area of living room + area of the rest of the house
Total area = 960 + 1200 + 1000
Total area = 3160 square feet.

The final answer is: 3160"

On Monday, Alice saw 3 clouds.
On Tuesday, she saw double the number of clouds as Monday, which is 3 * 2 = 6 clouds.
On Wednesday, she saw double the number of clouds as Tuesday, which is 6 * 2 = 12 clouds.
On Thursday, she saw double the number of clouds as Wednesday, which is 12 * 2 = 24 clouds.
On Friday, she saw double the number of clouds as Thursday, which is 24 * 2 = 48 clouds.

Now, let's add up the number of clouds she saw each day:
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93

"To find the number of pods in the new box, we need to calculate 20% of 100 and add it to 100. 

20% of 100 = 0.2 * 100 = 20
Number of pods in the new box = 100 + 20 = 120

Since the price remains the same, we can calculate the number of cycles per dollar for the new box.

Number of cycles per dollar = Number of pods in the new box / Price of the box
= 120 / 12
= 10

Therefore, with the new box, you can run 10 dishwashing cycles for $1."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since he withdraws 1000 dollars in 20 dollar bills, he has 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home. So, he has 50 - 10 = 40 bills left.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is 20, so he uses 20 bills to pay for the bill. This leaves him with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

4. Thomas then triples his money. Since he has 20 bills left, and each bill is worth $20, he has a total of 20 * 20 = $400. Tripling this amount gives him 3 * 400 = $1200.

5. He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. To find out how many 5 dollar bills he has, we need to divide the total amount of money by 5. 1200 / 5 = 240.

The final answer is: 240"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals in the first half.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals.

Now, we need to find out how many goals team A scored in the second half. It is given that team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B in the second half. Since team B scored 8 goals in the second half, team A scored 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals in the second half.

Now, let's calculate the total number of goals scored by each team in the match. Team A scored 4 goals in the first half and 2 goals in the second half, so the total number of goals scored by team A is 4 + 2 = 6.

Team B scored 2 goals in the first half and 8 goals in the second half, so the total number of goals scored by team B is 2 + 8 = 10.

The total number of goals scored in the match is the sum of the goals scored by team A and team B, which is 6 + 10 = 16.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much chalk the teacher has left after Monday and then determine how many days it will last.

The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk. He uses 45% of it on Monday, so the amount of chalk used is 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches.

The amount of chalk left is 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches.

Since the teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches, we need to find out how many days the remaining 2.75 inches will last at a rate of 20% usage per day.

Let's set up an equation to represent the situation:

2.75 = 5 * (1 - 0.20)^n

where n is the number of days.

Simplifying the equation:

2.75 = 5 * (0.80)^n

Divide both sides by 5:

0.55 = (0.80)^n

To solve for n, we can take the logarithm of both sides:

log(0.55) = n * log(0.80)

Now, we can use a calculator to find the value of n:

n = log(0.55) / log(0.80)
n ≈ 3.93

Since the teacher can't use a fraction of a day, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the teacher has 4 days before he has to recycle the piece of chalk.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the number of students not on varsity, we first need to find the total number of students on varsity. 

One-third of the girls are on varsity, so the number of girls on varsity is 12 * (1/3) = 4. 
One-fourth of the boys are on varsity, so the number of boys on varsity is 12 * (1/4) = 3.

The total number of students on varsity is 4 (girls) + 3 (boys) = 7.

The total number of students in the class is 12 (boys) + 12 (girls) = 24.

The number of students not on varsity is 24 (total students) - 7 (students on varsity) = 17.

Mike bought 5 face masks. 

Three times the number of face masks Mike bought is 3 * 5 = 15.

Johnny bought 2 more than three times as many as Mike, so we add 2 to 15: 15 + 2 = 17.

Therefore, Johnny bought 17 face masks.

"To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we need to first determine the total number of teeth the dentist works on. The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more teeth than he drills, so the number of teeth capped is 4 + 7 = 11.

The total number of teeth the dentist works on is the sum of the teeth drilled and capped, which is 4 + 11 = 15.

To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we divide the total number of teeth worked on by the total number of teeth James has, and then multiply by 100.

Percentage = (15 / 30) * 100
Percentage = 0.5 * 100
Percentage = 50%

"To find the total cost of the milk that Mr. Marcellus purchased, we need to multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon. 

Total cost = Number of gallons * Cost per gallon
Total cost = 4000 * $3.5
Total cost = $14,000

Since 2/5 of the milk was expired, we need to find 2/5 of 4000 gallons to determine the amount that was returned.

Expired milk = (2/5) * 4000
Expired milk = (2 * 4000) / 5
Expired milk = 8000 / 5
Expired milk = 1600 gallons

The refund amount will be the cost of the expired milk, which is the same as the total cost per gallon multiplied by the number of expired gallons.

Refund amount = Total cost per gallon * Expired milk
Refund amount = $3.5 * 1600
Refund amount = $5600

"Let's denote Colin's current age as C and Wendy's current age as W.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be expressed as:

W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be expressed as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

We can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:

C + 25 = (5/3)(C + 7)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2:

20 = C

"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we first need to determine the total number of books he can buy with $27,000. 

Since he can buy 100 books for $500, we can find the total number of books he can buy by dividing the total amount he has ($27,000) by the cost of 100 books ($500).

Total number of books = Total amount / Cost per 100 books
Total number of books = $27,000 / $500
Total number of books = 54

Now that we know Bob can buy a total of 54 books, we need to find out how many books he can buy per school. Since he is distributing the money to 3 schools, we divide the total number of books by 3.

Number of books per school = Total number of books / Number of schools
Number of books per school = 54 / 3
Number of books per school = 18

"To find out how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of slices each type of pizza is needed for. 

For the cheese pizza, each friend eats 6 slices, and there are 6 friends, so the total number of cheese pizza slices needed is 6 friends * 6 slices/friend = 36 slices. 

For the pepperoni pizza, each friend eats 4 slices, and there are 6 friends, so the total number of pepperoni pizza slices needed is 6 friends * 4 slices/friend = 24 slices.

Since the cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices and the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, we need to find the minimum number of whole pies of each type that can satisfy the total number of slices needed. 

For the cheese pizza, we need 36 slices, and each pie has 12 slices, so we need 36 / 12 = 3 whole cheese pizzas.

For the pepperoni pizza, we need 24 slices, and each pie has 8 slices, so we need 24 / 8 = 3 whole pepperoni pizzas.

Therefore, Kate needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas.

The total number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy is 3 (cheese) + 3 (pepperoni) = 6.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the net rate at which Jay is building snowballs. 

Jay builds 20 snowballs in 1 hour, which is equivalent to 60 minutes. So, his rate of building snowballs is 20/60 = 1/3 snowballs per minute.

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. To find the rate at which snowballs melt, we divide the number of snowballs that melt by the time it takes for them to melt: 2/15 snowballs per minute.

Now, we need to find the net rate at which Jay is building snowballs. This is the rate at which he builds snowballs minus the rate at which they melt: (1/3) - (2/15) = (5/15) - (2/15) = 3/15 = 1/5 snowballs per minute.

Since Jay wants to have 60 snowballs, and he is building snowballs at a net rate of 1/5 per minute, we can find the time it will take him to build 60 snowballs by dividing the total number of snowballs by the net rate: 60 / (1/5) = 60 * 5 = 300 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to find Jim's age 20 years ago, when Digimon was first released. 

Let's denote Jim's age 20 years ago as 'x'. Since John was twice as old as Jim 20 years ago, John's age 20 years ago would be 2x.

We know that John is 28 now, so 20 years ago, John's age would be 28 - 20 = 8. 

Since John's age 20 years ago was 2x, we can set up the equation 2x = 8. Solving for x, we get x = 4.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, the remaining bandages after the first day are x - 38 + 50.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. The remaining bandages after the second day are (x - 38 + 50) - 28.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages (2 * 50 = 100 bandages) and used half a pack (50 / 2 = 25 bandages). The remaining bandages after the third day are ((x - 38 + 50) - 28) - 25 + 100.

We are given that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. So, we can set up the equation:

(x - 38 + 50) - 28 - 25 + 100 = 78

Simplifying the equation:

x - 38 + 50 - 28 - 25 + 100 = 78
x + 57 = 78

Subtracting 57 from both sides:

x = 21

"To find Jen's total earnings for April, we need to calculate her total hours worked and her attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her total hours worked in April. Since there are 4 weeks in April and she works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week, we can calculate her total hours worked as follows:

Total hours worked = 7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week * 4 weeks
Total hours worked = 180 hours

Next, let's calculate her total earnings from her hourly rate:

Total earnings from hourly rate = Total hours worked * Hourly rate
Total earnings from hourly rate = 180 hours * $1.5/hour
Total earnings from hourly rate = $270

Since Jen did not incur any absences for April, she will receive the attendance bonus of $10 for the month.

Total earnings = Total earnings from hourly rate + Attendance bonus
Total earnings = $270 + $10

Now, we need to find the total amount of blood in ten sharks. To do this, we multiply the amount of blood in one shark by the number of sharks: 120 * 10 = 1200 gallons.

The final answer is: 1200"
"To find the total number of people who entered the restaurant, we need to calculate the number of people who entered at each time and add them up.

First, 50 people entered in the morning. 

At 10:00, 40 more people entered, so the total number of people at this point is 50 + 40 = 90.

Then, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is 2 * 40 = 80 people. So, the total number of people now is 90 + 80 = 170.

Finally, 3 times as many people as the number that came in first (50) entered by evening, which is 3 * 50 = 150 people. So, the total number of people now is 170 + 150 = 320.

The total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is 320."
"To find the total number of pens Alain has, we first need to determine the number of red pens and black pens separately.

Since Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens, and each pack has 5 pens, the total number of red pens is 5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 red pens.

It is given that Alain's mom bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens. Therefore, the number of black pens is 2 * 25 = 50 black pens.

To find the total number of pens Alain has, we add the number of red pens and black pens: 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens.

The final answer is: 75"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find the cost of one bottle of scotch. Since John buys 10 bottles for $600, we can divide the total cost by the number of bottles to get the cost per bottle.

Cost per bottle of scotch = Total cost / Number of bottles
Cost per bottle of scotch = $600 / 10
Cost per bottle of scotch = $60

Next, we need to find the cost of one bottle of cognac. We know that the cost of cognac is 50% more than the cost of scotch. To find the cost of cognac, we can multiply the cost of scotch by 1.5 (since 50% more is the same as 1.5 times the original cost).

Cost per bottle of cognac = Cost per bottle of scotch * 1.5
Cost per bottle of cognac = $60 * 1.5
Cost per bottle of cognac = $90

Now, we know that John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch. Since he buys 10 bottles of scotch, he buys 10 * 2 = 20 bottles of cognac.

Total cost of cognac = Cost per bottle of cognac * Number of bottles of cognac
Total cost of cognac = $90 * 20
Total cost of cognac = $1800

Finally, we can find the total amount John spends on everything by adding the total cost of scotch and the total cost of cognac.

Total amount spent = Total cost of scotch + Total cost of cognac
Total amount spent = $600 + $1800
Total amount spent = $2400

The final answer is: $2400"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of trees planted on the first day and the second day separately, and then add them together.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees and twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which is 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees. So, the total number of trees planted on the first day is 20 + 40 = 60.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees than on the first day, which is 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day, which is 40 + (1/4 * 40) = 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees. So, the total number of trees planted on the second day is 30 + 50 = 80.

The total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 60 + 80 = 140.

The final answer is: 140"
"To find the amount of root beer available for each person to drink, we need to calculate the total amount of root beer remaining after all the events.

Initially, Fred made 24 gallons of root beer.

On the first day, 4 gallons were consumed by his children, so the remaining amount is:
24 - 4 = 20 gallons

On the second day, 7 gallons were spilled, so the remaining amount is:
20 - 7 = 13 gallons

On the third day, 5 gallons were consumed by Ronnie, so the remaining amount is:
13 - 5 = 8 gallons

On the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party, and they shared the remaining root beer equally. To find the amount each person got, we divide the remaining amount by the number of people:
8 / 3 = 2.67 gallons

So, each person got approximately 2.67 gallons of root beer to drink during the party.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2.67}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge as 'x'. 

The problem states that eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be translated into the equation: 4x + 8 = 40.

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate the variable 'x'. We can do this by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation: 4x = 40 - 8.

This simplifies to: 4x = 32.

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for 'x': x = 32 / 4.

x = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the number of fish with red stripes, we first need to calculate one-third of the total number of fish. 

One-third of 66 is 66 / 3 = 22.

Now, we know that 22 fish have red stripes. To find the number of remaining fish, we subtract the number of fish with red stripes from the total number of fish.

Remaining fish = Total fish - Fish with red stripes
Remaining fish = 66 - 22
Remaining fish = 44

Now, we need to find the number of fish with blue stripes, which is 5/11 of the remaining fish.

Number of fish with blue stripes = (5/11) * Remaining fish
Number of fish with blue stripes = (5/11) * 44
Number of fish with blue stripes = 20

However, we need to find the total number of fish with red and blue stripes. Since some fish may have both red and blue stripes, we need to be careful not to double-count them. 

To find the total number of fish with red and blue stripes, we can add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes.

Total fish with red and blue stripes = Fish with red stripes + Fish with blue stripes
Total fish with red and blue stripes = 22 + 20
Total fish with red and blue stripes = 42

"To find out how many eyeshadow colors Amy has left, we need to calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors she initially had and then subtract the ones she lost or used up.

Amy initially had 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each, so she had 2 * 4 = 8 eyeshadow colors from the palettes.

She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 eyeshadow colors each, so she had 3 * 6 = 18 eyeshadow colors from the makeup sets.

In total, Amy had 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors.

Her sister stole one of the palettes, which had 4 colors, so Amy lost 4 eyeshadow colors.

Amy used up half of the colors from one makeup set, which had 6 colors. Half of 6 is 3, so she used up 3 eyeshadow colors.

In total, Amy lost 4 + 3 = 7 eyeshadow colors.

To find out how many eyeshadow colors Amy has left, we subtract the ones she lost from the total: 26 - 7 = 19.

The final answer is: 19"
"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to break down the information given.

1. Mattison's height is 60 inches.
2. The two-story house is 7 times as high as Mattison, so the total height of the house is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.
3. The first floor's floor to ceiling height is three times Mattison's height, so it is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.
4. Since the total height of the house is 420 inches and the first floor's height is 180 inches, the height of the second floor is 420 - 180 = 240 inches.
5. The height of the roof from the second floor's floor is the same as the height of the first floor, which is 180 inches.

The final answer is: 180"
"To find the number of shells found by team Gogetters, we first need to determine the number of shells found by team Alphas and team The finders.

Team Alphas found 40% of the total 700 shells. To find 40% of 700, we multiply 700 by 0.4:
700 * 0.4 = 280 shells found by team Alphas.

The remaining shells are 700 - 280 = 420 shells. Team The finders found 60% of the remaining shells. To find 60% of 420, we multiply 420 by 0.6:
420 * 0.6 = 252 shells found by team The finders.

Now, we subtract the shells found by team Alphas and team The finders from the total to find the number of shells found by team Gogetters:
700 - 280 - 252 = 168 shells found by team Gogetters.

The final answer is: 168"
"To find the total amount of exercise needed for all 4 dogs, we can multiply the average exercise per dog by the number of dogs. The average exercise per dog is 3 miles, and there are 4 dogs. 

Total exercise = Average exercise per dog * Number of dogs
Total exercise = 3 miles * 4
Total exercise = 12 miles

Now, we know the total exercise needed for all 4 dogs is 12 miles. We also know the exercise needed for the first, second, and third dogs. 

First dog: 1 mile
Second dog: 4 miles
Third dog: 3 miles

Total exercise for the first three dogs = 1 + 4 + 3
Total exercise for the first three dogs = 8 miles

To find the exercise needed for the last dog, we subtract the total exercise for the first three dogs from the total exercise for all 4 dogs.

Exercise for the last dog = Total exercise for all 4 dogs - Total exercise for the first three dogs
Exercise for the last dog = 12 miles - 8 miles
Exercise for the last dog = 4 miles

The last dog needs 4 miles of exercise per day.

"To find out how much money John got from the loan, we need to calculate 40% of the value of his house. 

40% of $250,000 = 0.4 * $250,000 = $100,000

John then uses 60% of this amount to pay off his debts. 

60% of $100,000 = 0.6 * $100,000 = $60,000

To find out how much money John has leftover, we subtract the amount he used to pay off his debts from the amount he got from the loan.

$100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000

The final answer is: $40,000"

"To find Trinity's profit, we need to first find the selling price of the magazines. 

The cost price of the magazines is $72. Trinity sells the magazines at 11/8 of the price she bought them. 

To find the selling price, we multiply the cost price by 11/8. 

Selling price = (11/8) * 72
Selling price = (11 * 72) / 8
Selling price = 792 / 8
Selling price = 99

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the cost price from the selling price.

Profit = Selling price - Cost price
Profit = 99 - 72
Profit = 27

"To find the total amount of water removed, we need to calculate the amount of water removed by each setting and then add them together.

The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed by the low setting is 1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters.

The medium setting removes twice as much water as the low setting, which is 2 * 1 liter/day = 2 liters/day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed by the medium setting is 2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters.

The high setting removes twice as much water as the medium setting, which is 2 * 2 liters/day = 4 liters/day. Since Brian ran it for 5 days, the total amount of water removed by the high setting is 4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters.

Now, we add the total amount of water removed by each setting: 3 liters (low) + 6 liters (medium) + 20 liters (high) = 29 liters.

"To find out how many balloons were thrown, we need to first determine the total number of balloons Jolene and her friends had initially. Since they filled up 10 packs of balloons with 30 balloons per pack, the total number of balloons is 10 * 30 = 300.

Since 12 balloons were left by the end of the afternoon, we can find the number of balloons thrown by subtracting the remaining balloons from the total number of balloons. 

300 (total balloons) - 12 (remaining balloons) = 288

So, Jolene and her friends threw 288 balloons.

The final answer is: 288"

"To find the combined capacity of both schools, we first need to determine the capacity of John's school. 

Since each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, and Ali's class has 120 students, we can find the capacity of one of John's classes by multiplying 120 by 1/8.

Capacity of one of John's classes = 120 * (1/8) = 15 students

Since John has two classes, we multiply the capacity of one class by 2 to find the total capacity of John's school.

Capacity of John's school = 15 * 2 = 30 students

Now, we add the capacity of Ali's school (which is 120 students) to the capacity of John's school to find the combined capacity of both schools.

Combined capacity = 120 + 30 = 150

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total interest Stephen owes his sister and then subtract the total amount he has paid in the 11 months from the total amount he owes, including interest.

First, let's calculate the total interest Stephen owes his sister. The interest is 2% of the initial amount borrowed, which is $300. 

Interest = 2% of $300 = 0.02 * $300 = $6

So, Stephen owes his sister $300 (initial amount) + $6 (interest) = $306 in total.

Now, let's calculate the total amount Stephen pays in the 11 months. He pays $25 per month for 11 months.

Total amount paid in 11 months = $25 * 11 = $275

Now, we need to find the amount Stephen pays in the twelfth month. This will be the remaining amount, including interest, that he owes his sister.

Amount paid in the twelfth month = Total amount owed - Total amount paid in 11 months
= $306 - $275
= $31

Therefore, Stephen will pay $31 in the twelfth month."
"To find out how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we need to first calculate the total number of diapers changed per day. Since each child requires 5 diaper changes per day and there are 2 children, the total number of diaper changes per day is 2 * 5 = 10.

Since Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, she changes 10 / 2 = 5 diapers per day. 

To find out how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we subtract the number of diapers his wife changes from the total number of diaper changes per day: 10 - 5 = 5.

"To find the total number of jelly beans in the jar, we first need to calculate the volume of the jar. The jar has a square base with a side length of 6 inches and a height of 15 inches. The volume of a rectangular prism (such as the jar) is given by the formula V = lwh, where l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height.

Given that the base is square, the length and width are the same, so we can calculate the volume as V = 6 * 6 * 15 = 540 cubic inches.

Since the jelly beans have a volume of 0.15 cubic inches, we can calculate the total number of jelly beans in the jar by dividing the volume of the jar by the volume of a single jelly bean. However, we need to account for the packing efficiency, which is 80%. This means that the actual number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar is 80% of the calculated number.

First, let's calculate the total number of jelly beans without considering the packing efficiency: 540 / 0.15 = 3600.

To account for the packing efficiency, we multiply this number by 0.8: 3600 * 0.8 = 2880.

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we can calculate the number of red jelly beans by multiplying the total number of jelly beans by 0.3: 2880 * 0.3 = 864.

However, we are given that the true number of red jelly beans in the container is 900. To find out how far off Tim's guess was, we need to know what his guess was. Since we don't have this information, we can't calculate the exact difference."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, the bus had 20 people.

At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus became 20 + 40 = 60.

At the second stop, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. Since 40 people entered at the first station, 3/4 of 40 is (3/4) * 40 = 30. So, 30 people entered the bus at the second stop. The total number of people on the bus became 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus became 2 * 90 = 180.

The bus has a capacity of 200 people. To find the remaining spaces, we subtract the current number of people from the capacity: 200 - 180 = 20.

"To find the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to calculate the cost of visits for the first 5 years and the cost of visits for the next 3 years.

For the first 5 years, the cost of one visit is $2. Since Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year, the annual cost is 3 * $2 = $6. For 5 years, the total cost is 5 * $6 = $30.

The cost of one visit increases by 150% after 5 years. A 150% increase means the new cost is 2.5 times the original cost. So, the new cost of one visit is $2 * 2.5 = $5. The annual cost for the next 3 years is 3 * $5 = $15. For 3 years, the total cost is 3 * $15 = $45.

The total cost for all 8 years is the sum of the cost for the first 5 years and the cost for the next 3 years: $30 + $45 = $75.

There are 4 grades (4-7) and 10 students in each grade, so the total number of students is 4 * 10 = 40.

Since only 8 students can try the escape room at a time, we need to divide the total number of students by 8 to find the number of groups.

40 / 8 = 5

Since each group uses their full 45 minutes, the time it takes for everyone to try the escape room is the number of groups multiplied by the time per group.

"To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length can be represented as 4x.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, and it is divided into two pieces. Therefore, the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is equal to 40 feet. We can write this as an equation:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece (x = 8), we can find the length of the longer piece by multiplying x by 4:

Longer piece = 4x = 4(8) = 32

"To find out how much seasoning Aiden needs, we first need to determine how many pounds of ground beef he needs to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound to find the total pounds of meat needed.

Total meatballs needed = 80
Meatballs per pound = 16

Total pounds of meat needed = Total meatballs needed / Meatballs per pound
Total pounds of meat needed = 80 / 16
Total pounds of meat needed = 5

Now that we know Aiden needs 5 pounds of ground beef, we can find out how much seasoning he needs. He adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat.

Total pounds of meat needed = 5
Seasoning per pound = 2 tablespoons

Total seasoning needed = Total pounds of meat needed * Seasoning per pound
Total seasoning needed = 5 * 2
Total seasoning needed = 10

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Let C be the number of cupcakes Carly made, and B be the number of brownies she made. We know that B = 3C - 2, since she makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes.

We also know that each person gets 2 treats, and there are 5 people in the class. So, the total number of treats is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, so C + B = 10.

Substituting B = 3C - 2 into the equation C + B = 10, we get C + (3C - 2) = 10.

Combine like terms: 4C - 2 = 10.

Add 2 to both sides: 4C = 12.

Divide both sides by 4: C = 3.

The original cost of the manicure and pedicure is $35 + $40 = $75. 

The 20% discount is 0.20 * $75 = $15. 

So, the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure is $75 - $15 = $60.

Since Karen wants to add nail art on each of her fingers, and there are 10 fingers in total (5 on each hand), the cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost is the sum of the discounted manicure and pedicure cost and the nail art cost, which is $60 + $30 = $90.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many paintings Shelley has. Since Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, and Samantha has 27 paintings, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship:

Samantha's paintings = Shelley's paintings - 12
27 = Shelley's paintings - 12

To find Shelley's paintings, we add 12 to both sides of the equation:

Shelley's paintings = 27 + 12
Shelley's paintings = 39

Now that we know Shelley has 39 paintings, we can find out how many paintings Kim has. Since Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, we can set up another equation:

Shelley's paintings = Kim's paintings + 8
39 = Kim's paintings + 8

To find Kim's paintings, we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:

Kim's paintings = 39 - 8
Kim's paintings = 31

"To find the price of the toy after the discount in January, we need to follow the given changes in price.

Initially, the price of the toy was $40.

In December, the price increased by 80%. To find the new price, we multiply the initial price by 1.8 (100% + 80% = 180%, or 1 + 0.8 = 1.8).

New price in December = $40 * 1.8 = $72

In January, the price decreased by 50%. To find the new price, we multiply the price in December by 0.5 (100% - 50% = 50%, or 1 - 0.5 = 0.5).

New price in January = $72 * 0.5 = $36

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."

For the standard rate lessons, Charlie has 4 lessons at $80 per hour. So, the total income from standard rate lessons is:
4 * $80 = $320

For the reduced rate lessons, Charlie has 2 lessons at a 25% discount. The reduced rate is 75% of the standard rate, which is 0.75 * $80 = $60 per hour. So, the total income from reduced rate lessons is:
2 * $60 = $120

Now, we add the income from both types of lessons to find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day:

270 + 40 = 310
310 + 90 = 400
400 + 100 = 500
500 + 70 = 570
570 + 60 = 630

The sum of the scores is 630.

Next, we need to count the total number of scores, which is 9.

Now, we divide the sum by the total number of scores to find the mean:
630 ÷ 9 = 70

The final answer is: 70"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many pomelos Eve gave away. Let's start by identifying the information given:

- Eve originally had 20 pieces of pomelos.
- After giving some away, Eve is left with 1/4 of the pomelos she originally had.

Since Eve is left with 1/4 of the original amount, we can set up an equation to represent this situation:

Let x be the number of pomelos Eve gave away.

The number of pomelos Eve has left is 1/4 of the original amount, which is 20. So, we can write the equation as:

20 - x = (1/4) * 20

To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. First, we can simplify the right-hand side of the equation by multiplying 1/4 by 20:

20 - x = 5

Now, we can isolate x by subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation:

-x = -15

To solve for x, we multiply both sides of the equation by -1:

x = 15

So, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the number of apples Walter ate, we first need to find the number of apples remaining after he ate 2/5 of them. 

Walter bought 60 apples and ate 2/5 of them. 
2/5 of 60 is (2/5) * 60 = 24 apples.

So, the number of apples remaining after Walter ate 2/5 of them is 60 - 24 = 36 apples.

Walter then gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples. 
25% of 36 is (25/100) * 36 = 9 apples.

So, the number of apples remaining after Walter gave his sister 9 apples is 36 - 9 = 27 apples.

Walter sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. 
The total amount of money Walter received is 27 * 3 = $81.

The final answer is: $81"
"To find the total number of novels Regina wrote this year, we need to determine the total number of novels she wrote last year and then multiply it by 4 (since 3 quarters is equivalent to 3/4, and to find the whole, we multiply by 4/3).

Let's denote the total number of novels Regina wrote this year as 'x'. We know that 3/4 of x is equal to 9 novels. 

We can set up the equation: (3/4)x = 9

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 4/3 to isolate x:

x = 9 * (4/3)
x = 12

So, Regina wrote 12 novels this year. 

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the distance covered by Michael in 3 days, we need to calculate the total distance he travels in that time. 

First, we need to find the total hours he travels in 3 days. Since there are 24 hours in a day, the total hours he travels is 3 days * 24 hours/day = 72 hours.

Now, we can find the distance he travels in 72 hours by multiplying his average speed by the total hours: 50 km/hr * 72 hr = 3600 km.

To find the percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas that he has covered, we need to divide the distance he traveled (3600 km) by the total distance (6000 km) and multiply by 100: (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100 = 60%.

The final answer is: 60"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Madeline ate 6 grapes.
2. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make a full glass, so he used 6 * 5 = 30 grapes.
3. The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.
4. Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie requires 12 grapes. So, the total number of grapes used by their mother is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.
5. To find the total number of grapes at the beginning, we need to add the grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and her mother. However, since the grapes used by their mother are the remaining grapes, we need to subtract the grapes used by Madeline and her brother from the total number of grapes used by their mother to find the initial number of grapes. The total number of grapes used by their mother is 48, and the grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 36. So, the initial number of grapes is 48 + 36 = 84.

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the total number of teachers at school that day, we need to add the number of teachers who were sick and the number of substitute teachers. 

Number of teachers who were sick: 13
Number of substitute teachers: 9

Total number of teachers at school that day = Number of teachers who were sick + Number of substitute teachers
Total number of teachers at school that day = 13 + 9
Total number of teachers at school that day = 22

The total number of teachers at school that day is 22."
"To find the total cost of making macaroni and cheese, we need to calculate the cost of the pasta, cheddar cheese, and gruyere cheese.

The cost of the pasta is $1.00 per box. Since Bud makes it once a week, he buys 52 boxes in a year (52 weeks). The total cost of the pasta is 52 * $1.00 = $52.00.

The cost of the cheddar cheese is $3.00. Since Bud makes it once a week, he buys 52 blocks in a year. The total cost of the cheddar cheese is 52 * $3.00 = $156.00.

The cost of the gruyere cheese is twice the cost of the cheddar cheese, which is 2 * $3.00 = $6.00. Since Bud makes it once a week, he buys 52 blocks in a year. The total cost of the gruyere cheese is 52 * $6.00 = $312.00.

The total cost of making macaroni and cheese is the sum of the costs of the pasta, cheddar cheese, and gruyere cheese: $52.00 + $156.00 + $312.00 = $520.00.

The final answer is: $520.00"
"To find the total number of classrooms the custodian needs to clean, we already know that number is 80. 

The custodian has 5 days to complete the task. We need to find out how many minutes they have to work in total. Since they work 8 hours a day, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 8 hours by 60 minutes per hour to get the total minutes per day: 8 * 60 = 480 minutes per day.

Since they have 5 days, we multiply the total minutes per day by 5 to get the total minutes for the entire task: 480 * 5 = 2400 minutes.

Now, we know it takes them 15 minutes per classroom. To find the total number of minutes spent cleaning, we multiply the number of classrooms by the time per classroom: 80 * 15 = 1200 minutes.

To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning, we divide the total minutes spent cleaning by the total minutes available and multiply by 100: (1200 / 2400) * 100 = 50%.

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, let's first determine the capacity of each shelf. 

Let's denote the capacity of a middle shelf as 'x'. Since the bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, its capacity is 2x. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so its capacity is 2x - 5.

We know that each of the middle shelves can hold 10 books. Therefore, x = 10.

Now, we can calculate the capacity of the bottom and top shelves:
- Bottom shelf: 2x = 2 * 10 = 20 books
- Top shelf: 2x - 5 = 2 * 10 - 5 = 15 books

The total capacity of the middle shelves is 2 * 10 = 20 books. The total capacity of the bottom and top shelves is 20 + 15 = 35 books.

The total capacity of one bookcase is 20 (middle) + 20 (middle) + 35 (bottom and top) = 75 books.

Since Elly has 110 books, we need to find out how many bookcases she needs to hold all of them. 

To do this, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase: 110 / 75 = 1.46. 

Since we can't have a fraction of a bookcase, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find Rose's profit, we first need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

The cost of 5 dozens of eggs is 5 * $2.40 = $12.

Since 1 dozen has 12 eggs, 5 dozens will have 5 * 12 = 60 eggs.

Rose will sell the eggs for $1 for 3 eggs, so the selling price per egg is $1 / 3 = $0.33.

The total revenue from selling 60 eggs is 60 * $0.33 = $20.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $20 - $12 = $8.

The final answer is: $8"
"To find the number of white hats, we first need to determine the number of red and blue hats. 

Half of the hats are red, which is 100 * 0.5 = 50 red hats.

The remaining hats are 100 - 50 = 50 hats.

3/5 of the remaining hats are blue, which is 50 * (3/5) = 30 blue hats.

The rest of the remaining hats are white, which is 50 - 30 = 20 white hats.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the cost of each stick of jerky, we need to first calculate the total cost of the bag after the discount and then divide it by the number of sticks.

The original price of the bag is $18.00, and there's a $3.00 discount. So, the discounted price is $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00.

Since the price is in dollars, we need to convert it to cents for uniformity. There are 100 cents in a dollar, so the discounted price in cents is $15.00 * 100 = 1500 cents.

Now, we know that there are 30 sticks in a bag. To find the cost of each stick, we divide the total cost in cents by the number of sticks: 1500 cents / 30 sticks = 50 cents per stick.

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many questions Audrey needs to get right in total to pass the 6th grade. Since she needs to get 70% of the total questions correct, we need to find the total number of questions first.

The first test has 70 questions, and the second test has 40 questions. The total number of questions is 70 + 40 = 110.

To find 70% of 110, we multiply 110 by 0.7: 110 * 0.7 = 77.

So, Audrey needs to get 77 questions correct in total to pass the 6th grade.

Now, let's find out how many questions she got right in the first test. She got 60% of 70 questions correct, which is 70 * 0.6 = 42.

To find out how many questions she needs to get right in the second test, we subtract the number of questions she got right in the first test from the total number of questions she needs to get right: 77 - 42 = 35.

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as S and the number of blueberry cubes as B. We are given that B = 5S - 4. We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so S + B = 116.

We can substitute the expression for B into the second equation: S + (5S - 4) = 116. Combining like terms, we get 6S - 4 = 116. Adding 4 to both sides, we get 6S = 120. Dividing both sides by 6, we get S = 20.

Now that we know S, we can find B by substituting S into the equation B = 5S - 4: B = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96.

Ara has been playing 40 games every year for 4 years. So, the total number of games she has played is:
40 games/year * 4 years = 160 games

Since her score for every game is 21 points, we can multiply the total number of games by her score per game to find the total points:
160 games * 21 points/game = 3360 points

The final answer is: 3360"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Brendan initially had 10 marbles.
2. He dropped half of them, so he had 10 / 2 = 5 marbles left.
3. He found 3 more marbles, so now he had 5 + 3 = 8 marbles.
4. However, one of the marbles he picked up was actually a bead, so he removed it from the count. This leaves him with 8 - 1 = 7 marbles.

Therefore, Brendan ended up with 7 marbles.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, we know that for every 2 customers who come into the dealership, 1 will buy a car. This means that for every 2 customers, Jason will sell 1 car. Since Jason needs to sell 15 cars, he will need 15 * 2 = 30 customers to come into the dealership.

Next, we know that for every 25 telephone calls, 1 customer will come into the dealership. To find out how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to get 30 customers, we can set up a proportion: 25 calls / 1 customer = x calls / 30 customers. 

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 25 * 30 = 1 * x, which gives us 750 = x. 

Therefore, Jason would need to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

The final answer is: 750"
"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of flashlights and the number of candles separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of flashlights. There are 4 people in the family, and each person has a flashlight. So, the total number of flashlights is 4.

Next, let's calculate the number of candles. There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. 

Half of 8 rooms is 4 rooms. So, 4 rooms have 4 small candles each, which is 4 * 4 = 16 small candles. The other 4 rooms have 5 medium candles each, which is 4 * 5 = 20 medium candles. 

The total number of candles is 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles.

Now, we add the number of flashlights and the number of candles together: 4 flashlights + 36 candles = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find out how many chips each person gets, we need to first calculate the total number of chips Mitchell has. Since he buys two bags of chips with 55 chips each, we multiply the number of bags by the number of chips in each bag.

Total chips = 2 bags * 55 chips/bag = 110 chips

Next, we need to divide the total number of chips by the number of family members to find out how many chips each person gets.

Chips per person = Total chips / Number of family members
= 110 chips / 5 people
= 22 chips per person

"To find the total time it takes to solve the Rubik's cube, we need to calculate the time taken for each side and add them up.

The first side takes 5 minutes.
The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so they take 2 * 5 = 10 minutes each.
The last two sides each take half as long as the first side, so they take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes each.

Now, let's add up the time taken for all sides:
5 (first side) + 10 (second side) + 10 (third side) + 2.5 (fourth side) + 2.5 (fifth side) = 30 minutes

The total time it takes to solve the Rubik's cube is 30 minutes.

Since there are 20 helmets and half as many helmets as footballs, the number of footballs is twice the number of helmets. 
Number of footballs = 2 * 20 = 40

Since there are half as many robots as helmets, the number of robots is half the number of helmets.
Number of robots = 20 / 2 = 10

Now, we need to find the total number of items Dominick saw. 
Total number of items = Number of helmets + Number of robots + Number of footballs
Total number of items = 20 + 10 + 40
Total number of items = 70

"To find out the total number of calls Tim deals with in a day, we need to convert the time it takes him to deal with a call from minutes to hours. 

15 minutes is equal to 15/60 = 0.25 hours.

Now, we can find the number of calls he deals with in a day by dividing the total hours he spends at work by the time it takes to deal with a call.

Number of calls per day = 6 hours / 0.25 hours per call = 24 calls per day.

To find the total number of calls he deals with in a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of calls per day by the number of days.

Total calls in a week = 24 calls per day * 5 days = 120 calls.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time it takes for Phineas to cover the distance on land and in water separately, and then add them together.

Since Phineas needs to cover 200 yards, and half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, we can calculate the distance for each as follows:

Distance on land = 200 yards / 2 = 100 yards
Distance in water = 200 yards / 2 = 100 yards

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for Phineas to cover each distance:

Time on land = Distance on land / Speed on land = 100 yards / 20 yards/minute = 5 minutes
Time in water = Distance in water / Speed in water = 100 yards / 10 yards/minute = 10 minutes

Total time = Time on land + Time in water = 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes

"To find the total cost of the phone plan, we need to determine the cost of the additional phones and add it to the cost of the main phone.

Let's assume the cost of each additional phone is x. Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of the main phone is 2x.

We know that the main phone costs $20, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 20

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 20 / 2
x = 10

Now that we know the cost of each additional phone is $10, we can find the total cost of the additional phones. There are 4 additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is:

4x = 4 * 10
4x = 40

The total cost of the phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones:

Total cost = 2x + 4x
Total cost = 6x
Total cost = 6 * 10
Total cost = 60

"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the total number of people he saw on the first three days and add it to the total number of people he saw on the remaining days.

On the first day, Conor saw 50 people.

On the second day, there were 20 more people than on the first day, so the number of people on the second day is 50 + 20 = 70.

On the third day, the number of people was twice the number on the second day, so the number of people on the third day is 2 * 70 = 140.

The total number of people on the first three days is 50 + 70 + 140 = 260.

Since there are 7 days in a week, and Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the remaining 4 days, the total number of people he saw on the remaining days is 60 * 4 = 240.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps and calculate the number of kernels that popped in each 30-second interval.

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped.
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount popped, so 3 * 20 = 60 kernels popped.
3. In the next 30 seconds, four times the initial popping rate popped, so 4 * 20 = 80 kernels popped.
4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slowed down to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, so 0.5 * 80 = 40 kernels popped.

Now, let's calculate the total number of kernels that popped during cooking: 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 kernels.

After Garrett takes the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat. This means 0.25 * 40 = 10 kernels popped from the residual heat.

To find the total number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat, we add the kernels that popped during cooking and the kernels that popped from the residual heat: 200 + 10 = 210.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of lemonade Tim needs to make, including the extra gallon for Allen. Since Tim needs to make 4 gallons of regular lemonade and 1 extra gallon that is twice as tart, we can consider the extra gallon as 2 gallons of regular lemonade. 

So, in total, Tim needs to make 4 + 2 = 6 gallons of lemonade.

Since each gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice, and 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the total number of lemons needed for 6 gallons of lemonade.

6 gallons * 1 cup/gallon = 6 cups of lemon juice
6 cups of lemon juice / 1 cup/6 lemons = 6 * 6 = 36 lemons

Therefore, Tim will need 36 lemons.

"To find the total amount of dog food needed in a week, we need to calculate the daily consumption of both breeds and then multiply it by 7.

The German Shepherds consume 5 kilograms each per day, and there are 3 of them. So, their total daily consumption is 5 * 3 = 15 kilograms.

The Bulldogs consume 3 kilograms each per day, and there are 2 of them. So, their total daily consumption is 3 * 2 = 6 kilograms.

The total daily consumption of both breeds is 15 + 6 = 21 kilograms.

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7: 21 * 7 = 147 kilograms.

Therefore, the Kennel house will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week.

"To find the total number of animal legs on the farm, we need to calculate the total number of legs from both the 2-legged and 4-legged animals.

The 2-legged animals contribute 2 legs each, so the total number of legs from 2-legged animals is 10 * 2 = 20.

The 4-legged animals contribute 4 legs each, so the total number of legs from 4-legged animals is 15 * 4 = 60.

Now, we add the total number of legs from both types of animals to get the overall total: 20 + 60 = 80.

The total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm is 80 / 2 = 40.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance Elvis traveled in both directions and then find the difference between the two distances.

First, let's calculate the distance Elvis traveled west. Since he traveled for 5 hours at an average speed of 18mph, we can use the formula:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 18mph * 5 hours
Distance = 90 miles

Now, let's calculate the distance Elvis traveled east. Since he traveled for 8 hours at an average speed of 18mph, we can use the same formula:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 18mph * 8 hours
Distance = 144 miles

Since Elvis traveled 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, we need to find the difference between the two distances to determine how far he is from his house now. 

The distance traveled west is 90 miles, and the distance traveled east is 144 miles. To find the net distance from his house, we subtract the distance traveled west from the distance traveled east:

Net distance = Distance traveled east - Distance traveled west
Net distance = 144 miles - 90 miles
Net distance = 54 miles

The final answer is: 54"
"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year and subtract it from the initial value.

Initial value of the boat = $9000

First year depreciation: 30% of $9000 = 0.3 * $9000 = $2700
Value after first year = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Second year depreciation: 30% of $6300 = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890
Value after second year = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Third year depreciation: 20% of $4410 = 0.2 * $4410 = $882
Value after third year = $4410 - $882 = $3528

The final value of the boat after three years is $3528.

The final answer is: $3528"
"To find the number of pink candies, we first need to determine the number of orange and yellow candies. 

We are given that there are 54 red candies. Since there are twice as many orange candies as red candies, the number of orange candies is 2 * 54 = 108.

We are also given that there are half as many yellow candies as red candies. The number of yellow candies is 54 / 2 = 27.

Now, we know the total number of candies is 232. We can find the number of pink candies by subtracting the number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total.

Number of pink candies = Total number of candies - (Number of red candies + Number of orange candies + Number of yellow candies)
= 232 - (54 + 108 + 27)
= 232 - 189
= 43

"To find the total cost of the hotel and bus travels, we need to calculate the cost of the hotel and the cost of the bus trips separately and then add them together.

The cost of the hotel for 3 nights is 3 * $80 = $240.

The cost of one bus trip is 10% of the cost of one night at the hotel, which is 0.1 * $80 = $8.

Since Helen rode the bus 7 times, the total cost of the bus trips is 7 * $8 = $56.

The total cost of the hotel and bus travels is $240 + $56 = $296.

The final answer is: $296"
"To find out how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we first need to determine how many marbles Dallas received. We know that Dallas has 21 marbles after dropping 4, so he must have had 21 + 4 = 25 marbles initially.

Since Mazie gave the twins a total of 52 marbles, and Dallas had 25, we can find out how many marbles Darla received by subtracting 25 from 52.

52 (total marbles) - 25 (marbles given to Dallas) = 27

So, Mazie gave 27 marbles to Darla.

"To find the total weight of the car, luggage, and children, we need to add the individual weights together.

Total weight = weight of the car + weight of luggage + weight of children
Total weight = 1200 pounds + 250 pounds + (2 * 75 pounds)
Total weight = 1200 pounds + 250 pounds + 150 pounds
Total weight = 1600 pounds

Since the force required to move the car is 1% of the total weight, we need to calculate 1% of 1600 pounds.

Force required = 1% * 1600 pounds
Force required = 0.01 * 1600 pounds
Force required = 16 pounds

"To determine the amount of crepe paper James needs, we need to calculate the perimeter of the backyard fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides. 

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2l + 2w, where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the length (l) is 20 feet and the width (w) is 15 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

P = 2(20) + 2(15)
P = 40 + 30
P = 70

So, James needs 70 feet of crepe paper to go around the entire fence.

The final answer is: 70"
"To find the average age of Mia and Emma, we first need to determine Emma's age. Since Mia is 40 years old and they are 16 years apart in age, Emma's age would be 40 + 16 = 56 years old.

Now, to find the average age, we add their ages and divide by 2. The sum of their ages is 40 + 56 = 96.

"To find the total cost of the place settings, we need to calculate the cost of each type of plate and then add them together.

Avery needs 12 dinner plates, and each costs $6.00, so the total cost of dinner plates is 12 * $6.00 = $72.00.

She also needs 12 bowls, and each costs $5.00, so the total cost of bowls is 12 * $5.00 = $60.00.

For the salad plates, she needs 12 as well, and each costs $4.00, so the total cost of salad plates is 12 * $4.00 = $48.00.

Now, we add the costs of all the plates together: $72.00 (dinner plates) + $60.00 (bowls) + $48.00 (salad plates) = $180.00.

The total amount Avery will spend on place settings is $180.00.

"To find out how much feed is left after a week, we need to calculate the total amount of feed consumed by the pigs in a week and subtract that from the total amount of feed ordered.

First, let's calculate the amount of feed each pig eats in a day: 4 pounds * 2 = 8 pounds per pig per day.

Since Dexter has 5 pigs, the total amount of feed consumed by all pigs in a day is: 8 pounds/pig * 5 pigs = 40 pounds per day.

In a week, there are 7 days, so the total amount of feed consumed by all pigs in a week is: 40 pounds/day * 7 days = 280 pounds.

Now, let's subtract the total amount of feed consumed from the total amount of feed ordered: 300 pounds - 280 pounds = 20 pounds.

Therefore, the amount of feed left after a week is 20 pounds.

"To find out how many hot dogs John needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of hot dogs required for the party. 

Since each guest will eat 2 hot dogs and there are 20 guests, the total number of hot dogs needed is 20 * 2 = 40 hot dogs.

However, John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party. So, the total number of hot dogs he needs to buy is 40 - 4 = 36 hot dogs.

Since a pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs and costs $2, we need to find out how many packs John needs to buy. 

To do this, we divide the total number of hot dogs needed by the number of hot dogs in a pack: 36 / 6 = 6.

Since each pack costs $2, the total amount John needs to spend on hot dogs is 6 * $2 = $12.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there are 5 children following the truck.

On the second street, each of the 5 children is joined by another child, so the total number of children becomes 5 + 5 = 10.

On the third street, each of the existing 10 children is joined by another 2 children, so the total number of children becomes 10 + (10 * 2) = 10 + 20 = 30.

The original 5 children then give up and leave the group, so we subtract 5 from the total number of children: 30 - 5 = 25.

Therefore, there are 25 children now following the truck.

"To find the total amount of money the company will receive for selling the produced chocolate bars during two weeks, we need to calculate the total number of bars produced in two weeks and then multiply it by the price per bar.

First, let's find the number of bars produced in one week. Since the company produces 5000 bars in a day, we multiply this by 7 (the number of days in a week):

5000 bars/day * 7 days/week = 35,000 bars/week

Now, we multiply the number of bars produced in one week by 2 to find the total number of bars produced in two weeks:

35,000 bars/week * 2 weeks = 70,000 bars

Since each bar is sold for $2, we multiply the total number of bars by the price per bar:

"To find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. The original price of each T-shirt is $8. Since Jake buys 2 T-shirts, the total cost of the T-shirts without the discount is 2 * $8 = $16. However, Jake gets a buy one get one 50% off deal, which means one of the T-shirts is 50% off. The discount on one T-shirt is 50% of $8, which is 0.5 * $8 = $4. So, the cost of the T-shirt with the discount is $8 - $4 = $4. Since Jake gets one T-shirt at the original price and one at the discounted price, the total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and Jake gets a 40% discount. The discount on the shoes is 40% of $40, which is 0.4 * $40 = $16. So, the cost of the shoes after the discount is $40 - $16 = $24.

Now, let's add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store. The total cost is $12 + $24 = $36.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested: 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.
2. Igor gathered two more test tubes than the number of Petri dishes requested: 14 - 2 = 12 test tubes, but we already know Igor gathered 8 test tubes, so this statement is incorrect. Let's assume Igor gathered 2 more than the number of Petri dishes requested, which means he gathered 16 test tubes (16 = 14 + 2). This is a contradiction, so we will use the first statement that Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested.
3. Igor gathered the correct number of beakers, which is 7.
4. The total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench was 29.

Let's denote the number of beakers Igor lost as 'x'. The total number of items Igor had is the sum of the test tubes, beakers, and Petri dishes he gathered, minus the number of beakers he lost. This can be expressed as:

8 (test tubes) + 7 (beakers) + 14 (Petri dishes) - x (beakers lost) = 29

Combine like terms:

29 - x = 29

To find the number of beakers lost, we need to isolate 'x':

x = 29 - 29
x = 0

However, this is not possible since Igor lost some beakers. Let's re-evaluate the information.

We know Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, which is 8. We also know he gathered 2 more test tubes than the number of Petri dishes requested, which is 16. This is a contradiction, so we will use the first statement that Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested.

Let's re-evaluate the total number of items Igor gathered: 8 test tubes, 7 beakers, and 14 Petri dishes. The total number of items Igor gathered is 8 + 7 + 14 = 29. This means Igor did not lose any beakers.

However, the problem states that Igor lost several beakers on the way to the lab bench. This implies that the total number of items Igor had before placing them on the lab bench is more than 29. Let's re-evaluate the information.

Let's denote the number of beakers Igor lost as 'x'. The total number of items Igor had before placing them on the lab bench is the sum of the test tubes, beakers, and Petri dishes he gathered, plus the number of beakers he lost. This can be expressed as:

8 (test tubes) + 7 (beakers) + 14 (Petri dishes) + x (beakers lost) = 29 + x

Combine like terms:

29 + x = 29 + x

This equation is true for any value of 'x'. However, we know that Igor lost several beakers. Let's re-evaluate the information.

We know Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, which is 8. We also know he gathered 2 more test tubes than the number of Petri dishes requested, which is 16. This is a contradiction, so we will use the first statement that Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested.

Let's re-evaluate the total number of items Igor gathered: 8 test tubes, 7 beakers, and 14 Petri dishes. The total number of items Igor gathered is 8 + 7 + 14 = 29. This means Igor did not lose any beakers.

However, the problem states that Igor lost several beakers on the way to the lab bench. This implies that the total number of items Igor had before placing them on the lab bench is more than 29. Let's re-evaluate the information.

Let's denote the number of beakers Igor lost as 'x'. The total number of items Igor had before placing them on the lab bench is the sum of the test tubes, beakers, and Petri dishes he gathered, plus the number of beakers he lost. This can be expressed as:

8 (test tubes) + 7 (beakers) + 14 (Petri dishes) + x (beakers lost) = 29 + x

Combine like terms:

29 + x = 29 + x

This equation is true for any value of 'x'. However, we know that Igor lost several beakers. Let's re-evaluate the information.

"To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws required for the tables and subtract that from the total number of screws he has.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws, so each table requires 4 * 2 = 8 screws.

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws required is 8 * 4 = 32 screws.

James has 40 screws, so to find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws required from the total number of screws he has: 40 - 32 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we first need to determine the number of eggs in the second basket. Since there are twice as many eggs in the second basket as in the first, and the first basket has 10 eggs, the second basket has 2 * 10 = 20 eggs.

Now, to find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we add the number of eggs in the first basket to the number of eggs in the second basket: 10 + 20 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to calculate the individual amounts raised by each girl and then add them together.

Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, who raises $430. So, Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750.

Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, who raises $300. So, Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, we add up the amounts raised by each girl: $750 (Kim) + $430 (Alexandra) + $700 (Maryam) + $300 (Sarah) = $2180.

The total amount of money raised is $2180.

The final answer is: $2180"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the speed of Aaron and Vanessa. Let's assume Aaron's speed is A miles per minute and Vanessa's speed is V miles per minute.

Given that Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, we can write the equation:
A = 2V

We are also given that Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron, so if Vanessa runs 4 miles, Aaron runs 2 miles. Since Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, we can write the equation:
2 = 16A

Now, we can substitute the value of A from the first equation into the second equation:
2 = 16(2V)
2 = 32V

Now, we can solve for V:
V = 2/32
V = 1/16

Since V is the speed of Vanessa in miles per minute, we can find the time it took her to run 4 miles by dividing the distance by her speed:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 4 / (1/16)
Time = 4 * 16
Time = 64

The final answer is: 64"
"To find out how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of line required for the existing dock. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock, the total line required is 3 * 200 = 600 feet.

However, the caretaker already has 6 feet of new line. So, we need to subtract this from the total line required: 600 - 6 = 594 feet.

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line.

"To find out how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to calculate their daily revenue and then multiply it by the number of days they are open.

First, let's calculate the daily revenue. They get 6 reservations a night, and each reservation includes 2 meals that cost $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine. 

Daily revenue = (6 reservations * 2 meals * $5) + (6 reservations * $5)
Daily revenue = (6 * 2 * $5) + (6 * $5)
Daily revenue = $60 + $30
Daily revenue = $90

Since they are open 2 days a week, we multiply the daily revenue by 2.

Weekly revenue = Daily revenue * 2
Weekly revenue = $90 * 2
Weekly revenue = $180

The final answer is: $180"
"To find the cost price of each watermelon, we first need to find the total cost of the watermelons. The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80, so the cost price of each watermelon can be found by dividing the total cost by the number of watermelons.

Cost price of 50 watermelons = $80
Cost price of 1 watermelon = $80 / 50
Cost price of 1 watermelon = $1.60

Now, we know the cost price of each watermelon and the profit percentage. To find the selling price of each watermelon, we need to add the profit to the cost price and then calculate 25% of the cost price.

Profit percentage = 25%
Profit = 25% of $1.60
Profit = 0.25 * $1.60
Profit = $0.40

Selling price of 1 watermelon = Cost price + Profit
Selling price of 1 watermelon = $1.60 + $0.40
Selling price of 1 watermelon = $2

The selling price of each watermelon is $2."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the current age of James and then determine the age of John's youngest son.

First, let's find James' current age. We know that James is twice as old as Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years. This means that James is twice as old as 12 - 3 = 9 years old. So, James is 9 * 2 = 18 years old.

Since James is 18 years old now and John had him when he was 19, John is 19 - 18 = 1 year older than James. However, this is not the correct way to calculate John's age. We need to find the age of John when James was born. Since James is 18 now, John was 19 when James was born. However, we are given that John had James when he was 19, which means John was 19 at that time. 

However, we are also given that John's youngest son was born when John was 32. This means that John's youngest son is 32 - 19 = 13 years younger than James. 

Now, let's find the current age of John's youngest son. Since John's youngest son is 13 years younger than James, he is 18 - 13 = 5 years old.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

The final answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many oranges each person can peel in an hour and then compare their rates.

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so her rate is 1 orange / 3 minutes. 
Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so her rate is 1 orange / 4 minutes.

In one hour (60 minutes), Ana can peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges.
In one hour, Jane can peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

The difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane in an hour is 20 - 15 = 5 oranges.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total amount Mark paid, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator and the labor cost.

First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator. The original price is $400, and Mark gets it for 80% off. To find the discount amount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage (80% = 0.8).

Discount = $400 * 0.8 = $320

The cost of the radiator after the discount is the original price minus the discount amount.

Radiator cost = $400 - $320 = $80

Next, let's calculate the labor cost. The mechanic works for 3 hours at $50 an hour.

Labor cost = 3 hours * $50/hour = $150

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the labor cost to find the total amount Mark paid.

Total cost = Radiator cost + Labor cost
Total cost = $80 + $150
Total cost = $230

The final answer is: $230"
"Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as W. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write the equation:

C + W = 20

We also know that the total number of legs is 70. Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, so we can write the equation:

2C + 4W = 70

We can solve this system of equations by multiplying the first equation by 2 to get:

2C + 2W = 40

Now, we can subtract this equation from the second equation to eliminate C:

(2C + 4W) - (2C + 2W) = 70 - 40
2W = 30

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

W = 15

Now that we know the number of cows, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find the number of chickens:

C + 15 = 20
C = 5

Therefore, there are 5 chickens on Farmer Brown's farm.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

First, let's find the total number of slices. There are 7 pizzas, and each pizza is cut into 8 slices. 

Total number of slices = 7 pizzas * 8 slices/pizza = 56 slices

There are 4 people in total, including Henry and his 3 friends. 

Number of people = 4

Now, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people to find out how many slices each person can have.

Slices per person = Total number of slices / Number of people
= 56 slices / 4 people
= 14 slices/person

The final answer is: 14"
