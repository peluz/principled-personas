"To find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to determine the number of eggs she sells. 

First, let's calculate the total number of eggs she lays per day: 16 eggs.

Next, let's calculate the number of eggs she consumes: 3 eggs for breakfast and 4 eggs for baking muffins, which is 3 + 4 = 7 eggs.

Now, let's subtract the number of eggs she consumes from the total number of eggs she lays: 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.

Since she sells the remainder at the farmers' market for $2 per egg, we multiply the number of eggs she sells by the price per egg: 9 eggs * $2/egg = $18.

The final answer is: $18"
"To find the total number of bolts required, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber first. Since it's half the amount of blue fiber, and there are 2 bolts of blue fiber, we can calculate the white fiber as follows:

White fiber = 2 bolts / 2 = 1 bolt

Now, we add the blue fiber and white fiber to get the total:

Total bolts = 2 bolts (blue) + 1 bolt (white) = 3 bolts

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the profit Josh made, we first need to determine the total value of the house after the repairs. 

The original value of the house was $80,000. Josh put in $50,000 in repairs, which increased the value of the house by 150%. 

To find the new value of the house, we can set up an equation: 

New Value = Original Value + (Original Value * 150%)

New Value = $80,000 + ($80,000 * 1.5)
New Value = $80,000 + $120,000
New Value = $200,000

Now, we need to find the profit Josh made. The profit is the difference between the new value of the house and the total amount Josh spent on the house, which is the original price plus the repairs.

Profit = New Value - (Original Value + Repairs)
Profit = $200,000 - ($80,000 + $50,000)
Profit = $200,000 - $130,000
Profit = $70,000

The final answer is: $70,000"
"To find the total number of meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total meters he runs in one sprint session and then multiply it by the number of sessions he has in a week.

Since James runs 3 sprints in one session, and each sprint is 60 meters, the total meters he runs in one session is:
3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/session

Since James runs 3 sessions a week, the total meters he runs in a week is:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

The final answer is: 540"
"To determine the total amount of feed needed for the final meal, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed given to the chickens throughout the day. 

In the morning, Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups of feed. In the afternoon, she gives them another 25 cups of feed. So, the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

Since Wendi feeds each chicken 3 cups of feed per meal, and she has 20 chickens, the total amount of feed needed per meal is 3 * 20 = 60 cups.

To find the amount of feed needed for the final meal, we subtract the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total amount of feed needed per meal: 60 - 40 = 20 cups.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining glasses. The first glass costs $5. 

The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * 5 = $3. 

The third glass costs 60% of $3, which is 0.6 * 3 = $1.8. 

We can see that the cost of each subsequent glass is 60% of the previous glass's cost. 

The sequence of the cost of the glasses is: $5, $3, $1.8, $1.08, $0.64, $0.384, $0.2304, $0.13824, $0.082944, $0.0497664, $0.02986584, $0.017929504, $0.010757904, $0.006454144, $0.0038272864, $0.002306377184, $0.0013738263104.

To find the total cost, we need to sum up the cost of all the glasses. 

The sum of the cost of the glasses is approximately $5 + $3 + $1.8 + $1.08 + $0.64 + $0.384 + $0.2304 + $0.13824 + $0.082944 + $0.0497664 + $0.02986584 + $0.017929504 + $0.010757904 + $0.006454144 + $0.0038272864 + $0.002306377184 + $0.0013738263104 ≈ $24.01.

However, a more efficient way to calculate this is to use the formula for the sum of a geometric series: S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.

In this case, a = 5, r = 0.6, and n = 16. 

S = 5 * (1 - 0.6^16) / (1 - 0.6) ≈ 24.01

The final answer is: $24.01"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of sheep in Toulouse and Charleston first. 

Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, and Seattle has 20 sheep, we can calculate the number of sheep in Charleston as follows:
Charleston = 4 * Seattle = 4 * 20 = 80

Now, we know that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. So, we can calculate the number of sheep in Toulouse as follows:
Toulouse = 2 * Charleston = 2 * 80 = 160

Now, we have the number of sheep in Toulouse (160), Charleston (80), and Seattle (20). To find the total number of sheep, we add these numbers together:
Total = Toulouse + Charleston + Seattle = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260

The final answer is: 260"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

First, let's find out how long it would take Carla to download the file without any interruptions. Since she can download 2 GB/minute, we can divide the total file size by her download rate:

200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes

However, 40% of the way through the download, Windows forces a restart. To find out how much of the file Carla has downloaded at this point, we can multiply the total file size by 0.4:

200 GB * 0.4 = 80 GB

Since Carla has downloaded 80 GB, she still needs to download 120 GB (200 - 80 = 120). 

Now, let's consider the time it takes to download the remaining 120 GB. Since Carla can download 2 GB/minute, we can divide the remaining file size by her download rate:

120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes

However, we also need to account for the 20 minutes it takes to install updates and restart the download. So, the total time it takes to download the file is the time it takes to download the remaining 120 GB (60 minutes) plus the time it takes to install updates and restart the download (20 minutes):

60 minutes + 20 minutes = 80 minutes

The total time it takes to download the file is 80 minutes.

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and calculate the distance traveled in each segment.

First, John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph. The distance traveled in this segment is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 60 mph * 3 hours = 180 miles

Then, he spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so no distance is traveled in this segment.

Next, he drives for 0.5 hours (half an hour) at 30 mph. The distance traveled in this segment is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 mph * 0.5 hours = 15 miles

Finally, he drives for the remaining 1.5 hours (4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours) at 80 mph. The distance traveled in this segment is:
Distance = Speed * Time = 80 mph * 1.5 hours = 120 miles

The total distance traveled is the sum of the distances in each segment:
Total Distance = 180 miles + 0 miles + 15 miles + 120 miles = 315 miles

However, since John is trying to get home, we need to consider the distance he traveled in the first 3 hours as the distance from home. The distance he traveled in the last 4 hours is the distance from his current location to home.

The distance from home is the difference between the total distance traveled and the distance traveled in the first 3 hours:
Distance from home = Total Distance - Distance traveled in the first 3 hours
= 315 miles - 180 miles
= 135 miles

The final answer is: 135"
"To find Eliza's total earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours separately, then add them together.

For the first 40 hours, her earnings are 40 hours * $10/hour = $400.

For the overtime hours, she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours. Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, so her overtime rate is $10 * 1.2 = $12/hour. Her overtime earnings are 5 hours * $12/hour = $60.

Her total earnings for the week are $400 + $60 = $460.

The final answer is: $460"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and then add them together.

In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it's 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

In the third month, the downloads were reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we multiply 180 by 0.3, which is 54. Then, we subtract 54 from 180 to get 126 downloads in the third month.

Now, we add the downloads from each month: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The final answer is: 366"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts: 3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen will be 3 x $68 = $204.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes: 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen will be 2 x $80 = $160.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes: 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen will be 6 x $55 = $330.

Finally, let's add the costs together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The final answer is: $694"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of planting the tree and the annual expenses, and then find the point at which the total earnings from selling lemons exceed these costs.

The initial cost of planting the tree is $90. The annual expenses for watering and feeding the tree are $3. 

Each year, the tree will grow 7 lemons, which can be sold for $1.5 each, resulting in a total annual revenue of 7 * $1.5 = $10.5.

To find the break-even point, we need to calculate the total cost of the tree and the total annual expenses, and then find the point at which the total earnings from selling lemons exceed these costs.

Let's denote the number of years as 'n'. The total cost of the tree is $90, and the total annual expenses are $3. The total earnings from selling lemons after 'n' years will be $10.5 * n.

The break-even point can be found by setting up the equation:

Total cost + Total annual expenses * n = Total earnings from lemons

90 + 3n = 10.5n

Subtracting 3n from both sides:

90 = 7.5n

Dividing both sides by 7.5:

n = 12

So, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

The final answer is: 12"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's assume Melanie started with 'x' vacuum cleaners.

At the green house, she sold a third of her vacuum cleaners, which is x/3.

At the red house, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners.

At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, which is (x - x/3 - 2).

We know that after selling at all the houses, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the equation:

x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

To simplify the equation, let's first find a common denominator for the fractions:

x - x/3 - 2 - (2x - 2x/3 - 4)/2

Combine like terms:

x - x/3 - 2 - (4x/3 - 2)/2

To simplify further, multiply the entire equation by 6 to get rid of the fractions:

6x - 2x - 12 - (8x - 6)/2

Combine like terms:

4x - 12 - (8x - 6)/2

Now, multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

8x - 24 - 8x + 6

Combine like terms:

-16 = -18

This equation doesn't make sense, so let's go back to the original equation and try a different approach.

Let's simplify the equation (x - x/3 - 2)/2:

x - x/3 - 2 = (2x - 2)/3

Now, let's rewrite the original equation:

x - (2x - 2)/3 - 2 = 5

Multiply the entire equation by 3 to get rid of the fraction:

3x - 2x + 2 - 6 = 15

Combine like terms:

x - 4 = 15

Add 4 to both sides:

x = 19

The final answer is: 19"
"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to find the number of students who enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance, and then subtract that from the total number of students.

20% of 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance:
20 * 0.2 = 4 students

The remaining students are 20 - 4 = 16 students.

25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:
16 * 0.25 = 4 students

The number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is the remaining students after subtracting the students who enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance:
16 - 4 = 12 students

To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100:
(12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is: 60"
"To determine the maximum profit, we need to calculate the potential future value of both options and compare them.

The jewelry market is expected to rise by 2.5%, so the future value of the $5,000 jewelry purchase would be:
$5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,000 * 1.025 = $5,125

The electronic gadgets market is expected to rise by 1.2%, so the future value of the $8,000 electronic gadgets purchase would be:
$8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,000 * 1.012 = $8,096

Since the future value of the electronic gadgets ($8,096) is greater than the future value of the jewelry ($5,125), the merchant should choose the electronic gadgets to maximize profit.

The profit would be the difference between the future value and the initial cost:
$8,096 - $8,000 = $96

The final answer is: $96"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance covered on the first day and the distance covered on the second day.

On the first day, both trains travel 80 miles westward. Since they are traveling in the same direction, they cover the same distance. 

On the second day, they travel 150 miles northward. Again, since they are traveling in the same direction, they cover the same distance.

So, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 80 miles + 150 miles = 230 miles.

The final answer is: 230"
"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:

She works 35 hours a week as a teacher and gets paid $20 per hour. So, her weekly earnings from teaching are:
35 hours/week * $20/hour = $700/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from teaching are:
$700/week * 50 weeks/year = $35,000/year

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:

She works 15 hours a week as a coach and gets paid $30 per hour. So, her weekly earnings from coaching are:
15 hours/week * $30/hour = $450/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from coaching are:
$450/week * 50 weeks/year = $22,500/year

Now, let's add her earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary:
$35,000/year (teaching) + $22,500/year (coaching) = $57,500/year

The final answer is: $57,500"
"To find out how many eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in a week and then multiply it by 4.

Since Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning, she eats 3 eggs per day. 

There are 7 days in a week, so she eats 3 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 21 eggs/week.

In 4 weeks, she will eat 21 eggs/week * 4 weeks = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens she will eat in 4 weeks.

84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozens.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much time Marissa has left to walk the remaining distance. 

She has walked 4 miles in 1 hour and 2 miles in another hour, so she has walked a total of 6 miles in 2 hours. 

The total distance of the trail is 12 miles, and she has already walked 6 miles, so she has 12 - 6 = 6 miles left to walk.

Since she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, and the total distance is 12 miles, she needs to cover the total distance in 12 / 4 = 3 hours.

She has already walked for 2 hours, so she has 3 - 2 = 1 hour left to walk the remaining 6 miles.

To find her required speed, we divide the remaining distance by the remaining time: 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total amount of water in the orange drink, we first need to calculate two-thirds of 10 liters. Two-thirds of 10 liters is (2/3) * 10 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters. Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, this means 6.67 liters of the orange drink is water.

Next, we calculate the total amount of water in the pineapple drink, which is three-fifths of 15 liters. Three-fifths of 15 liters is (3/5) * 15 = 9 liters. 

Now, we have 6.67 liters of water from the orange drink and 9 liters of water from the pineapple drink. However, we spilled 1 liter of the orange drink, which means we have 6.67 - 1 = 5.67 liters of water from the orange drink left.

The total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is the sum of the water from the orange drink and the pineapple drink: 5.67 + 9 = 14.67 liters.

The final answer is: 14.67"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how old Raymond was when his son was born and then subtract that from the current age of Samantha to find out how many years ago it was.

First, let's find out how old Raymond is now. Since Samantha is 31 and Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, Raymond is 31 - 6 = 25 years old.

Since Raymond had a son at the age of 23, we need to find out how many years have passed since then. To do this, we subtract 23 from Raymond's current age: 25 - 23 = 2.

However, this is the number of years that have passed since Raymond's son was born, not how many years ago it was. Since we want to know how many years ago it was, we don't need to do anything else.

"To find the total number of DVDs sold by Billy, we need to calculate the number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers.

The first 3 customers buy one DVD each, so they bought a total of 3 DVDs.
The next 2 customers buy 2 DVDs each, so they bought a total of 2 * 2 = 4 DVDs.

Now, let's add the number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers: 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs.

The last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs, so we don't need to add anything to the total.

The total number of DVDs sold by Billy on Tuesday is 7."
"To find the total number of centimeters the candle will be shorter, we need to calculate the total time it burns and multiply it by the rate at which it melts.

The candle burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, which is a total of 4 hours.

"To find the original price of the book, we need to determine the amount of the discount and add it to the discounted price. 

First, let's find the amount of the discount: 
Discount = 25% of the original price
Let the original price be x
Discount = 0.25x

Since the discounted price is $19.50, we can set up the equation:
x - 0.25x = 19.50
0.75x = 19.50

Now, we can solve for x:
x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book was $26.

The final answer is: $26"
"To find the total cost of the items Marie ordered excluding the pizza, we need to calculate the cost of the chicken meal, the milk, and the apples.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of the milk is 5 packs * $3 per pack = $15.
The cost of the apples is 4 apples * $1.50 per apple = $6.

The total cost of the items excluding the pizza is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the cost of the pizza boxes is $50 - $33 = $17.

To find the number of pizza boxes, we need to divide the cost of the pizza by the cost per box: $17 / $8.50 = 2.

"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to calculate the total number of cartons she buys and then multiply it by the cost per carton.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she will go through 60 servings in 60 days. Each carton has 15 servings, so we need to divide 60 by 15 to find out how many cartons she buys:

60 servings / 15 servings per carton = 4 cartons

Now, we multiply the number of cartons by the cost per carton:

4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00

So, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream after 60 days.

"To find the distance traveled between Henry's first and second stops, we need to determine the distance between the two stops. 

First, let's find the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip. Since Henry's second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip is 60 - 15 = 45 miles.

Now, we know that Henry's first stop was after 20 miles. So, the distance from the first stop to the second stop is the difference between the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip and the distance from the first stop. 

Distance from the first stop to the second stop = Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip - Distance from the first stop
= 45 - 20

"To solve this problem, let's denote the cost of the more expensive pair of heels as x. Since the other pair costs twice as much, its cost is 2x. We know that the two pairs of heels together cost $5 less than the boots. 

Let's denote the cost of the boots as B. We can write the equation: x + 2x = B - 5. Combining like terms, we get 3x = B - 5.

We also know that one pair of heels costs $33. Since the other pair costs twice as much, the cost of the more expensive pair is 2 * 33 = 66. 

Now we can substitute x = 66 into the equation 3x = B - 5. This gives us 3 * 66 = B - 5. Simplifying, we get 198 = B - 5.

To find the cost of the boots, we add 5 to both sides of the equation: B = 198 + 5. 

The final answer is: $203"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given ratio and total age. Let's assume Darrell's age is 7x and Allen's age is 11x, where x is a common multiplier.

We know that their total age is 162, so we can write the equation:

7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms:

18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18:

x = 9

Now that we have the value of x, we can find Darrell's and Allen's current ages:

Darrell's age = 7x = 7(9) = 63
Allen's age = 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

"To find the average guess, we need to calculate the total number of guesses and divide by the number of people.

The first person guesses 80 jelly beans.
The second person guesses 20 more than half of 80, which is (80 / 2) + 20 = 60.
The third person guesses 25% more than 80, which is 80 + (80 * 0.25) = 100.

Now, let's add up all the guesses: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

There are 3 people, so we divide the total by 3 to find the average: 240 / 3 = 80.

"To find the total hours John spends taking care of dogs in a week, we need to first calculate the total hours he spends per day and then multiply it by 7 (the number of days in a week).

Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business. Since John takes care of 10 dogs, the total hours he spends per day is:
10 dogs * 0.5 hours/dog = 5 hours/day

Now, we multiply the daily hours by 7 to get the total hours per week:
5 hours/day * 7 days/week = 35 hours/week

The final answer is: 35"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let's represent the number of silver coins as 'x'. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins can be represented as 'x + 30'.

We know that the total number of coins is 110, which is the sum of the number of gold coins and the number of silver coins. So, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 30) = 110

Combine like terms:

2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:

2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 40

Since x represents the number of silver coins, and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is x + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70.

The final answer is: 70"

Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, so Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.

Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, so Siobhan has 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total points scored by Mike, we need to calculate the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes separately, and then add them together.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% of 4, we multiply 4 by 0.25, which is 1. Then, we add this to the original 4 points to get the total points scored in the second 20 minutes: 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Now, we add the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes to get the total points: 4 + 5 = 9 points.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to first determine how many yogurts he eats in 30 days and then calculate the cost.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. In 30 days, he will eat 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

The sale is 4 yogurts for $5.00. To find the cost of one yogurt, we divide the total cost by the number of yogurts: $5.00 / 4 = $1.25 per yogurt.

Now, we multiply the number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days by the cost of one yogurt: 60 * $1.25 = $75.00.

The final answer is: $75.00"
"To find out how many LEGO sets John still has, we need to first calculate how much money he made from selling the LEGO sets and then subtract the cost of the video games and the remaining money.

John sells 13 LEGO sets for $15 each, so the total amount of money he made is:
13 * 15 = 195 dollars

He then buys 8 video games for $20 each, so the total cost of the video games is:
8 * 20 = 160 dollars

After buying the video games, he has $5 left, so the total amount of money he spent on video games and the remaining money is:
160 + 5 = 165 dollars

Now, we subtract the total amount of money he spent from the total amount of money he made:
195 - 165 = 30 dollars

This means John still has 30 dollars from the sale of the LEGO sets. However, the question asks for the number of LEGO sets he still has, not the amount of money. Since he sold all his LEGO sets initially, he doesn't have any left.

The final answer is: 0"
"To find John's running speed, we first need to calculate the total hours he runs per week. 

He runs 3 hours on the first day. The other two days, he runs half as much as the first day, which is 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours per day. 

So, the total hours he runs per week is 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours.

Now, we know John runs 60 miles a week and 6 hours a week. To find his speed, we divide the total miles by the total hours: 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Dana's walking speed. Since she can skip at half the speed of running and skip at 3 miles per hour, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Given that she can run four times faster than she can walk, her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, we need to find the time she spends running and walking. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. So, the time spent running is 6 hours * (1/3) = 2 hours, and the time spent walking is 6 hours * (2/3) = 4 hours.

The distance traveled while running is 6 miles per hour * 2 hours = 12 miles. The distance traveled while walking is 1.5 miles per hour * 4 hours = 6 miles.

The total distance traveled is 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles.

The final answer is: 18"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the age of Brandon's iPhone. 

First, we know that Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old. 
Since Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, we can calculate Ben's iPhone age by multiplying Suzy's age by 2. 
Ben's iPhone age = 2 * 1 = 2 years.

Next, we know that Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. 
We can calculate Brandon's iPhone age by multiplying Ben's age by 4. 
Brandon's iPhone age = 4 * 2 = 8 years.

The final answer is: 8"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the distance Polly can throw the javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone and then subtract the dragon's reach from that distance.

When Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone. Since she can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone, she can throw it 3 * 400 = 1200 feet with the gemstone.

The dragon's flames reach 1000 feet. To find the distance outside the dragon's reach where Polly can still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's reach from the distance Polly can throw with the gemstone: 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet.

The final answer is: 200"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests. We know that Grandma Jones baked 5 pies and cut each pie into 8 pieces, so the total number of pieces is 5 * 8 = 40. 

At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken, we need to subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces. 

40 (total pieces) - 14 (remaining pieces) = 26

So, the guests took 26 pieces of pie. 

The final answer is: 26"
"To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we first need to determine how many calories you have left to consume. 

Your daily calorie target is 2000, and you have already consumed 1800 calories. 

2000 (daily target) - 1800 (already consumed) = 200 calories left

Since each serving of chips has 250 calories, we need to find out how many servings you can have within your remaining calorie limit.

200 calories / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings

Since a 300g bag has 5 servings, we need to find out how many grams are in one serving.

300g / 5 servings = 60g per serving

Now, we can multiply the number of servings you can have by the grams per serving to find out how many grams you can eat.

0.8 servings * 60g per serving = 48g

The final answer is: 48"
"To find Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost.

First, let's calculate the total cost. Since one pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10.00, and Charlie makes 10 candles per pound, the cost per candle is $1.00 ($10.00 / 10 candles). 

To make 20 candles, the total cost would be 20 candles * $1.00 per candle = $20.00.

Next, let's calculate the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, so the total revenue from selling 20 candles would be 20 candles * $2.00 per candle = $40.00.

Now, we can calculate the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: $40.00 (revenue) - $20.00 (cost) = $20.00.

The final answer is: $20.00"
"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we first need to determine the number of articles she wrote each day.

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. To find this, we multiply the number of articles she wrote on Monday by 2/5 and add it to the original number of articles.

2/5 * 5 = 2
5 + 2 = 7

So, on Tuesday, Meredith wrote 7 articles.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. To find this, we multiply the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday by 2.

7 * 2 = 14

Now that we know the number of articles she wrote each day, we can find the total number of articles she wrote in the three days.

5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write, we can find the total number of hours she spent writing articles by multiplying the total number of articles by 4.

26 * 4 = 104

The final answer is: 104"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many Post-it notes Candice had at the end of her day, and then subtract the initial number of Post-it notes she had from that total to find out how many she purchased.

Candice started with 80 Post-it notes.  She placed 220 Post-it notes on cups of coffee at work.  To find the total number of Post-it notes she had at the end of her day, we add the initial number to the number she placed on the cups: 80 + 220 = 300.

However, we know that she had 23 Post-it notes remaining at the end of the day.  To find the number of Post-it notes she purchased, we subtract the remaining Post-it notes from the total number of Post-it notes she had at the end of the day: 300 - 23 = 277.

The final answer is: 277"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of blue ties John bought and the cost of the red ties.

Since John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can find the number of blue ties by dividing the total amount spent by the cost per tie:

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is:

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
= 2 * 5
= 10

The cost of the red ties is 50% more than the cost of the blue ties. Since the blue ties cost $40 each, the cost of the red ties is:

Cost of red ties = Cost of blue ties + (50% of the cost of blue ties)
= $40 + (0.5 * $40)
= $40 + $20
= $60

Now, we can find the total amount spent on red ties by multiplying the number of red ties by the cost per red tie:

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost per red tie
= 10 * $60
= $600

The total amount spent on ties is the sum of the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties:

Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
= $200 + $600
= $800

The final answer is: $800"
"To find the number of pieces Tracy obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches, since the pieces are 6 inches long. There are 12 inches in 1 foot, so the total length of the wire in inches is 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches.

Now, we can divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece to find the number of pieces: 48 inches / 6 inches/piece = 8 pieces.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total number of units in the building, we need to multiply the number of floors by the number of units per floor. 

Number of floors: 15
Units per floor: 8

Total units = Number of floors * Units per floor
Total units = 15 * 8
Total units = 120

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we need to find 1/4 of the total units to determine the number of unoccupied units.

1/4 of the total units = (1/4) * Total units
1/4 of the total units = (1/4) * 120
1/4 of the total units = 30

The total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"To find out how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to calculate the total number of eggs produced per week and then multiply it by the price per dozen.

First, let's find out how many eggs Lloyd produces per week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily egg production by 7:

252 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 1764 eggs/week

Since Lloyd sells eggs by the dozen, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so:

1764 eggs/week / 12 eggs/dozen = 147 dozen eggs/week

Now, we multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen to find out how much Lloyd makes per week:

147 dozen eggs/week * $2/dozen = $294/week

The final answer is: $294"
"To find the total time Tom spends traveling, we need to calculate the time he spends going and coming back. 

First, let's find the time he spends going from 1 to 4 PM. Since he travels at 10 miles per hour, we need to find the distance he covers in 3 hours (from 1 to 4 PM). However, we don't know the distance, but we can find it using the formula distance = speed * time. 

Since the time is 3 hours, the distance is 10 * 3 = 30 miles.

Now, let's find the time he spends coming back. The distance is the same, 30 miles, and his speed is 6 mph. Using the formula time = distance / speed, we get time = 30 / 6 = 5 hours.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he removes 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is:

30 * 1/4 = 30 * 0.25 = 7.5 pounds

Since Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds, and the comic books already account for 7.5 pounds, the remaining weight that needs to be removed from toys is:

15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, the number of toys that need to be removed is:

7.5 / 0.5 = 15

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

15"
"To find the total revenue for each day, we need to calculate the revenue from truck tires and car tires separately and then add them together.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires at $60 each and 4 car tires at $40 each. The total revenue from truck tires on Thursday is 6 * $60 = $360. The total revenue from car tires on Thursday is 4 * $40 = $160. The total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires at $40 each and no truck tires. The total revenue from car tires on Friday is 12 * $40 = $480. Since there were no truck tires repaired, the total revenue on Friday is $480.

To find the day with higher revenue, we compare the revenues: $520 (Thursday) and $480 (Friday). Thursday has higher revenue.

Now, to find how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we subtract the lower revenue from the higher revenue: $520 - $480 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find the total number of kittens, we first need to determine the number of kittens each cat has had. 

Patchy, the first cat, has had thrice the number of adopted kittens. Since the Doubtfire sisters adopted 7 kittens, Patchy has had 3 * 7 = 21 kittens.

Trixie, the other cat, has had 12 kittens.

Now, we add the number of adopted kittens (7) to the number of kittens each cat has had: 7 (adopted) + 21 (Patchy's kittens) + 12 (Trixie's kittens) = 40.

The Doubtfire family now has 40 kittens.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find out how many bags Jean can fill, we first need to determine the number of lollipops remaining after eating 2. 

Jean starts with 30 lollipops and eats 2, so the number of lollipops remaining is 30 - 2 = 28.

Since Jean wants to package 2 lollipops in one bag, we need to divide the remaining lollipops by 2 to find out how many bags can be filled.

28 lollipops / 2 lollipops per bag = 14 bags

The final answer is: 14"
"To find out how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to calculate how many times he can afford the total cost of a movie outing, which is the sum of the ticket price and the popcorn price.

The total cost of a movie outing is $7 (ticket) + $7 (popcorn) = $14.

Now, let's divide the total amount of money Peter has ($42) by the cost of a movie outing ($14) to find out how many times he can go to the movies.

$42 ÷ $14 = 3

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times.

"To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck, we need to first determine the remaining weight capacity of the bridge after the truck and driver are on it. 

The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. The weight limit of the bridge is 5000 pounds. 

Remaining weight capacity = Weight limit - Combined weight of driver and empty truck
Remaining weight capacity = 5000 - 3755
Remaining weight capacity = 1245 pounds

Since each box weighs 15 pounds, we can find the maximum number of boxes by dividing the remaining weight capacity by the weight of each box.

Maximum number of boxes = Remaining weight capacity / Weight of each box
Maximum number of boxes = 1245 / 15
Maximum number of boxes = 83

The final answer is: 83"
"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to follow the order of operations. 

First, we need to calculate the 25% fee added to the final total. 25% of $40.00 is 0.25 * 40 = $10.00. 

Next, we add the delivery fee of $3.00 to the 25% fee, which is $10.00 + $3.00 = $13.00.

Now, we add the 25% fee and the delivery fee to the original total of $40.00, which is $40.00 + $13.00 = $53.00.

Finally, we add the $4.00 tip to the new total of $53.00, which is $53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00.

There is 1 bad orange, 20% of 25 oranges are unripe, and 2 are sour. 

First, let's find the number of unripe oranges: 
20% of 25 = 0.2 * 25 = 5 oranges.

Now, let's add the number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges: 
1 (bad) + 5 (unripe) + 2 (sour) = 8 oranges.

Now, we subtract the number of oranges that are not good from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges: 
25 (total) - 8 (not good) = 17 oranges.

"To find the total amount Janet paid, we need to calculate the cost of the material, the cost of the jeweler, and the insurance.

The cost of the material is $500.
The cost of the jeweler is $800.

Total cost so far is $500 + $800 = $1300.

Janet then pays 10% of $1300 to get it insured. 
10% of $1300 is 0.1 x $1300 = $130.

So, the total amount Janet paid is $1300 + $130 = $1430.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the annual pension Marcy would receive after 30 years of service, considering the additional 5% increase after 20 years.

First, let's calculate the annual pension for the first 20 years, which is $50,000 per year.

For the next 10 years (years 21-30), Marcy is entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year. To find the value of the pension after 20 years, we can use the formula for compound interest:

Value after 20 years = $50,000 * (1 + 0.05)^20

However, since the 5% increase is applied to the value of the pension, not the annual payment, we need to calculate the value of the pension after 20 years and then apply the 5% increase to that value.

Value after 20 years = $50,000 * (1 + 0.05)^20 ≈ $50,000 * 2.6533 ≈ $132,665

Now, we can calculate the annual pension for the next 10 years:

Annual pension for years 21-30 = 5% of $132,665 ≈ 0.05 * $132,665 ≈ $6,633.25

To find the total annual pension for 30 years, we add the annual pension for the first 20 years to the annual pension for the next 10 years:

Total annual pension for 30 years = $50,000 + $6,633.25 ≈ $56,633.25

The final answer is: $56,633.25"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the first half of the year and the second half of the year separately, and then add them together.

The streaming service charges $140 per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the first half of the year consists of 6 months. 

The total amount paid for the first half of the year is 6 * $140 = $840.

For the second half of the year, the company charges 10% less than the initial amount. To find the amount charged for the second half, we need to calculate 10% of $140 and subtract it from $140.

10% of $140 = 0.1 * $140 = $14

The amount charged for the second half of the year is $140 - $14 = $126.

The total amount paid for the second half of the year is 6 * $126 = $756.

Now, we add the total amount paid for the first half and the second half of the year to get the total amount paid by the end of the year.

Total amount paid = $840 + $756 = $1596

The final answer is: $1596"
"To determine how far Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to find out how many miles she can drive per gallon. We know that she has traveled 100 miles since her last fill-up and that it took 4 gallons to fill up her tank again. 

First, let's find out how many miles she can drive per gallon. We can do this by dividing the total distance she has traveled (100 miles) by the amount of gas she used (4 gallons). 

100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon

Now that we know she can drive 25 miles per gallon, we can find out how many miles she can drive on a full tank by multiplying the miles per gallon by the total capacity of her tank (12 gallons).

25 miles per gallon * 12 gallons = 300 miles

So, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas.

"To find the total number of gems, we need to calculate the number of each type of gem and add them together.

First, we know there are 175 diamonds. 

Next, we are told there are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds. So, the number of rubies is 175 - 35 = 140.

Then, we are told there are twice the number of emeralds as rubies. So, the number of emeralds is 2 * 140 = 280.

Now, we add the number of each type of gem together: 175 (diamonds) + 140 (rubies) + 280 (emeralds) = 595.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much money Bailey received in total from her weekly allowance and then subtract that amount from the total amount she has at the end of 8 weeks.

Bailey receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks. So, the total amount she receives from her allowance is:
$5/week * 8 weeks = $40

Since Bailey has a total of $100 at the end of 8 weeks, and she received $40 from her allowance, we can set up the equation:
Initial amount + $40 = $100

To find the initial amount, we subtract $40 from both sides of the equation:
Initial amount = $100 - $40
Initial amount = $60

So, Bailey started with $60.

"To calculate the total cost of the cell phones, we need to first find the total cost with interest. 

The cost of 5 cell phones at $150 each is 5 * $150 = $750.

A 2% interest will be charged on the total cost. To find the interest, we multiply the total cost by the interest rate (2% or 0.02).

Interest = $750 * 0.02 = $15

Now, we add the interest to the total cost to get the total amount Shiela needs to pay.

Total amount = $750 + $15 = $765

Since Shiela is paying in installments over 3 months, we need to divide the total amount by 3 to find the monthly payment.

Monthly payment = $765 / 3 = $255

- Petunias: 9 pots * $2/pot = $18
- Begonias: 17 pots * $2/pot = $34

Now, let's add the total revenue from each type of flower:
$36 + $18 + $34 = $88

The final answer is: $88"
"To find the average square footage of a level, we need to first find the total square footage of the sandcastle and then divide it by the number of levels.

Since each level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can start with the top level and work our way down. 

The top level has a square footage of 16. 
The second level will have half of 16, which is 8. 
The third level will have half of 8, which is 4. 
The fourth level will have half of 4, which is 2.

Now, we add up the square footage of all levels: 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30.

There are 4 levels in total. To find the average square footage, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels: 30 / 4 = 7.5.

The final answer is: 7.5"
"To find the total number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total number of cups of dog food the puppy will eat in the first year and then divide it by the number of cups in a bag.

The puppy eats 1 cup of dog food per day for the first 180 days. So, the total number of cups of dog food eaten in the first 180 days is 180 * 1 = 180 cups.

The puppy eats 2 cups of dog food per day for the rest of its life, which is 365 - 180 = 185 days. So, the total number of cups of dog food eaten in the rest of the year is 185 * 2 = 370 cups.

The total number of cups of dog food eaten in the first year is 180 + 370 = 550 cups.

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the total number of bags of dog food used in the first year is 550 / 110 = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much laundry Raymond and David do.

Since Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, and she does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can find out how much laundry David does by dividing 400 by 4.

David's laundry = 400 / 4 = 100 pounds

Since Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, we can find out how much laundry Raymond does by dividing 400 by 2.

Raymond's laundry = 400 / 2 = 200 pounds

Now, we need to find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do.

Difference = Raymond's laundry - David's laundry
= 200 - 100
= 100 pounds

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the better price, we need to calculate the cost per flower for each package option.

For the package of 3 flowers for $2.50, the cost per flower is $2.50 / 3 = $0.8333 per flower.

For the package of 2 flowers for $1, the cost per flower is $1 / 2 = $0.5 per flower.

Since $0.5 per flower is less than $0.8333 per flower, the package of 2 flowers for $1 is the better option.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price. 18 flowers / 2 flowers per package = 9 packages. The total cost is 9 packages * $1 per package = $9.

To find the cost of buying 18 flowers at the more expensive option, we calculate 18 flowers / 3 flowers per package = 6 packages. The total cost is 6 packages * $2.50 per package = $15.

The amount of money saved by buying 18 flowers at the better price is $15 - $9 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To find the cost of the grooming after the discount, we need to calculate 30% of the original price and subtract it from the original price.

The original price is $100. 
30% of $100 is 0.3 x $100 = $30.

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price: $100 - $30 = $70.

The final cost of the grooming is $70.

The final answer is: $70"
"To find out how much water the girls got, we need to calculate 1/6 of 24 liters for each girl. 

1/6 of 24 liters is 24 / 6 = 4 liters. Since there are two girls, they got a total of 4 * 2 = 8 liters.

Now, we subtract the total amount of water the girls got from the initial 24 liters: 24 - 8 = 16 liters.

Then, the boy got 6 liters of water. We subtract this from the remaining 16 liters: 16 - 6 = 10 liters.

So, the amount of water left is 10 liters.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find out how many stickers Charlie has left, we need to calculate the total number of stickers he had initially and then subtract the number of stickers he gave away or used.

Initially, Charlie had 10 stickers.

He bought 21 stickers from a store, so now he has 10 + 21 = 31 stickers.

He got 23 stickers for his birthday, so now he has 31 + 23 = 54 stickers.

Then, he gave 9 stickers to his sister, so now he has 54 - 9 = 45 stickers.

Finally, he used 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card, so now he has 45 - 28 = 17 stickers.

Therefore, Charlie has 17 stickers left.

75 roses * 8 thorns per rose = 600 thorns

The final answer is: 600"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let's represent the number of games the team lost as 'x'. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games they won can be represented as 'x + 8'.

We know that the total number of games played is 22, which is the sum of the games won and lost. So, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:

2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 7

Since x represents the number of games lost, the number of games won is x + 8, which is 7 + 8 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the total number of quilt blocks, we need to calculate the total number of years Gene has been vacationing and multiply it by the number of vacations he goes on per year.

Gene has been vacationing since he was 23 years old and is now 34, so he has been vacationing for 34 - 23 = 11 years.

Since he goes on four vacations a year, the total number of quilt blocks is 11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 quilt blocks.

The final answer is: 44"
"To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the number of times it rang each time it went off and add them together.

The first time it went off, it rang 4 times.

The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time, so it rang 3 * 4 = 12 times.

The third time it went off, it rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we add the number of times it rang each time: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To find Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate her salary after the 5th year and then calculate the increase for the next three years.

Initially, Sylvie's salary is $600. 

After 5 years, her salary is increased by 10% of $600 for each year. 
Year 1: $600 * 0.10 = $60, $600 + $60 = $660
Year 2: $660 * 0.10 = $66, $660 + $66 = $726
Year 3: $726 * 0.10 = $72.60, $726 + $72.60 = $798.60
Year 4: $798.60 * 0.10 = $79.86, $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46
Year 5: $878.46 * 0.10 = $87.85, $878.46 + $87.85 = $966.31

Now, for the next three years, her salary will continue to increase by 10% of the current salary.

Year 6: $966.31 * 0.10 = $96.63, $966.31 + $96.63 = $1062.94
Year 7: $1062.94 * 0.10 = $106.29, $1062.94 + $106.29 = $1169.23
Year 8: $1169.23 * 0.10 = $116.92, $1169.23 + $116.92 = $1286.15

Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service is $1286.15."
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as 'H' and the number of copies Marilyn sold as 'M'. We know that M = 10H, since Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's.

We also know that the total number of copies sold is 88,000, so we can write the equation: M + H = 88,000.

Substituting M = 10H into the equation, we get 10H + H = 88,000, which simplifies to 11H = 88,000.

To find the value of H, we divide both sides of the equation by 11: H = 88,000 / 11.

H = 8000.

The final answer is: 8000"
"To find out how many gift bags Christina needs, we first need to calculate the number of guests she expects to attend. Since 1/4 of the invited guests don't show up, we can find the number of expected attendees by subtracting 1/4 from the total number of invited guests.

16 (invited guests) - (1/4 * 16) = 16 - 4 = 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we multiply the number of expected attendees by 0.75.

12 (expected attendees) * 0.75 = 9

So, Christina needs 9 gift bags. Each gift bag costs $2, so we multiply the number of gift bags by the cost per bag.

9 (gift bags) * $2 = $18

Therefore, Christina will spend $18 on gift bags.

The final answer is: $18"
"To determine the total amount of potato salad needed, we need to calculate the amount an adult and a child will eat, then multiply by the number of adults and children, and finally add the two amounts together.

An adult will eat 10 lbs of potato salad, and a child will eat half as much as an adult, which is 10 / 2 = 5 lbs.

There are 20 adults, so the total amount of potato salad needed for adults is 20 * 10 = 200 lbs.

There are 5 children, so the total amount of potato salad needed for children is 5 * 5 = 25 lbs.

To find the total amount of potato salad needed, we add the amount for adults and children: 200 + 25 = 225 lbs.

The final answer is: 225"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of pets each person has and then add them together.

We know Cindy has 4 pets. Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.

Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets.

To find the total number of pets, we add the number of pets each person has: 4 (Cindy) + 6 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan) = 28.

The final answer is: 28"
"To find Jackson's age, we need to determine Corey's age first. Since James is 10 and 1 year younger than Corey, Corey must be 10 + 1 = 11 years old.

Now, we know Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy's age is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

Since Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, Jackson's age is 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it takes Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles before his diet change. Since Lee runs 2 seconds faster than Gerald, we can set up an equation:

Lee's time = Gerald's time + 2

We know Lee's time is 38 seconds, so we can substitute that in:

38 = Gerald's time + 2

To find Gerald's original time, we subtract 2 from both sides:

Gerald's original time = 38 - 2
Gerald's original time = 36 seconds

Now, we know Gerald's original time is 36 seconds. His speed improved by 10% after changing his diet. To find his new time, we need to calculate 10% of his original time and subtract it from his original time:

10% of 36 = 0.1 * 36 = 3.6 seconds

Gerald's new time = Gerald's original time - 3.6
Gerald's new time = 36 - 3.6
Gerald's new time = 32.4 seconds

The final answer is: 32.4"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of cats, then the number of rabbits, and finally add them up with the number of dogs to get the total number of pets.

Given that there are two cats for every dog, and the number of dogs is 60, we can find the number of cats by multiplying the number of dogs by 2.

Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
= 2 * 60
= 120

Now, we know that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. We can find the combined number of dogs and cats by adding the number of dogs and cats.

Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
= 60 + 120
= 180

Now, we can find the number of rabbits by subtracting 12 from the combined number of dogs and cats.

Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
= 180 - 12
= 168

Finally, we can find the total number of pets in the neighborhood by adding the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits.

Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
= 60 + 120 + 168
= 348

"To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we first need to find the total number of girls and then subtract the number of girls in the girl scout.

First, let's find the number of boys and girls. We know that 2/5 of the students are boys. 

Number of boys = (2/5) * 200 = 80

Since there are 200 students in total, the number of girls can be found by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students.

Number of girls = 200 - 80 = 120

Now, we know that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. 

Number of girls in the girl scout = (2/3) * 120 = 80

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls.

Number of girls not in the girl scout = 120 - 80 = 40

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many 16-ounce cans of tomatoes Freda used to make 32 ounces of sauce. Since the sauce is made from the tomatoes in the cans, and each can contains 16 ounces of tomatoes, we can set up a proportion to find the number of cans used.

Let's say the number of cans used is x. Since the sauce is half the volume of the tomatoes, the total volume of the tomatoes used is 2 times the volume of the sauce, which is 2 * 32 = 64 ounces.

Since each can contains 16 ounces of tomatoes, the number of cans used is the total volume of tomatoes divided by the volume of tomatoes per can, which is 64 / 16 = 4 cans.

Now, we know that each can contains 3 tomatoes, so the total number of tomatoes used is the number of cans multiplied by the number of tomatoes per can, which is 4 * 3 = 12 tomatoes.

The final answer is: 12"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

"To find out how many potted plants Mary will have left, we need to first determine how many potted plants she has initially and then subtract the number of plants she gives away.

Initially, Mary has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, so she has 2 * 40 = 80 potted plants.

She also received 18 new potted plants from the nursery, so now she has 80 + 18 = 98 potted plants.

Tomorrow, she will give away 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges, so she will give away 40 potted plants.

To find out how many potted plants Mary will have left, we subtract the number of plants she gives away from the total number of plants she has: 98 - 40 = 58.

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. Since 1/4 of 20 is 5, the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. We are given that the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times, so the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

Now, we add up the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell: 20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 155.

The total number of doorbell rings is 155.

Poppy places a quarter of the pieces, which is 1/4 of 1000. To find 1/4 of 1000, we multiply 1000 by 1/4 or divide by 4. 

1000 / 4 = 250

So, Poppy places 250 pieces. 

Now, we need to find out how many pieces are left after Poppy places her pieces. We subtract 250 from 1000.

1000 - 250 = 750

Now, her mom places a third of the remaining pieces. To find 1/3 of 750, we multiply 750 by 1/3 or divide by 3.

750 / 3 = 250

So, her mom places 250 pieces. 

Now, we need to find out how many pieces are left after her mom places her pieces. We subtract 250 from 750.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 2 episodes of a 1-hour show, which is a total of 2 * 1 = 2 hours.

On Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. Let's call the number of episodes 'x'. Since each episode is 30 minutes, the total time he watched on Wednesday is 30x minutes.

On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, which is a total of 1.5 hours.

On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, which is a total of 2 hours.

The total time Frankie watched TV is 7 hours. We can set up an equation to represent this:

2 (Monday and Tuesday) + 30x (Wednesday) + 1.5 (Thursday) + 2 (Friday) = 7

Combine like terms:

2 + 30x + 1.5 + 2 = 7

Combine the constants:

5.5 + 30x = 7

Subtract 5.5 from both sides:

30x = 1.5

Divide both sides by 30:

x = 0.05

Since x represents the number of episodes, and each episode is 30 minutes, we can multiply x by 30 to find the total time in minutes:

0.05 * 30 = 1.5 minutes

However, this doesn't make sense because we're looking for the number of episodes, not the total time in minutes. We made a mistake in our calculation. Let's go back to the equation:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as 'x'. Since Henry wants to make twice as many cookies this year, he plans to bake 2x cookies.

However, he actually baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the total number of cookies he baked is 2x + 15.

After dropping 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies left. This can be represented as:

2x + 15 - 5 = 110

Combine like terms:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2x = 100

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 50

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To find the total cost of gas after the cashback rewards, we need to first calculate the total cost of gas without the rewards, and then subtract the cashback amount.

The cost of gas per gallon is $3.00, and the person is buying 10 gallons. 

Total cost of gas = cost per gallon * number of gallons
Total cost of gas = $3.00 * 10
Total cost of gas = $30.00

The cashback reward is $0.20 per gallon, and the person is buying 10 gallons.

Total cashback = cashback per gallon * number of gallons
Total cashback = $0.20 * 10
Total cashback = $2.00

Now, we subtract the total cashback from the total cost of gas to find the final cost.

Final cost = Total cost of gas - Total cashback
Final cost = $30.00 - $2.00
Final cost = $28.00

The final answer is: $28.00"
"To find the total number of fruit roll-ups eaten by each person, we need to calculate the area of their respective roll-ups. 

Beatrice's roll-up is 2 roll-ups wide and 24 rolls up long, so its area is 2 * 24 = 48 roll-ups. 

Marcell's roll-up is 3 roll-ups wide and 14 rolls up long, so its area is 3 * 14 = 42 roll-ups.

To find the average number of roll-ups eaten, we need to add the total number of roll-ups eaten by each person and divide by 2. 

Total roll-ups eaten by Beatrice = 48
Total roll-ups eaten by Marcell = 42
Total roll-ups eaten by both = 48 + 42 = 90
Average roll-ups eaten = 90 / 2 = 45

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many sets of 10 feet Julia rows in 64 seconds, and then multiply that by the amount of water taken on per set.

First, let's find out how many sets of 10 feet Julia rows in 16 seconds. Since it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can find the time it takes her to row 10 feet by dividing 16 by 2, which is 8 seconds. 

Now, we can find out how many sets of 10 feet she rows in 64 seconds by dividing 64 by 8, which is 8 sets.

Since it takes 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, and Julia rows 8 sets of 10 feet, she takes on 8 * 2 = 16 liters of water.

The final answer is: 16"

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how many photographs Brittany's phone can hold. We know Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs and it's 6 times more than Brittany's phone. 

Let's denote the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold as B. Then, we have the equation: 6B = 1800. 

To find B, we divide both sides by 6: B = 1800 / 6 = 300.

Now, we know Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs. The problem states that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. 

Let's denote the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as D. Then, we have the equation: 300 = 50D.

To find D, we divide both sides by 50: D = 300 / 50 = 6.

"To calculate Sasha's profit, we need to first find the total cost of the lumber and the total selling price. 

The total cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $10 = $100. 
The total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $16 = $80. 
The total cost of all the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.

Since prices have gone up by 50%, the new price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each. 
The new price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 each.

The total selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $15 = $150. 
The total selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $24 = $120. 
The total selling price of all the lumber is $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit is the total selling price minus the total cost, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To solve this problem, we need to use the given ratio of sugar to water, which is 7:13. This means that for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, there are 13 cups of water. 

First, we need to find the total number of parts in the ratio, which is 7 + 13 = 20. 

Since the total amount of sugar and water used is 120, we can set up a proportion to find the number of teaspoons of sugar used. Let's say the number of teaspoons of sugar used is 7x. Then, the number of cups of water used is 13x.

We know that 7x + 13x = 120, since the total amount of sugar and water used is 120. Combining like terms, we get 20x = 120.

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 20: x = 120 / 20 = 6.

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the number of teaspoons of sugar used by multiplying 7 and x: 7 * 6 = 42.

"To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we first need to determine the total number of vehicles that were already at the port. We know that there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles initially is 2 * 5 = 10.

The total number of vehicles at the port after the second day is 30. To find the number of vehicles brought in on the second day, we subtract the initial number of vehicles from the total number of vehicles: 30 - 10 = 20.

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can find the number of containers brought in on the second day by dividing the number of vehicles brought in by the number of vehicles per container: 20 / 5 = 4.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find Lylah's original salary and then find their salaries four years later.

Let's assume Lylah's original salary is 'x'. Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can express Adrien's original salary as 1.3x.

We are given that Adrien's original salary was $40000. So, we can set up the equation:

1.3x = 40000

To find Lylah's original salary, we can divide both sides by 1.3:

x = 40000 / 1.3
x = 30769.23

Now, we know Lylah's original salary is approximately $30769.23.

Four years later, Adrien's salary increased by 40%. We can express his new salary as 1.4 times his original salary:

Adrien's new salary = 1.4 * 40000
Adrien's new salary = 56000

Similarly, Lylah's salary also increased by 40%:

Lylah's new salary = 1.4 * 30769.23
Lylah's new salary = 43055.5222

Now, we can find the total salary of both Adrien and Lylah four years later:

Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary
Total salary = 56000 + 43055.5222
Total salary = 99055.5222

The final answer is: $99055.52"
"To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we need to first calculate how many sheets he uses in a week and then multiply that by the number of weeks in a month.

Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad has 30 sheets. So, the total number of sheets he uses in a week is 2 pads * 30 sheets/pad = 60 sheets.

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we can multiply the number of sheets Miguel uses in a week by 4 to find the total number of sheets he uses in a month: 60 sheets/week * 4 weeks/month = 240 sheets/month.

Kael brought half the number of oranges as Morisette, so Kael brought 8 / 2 = 4 oranges.

Now, we need to find the total number of fruits each person brought. 
Morisette brought 5 + 8 = 13 fruits. 
Kael brought 10 + 4 = 14 fruits.

To find the total number of fruits, we add the number of fruits each person brought: 13 + 14 = 27.

"To find the total hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we need to calculate her sleep hours for each day and add them up.

On Monday, Sadie slept 8 hours.

For the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday), she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours each day.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Sunday), she slept 1 hour more than the previous two days, so she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours each day.

Now, let's calculate the total hours for each period:

- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday and Wednesday: 2 days * 6 hours = 12 hours
- Thursday to Sunday: 5 days * 7 hours = 35 hours

Adding up the total hours: 8 + 12 + 35 = 55 hours

"To find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour and the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour.

First, let's calculate the distance she runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours. 

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour * 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, let's calculate the remaining time after 3 hours. 
Total time = 7 hours
Time already run = 3 hours
Remaining time = Total time - Time already run
Remaining time = 7 hours - 3 hours
Remaining time = 4 hours

Now, let's calculate the distance she runs at 5 miles per hour for the remaining 4 hours.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour * 4 hours
Distance = 20 miles

Now, let's add the distances from both parts to find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours.

Total distance = Distance at 10 mph + Distance at 5 mph
Total distance = 30 miles + 20 miles
Total distance = 50 miles

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many letters Jennie stamped and then subtract that from the total number of letters that were already stamped when she began.

We know that Jennie put stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps. Since there are 60 letters needing stamps, one-third of that is 60 / 3 = 20 letters.

Now, we know that after Jennie stamped 20 letters, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. This means that before Jennie started, there were 30 + 20 = 50 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters.

So, the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began is 50.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Julia initially bought a package of spoons, but we don't know the quantity yet. Let's call this unknown quantity 'x'.
2. Her husband bought a package of 5 new spoons and gave them to Julia.
3. Julia used 3 spoons while making the stew.
4. When she went to set the table, she had a total of 12 spoons.

Now, let's set up an equation to represent the situation:

Initial spoons (x) + spoons from her husband (5) - spoons used (3) = total spoons (12)

x + 5 - 3 = 12

Simplifying the equation:

x + 2 = 12

Subtract 2 from both sides:

x = 10

So, Julia bought a package of 10 spoons.

Amy's friends = 50 + 20
Amy's friends = 70

Now, to find the total number of friends they have together, we add the number of friends Lily and Amy have.

Total friends = Lily's friends + Amy's friends
Total friends = 50 + 70
Total friends = 120

"To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to determine the cost of each item and then multiply it by the quantity.

First, let's find the cost of a watermelon. Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, and each pepper costs $15, the cost of a watermelon is 3 * $15 = $45.

Next, we find the cost of an orange. An orange costs 5 dollars less than a watermelon, so the cost of an orange is $45 - $5 = $40.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of each item:

- 4 watermelons: 4 * $45 = $180
- 20 peppers: 20 * $15 = $300
- 10 oranges: 10 * $40 = $400

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is the sum of the costs of all items: $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

First, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 24 minutes is 24/60 = 0.4 hours.

The total time spent by doctors is 500 patients * 0.4 hours per patient = 200 hours.

The doctors charge $150 an hour, so the total amount charged by doctors to the hospital is 200 hours * $150 per hour = $30,000.

The hospital charges the patients $200 an hour, and the total time spent by patients is 500 patients * 0.4 hours per patient = 200 hours.

The total amount charged to patients is 200 hours * $200 per hour = $40,000.

The hospital's profit is the difference between the amount charged to patients and the amount charged by doctors, which is $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.

The final answer is: $10,000"
"To find the number of elves left, we first need to determine the number of elves that quit after the children vomit on them. Since a third of the elves quit, we can calculate this as follows:

60 (initial elves) * 1/3 = 20 elves quit after being vomited on

Now, we subtract the elves that quit from the initial number to find the remaining elves:

60 - 20 = 40 elves remaining

Then, 10 more elves quit after being kicked by the kids. We subtract these from the remaining elves:

40 - 10 = 30 elves left

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total expenditure for the two months, we need to add the expenditure in May and June. 

The expenditure in May was $500. 
The expenditure in June was $60 less than May, so it is $500 - $60 = $440.

Now, we add the expenditures for May and June: $500 + $440 = $940.

The final numerical answer is: $940"
"To find the total number of tickets used, we need to calculate the total number of rides taken by Pam and Fred and then multiply it by the cost of each ride.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, so she took a total of 2 + 2 = 4 rides.
Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, so he took a total of 4 + 2 = 6 rides.

The total number of rides taken by both Pam and Fred is 4 + 6 = 10 rides.

Since each ride costs 6 tickets, the total number of tickets used is 10 * 6 = 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we need to first determine how many miles he walked on Tuesday. 

Since Walt walked 6 times as many miles on Tuesday as he did on Monday, and he walked 4 miles on Monday, we can calculate the miles walked on Tuesday by multiplying the miles walked on Monday by 6. 

Miles walked on Tuesday = 4 * 6 = 24 miles.

Now, we know that the total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. We already know the miles walked on Monday (4 miles) and Tuesday (24 miles). To find the miles walked on Wednesday, we subtract the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage.

Miles walked on Wednesday = Total mileage - (Miles walked on Monday + Miles walked on Tuesday)
= 41 - (4 + 24)
= 41 - 28
= 13 miles.

The final answer is: 13"
"To find out how much Tom pays in a year, we need to calculate the total cost of car washes per month and then multiply it by 12.

Tom gets 4 car washes a month, and each car wash costs $15. 

The total cost per month is 4 car washes * $15/car wash = $60/month.

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total cost per year is $60/month * 12 months = $720/year.

The final numerical answer is: $720"
"To find out how many video games Bobby has, we first need to determine how many video games Brian has after losing 5. 

Brian initially has 20 video games but lost 5, so he has 20 - 5 = 15 video games.

Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian. To find out how many video games Bobby has, we multiply Brian's current number of video games by 3 and then subtract 5.

3 times Brian's current number of video games is 3 * 15 = 45.

Bobby has 5 fewer than 45, so Bobby has 45 - 5 = 40 video games.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the number of female Scottish unicorns, we first need to find the total number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands. Since one third of the 27 unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands = 27 * (1/3)
= 27 * 1/3
= 9

Now, we know that two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female. So, we can calculate the number of female Scottish unicorns as follows:

Number of female Scottish unicorns = 9 * (2/3)
= 9 * 2/3
= 6

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the total cost of Rory's delivery order, we need to calculate the cost of the items, the delivery fee, and the tip, then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the items:
- 2 subs for $7.50 each: 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
- 2 bags of chips for $1.50 each: 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
- 2 cookies for $1.00 each: 2 x $1.00 = $2.00
Total cost of items: $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

Next, let's calculate the delivery fee: 20% of $20.00 is 0.20 x $20.00 = $4.00

Now, let's add the delivery fee to the total cost of the items: $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Finally, let's add the $5.00 tip to the total: $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

The final answer is: $29.00"
"To find out how many questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate the total number of questions he was able to complete in each test and then subtract that from the total number of questions in each test.

For the first test, Mark had 8 hours to complete 75 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour. 

First, let's find out how many questions Mark could have completed in 8 hours: 
8 hours * 5 questions per hour = 40 questions

Since Mark had 75 questions in the first test, he left 75 - 40 = 35 questions incomplete.

For the second test, Mark had 6 hours to complete 100 questions at the same rate of 5 questions per hour.

Now, let's find out how many questions Mark could have completed in 6 hours: 
6 hours * 5 questions per hour = 30 questions

Since Mark had 100 questions in the second test, he left 100 - 30 = 70 questions incomplete.

To find the total number of questions Mark left incomplete, we add the incomplete questions from both tests: 
35 (from the first test) + 70 (from the second test) = 105 questions

The final answer is: 105"
"To find the number of pink gumballs, we need to first determine the number of blue gumballs, which is given as 12. 

The problem states that there are 22 more than four times the number of pink gumballs as there are blue gumballs. This can be represented as an equation: 

Pink gumballs = 4 * Blue gumballs + 22

Substituting the given value of blue gumballs (12) into the equation:

Pink gumballs = 4 * 12 + 22
Pink gumballs = 48 + 22
Pink gumballs = 70

"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine the total number of semi-automatic cars. We know that there are 20 cars in total, with 12 being automatic and 4 being manual. 

Total number of cars = 20
Automatic cars = 12
Manual cars = 4

To find the number of semi-automatic cars, we subtract the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars:
Semi-automatic cars = Total number of cars - (Automatic cars + Manual cars)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16
Semi-automatic cars = 4

Now, we can find the percentage of semi-automatic cars by dividing the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiplying by 100:
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 0.2 * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 20%

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, we can start by representing the number of baby bees as 'x'. Since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, the number of worker bees is 2x. 

We also know that there are twice as many babies as queens, so the number of queens is x/2. 

The total number of bees in the hive is 700, which is the sum of worker bees, baby bees, and queens. We can write this as an equation:

x + 2x + x/2 = 700

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + 4x + x = 1400

Combine like terms:

7x = 1400

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 200

Now that we know the number of baby bees, we can find the number of worker bees, which is 2x:

Worker bees = 2 * 200 = 400

The final answer is: 400"
"To find out how much money Jordan would earn in one week, we need to calculate the total hours he would work in a week and then multiply that by his hourly wage.

Since Jordan plays video games for 2 hours a day, if he spent that time working instead, he would work 2 hours a day. There are 7 days in a week, so the total hours he would work in a week is 2 hours/day * 7 days = 14 hours.

Now, we multiply the total hours worked in a week by his hourly wage: 14 hours * $10/hour = $140.

The final answer is: $140"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of food items and non-food items separately and then add them together.

The food items are milk and eggs, which cost 2 dollars and 3 dollars respectively. So, the total cost of food items is 2 + 3 = 5 dollars.

The non-food items are light bulbs, cups, and roach traps, which cost 3 dollars, 3 dollars, and 4 dollars respectively. However, there is a 10% tax on these items. To find the total cost of non-food items, we need to calculate the tax first.

The total cost of non-food items before tax is 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars. The tax is 10% of 10 dollars, which is 0.1 * 10 = 1 dollar. So, the total cost of non-food items after tax is 10 + 1 = 11 dollars.

Now, we can find the total cost by adding the cost of food items and non-food items: 5 + 11 = 16 dollars.

The final answer is: 16"
"To calculate the total profit, we first need to determine the total income and total expenses. 

Kim has 3 current clients and 5 potential clients, making a total of 8 clients. Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. 

Total bottles of bleach needed per week: 8 clients * 2 bottles/client = 16 bottles
Total packs of cloths needed per week: 8 clients * 1 pack/client = 8 packs

The cost of bleach per week: 16 bottles * $2/bottle = $32
The cost of cloths per week: 8 packs * $5/pack = $40

Total expenses per week: $32 (bleach) + $40 (cloths) = $72

Kim's total income per week is given as $92. 

To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income: 
Profit = Total income - Total expenses
Profit = $92 - $72
Profit = $20

"To find out how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare and then multiply it by the number of hectares, and finally, we need to consider the number of harvests within a year.

First, let's find the total number of pineapples per hectare: 
100 pineapples/hectare * 10 hectares = 1000 pineapples

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, there are 4 harvests within a year (12 months / 3 months per harvest = 4 harvests).

Now, let's multiply the total number of pineapples per hectare by the number of harvests within a year:
1000 pineapples/hectare * 10 hectares * 4 harvests = 40000 pineapples

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of the bees that left in the first 6 hours return. So, 1/2 * 30 = 15 bees return.
3. The number of bees that have left but not returned is 30 - 15 = 15 bees.
4. In the next 6 hours, two times as many bees as the ones that left in the first 6 hours fly from the hive and leave. So, 2 * 30 = 60 bees leave.
5. The total number of bees that left but not returned is now 15 (from step 3) + 60 (from step 4) = 75 bees.
6. In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive. So, 75 bees return.

The cost of the child ticket is $10, and the cost of the adult ticket is $12. 

Total cost = cost of child ticket + cost of adult ticket
Total cost = $10 + $12
Total cost = $22

Since Brittany's mom received $8 in change, we need to add this to the total cost to find out how much she gave the cashier.

Total given = Total cost + Change
Total given = $22 + $8
Total given = $30

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many friends Dorothy has. Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends, we can set up an equation to find Dorothy's number of friends.

Let's denote the number of friends Dorothy has as 'x'. Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, we can write the equation as:

3x = 12

To find the value of 'x', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 12 / 3
x = 4

So, Dorothy has 4 friends on Facebook.

Now, we know that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. Since Dorothy has 4 friends, we can multiply 4 by 4 to find James' number of friends:

James' friends = 4 * 4
James' friends = 16

Therefore, James has 16 friends on Facebook.

"To determine the time it takes for each person to get home, we need to calculate the time it takes for Steve and Tim to cover their respective distances.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet since the speeds are given in feet per minute. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15,840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10,560 feet

Now, let's calculate the time it takes for each person to get home:

Steve's time: distance / speed = 15,840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: distance / speed = 10,560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve takes 36 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve will be the winner. To find out how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to subtract the winner's time from the loser's time.

Waiting time = Tim's time - Steve's time = 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Dave ate 14 french fries initially.
2. The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 french fries.
   Now, the total amount eaten by Dave and the seagull is 14 + 7 = 21 french fries.
3. Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate a total of 3 * 3 = 9 french fries.
   Now, the total amount eaten is 21 + 9 = 30 french fries.
4. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries. Let's denote the initial amount of fries as 'x'. 
   After the seagull and pigeons ate, the remaining amount is x - 30.
   The raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries, which is (2/3) * (x - 30).
   The remaining amount after the raccoon is (x - 30) - (2/3) * (x - 30).
   Simplifying this, we get (1/3) * (x - 30).
5. After the raccoon, ants carried off a final french fry, leaving 5 behind. 
   This means the remaining amount after the raccoon is 5 + 1 = 6 french fries.
   So, we can set up the equation: (1/3) * (x - 30) = 6.
   Solving for x, we get x - 30 = 18, and x = 48.

"To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the length of each type of baked good in feet and then add them together.

First, let's convert the length of each type of baked good from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

- Each roll is 4 inches long, which is 4/12 = 1/3 feet long.
- Each croissant is 6 inches long, which is 6/12 = 0.5 feet long.
- Each baguette is 2 feet long.

Now, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good:

- Rolls: 300 rolls * 1/3 feet per roll = 100 feet
- Croissants: 120 croissants * 0.5 feet per croissant = 60 feet
- Baguettes: 60 baguettes * 2 feet per baguette = 120 feet

Now, let's add the lengths together to find the total length of the baked goods:

100 feet (rolls) + 60 feet (croissants) + 120 feet (baguettes) = 280 feet

The monkeys need 200 bananas per month, the gorillas need 400 bananas per month, and the baboons need 100 bananas per month. 

Total monthly consumption = 200 (monkeys) + 400 (gorillas) + 100 (baboons) = 700 bananas per month.

Since the zookeeper needs to order bananas for 2 months, we multiply the total monthly consumption by 2.

Total bananas needed for 2 months = 700 bananas/month * 2 months = 1400 bananas.

The final answer is: 1400"
"To find out who the winner is, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Since he's running back and forth, the total distance he covers is 2 times the length of the field for each run. So, the total distance Blake ran is 15 * 2 * 100 = 3000 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 2 * 100 = 200 yards. Then, she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 2 * 40 = 80 yards. She does this 34 times, so the total distance she covers is 34 * 80 = 2720 yards. 

To find the total distance Kelly ran, we add the initial 200 yards to the distance she ran to the 40-yard line and back: 2720 + 200 = 2920 yards.

Now, we compare the distances: Blake ran 3000 yards, and Kelly ran 2920 yards. Blake is the winner.

To find out how much farther the winner ran than the loser, we subtract the loser's distance from the winner's distance: 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. 

Total fish caught by Anakin = 10 + 6 + 3 = 19

Now, let's find the number of fish caught by Locsin. 

Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so he caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.

Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so he caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.

Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so he caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Total fish caught by Locsin = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

Now, let's find the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin.

Total fish caught = Total fish caught by Anakin + Total fish caught by Locsin

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the price increase every two months and add it to the original price. 

The original price of the bag of marbles is $20. 

After 2 months, the price increases by 20% of $20, which is 0.20 * $20 = $4. 
So, the price after 2 months is $20 + $4 = $24.

After 4 months, the price increases by 20% of $24, which is 0.20 * $24 = $4.80. 
So, the price after 4 months is $24 + $4.80 = $28.80.

After 6 months, the price increases by 20% of $28.80, which is 0.20 * $28.80 = $5.76. 
So, the price after 6 months is $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56.

After 8 months, the price increases by 20% of $34.56, which is 0.20 * $34.56 = $6.912. 
So, the price after 8 months is $34.56 + $6.912 = $41.472.

After 10 months, the price increases by 20% of $41.472, which is 0.20 * $41.472 = $8.2944. 
So, the price after 10 months is $41.472 + $8.2944 = $49.7664.

After 12 months, the price increases by 20% of $49.7664, which is 0.20 * $49.7664 = $9.95328. 
So, the price after 12 months is $49.7664 + $9.95328 = $59.71968.

After 14 months, the price increases by 20% of $59.71968, which is 0.20 * $59.71968 = $11.943736. 
So, the price after 14 months is $59.71968 + $11.943736 = $71.663416.

After 16 months, the price increases by 20% of $71.663416, which is 0.20 * $71.663416 = $14.3326832. 
So, the price after 16 months is $71.663416 + $14.3326832 = $85.9960992.

After 18 months, the price increases by 20% of $85.9960992, which is 0.20 * $85.9960992 = $17.19921984. 
So, the price after 18 months is $85.9960992 + $17.19921984 = $103.19531904.

After 20 months, the price increases by 20% of $103.19531904, which is 0.20 * $103.19531904 = $20.639063808.

"To find the total worth of all the toys, we need to calculate the cost of each type of toy and then add them together.

The doll costs as much as 3 action figures. Since an action figure costs $5, the doll costs 3 * $5 = $15.

One red car costs $4. Since there are 5 red cars, the total cost of the red cars is 5 * $4 = $20.

The total cost of the action figures is 3 * $5 = $15.

Now, we add the cost of the doll, the red cars, and the action figures together: $15 (doll) + $20 (red cars) + $15 (action figures) = $50.

The total worth of all the toys is $50.

"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the difference in income between the two options.

If Jackie does her taxes herself, she'll lose $35/hour in missed income for 3 hours of freelance work. So, the total amount of money she'll lose is:

$35/hour * 3 hours = $105

On the other hand, if she hires the accountant, she'll have to pay $90. 

To find out how much more money she'll have if she hires the accountant, we need to subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the amount she'll lose if she does it herself:

$105 - $90 = $15

So, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

"To determine how many times Sandra has to babysit, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she needs for the Spanish flans and divide it by the number of eggs she receives per babysitting session.

First, let's calculate the total number of eggs needed for 15 Spanish flans:
15 Spanish flans * 3 eggs per flan = 45 eggs

Now, let's divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she receives per babysitting session:
45 eggs / 9 eggs per babysitting session = 5

So, Sandra has to babysit 5 times to get enough eggs for the Spanish flans.

"Let's denote Brooke's current age as B and Seth's current age as S. We are given that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write an equation:

S = 2B

We are also given that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. This means that in 2 years, Seth's age will be S + 2 and Brooke's age will be B + 2. The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write another equation:

S + 2 + B + 2 = 28

Combine like terms:

S + B + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

S + B = 24

Now we can substitute S = 2B into this equation:

2B + B = 24

Combine like terms:

3B = 24

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age by substituting B = 8 into the equation S = 2B:

S = 2(8)
S = 16

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much money Jimmy has, we need to first determine what ""twice the money Ethel has"" is. Since Ethel has $8, twice that amount would be 2 * 8 = 16.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, and Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old. So, Sally Four is also 8 years old.
2. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four. Since Sally Four is 8 years old, Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.
3. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red. So, Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we have the ages of all four birds: Sally Four (8), Sally Two (19), Granny Red (16), and Sally Thirtytwo (8). To find the total age, we add their ages together:

"To find out how much Jessica pays in a year, we first need to calculate the increased minimum payments for each debt. 

The minimum payment for the student loans is $300, so 50% more than that would be 1.5 * $300 = $450. 

The minimum payment for the credit card is $200, so 50% more than that would be 1.5 * $200 = $300. 

The minimum payment for the mortgage is $500, so 50% more than that would be 1.5 * $500 = $750.

Now, we add up the increased minimum payments for each debt: $450 + $300 + $750 = $1500.

To find out how much Jessica pays in a year, we multiply the total monthly payment by 12: $1500 * 12 = $18,000.

"To find the total time it takes Billy to peel and cut all the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel one potato and multiply it by the total number of potatoes, then add the time it takes to cut one potato and multiply it by the total number of potatoes.

Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds = 5/60 minutes (converting seconds to minutes)

Total time to peel all potatoes: 60 potatoes * 1.5 minutes/potato = 90 minutes
Total time to cut all potatoes: 60 potatoes * (5/60) minutes/potato = 5 minutes

Now, we add the total time to peel and cut all potatoes: 90 minutes + 5 minutes = 95 minutes

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much they made in total from selling lemonade and then subtract the cost of sugar to find the cost of lemons.

Let's start by finding the total revenue. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. So, the revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10.

Since they made $25 in profit, and we know that profit is revenue minus cost, we can set up an equation to find the total revenue. Let's call the total number of gallons they made 'x'. Then, the total revenue is 10x.

The cost of making lemonade is $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar per gallon. So, the total cost per gallon is 3 + 2 = $5.

The profit equation is: Total Revenue - Total Cost = Profit
10x - 5x = 25
5x = 25

Now, we can solve for x:
x = 25 / 5
x = 5

So, they made 5 gallons of lemonade.

Now that we know they made 5 gallons, we can find the total cost of lemons. The cost of lemons per gallon is $3, so the total cost of lemons is 3 * 5 = $15.

Chinese participants = 160

Now, we know that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants.

Number of girls on the Chinese team = Chinese participants - Number of boys
Number of girls on the Chinese team = 160 - 60
Number of girls on the Chinese team = 100

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations and calculate the remaining amount after each expense.

1. Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent: 
   1/4 of 6000 = 6000 * 1/4 = 1500

   Remaining amount after rent = 6000 - 1500 = 4500

2. Zaid spends 1/3 on car fuel:
   1/3 of 4500 = 4500 * 1/3 = 1500

   Remaining amount after car fuel = 4500 - 1500 = 3000

3. Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity:
   Half of 3000 = 3000 * 1/2 = 1500

   Remaining amount after donation = 3000 - 1500 = 1500

4. Zaid gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$:
   Total given to family = 200 + 700 = 900

   Remaining amount after giving to family = 1500 - 900 = 600

To find the value of 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we know the number of white carnations is 40, we can find the number of red roses. Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, we can write the equation:

"Let's break down the information given in the problem.

Let's denote Mark's current age as M and Jean's current age as J. We know that J = M + 2.

Two years ago, Mark was M - 2 years old, and Jan was 30 - 2 = 28 years old. We are also given that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. This can be written as:

M - 2 = (1/2) * 28 + 5

Simplifying the equation:

M - 2 = 14 + 5
M - 2 = 19
M = 21

Now that we know Mark's age, we can find Jean's age by adding 2 to Mark's age:

J = M + 2
J = 21 + 2
J = 23

"To find the total time for each team, we need to calculate the time for each runner and add them up.

The well-rounded team has each member running 400 meters in 55 seconds. Since there are four members, the total time for this team is 4 * 55 = 220 seconds.

The less well-rounded team's first runner runs 400 meters in 60 seconds. The second runner is 3 seconds faster, so they run 400 meters in 60 - 3 = 57 seconds. The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so they run 400 meters in 57 - 3 = 54 seconds. The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so they run 400 meters in 54 - 3 = 51 seconds. The total time for this team is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 162 seconds.

To find the difference in time between the two teams, we subtract the time of the less well-rounded team from the time of the well-rounded team: 220 - 162 = 58 seconds.

The faster team will win by 58 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, and then find the difference between these two probabilities.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die is the probability of rolling a 4, 5, or 6. There are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, 6) out of 6 possible outcomes, so the probability is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5 or 50%.

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5, since there are 3 even numbers (2, 4, 6) out of 6 possible outcomes. Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 = 0.25 or 25%.

To find the difference in probability, we subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3: 50% - 25% = 25%.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of small rodents (rats and hamsters) and the total number of straw pieces given to them. 

Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as 'r'. Since there are 3 cages of rats, the total number of rats is 3r. 

The total number of hamsters is 10. 

The total number of straw pieces given to rats is 3r * 6 = 18r. 
The total number of straw pieces given to hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50. 

The total number of straw pieces given to small rodents is 160. So, we can write the equation: 18r + 50 = 160.

Now, let's solve for 'r'. Subtract 50 from both sides of the equation: 18r = 110. 

Divide both sides by 18: r = 110 / 18 = 6.11 (round down to 6.11, but since you can't have a fraction of a rat, we'll round down to 6, but we need to check if this is the correct answer)

If there are 6 rats in each cage, the total number of rats is 3 * 6 = 18. The total number of straw pieces given to rats is 18 * 6 = 108. The total number of straw pieces given to hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50. The total number of straw pieces given to small rodents is 108 + 50 = 158, which is less than 160. 

However, if there are 7 rats in each cage, the total number of rats is 3 * 7 = 21. The total number of straw pieces given to rats is 21 * 6 = 126. The total number of straw pieces given to hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50. The total number of straw pieces given to small rodents is 126 + 50 = 176, which is more than 160.

Since 6 rats in each cage results in less straw and 7 rats in each cage results in more straw, the correct number of rats in each cage must be between 6 and 7. 

Let's try 6.5 rats in each cage. The total number of rats is 3 * 6.5 = 19.5. The total number of straw pieces given to rats is 19.5 * 6 = 117. The total number of straw pieces given to hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50. The total number of straw pieces given to small rodents is 117 + 50 = 167, which is still more than 160.

Let's try 6.25 rats in each cage. The total number of rats is 3 * 6.25 = 18.75. The total number of straw pieces given to rats is 18.75 * 6 = 112.5. The total number of straw pieces given to hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50. The total number of straw pieces given to small rodents is 112.5 + 50 = 162.5, which is still more than 160.

Let's try 6.125 rats in each cage. The total number of rats is 3 * 6.125 = 18.375. The total number of straw pieces given to rats is 18.375 * 6 = 110.25. The total number of straw pieces given to hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50. The total number of straw pieces given to small rodents is 110.25 + 50 = 160.25, which is very close to 160.

Since 6.125 rats in each cage results in a total of 160.25 straw pieces, which is very close to 160, we can round down to 6 rats in each cage.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total cost incurred by the trader, which includes the cost of buying the bags and the cost of transportation. 

Let's denote the number of bags as 'x'. The cost of buying 'x' bags at $20 per bag is 20x. The cost of transporting 'x' bags at $2 per bag is 2x. 

The total cost is the sum of these two costs: total_cost = 20x + 2x = 22x.

The trader sold the bags at $30 each, so the total revenue is 30x.

The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost: profit = total_revenue - total_cost = 30x - 22x = 8x.

We are given that the profit is $400, so we can set up the equation: 8x = 400.

To find the number of bags, we need to solve for x: x = 400 / 8 = 50.

The cost of the rides is 2 rides * $33 per ride = $66.

Now, let's add up the total cost: $20.25 (tickets) + $15.75 (food) + $66 (rides) = $102.

Since they split the cost evenly, each friend paid $102 / 3 = $34.

Since Tom starts with 50 trees, we need to calculate the total number of trees after 10 years. 

In 10 years, the net change is 8 * 10 = 80 trees. So, the total number of trees after 10 years is 50 + 80 = 130 trees.

However, after 10 years, 30% of the trees die. To find the number of trees that die, we multiply 130 by 0.3: 130 * 0.3 = 39 trees.

Now, we subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees: 130 - 39 = 91 trees.

The final answer is: 91"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos on Sue's front yard.

On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. They painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back out on Sue's front yard. So, now there are 6 white flamingos and 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos.

On Sunday morning, the neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection. Now, there are 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos.

The total number of flamingos on Sue's front yard is 30 pink + 6 white = 36 flamingos.

To find out how many more pink plastic flamingos were out than white plastic flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To find out how much change Violetta will get, we first need to determine how many crayons she can buy with $20. Since one crayon costs $2, we can divide the total amount she has by the cost of one crayon.

$20 ÷ $2 = 10 crayons

Since Violetta needs 5 different colors, we can assume she will buy 2 crayons of each color. 

The total number of crayons she will buy is 5 * 2 = 10 crayons.

Since she can buy 10 crayons with $20, and she only needs 10 crayons, she will spend the entire $20.

The change she will get is $0.

The final answer is: $0"
"To find the cost of a pen, we need to add the cost of a pencil and an eraser, since a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined. 

Cost of a pencil = $1.20
Cost of an eraser = $0.30
Cost of a pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser
Cost of a pen = $1.20 + $0.30
Cost of a pen = $1.50

Now, we need to find the cost of 8 pens. 

Cost of 8 pens = Cost of a pen * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $1.50 * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $12.00

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we first need to calculate the total pounds of carrots that will be used by the restaurants. 

Each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants. 

Total pounds of carrots used = Number of restaurants * Pounds per restaurant
Total pounds of carrots used = 40 * 2
Total pounds of carrots used = 80 pounds

Now, we subtract the total pounds of carrots used from the total pounds of carrots available to find out how many pounds will not be used.

Pounds of carrots not used = Total pounds of carrots - Total pounds of carrots used
Pounds of carrots not used = 200 - 80
Pounds of carrots not used = 120

The final answer is: 120"
"To find the number of children in Soda, we need to subtract the total number of men and women from the total population.

Total population = 23786
Number of men = 8417
Number of women = 9092

First, let's add the number of men and women:
8417 + 9092 = 17509

Now, subtract the sum from the total population to find the number of children:
23786 - 17509 = 6277

The number of children in Soda is 6277."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Initially, Elaine had 20 Pokémon cards.

In the first month, she collected three times the number of cards she initially had: 3 * 20 = 60 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month: 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months: (60 + 40) * 2 = 200 cards.

Now, let's add up the total number of cards Elaine has: 20 (initial cards) + 60 (first month) + 40 (second month) + 200 (third month) = 320 cards.

The final answer is: 320"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Mark edits 1000 sentences each week. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, he edits 1000 / 2 = 500 sentences for each publisher.

Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence, so the total amount Mark earns from Publisher A is 500 * 5 = 2500 cents.

Since Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, Publisher B pays 2 * 5 = 10 cents per sentence. The total amount Mark earns from Publisher B is 500 * 10 = 5000 cents.

To find the total amount Mark makes in a week, we add the amounts from both publishers: 2500 + 5000 = 7500 cents.

The final answer is: 7500"
"To find the total amount of water Baldur gets every day, we need to calculate the total number of pails he gets in a day and then multiply it by the amount of water in each pail.

Baldur gets 5 pails of water every morning and 6 pails of water every afternoon. So, the total number of pails he gets in a day is 5 + 6 = 11 pails.

Since each pail contains 5 liters of water, the total amount of water he gets every day is 11 pails * 5 liters/pail = 55 liters.

The final answer is: 55"
"To calculate John's total earnings for the year, we need to consider both the one-time monetary reward and the 5% raise in salary.

First, let's calculate the total amount John earns from his weekly salary for the year. Since he makes $2000 a week and works every week of the year, we multiply his weekly salary by the number of weeks in a year (52).

Weekly salary: $2000
Number of weeks in a year: 52
Total salary for the year: $2000 * 52 = $104,000

Next, we calculate the 5% raise in salary. A 5% raise means John's new salary will be 105% of his original salary (100% + 5% increase).

Original salary: $2000
New salary: $2000 * 1.05 = $2100

Now, let's calculate John's total earnings for the year, including the one-time monetary reward of $5000.

Total salary for the year: $104,000
One-time monetary reward: $5000
Total earnings for the year: $104,000 + $5000 = $109,000

The final answer is: $109,000"
"To find the total number of barrels of wine produced per year, we need to calculate the total number of tons of grapes produced per year and then multiply it by the number of barrels of wine each ton can make.

First, let's find the total number of tons of grapes produced per year. Since each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year and there are 10 acres, we multiply 5 tons/acre by 10 acres:

5 tons/acre * 10 acres = 50 tons/year

Next, we know that each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine. To find the total number of barrels of wine produced per year, we multiply the total number of tons of grapes by the number of barrels each ton can make:

50 tons/year * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels/year

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the slices used for the sandwiches, omelets, and the macaroni and cheese dish separately and then add them together.

For the sandwiches, Carl ate 7 days' worth of sandwiches (since he ate one every day for a week) with 2 slices per sandwich. So, the total slices used for sandwiches = 7 * 2 = 14.

For the omelets, Carl ate 3 days' worth of omelets with 3 slices per omelet (since he used one more slice per omelet than per sandwich). So, the total slices used for omelets = 3 * 3 = 9.

For the macaroni and cheese dish, Carl used 8 slices.

Now, let's add the slices used for sandwiches, omelets, and the macaroni and cheese dish together: 14 (sandwiches) + 9 (omelets) + 8 (macaroni and cheese) = 31.

The final answer is: 31"
"To find the total number of pens Janet has now, we need to calculate the number of pens she initially had and the number of pens she bought.

Janet initially had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, so the total number of pens she had initially is 22 + 10 = 32.

She bought 6 bags of blue pens, with 9 pens in each bag, so the total number of blue pens she bought is 6 * 9 = 54.

She also bought 2 bags of red pens, with 6 pens in each bag, so the total number of red pens she bought is 2 * 6 = 12.

The total number of pens she bought is 54 (blue) + 12 (red) = 66.

Now, we add the total number of pens she initially had to the total number of pens she bought: 32 (initial pens) + 66 (pens bought) = 98.

The final answer is: 98"
"To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we first need to find the total score she needs for the semester. Since there are six tests and she wants an average of 93, we multiply 93 by 6 to get the total score.

Total score = Average * Number of tests
Total score = 93 * 6
Total score = 558

Next, we need to find the total score of the first five tests. We add up the scores of the first five tests.

Score of first five tests = 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86
Score of first five tests = 338

Since Mr. Bert allows the students to remove the lowest score from the average each semester, we need to find the lowest score among the first five tests. The lowest score is 71.

Now, we subtract the lowest score from the total score of the first five tests to get the new total score.

New total score of first five tests = Score of first five tests - Lowest score
New total score of first five tests = 338 - 71
New total score of first five tests = 267

Now, we add the score of the sixth test to the new total score of the first five tests to get the total score for the semester.

Total score = New total score of first five tests + Score of sixth test
558 = 267 + Score of sixth test

To find the score of the sixth test, we subtract the new total score of the first five tests from the total score.

Score of sixth test = Total score - New total score of first five tests
Score of sixth test = 558 - 267
Score of sixth test = 291

The final answer is: 291"
"To find the total number of kilometers Michael rode his bike, we need to calculate the distance covered in the two different periods.

First, let's calculate the distance covered in the first four weeks when he rode 25 kilometers each time, 5 times a week.

Distance covered in the first four weeks = 25 km * 5 times/week * 4 weeks = 25 * 5 * 4 = 500 km

Next, let's calculate the distance covered in the next three weeks when he rode 60 kilometers each time, 2 times a week.

Distance covered in the next three weeks = 60 km * 2 times/week * 3 weeks = 60 * 2 * 3 = 360 km

Now, let's add the distances covered in both periods to find the total distance.

Total distance = Distance covered in the first four weeks + Distance covered in the next three weeks
Total distance = 500 km + 360 km
Total distance = 860 km

The final answer is: 860"
"To find the total weight of the bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the weight of the chocolate bars. Since there are 25 chocolate bars and each weighs 40g, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
25 * 40g = 1000g

Next, let's find the weight of the candied apples. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, the weight of each candied apple is:
40g / 2 = 20g

Now, let's find the total weight of the candied apples:
80 * 20g = 1600g

Finally, let's add the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag of candy:
1000g + 1600g = 2600g

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since each plate costs $6000, half a dozen plates will cost 6 * $6000 = $36,000.

We are also given that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, the total cost of twenty dozen cups is $36,000 - $1200 = $34,800.

Since twenty dozen cups is equivalent to 240 cups, we can find the cost of each cup by dividing the total cost by the number of cups: $34,800 / 240 = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy and the total amount of money she has earned so far.

The total cost of the items is the cost of the jacket plus the cost of 2 pairs of shoes: 
$30 (jacket) + 2 * $20 (shoes) = $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved before she started babysitting. She earns $5 each time she babysits the neighbor's kids, so the total amount she has earned from babysitting is:
$5 * number of times she babysits.

Let's denote the number of times she babysits as 'x'. Then, the total amount she has earned from babysitting is $5x.

She also earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. Let's denote the number of times she mows the lawn as 'y'. Then, the total amount she has earned from mowing the lawn is $4y.

The total amount of money she has is the sum of the money she already had, the money she earned from babysitting, and the money she earned from mowing the lawn:
$10 (initial savings) + $5x (babysitting) + $4y (mowing the lawn).

Since she wants to buy the jacket and shoes, the total amount of money she has must be greater than or equal to the total cost of the items:
$10 + $5x + $4y ≥ $70.

We want to find the minimum number of times she must mow the lawn, so we want to find the smallest value of 'y' that satisfies the inequality. To do this, we can first subtract $10 from both sides of the inequality:
$5x + $4y ≥ $60.

Since we want to find the minimum value of 'y', we can try to find the smallest value of 'x' that satisfies the inequality. We know that $5x must be less than or equal to $60 - $4y, so we can write:
$5x ≤ $60 - $4y.

Now, we can try to find the smallest value of 'y' that satisfies the inequality. We can do this by trying different values of 'y' and checking if the corresponding value of 'x' satisfies the inequality.

If y = 0, then $5x ≤ $60, which means x ≤ 12. This means she can afford the jacket and shoes if she babysits 12 times and doesn't mow the lawn.

If y = 1, then $5x ≤ $56, which means x ≤ 11.2. This means she can afford the jacket and shoes if she babysits 11 or 12 times and mows the lawn once.

If y = 2, then $5x ≤ $52, which means x ≤ 10.4. This means she can afford the jacket and shoes if she babysits 10 or 11 times and mows the lawn twice.

If y = 3, then $5x ≤ $48, which means x ≤ 9.6. This means she can afford the jacket and shoes if she babysits 9 or 10 times and mows the lawn three times.

If y = 4, then $5x ≤ $44, which means x ≤ 8.8. This means she can afford the jacket and shoes if she babysits 8 or 9 times and mows the lawn four times.

If y = 5, then $5x ≤ $40, which means x ≤ 8. This means she can afford the jacket and shoes if she babysits 8 times and mows the lawn five times.

If y = 6, then $5x ≤ $36, which means x ≤ 7.2. This means she can afford the jacket and shoes if she babysits 7 or 8 times and mows the lawn six times.

If y = 7, then $5x ≤ $32, which means x ≤ 6.4. This means she can afford the jacket and shoes if she babysits 6 or 7 times and mows the lawn seven times.

If y = 8, then $5x ≤ $28, which means x ≤ 5.6. This means she can afford the jacket and shoes if she babysits 5 or 6 times and mows the lawn eight times.

If y = 9, then $5x ≤ $24, which means x ≤ 4.8. This means she can afford the jacket and shoes if she babysits 4 or 5 times and mows the lawn nine times.

If y = 10, then $5x ≤ $20, which means x ≤ 4. This means she can afford the jacket and shoes if she babysits 4 times and mows the lawn ten times.

If y = 11, then $5x ≤ $16, which means x ≤ 3.2. This means she can afford the jacket and shoes if she babysits 3 or 4 times and mows the lawn eleven times.

If y = 12, then $5x ≤ $12, which means x ≤ 2.4. This means she can afford the jacket and shoes if she babysits 2 or 3 times and mows the lawn twelve times.

If y = 13, then $5x ≤ $8, which means x ≤ 1.6. This means she can afford the jacket and shoes if she babysits 1 or 2 times and mows the lawn thirteen times.

If y = 14, then $5x ≤ $4, which means x ≤ 0.8. This means she can afford the jacket and shoes if she babysits 0 or 1 time and mows the lawn fourteen times.

If y = 15, then $5x ≤ $0, which means x ≤ 0. This means she can afford the jacket and shoes if she mows the lawn fifteen times.

The smallest value of 'y' that satisfies the inequality is y = 10, which means she must mow the lawn 10 times.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's denote the number of red chickens as 'r' and the number of white chickens as 'w'. We are given that w = r + 2.

The total number of eggs collected is the sum of the eggs produced by red and white chickens. Since each red chicken produces 3 eggs and each white chicken produces 5 eggs, we can write the equation:

3r + 5w = 42

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the time Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park since he walks around the edge. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the dimensions of the park, l = 6 miles and w = 1.5 miles, we can substitute these values into the formula:

P = 2(6 + 1.5)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles/hour, we can find the time he spends walking by dividing the perimeter by his speed:

Time = Perimeter / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of customers Sloane counted on the first day, then add 50 to that number to find the number of customers on the second day, and finally add the number of customers on the second day to the number of customers on the third day to find the total.

Let's denote the number of customers on the first day as x. 

On the second day, Sloane counted 50 more customers than the first day, so the number of customers on the second day is x + 50.

The total number of customers by the third day was 500, which is the sum of the customers on the first and second days. We can write this as an equation:

x + (x + 50) = 500

Combine like terms:

2x + 50 = 500

Subtract 50 from both sides:

2x = 450

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 225

So, Sloane counted 225 customers on the first day. 

On the second day, she counted 225 + 50 = 275 customers.

To find the number of customers on the third day, we need to add the number of customers on the second day to the total number of customers by the third day and subtract the number of customers on the first day:

Customers on the third day = Total customers by the third day - Customers on the first day
= 500 - 225

"Let's denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as 'x' gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the initial amount of water in the big pool is 2x gallons.

Since both pools leak at 4 gallons/minute, the rate of water loss for both pools is 8 gallons/minute. 

In 4 minutes, the total water lost from both pools is 8 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 32 gallons.

The big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as 'y'. Then, the current amount of water in the big pool is 4y.

We can set up the equation based on the initial and current water levels:

Initial water in the big pool - Initial water in the small pool - Water lost = Current water in the big pool - Current water in the small pool
2x - x - 32 = 4y - y

Combine like terms:
x - 32 = 3y

Since the small pool lost 4 gallons/minute for 4 minutes, the amount of water lost from the small pool is 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons. 

The initial amount of water in the small pool is x - 16 gallons.

Substitute x - 16 for x in the equation x - 32 = 3y:
(x - 16) - 32 = 3y
x - 48 = 3y

Now, we need to find the relationship between x and y. We know that the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool now. So, 4y = (2x - 32) - (x - 16) = x - 16.

Simplify the equation:
4y = x - 16
4y = (x - 16) + 16
4y = x

Substitute 4y for x in the equation x - 48 = 3y:
4y - 48 = 3y

Subtract 3y from both sides:
y - 48 = 0
y = 48

Now that we know y, we can find the initial amount of water in the small pool (x - 16):
x = 4y
x = 4 * 48
x = 192

The initial amount of water in the small pool is 192 gallons. Since the small pool lost 16 gallons in 4 minutes, the current amount of water in the small pool is:
y = x - 16
y = 192 - 16
y = 176

The final answer is: 176"
"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy and then divide that by her hourly wage.

The total cost of the items is the cost of the shoes plus the cost of the belt: $320.00 + $32.00 = $352.00.

Now, we divide the total cost by Lori's hourly wage: $352.00 ÷ $8.00 = 44 hours.

The final answer is: 44"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Janeth will pay in 12 months and then subtract that from the initial amount borrowed plus the additional 10% interest.

First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth will pay in 12 months:

$165/month * 12 months = $1980

Now, let's calculate the total amount Janeth borrowed with the additional 10% interest:

$2000 + (10% of $2000) = $2000 + $200 = $2200

Now, let's subtract the total amount Janeth will pay from the total amount she borrowed with interest:

$2200 - $1980 = $220

So, Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months will be $220.

The final answer is: $220"
"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to determine the number of dahlias and add it to the number of roses.

We know there are 4 roses in the vase. We also know there are 7 more dahlias than roses. 

To find the number of dahlias, we add 7 to the number of roses: 
4 (roses) + 7 = 11 dahlias

Now, we add the number of roses and dahlias to find the total number of flowers in the vase:
4 (roses) + 11 (dahlias) = 15

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the average age of the three in three years, we first need to find their current ages and then add 3 to each age. 

Given that Harriet is 21 years old, and she is half the age of Zack, Zack's age is 2 * 21 = 42 years old.

Since Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, Adrian's age is 3 * 21 = 63 years old.

Now, we have the current ages of the three: Harriet (21), Zack (42), and Adrian (63). 

In three years, their ages will be: Harriet (21 + 3 = 24), Zack (42 + 3 = 45), and Adrian (63 + 3 = 66).

To find the average age, we add their ages and divide by 3: (24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45.

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Yuri and Brianna. 

Naomi scored 68 points. 
Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. 
Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. 
Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. 
Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

The total points scored by the four students is 251. 
We know that Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna scored 68, 44, and 85 points respectively. 
So, the total points scored by these three students is 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points.

To find out how many points Jojo scored, we subtract the total points scored by the other three students from the total points scored by all four students. 
Jojo scored 251 - 197 = 54 points.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much water is left in the tank after Celine used 90 liters. 

Initial water in the tank = 120 liters
Water used by Celine = 90 liters
Water left in the tank = Initial water - Water used
Water left in the tank = 120 - 90
Water left in the tank = 30 liters

Now, Celine collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left. 
Rainwater collected = 2 * Water left in the tank
Rainwater collected = 2 * 30
Rainwater collected = 60 liters

Total water in the tank now = Water left in the tank + Rainwater collected
Total water in the tank now = 30 + 60
Total water in the tank now = 90 liters

"To find the total number of flowers Andy plants, we need to calculate the number of petunias first. Since he plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, we subtract 40 from the number of geraniums.

Number of geraniums: 90
Number of petunias = Number of geraniums - 40
Number of petunias = 90 - 40
Number of petunias = 50

Now, we add the number of geraniums and petunias to find the total number of flowers.

Total flowers = Number of geraniums + Number of petunias
Total flowers = 90 + 50
Total flowers = 140

The final answer is: 140"
"To find the total amount spent on advertising for the two years, we need to calculate the amount spent in the second year first. 

The company spent a third of $15000 in the second year. To find a third of $15000, we divide $15000 by 3.

$15000 / 3 = $5000

Now, we add the amount spent in the first year to the amount spent in the second year to find the total amount spent on advertising for the two years.

$15000 + $5000 = $20000

The total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is $20000."

"To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we first need to determine the total number of cards James has after the changes. Initially, he has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards. 

After losing 8 water type cards, he has 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards. 

After buying 14 grass type cards, he has 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards.

The total number of cards James has is 30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96 cards.

The probability of picking a water type card is the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards, which is 32/96.

To find the percentage, we multiply by 100: (32/96) * 100 = 33.333...%.

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33%."
"To calculate the total amount Chad owes, we need to first calculate the total cost of the burrito and the upgrade, then subtract the gift card amount.

The base burrito costs $6.50. Chad adds extra meat for $2.00, extra cheese for $1.00, avocado for $1.00, and 2 sauces for $0.25 each, which is 2 * $0.25 = $0.50. The total cost of the add-ons is $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $4.50. 

The total cost of the burrito with add-ons is $6.50 + $4.50 = $11.00. Chad also upgrades his meal for an extra $3.00, so the total cost before the gift card is $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00.

Chad has a gift card for $5.00, so we subtract this from the total cost: $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the combined rate at which Kalinda and her mom can add pieces to the puzzle. 

Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute. Her mom can add half as many pieces per minute, which is 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute.

The combined rate is 4 (Kalinda's rate) + 2 (her mom's rate) = 6 pieces per minute.

Since there are 360 pieces in the puzzle, we need to divide the total number of pieces by the combined rate to find the time it will take to complete the puzzle.

Time = Total pieces / Combined rate
Time = 360 / 6
Time = 60 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

Time in hours = 60 / 60
Time in hours = 1 hour

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, there were 120 baby watermelons. After two months, 30% of them were ready for harvest. 

30% of 120 is 0.3 * 120 = 36. So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest after two months.

This means that 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons were not ready for harvest after two months.

When Ashlyn came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 melons were ready for harvest. 

3/4 of 84 is (3/4) * 84 = 63. So, 63 watermelons were ready for harvest after two weeks.

This means that 84 - 63 = 21 watermelons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks.

"To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the total cost of the cars, the tax on the cars, and the registration fees.

The total cost of the cars is the price of one car multiplied by the number of cars: 12 * $20,000 = $240,000.

The tax on the cars is 10% of the total cost of the cars: 0.1 * $240,000 = $24,000.

The registration fees are $1000 per car, so for 12 cars, it's 12 * $1000 = $12,000.

Now, we add the total cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees to find the total cost: $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

The final answer is: $276,000"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many shells Kylie collected on Monday. We know that Robert collected 20 shells on Monday, and Kylie collected 5 more than Robert. 

So, Kylie collected 20 + 5 = 25 shells on Monday.

On Tuesday, Kylie collected 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. To find out how many shells Kylie collected on Tuesday, we need to multiply the number of shells she collected on Monday by 2.

25 * 2 = 50

So, Kylie collected 50 shells on Tuesday.

"To find the total number of insects in the garden, we first need to determine the number of bugs. Since Dax found half as many bugs as ants, and there were 50 ants, we can calculate the number of bugs as follows:

Number of bugs = Number of ants / 2
Number of bugs = 50 / 2
Number of bugs = 25

Now, to find the total number of insects in the garden, we add the number of ants and bugs:

Total number of insects = Number of ants + Number of bugs
Total number of insects = 50 + 25
Total number of insects = 75

"To find the number of penguins left sunbathing, we need to determine how many penguins are not in the ocean or the cave. 

First, let's find out how many penguins jump in the ocean. One-third of 36 is 36 / 3 = 12 penguins. 

Next, let's find out how many penguins go inside the cave. Another one-third of 36 is 36 / 3 = 12 penguins.

Now, we need to find the total number of penguins that are either in the ocean or the cave. This is 12 (ocean) + 12 (cave) = 24 penguins.

To find the number of penguins left sunbathing, we subtract the number of penguins in the ocean and the cave from the total number of penguins. This is 36 (total) - 24 (ocean and cave) = 12 penguins.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many tomatoes Steve eats in a week and then divide that by the number of tomatoes a vine can produce per week.

Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, he eats 6 * 7 = 42 tomatoes per week.

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats half as much as Steve, which is 42 / 2 = 21 tomatoes per week.

The total number of tomatoes they eat per week is 42 (Steve) + 21 (girlfriend) = 63 tomatoes per week.

Each vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week. To find out how many vines Steve needs, we divide the total number of tomatoes they eat per week by the number of tomatoes a vine can produce per week: 63 / 3 = 21 vines.

First, let's find the total number of slices needed: 
20 friends * 4 slices per friend = 80 slices

Since pizzas are sold in 8 slices, we need to divide the total number of slices by 8 to find the number of pizzas:
80 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 10 pizzas

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas to ensure each of his 20 friends gets 4 slices.

25 pens / 5 pens per new pen = 5 new pens

However, we also need to include the original 25 pens that Ram bought. So, we add the 5 new pens to the original 25 pens.

25 (original pens) + 5 (new pens) = 30 pens

Therefore, Ram gets to have 30 pens in total.

Since Jessa is 20 years old, and Joan is five years older than Jessa, we can calculate Joan's age by adding 5 to Jessa's age: 20 + 5 = 25.

Now, we know that Mary is two years younger than Joan, so we can calculate Mary's age by subtracting 2 from Joan's age: 25 - 2 = 23.

Now that we have the ages of all three girls, we can find the sum of their ages by adding their individual ages: 20 (Jessa) + 25 (Joan) + 23 (Mary) = 68.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. We know that John has 54 candies and that he has twice as many candies as Robert. 

To find out how many candies Robert has, we can divide the number of candies John has by 2. 

Robert's candies = John's candies / 2
Robert's candies = 54 / 2
Robert's candies = 27

We also know that James has 6 more candies than Robert. 

James' candies = Robert's candies + 6
James' candies = 27 + 6
James' candies = 33

Now, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Dolly has 2 books and Pandora has 1 book. 

Dolly will read her own 2 books and Pandora's 1 book, so Dolly will read a total of 3 books.

Pandora will read her own 1 book and Dolly's 2 books, so Pandora will read a total of 3 books.

In total, they will read 3 (Dolly's total) + 3 (Pandora's total) = 6 books.

However, we need to consider that they also read each other's books. So, Dolly will read Pandora's book and Pandora will read Dolly's book. This means they will read 2 more books.

Therefore, the total number of books they will read is 6 (initial books) + 2 (additional books) = 8 books.

"To find out how many hours Mike spends writing a week, we need to calculate the total number of letters he writes and then multiply it by the time it takes him to write one page.

First, let's find out how many letters Mike writes in a week. He has 3 pen pals left, and each of them sends 2 letters a week. So, the total number of letters he receives is 3 * 2 = 6 letters.

Since he responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters a week. 

Now, let's calculate the total number of pages he writes in a week. Each letter is 5 pages long, so the total number of pages is 6 * 5 = 30 pages.

Since Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time he spends writing a week is 30 pages * 6 minutes/page = 180 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60. So, 180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours.

15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes

Next, we add the extra 300 minutes used for calls with other people:

450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from Jason's total plan minutes:

1000 minutes - 750 minutes = 250 minutes

So, Jason has 250 minutes left.

The final answer is: 250"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Griffin had 24 french fries.

Kyle took 5 fries from Griffin. So, Griffin was left with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.

Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, which means Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Now, Griffin has 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

Ginger gave Griffin a certain number of fries, let's call it 'x'. After this, Griffin had 9 + x fries.

Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had taken, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. So, after Colby took 2 fries, Griffin had 9 + x - 2 = 7 + x fries.

We are given that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. Therefore, we can set up the equation 7 + x = 27.

To find the value of 'x', we subtract 7 from both sides of the equation: x = 27 - 7 = 20.

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries. 

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28.

According to the problem, this difference is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums, so we can set up the equation:

28 = 2 * 2x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

28 = 4x

Dividing both sides by 4, we get:

x = 7

Since there are the same number of fish in each aquarium, the number of fish in each aquarium is 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the total hours worked. The makeup artist works 6 hours a day, 4 times a week, for 5 weeks. 

Total hours worked per week = 6 hours/day * 4 days/week = 24 hours/week
Total hours worked in 5 weeks = 24 hours/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours

The makeup artist charges $250 per hour. 

Total cost before discount = 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000

After the movie is done, the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount. 

Discount amount = 10% of $30,000 = 0.1 * $30,000 = $3,000

Total amount Jean paid = Total cost before discount - Discount amount
= $30,000 - $3,000
= $27,000

The final answer is: $27,000"
"To find out how much each person paid, we need to first calculate the total cost of the party supplies. 

The total cost is the sum of the individual expenses: 
$12 (cake) + $43 (presents) + $15 (decorations) + $4 (invitations) + $22 (goodie bags) = $96

Since Isabelle and her two parents split the cost evenly, we divide the total cost by 3:
$96 / 3 = $32

Each person paid $32."
"To find out how much the chef spent, we need to calculate the total weight of the onions and then multiply it by the cost per pound.

The chef bought 4 bags of onions, each weighing 50 pounds. So, the total weight of onions is:
4 bags * 50 pounds/bag = 200 pounds

Since a pound of onions costs $1.50, the total cost is:
200 pounds * $1.50/pound = $300

The chef spent $300."
"To find out how many calories Sue consumed, we first need to determine how many cookies she ate. 

On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 5 cookies, so Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday.

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 13 cookies, so Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.

In total, Sue ate 20 + 26 = 46 cookies. 

Her sister ate 5 + 13 = 18 cookies.

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, Sue consumed 46 * 200 = 9200 calories, and her sister consumed 18 * 200 = 3600 calories.

The difference in calories consumed is 9200 - 3600 = 5600."
"To find the number of boys in the third class, we first need to determine the total number of girls in the school. Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, and there are 3 classes with 20 students each, the total number of students in the school is 3 * 20 = 60.

Given that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls, the total number of girls in the school is 15 + 12 = 27. 

Since the school is 50% girls, the total number of boys in the school is also 60 - 27 = 33.

Now, we need to find the number of girls in the third class. Since the school is 50% girls, the third class should also have 50% girls. The total number of students in the third class is 20, so the number of girls in the third class is 20 * 0.5 = 10.

To find the number of boys in the third class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in the third class: 20 - 10 = 10.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how many cougars Rick killed today. We know he killed 15 cougars last night and three fewer cougars than the previous night today. So, the number of cougars he killed today is 15 - 3 = 12.

Now, we know that Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars today. Since he killed 12 cougars today, he killed 3 * 12 = 36 wolves.

We also know that Rick killed 10 wolves last night. So, the total number of wolves he killed is 10 (last night) + 36 (today) = 46.

The total number of cougars he killed is 15 (last night) + 12 (today) = 27.

To find the total number of animals Rick killed, we add the number of wolves and cougars: 46 (wolves) + 27 (cougars) = 73.

The final answer is: 73"
"To find the floor Bill is on, we need to calculate the floor he rides the elevator to. 

First, we multiply his starting floor (3) by 4: 3 * 4 = 12.

So, Bill is now on the 18th floor.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we first need to determine how many times Anne went down the slide. Since Anne went down 30% less than Mitchel, we need to calculate 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30.

30% of 30 is 0.3 x 30 = 9. 

So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Since Robert went down 4 times as much as Anne, we multiply the number of times Anne went down by 4.

21 x 4 = 84

Robert went down the water slide 84 times.

"To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we first need to determine how many cows Mr. Sylas added to each stall. 

Initially, each stall had 20 cows. Mr. Sylas bought 40 cows and divided them equally among the 10 stalls. 

To find out how many cows he added to each stall, we divide the total number of new cows (40) by the number of stalls (10). 

40 / 10 = 4

So, Mr. Sylas added 4 cows to each stall. 

Now, we need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. We know that each stall has 20 original cows and 4 new cows. 

20 (original cows) + 4 (new cows) = 24 cows per stall

Since we want to find out how many cows are in 8 stalls, we multiply the number of cows per stall by 8.

24 * 8 = 192

"To find the total weight of the redwood tree, we first need to calculate the total number of 10-foot sections. Since the tree is 200 feet tall, we divide 200 by 10 to get the total number of sections.

200 feet / 10 feet per section = 20 sections

Since each section weighs 400 pounds, we multiply the number of sections by the weight per section.

20 sections * 400 pounds per section = 8000 pounds

However, termites ate 30% of the wood, so we need to find 30% of 8000 pounds and subtract it from the total weight.

30% of 8000 pounds = 0.3 * 8000 = 2400 pounds

Now, we subtract 2400 pounds from the total weight.

8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, and Andrea has 52 apples. So, Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.
2. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.
3. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.
4. To find the total number of fruits, we need to add the number of apples and bananas that both Andrea and Jamal have. 
   Total fruits = (Andrea's apples + Jamal's apples + Andrea's bananas + Jamal's bananas)
   Total fruits = (52 + 44 + 24 + 48)
   Total fruits = 168

"To determine the total amount of flour needed, we need to calculate the amount of flour required for each day and then add them together.

For today, Carla is making 36 cookies. Since two cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many dozens are in 36 cookies. 

36 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 3 dozen cookies

Since 2 cups of flour are needed for 1 dozen cookies, we multiply the number of dozens by 2 to find the total amount of flour needed for today.

3 dozen cookies * 2 cups per dozen = 6 cups of flour for today

For tomorrow, Carla is making 30 cookies. Again, we need to find out how many dozens are in 30 cookies.

30 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 2.5 dozen cookies

Since 2 cups of flour are needed for 1 dozen cookies, we multiply the number of dozens by 2 to find the total amount of flour needed for tomorrow.

2.5 dozen cookies * 2 cups per dozen = 5 cups of flour for tomorrow

Now, we add the amount of flour needed for both days to find the total amount of flour needed.

6 cups of flour for today + 5 cups of flour for tomorrow = 11 cups of flour

"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two-thirds of the pennies in the cup, we need to first calculate two-thirds of 9,300 pennies.

Two-thirds of 9,300 can be calculated as (2/3) * 9,300.

To find the value of two-thirds of 9,300, we can multiply 9,300 by 2 and then divide by 3.

First, multiply 9,300 by 2: 9,300 * 2 = 18,600

Then, divide 18,600 by 3: 18,600 / 3 = 6,200

Since each penny is worth $0.01, we can multiply 6,200 by 0.01 to find the total dollar amount.

6,200 * 0.01 = $62.00

2. Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has. 
   So, Ferdinand has 6 / 2 = 3 trees.
3. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has.
   First, we find twice the number of trees Ferdinand has: 2 * 3 = 6.
   Then, we add 5 to this number: 6 + 5 = 11.
   So, Harry has 11 trees.

Now, to find the difference in the number of trees between Harry's yard and Ferdinand's yard, we subtract the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard from the number of trees in Harry's yard:
11 - 3 = 8

"To find the total price of the house, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and the transfer fee, then add them to the selling price.

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, which is 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500.

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price, which is 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000.

The total price of the house is the sum of the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee: $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

To find out how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we subtract her budget from the total price: $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500.

"To solve this problem, we first need to find out how long it takes to heat the oil to 400 degrees. Since it takes 40% longer than 20 minutes to heat up to 400 degrees, we can calculate this as follows:

20 minutes * 1.4 (1 + 0.4) = 28 minutes

So, it takes 28 minutes to heat the oil to 400 degrees. 

Now, we know that after warming the oil, it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil. Since it took 28 minutes to warm up the oil, it will take 28 - 5 = 23 minutes to cook.

The total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is the sum of the time it took to warm up the oil and the time it took to cook:

28 minutes (to warm up the oil) + 23 minutes (to cook) = 51 minutes

"To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we first need to determine the total number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette. 

The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches, which is 900 * 0.1 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so it takes 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

The total number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette is 90 + 180 = 270 stitches.

Since the whole sweater is a 1800-stitch project, the total number of stitches used for the body and the sleeves is 1800 - 270 = 1530 stitches.

The body takes 900 stitches, so the number of stitches used for the sleeves is 1530 - 900 = 630 stitches.

"To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the lines for each scene and the song, then add them together.

The solo song has 54 lines. 

The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. However, only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has 60 * (4/5) = 48 lines from the second scene.

To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene: 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

We can substitute the first equation into the second one to solve for S:

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the equation:

6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Number of cobras: 40
Number of spots per cobra: 70
Total spots on cobras: 40 * 70 = 2800

Since the mambas have half the number of spots as the cobras, we can find the number of spots per mamba by dividing the number of spots per cobra by 2.

Number of spots per mamba: 70 / 2 = 35

Now, we can find the total number of spots on the mambas by multiplying the number of mambas by the number of spots per mamba.

Number of mambas: 60
Number of spots per mamba: 35
Total spots on mambas: 60 * 35 = 2100

To find the total number of spots on all the snakes, we add the total spots on the cobras and the mambas.

Total spots on all snakes: 2800 + 2100 = 4900

"To find out how many pizzas Maddy will need, we first need to calculate the total number of people attending the soccer game. There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, so the total number of people from the team and coaches is 12 + 3 = 15. Each team member brings 2 guests, so the total number of guests is 12 * 2 = 24. The total number of people attending the game is 15 (team and coaches) + 24 (guests) = 39.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, we need to divide the total number of people by 3 to find out how many pizzas are needed. 39 / 3 = 13. 

Now, we know that Maddy needs 13 pizzas. Each pizza costs $15, so the total cost will be 13 * 15 = $195.

"To find the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace, we first need to calculate the total space occupied by the topaz gemstones and the remaining space that will be filled by the silver beads.

Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and there are 8 gemstones per necklace. So, the total space occupied by the gemstones is 8 inches.

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches. To find the remaining space for the silver beads, we subtract the space occupied by the gemstones from the total length of the necklace:

25 inches (total length) - 8 inches (space occupied by gemstones) = 17 inches

Each silver bead is 1/4 inch long. To find the number of silver beads that can fit in the remaining space, we divide the remaining space by the length of each bead:

17 inches / (1/4 inch) = 17 / 0.25 = 68

"To find the total number of stories written in the first week, we need to add the number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot.

Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week.
Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week.
Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week.

Total stories in the first week = 20 + 40 + 60 = 120

In the second week, each of them doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week. 

Alani doubled her stories from 20 to 20 * 2 = 40.
Braylen doubled his stories from 40 to 40 * 2 = 80.
Margot doubled her stories from 60 to 60 * 2 = 120.

Total stories in the second week = 40 + 80 + 120 = 240

To find the total number of stories written altogether, we need to add the total number of stories written in the first week and the second week.

Total stories = 120 + 240 = 360

The final answer is: 360"
"To find the current age of Ann's brother, we need to multiply Ann's age by 2. 

Ann's age is 9 years, so her brother's current age is 9 * 2 = 18 years.

In 3 years, Ann's brother will be 18 + 3 = 21 years old.

"To find out how many cents Kelly has left, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has and subtract the cost of the can of pop.

Kelly has 5 quarters, which is equivalent to 5 x 25 cents = 125 cents. She also has 2 dimes, which is equivalent to 2 x 10 cents = 20 cents. 

The total amount of money Kelly has is 125 cents + 20 cents = 145 cents.

Now, we subtract the cost of the can of pop, which is 55 cents, from the total amount of money Kelly has: 145 cents - 55 cents = 90 cents.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the number of rows of 5-star stars, we first need to determine the total number of stars in the flag. We know that there are three rows of 8 stars and two rows of 6 stars. 

The total number of stars in the 8-star rows is 3 * 8 = 24 stars.
The total number of stars in the 6-star rows is 2 * 6 = 12 stars.

The total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows is 24 + 12 = 36 stars.

Since the flag has 76 stars in total, the number of stars in the 5-star rows is 76 - 36 = 40 stars.

Now, we need to find the number of rows of 5-star stars. To do this, we divide the total number of stars in the 5-star rows by 5.

Number of rows of 5-star stars = 40 / 5 = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the number of trucks needed, we need to calculate the total weight of the flagstones and divide it by the weight capacity of each truck.

First, let's find the total weight of the flagstones: 
80 flagstones * 75 pounds per flagstone = 6000 pounds

Now, let's divide the total weight by the weight capacity of each truck:
6000 pounds / 2000 pounds per truck = 3

So, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

The final answer is: 3"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the speed of the car in the slow lane. Since it's traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, we can calculate it as follows:

Speed of the car in the fast lane = 60 miles/hour
Speed of the car in the slow lane = 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour

Now, we know the distance covered by both cars is the same, which is 480 miles. We can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed to find the time taken by the car in the slow lane.

Time taken by the car in the slow lane = Distance / Speed
= 480 miles / 30 miles/hour
= 16 hours

The final answer is: 16"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem.

Ali has 22 medals. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.

Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

It's given that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have. Let's represent the total number of medals given out as 'x'. Then, we can write the equation:

39 = x / 10

To find 'x', we multiply both sides of the equation by 10:

x = 39 * 10
x = 390

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is 390.

The final answer is: 390"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of chocolate bars available. Since each packet contains 5 chocolate bars and there are 8 packets, the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

We know that each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, and there are 4 adults. So, the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 * 6 = 24.

Now, we need to find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children. This can be calculated by subtracting the number of chocolate bars given to adults from the total number of chocolate bars: 40 - 24 = 16.

Since there are 8 children, and the remaining chocolate bars are to be shared equally among them, we divide the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children: 16 / 8 = 2.

Therefore, each child will get 2 chocolate bars.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much Susan earns, we need to calculate the total time she works and then multiply it by her hourly wage.

First, let's find the total time she works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total time.

3 hours (working time) - 0.5 hours (pause time) = 2.5 hours

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to convert the total working time to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Now, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes:

150 minutes / 10 minutes/interval = 15 intervals

Since she earns $5 per interval, we multiply the number of intervals by her earnings per interval:

15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

So, Susan earns $75 for the online task.

The final answer is: $75"
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the points each player has after the third round and then add the extra points they receive in the fourth round.

After the third round, Mike has 21 points. 
Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

Now, let's add the extra points for the fourth round. 
Mike has 21 points, so he gets 0 extra points (since 21 is not over 20).
Jim has 18 points, so he gets 0 extra points (since 18 is not over 20).
Tony has 42 points, so he gets 1 extra point (since 42 is over 20).

Now, let's calculate the total points after the extra points have been distributed:
Mike has 21 + 0 = 21 points.
Jim has 18 + 0 = 18 points.
Tony has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

The total points of all three players is 21 + 18 + 43 = 82.

The final answer is: 82"
"To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we first need to determine how many oranges the sons washed. The oldest son is 8 years old, and the youngest son is half as old as the oldest, so the youngest son is 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

The oldest son washes 8 oranges, and the youngest son washes 4 oranges. In total, they wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

Will bought 15 oranges, and 12 were washed. To find out how many are left unwashed, we subtract the number of oranges washed from the total number of oranges: 15 - 12 = 3.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the total count of activities, we need to calculate the number of exercises done on each day and then add them together.

On the first day, Darren does:
- 100 pushups
- 50 squats
- 20 dumbbell presses

Total exercises on the first day = 100 + 50 + 20 = 170

On the second day, Darren does:
- 20 more pushups than the first day, so 100 + 20 = 120 pushups
- 10 fewer squats than the first day, so 50 - 10 = 40 squats
- Doubles the number of dumbbell presses, so 20 * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses

Total exercises on the second day = 120 + 40 + 40 = 200

Total exercises in two days = 170 + 200 = 370

The final answer is: 370"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day and then divide the total amount of rice available by this daily consumption.

First, let's calculate the daily consumption of rice. Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day (lunch and dinner). So, the daily consumption per person is 0.2 kg/meal * 2 meals = 0.4 kg/day.

Since there are 5 members in the household who eat rice every lunch and dinner, the total daily consumption is 0.4 kg/day * 5 people = 2 kg/day.

Now, let's calculate how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last. We can do this by dividing the total amount of rice available (42 kg) by the daily consumption (2 kg/day).

42 kg / 2 kg/day = 21 days

Since we want to know how many weeks the rice will last, we need to convert the number of days to weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so we can divide the number of days by 7.

21 days / 7 days/week = 3 weeks

Therefore, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we first need to calculate the total number of crates he sold in the week. 

Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he sold bread for 5 days. 

He sold 20 crates over the weekend, which is 2 days. 
He sold 15 crates on Tuesday, 12 crates on Wednesday, and 18 crates on Thursday.

Total crates sold = 20 (weekend) + 15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday) 
Total crates sold = 65

Since Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, he had 5 working days. His target for the week was 120 crates, but he had 6 days to achieve it (including the weekend). 

To find the target for 5 working days, we need to calculate the target per day and then multiply it by 5. 

Target per day = 120 / 6 
Target per day = 20 

Target for 5 working days = 20 * 5 
Target for 5 working days = 100 

Now, we can find out how many crates Sam was off from his target for the week. 

Crates off target = Target for 5 working days - Total crates sold 
Crates off target = 100 - 65 
Crates off target = 35 

The final answer is: 35"
"To find the total cost of the desk, we need to determine the last bid made by Carmen. 

The initial bid is $200. Three other people bid once, and Carmen bids after each of them. This means there are 3 additional bids made by the other people, and Carmen bids 4 times (after each of the 3 people and one more time to win). 

Each bid increases by $50. So, the total increase in the bid is (3 + 4) * $50 = 7 * $50 = $350.

The last bid made by Carmen is the initial bid plus the total increase, which is $200 + $350 = $550.

The final answer is: $550"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to find the total miles driven per year, the total cost per year for the miles driven, and the total bonus per year.

First, let's find the total miles driven per year. Since John goes to work 30 miles away and back each day, the total miles driven per day is 30 * 2 = 60 miles. He goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year, so the total miles driven per year is 60 * 5 * 50 = 15,000 miles.

The cost per mile is $2, so the total cost per year for the miles driven is 15,000 * $2 = $30,000.

John also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus per year is $150 * 12 = $1,800.

The total cost per year for driving is the sum of the total cost for the miles driven and the total bonus, which is $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

The final numerical answer is: $31,800"
"To find out how many minutes Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to add the minutes he exercised on both days. 

Monday: 16 minutes
Sunday: 23 minutes
Combined: 16 + 23 = 39 minutes

Since Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we need to multiply the combined minutes by 2.

Combined minutes: 39
Twice the combined minutes: 39 * 2 = 78 minutes

Therefore, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal.

The final answer is: 78"
"To determine the number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider the folding process. 

When a piece of paper is folded vertically, it creates two layers: the front and the back. 

In a standard tabloid, the pages are arranged in a way that the first page is on the left back, the second page is on the left front, the 32nd page is on the right back, and the 31st page is on the right front. 

This means that each piece of paper can accommodate two pages, one on the front and one on the back. 

Since there are 32 pages in total, we need 32 / 2 = 16 pieces of paper to accommodate all the pages.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much money Annika has left, we need to calculate the amount she spent on food and snacks, and then subtract that from the initial amount she brought.

Annika spent half of $50 on food and snacks, which is $50 / 2 = $25.

She also spent an additional $10 on rides.

So, the total amount she spent is $25 (food and snacks) + $10 (rides) = $35.

Now, let's subtract the total amount she spent from the initial amount she brought: $50 (initial amount) - $35 (total spent) = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we first need to determine how many books she sold in the first year. 

Let's denote the number of books sold in the current year as 'x'. Since she sold twice as many books in the first year, the number of books sold in the first year is 2x.

We know that the total number of books sold in the first two years is the sum of the books sold in the first year and the current year, which is 2x + x = 3x. 

We also know that there are 50 unsold books, and the total number of books is 250. So, the total number of books sold is 250 - 50 = 200.

Since the total number of books sold is 3x, we can set up the equation 3x = 200. Solving for x, we get x = 200 / 3 = 66.67. However, since the number of books cannot be a fraction, we can assume that Elise sold 67 books in the current year (rounding up from 66.67).

Now, we know that Elise sold 2x books in the first year, which is 2 * 67 = 134 books.

The total amount of money earned in the first year is 134 * 20 = 2680 dollars.

The total amount of money earned in the second year is 45 * 20 = 900 dollars.

However, the question asks for the total amount of money earned in the second year, not the number of books sold. Therefore, the answer is 900.

The final answer is: $900"
"To calculate Watson's total earnings for April, we need to calculate his daily earnings, weekly earnings, and then multiply it by the number of weeks in April.

Watson works 10 hours a day and earns $10 per hour, so his daily earnings are:
10 hours/day * $10/hour = $100/day

Since Watson works 5 days a week, his weekly earnings are:
$100/day * 5 days/week = $500/week

In April, there are 4 weeks. If the company performed very well for the whole month, Watson gets a $300 bonus each week. So, his total weekly earnings for April are:
$500/week + $300/week = $800/week

Now, we multiply his total weekly earnings by the number of weeks in April:
$800/week * 4 weeks = $3200

The final answer is: $3200"

"To find out how many loaves are sold in the afternoon, we first need to determine how many loaves are left after the morning sales. 

The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. 

Two-thirds of 60 is calculated as (2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves. 

So, 40 loaves are sold in the morning. 

Now, we need to find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales. 

The total number of loaves produced is 60, and 40 are sold in the morning. 

60 - 40 = 20 loaves are left.

Half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening. 

Half of 20 is calculated as (1/2) * 20 = 10 loaves.

Since the remaining loaves are divided equally between the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is 10.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much weight Joey loses per week and then multiply that by the number of weeks it takes Sandy to lose the same amount of weight.

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. To find out how much weight Joey loses per week, we divide the total weight lost by the number of weeks:

Weight lost per week = Total weight lost / Number of weeks
Weight lost per week = 8 pounds / 4 weeks
Weight lost per week = 2 pounds per week

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, we multiply the weight lost per week by the number of weeks it takes Sandy:

Total weight lost = Weight lost per week * Number of weeks
Total weight lost = 2 pounds/week * 4 weeks
Total weight lost = 8 pounds

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, the answer is 4 weeks.

"To find the total savings, we need to calculate the savings on the tubs of ice cream and the packets of milk separately and then add them together.

The original price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 * $13 = $26. The discounted price of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 * $11 = $22. The savings on 2 tubs of ice cream is $26 - $22 = $4.

The original price of 4 packets of milk is 4 * $1 = $4. The discounted price of 4 packets of milk is 4 * ($1 - $0.5) = 4 * $0.5 = $2. The savings on 4 packets of milk is $4 - $2 = $2.

The total savings is $4 + $2 = $6.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and legs grown after 15 days.

The serum grows an extra arm every 3 days. To find out how many arms are grown in 15 days, we divide 15 by 3. 

15 / 3 = 5

So, the person will grow 5 extra arms.

The serum grows an extra leg every 5 days. To find out how many legs are grown in 15 days, we divide 15 by 5.

15 / 5 = 3

So, the person will grow 3 extra legs.

To find the total number of new limbs, we add the number of extra arms and legs.

5 (extra arms) + 3 (extra legs) = 8

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount spent by Theo on the business suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket, and then subtract this amount from the total amount he has, and then subtract the amount he wishes to save.

First, let's calculate the cost of the business suits:
6 suits * $100 each = $600

Next, let's calculate the cost of the suitcases:
3 suitcases * $50 each = $150

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket. The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit:
Cost of a business suit = $100
5 times the cost of a business suit = 5 * $100 = $500
Cost of the flight ticket = $500 + $700 = $1200

Now, let's calculate the total amount spent by Theo:
Total amount spent = Cost of suits + Cost of suitcases + Cost of flight ticket
Total amount spent = $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950

Now, let's calculate the amount left after subtracting the total amount spent from the total amount Theo has:
Amount left = $6000 - $1950 = $4050

Now, let's subtract the amount Theo wishes to save from the amount left:
Amount left for gifts = $4050 - $2000 = $2050

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a day and then multiply it by 7 to get the total number of eggs consumed in a week.

First, let's find out how many people eat 3 eggs each day and how many people eat 2 eggs each day. 

There are 5 people in the family, and 3 people eat 3 eggs each day. So, the number of people eating 3 eggs each day is 3. The remaining people eat 2 eggs each day, which is 5 - 3 = 2 people.

Now, let's calculate the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a day. 

The 3 people eating 3 eggs each day will consume 3 * 3 = 9 eggs. The 2 people eating 2 eggs each day will consume 2 * 2 = 4 eggs. 

So, the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a day is 9 + 4 = 13 eggs.

To find the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7. 

13 eggs/day * 7 days = 91 eggs

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find Noah's current age. Since Cera is 46 years old now, six years ago, Cera was 40 years old. We are given that six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. So, Noah's age six years ago was 40 / 2 = 20 years.

Now, we know that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, the population of Chile six years ago was 20 * 3000 = 60,000.

We are also given that the population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now. So, the current population of Chile is 60,000 * 2 = 120,000.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of players on the defense as D. 

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2D.

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is D/2.

We know that the total number of players on the team is 105. Therefore, the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams is equal to 105:

D + 2D + D/2 = 105

To simplify the equation, we can multiply all terms by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2D + 4D + D = 210

Combine like terms:

7D = 210

Now, divide both sides by 7:

D = 210 / 7
D = 30

"To find the total number of people invited, we first need to calculate the number of people from the 2 families with 6 people and the 3 families with 4 people.

For the 2 families with 6 people, the total number of people is 2 * 6 = 12.
For the 3 families with 4 people, the total number of people is 3 * 4 = 12.
The total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.

However, 8 people couldn't come due to illness. So, we subtract 8 from the total number of people invited: 24 - 8 = 16.

Now, 1/4 of the people who couldn't come due to illness had previous commitments. 1/4 of 8 is 2. So, we subtract 2 from the number of people who couldn't come due to illness: 8 - 2 = 6.

The total number of people who couldn't come is 6. We subtract this from the total number of people invited: 24 - 6 = 18.

"To find the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store, we need to calculate the total number of marbles first.

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and added them to a store that had 50. So, the total number of marbles in the store after buying from Johanna is 20 + 50 = 70.

His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna, his father gave him 2/5 * 20 = 8 marbles.

Now, the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store is 70 (initial marbles) + 20 (bought from Johanna) + 8 (given by his father) = 98 marbles.

Each marble weighs 2kgs, so the total weight of marbles is 98 * 2 = 196 kgs.

Given that there are 30 boys, and the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:
Girls = 3 * Boys = 3 * 30 = 90

Next, we are given that there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys. To find the number of nongendered children, we can multiply the number of boys by 1/10:
Nongendered children = 1/10 * Boys = 1/10 * 30 = 3

Now, we can find the total number of children by adding the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
Total children = Boys + Girls + Nongendered children = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123

Let's denote the total number of people as 'x'. Since 1/4 of the people left, 3/4 of the people stayed. We can set up the equation:

3/4 * x = 22 + (number of women who stayed)

We know that the total number of people at the beginning was 25 men + 15 women = 40 people. So, x = 40.

Now, we can substitute x = 40 into the equation:

3/4 * 40 = 22 + (number of women who stayed)

30 = 22 + (number of women who stayed)

Subtract 22 from both sides:

8 = (number of women who stayed)

Since there were 15 women at the beginning, we can find the number of women who left:

15 - 8 = 7 women left

The total number of women who stayed is 8."
"To find the cost of the pen, we need to first determine the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book, and the book costs $4, the magazine costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, we know that the pen costs $1 less than the magazine. So, the cost of the pen is $2 - $1 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To find the total number of pencils Jam has, we know she has 3 boxes and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils. Since we know the number of loose pencils, we can find the number of pencils in the boxes by subtracting the loose pencils from the total: 26 - 2 = 24 pencils in the boxes.

Since each box contains an equal number of pencils, we can divide the total number of pencils in the boxes by the number of boxes to find the number of pencils in each box: 24 / 3 = 8 pencils per box.

Now, we know Jam has 24 pencils in 3 boxes, and Meg has 46 pencils. To find the total number of pencils, we add the number of pencils Jam and Meg have: 24 + 46 = 70 pencils.

To find the number of boxes needed to store all the pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils per box: 70 / 8 = 8.75. Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we round up to the nearest whole number to ensure all pencils fit. Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

The final answer is: 9"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total weakening effect of the ice cubes and the added cream.

First, let's calculate the number of ice cubes needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, so the number of ice cubes needed is:

65 / 13 = 5

Since each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, 5 ice cubes will make it 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters weaker.

Next, we need to consider the effect of adding 15 milliliters of cream. Since any added liquid weakens the coffee, the total weakening effect of the cream is 15 milliliters.

Now, we add the weakening effects of the ice cubes and the cream to get the total weakening effect:

60 milliliters (from ice cubes) + 15 milliliters (from cream) = 75 milliliters

The final answer is: 75"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the trade ratio. The given ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record. This means that for every 2 old records, 1 new record is given.

Since 5 people come in and leave with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of new records as 7. However, we need to find out how many old records were traded for these new records.

Let's use the ratio to set up an equation. If 2 old records are traded for 1 new record, then the total number of old records traded for 7 new records can be calculated as follows:

2 old records / 1 new record = x old records / 7 new records

To find the value of x, we can cross-multiply:

2 * 7 = 1 * x
14 = x

However, this is the number of old records traded for 1 new record. Since there are 5 people, and each person is trading, we need to multiply this number by 5 to get the total number of old records brought in:

14 * 5 = 70

So, the 5 people brought in a total of 70 old records.

The final answer is: 70"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of junior programmers and the number of senior programmers. 

The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, which is 100. So, the number of junior programmers is 2/5 * 100 = 40.

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers is 100 - 40 = 60.

The junior programmers are each paid $2000 per month, so the total amount paid to junior programmers is 40 * $2000 = $80,000.

Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so they are paid $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month.

The total amount paid to senior programmers is 60 * $2400 = $144,000.

The total amount paid to all programmers is the sum of the amount paid to junior programmers and senior programmers, which is $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

The final answer is: $224,000"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as 'x'.

Initially, there were x people on the bus.

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the total number of people became x + 5.

At the second bus stop, 7 people got down, so the total number of people became (x + 5) - 7 = x - 2.

Then, 8 more people got in, so the total number of people became (x - 2) + 8 = x + 6.

We are given that the total number of people heading to the third stop is 20, so we can set up the equation:

x + 6 = 20

To solve for x, we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:

x = 20 - 6
x = 14

The final answer is: 14"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops and eats 2 on his way to school. So, he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left.

2. He passes 14 out to his friends, so now he has 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops left.

3. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now, he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.

4. He eats 3 more lollipops that night, so he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops left.

5. He eats 2 more lollipops in the morning, so he has 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops left.

"To find the time it takes to fully charge the phone, we need to first determine how many percentage points are left to charge. Since the phone is already at 60% charged, it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more to be fully charged.

Given that the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time it takes to charge the remaining 40% as follows:

40 percentage points / 1 percentage point per 3 minutes = 40 * 3 minutes

40 * 3 = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we need to first calculate the total number of lollipops she has after her mother gives her 10 more. 

Erin initially has 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her 10 more, so Erin now has 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops.

Then, Erin gives 3 lollipops to Ella. To find out how many lollipops Erin has left, we subtract 3 from 17: 17 - 3 = 14.

So, Erin has 14 lollipops left.

The final answer is: 14"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip, apply the rewards and the coupon to the current shopping trip, and then find the final amount paid.

The customer spent $80 on their last shopping trip, which means they earned $80 / $20 = 4 rewards. 

On this shopping trip, they spent $43 and used their rewards. Since they had 4 rewards, they used $4 off the price. 

The coupon took twice the amount of rewards off the price, which is 2 * $4 = $8. 

So, the total discount applied is $4 (from rewards) + $8 (from the coupon) = $12.

The final amount paid is $43 (price) - $12 (discount) = $31.

The final answer is: $31"
"To determine which job pays more, we need to calculate the net pay for each job.

For Job A, the total income is $15/hour * 2000 hours/year = $30,000/year. The state tax rate is 20%, so the tax amount is $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000. The net pay for Job A is $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

For Job B, the total income is $42,000. The property tax is $6,000, so the net income before taxes is $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000. The state tax rate is 10%, so the tax amount is $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600. The net pay for Job B is $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

To find the difference in net pay between the two jobs, we subtract the net pay of Job A from the net pay of Job B: $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

The final answer is: $8,400"
"To find the number of unmanned ruined castles, we first need to find the total number of ruined castles. 

40% of the castles are ruins, so we multiply 220 by 0.4 to find the number of ruined castles: 
220 * 0.4 = 88

Since half of the ruined castles are unmanned, we divide the total number of ruined castles by 2:
88 / 2 = 44

So, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland.

The final answer is: 44"
"To find the total cost of each offer, we need to calculate the total amount paid in advance and the total amount paid in monthly installments.

Furniture United's offer:
- Advance payment: $1,350

"To find out how many guns each person would have if they were to share them equally, we first need to find the total number of guns. 

DJ has 8 guns, Nick has 10 guns, RJ has 1 gun, and Richard has 5 guns. 

Total number of guns = 8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24

Now, we need to divide the total number of guns by the number of people. There are 4 people in total.

Number of people = 4

Guns per person = Total number of guns / Number of people

"To find the final value of Maria's shares, we need to calculate the stock price after the first year and then after the second year.

Initially, Maria buys 8 shares for $8 each, so the total cost is 8 * 8 = $64.

The stock price increases by 50% in the first year. To find the new price, we multiply the original price by 1.5 (100% + 50% = 150%, or 1 + 0.5 = 1.5). 

New price after the first year = $8 * 1.5 = $12.

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. To find the new price, we multiply the price after the first year by 0.75 (100% - 25% = 75%, or 1 - 0.25 = 0.75).

New price after the second year = $12 * 0.75 = $9.

Now, we multiply the new price after the second year by the number of shares to find the final value of Maria's shares.

Final value = 8 * $9 = $72.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of students in the two equal groups as 'x'. Since the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the smallest group is 'x - 10'.

We know that the total number of students in the class is 200, and the sum of the students in all three groups is equal to 200. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combine like terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Add 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 70

Since the smallest group has 'x - 10' students, we can find the number of students in the smallest group by subtracting 10 from x:

x - 10 = 70 - 10
= 60

The final answer is: 60"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of chickens and cows on the farm. Let's denote the number of cows as 'c' and the number of chickens as '2c', since Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows.

We know that the total number of animals is 60, so we can set up the equation: c + 2c = 60. Combining like terms, we get 3c = 60. Dividing both sides by 3, we find that c = 20. This means there are 20 cows and 2c = 40 chickens.

Now, we need to calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. The total number of legs is (20 * 4) + (40 * 2) = 80 + 80 = 160.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the weights of the other animals and then add them to the weight of the container.

Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can set up the following equations based on the given information:

1. The blue beetle weighs the same as the pink frog: 
   Blue beetle = 50 pounds

2. The green toad also weighs the same as the pink frog:
   Green toad = 50 pounds

3. The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog:
   Yellow snake = 50 + 10 = 60 pounds

4. The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog:
   Red bird = 50 - 20 = 30 pounds

Now, we can find the total weight of the animals by adding their weights:
Total weight of animals = Pink frog + Blue beetle + Green toad + Yellow snake + Red bird
Total weight of animals = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 240 pounds

Finally, we add the weight of the container to the total weight of the animals:
Total weight = Total weight of animals + Container weight
Total weight = 240 + 20 = 260 pounds

Her son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, so the total number of cookies her son eats is 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so the total number of cookies her husband eats is 1 * 7 = 7 cookies.

The total number of cookies used by her son and her husband is 20 + 7 = 27 cookies.

Since each bag has 36 cookies, and 27 cookies are used by her son and her husband, the number of cookies left for Jenny is 36 - 27 = 9 cookies.

Therefore, Jenny eats 9 cookies.

"To find the percentage increase in the amount of money the factory is making per day, we need to first calculate the difference in the amount of money they are making per day now and the amount they used to make.

The factory used to make $100 per tractor and sold 10 tractors a day, so they made $100 * 10 = $1000 per day.

Now, they make $220 per silo and sell 5 silos a day, so they make $220 * 5 = $1100 per day.

The difference in the amount of money they are making per day now and the amount they used to make is $1100 - $1000 = $100.

To find the percentage increase, we divide the difference by the original amount and multiply by 100:

"To find the total time John spent, we need to calculate the time he spent boating, swimming, and watching shows. 

First, let's find the time he spent swimming. Since he spent half the time swimming as he did boating, and he spent 6 hours boating, he spent 6 / 2 = 3 hours swimming.

Next, let's find the total time he spent watching shows. He watched 3 shows, each 2 hours long, so he spent 3 * 2 = 6 hours watching shows.

Now, we know that the time he spent watching shows is 30% of his total time. Let's call his total time 'T'. Then, 30% of T is 6 hours. We can write this as 0.3T = 6.

To find T, we divide both sides by 0.3: T = 6 / 0.3 = 20 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the activities and then subtract that from Morgan's budget to find out how much money is left for her friends. 

The cost of mini-golf for Morgan and her friends is $5 per round. Since they will play one round, the total cost for mini-golf is $5. 

The cost of the arcade tokens is $5. 

The cost of riding the go-karts twice is 2 * $10 = $20.

The total cost of the activities is $5 (mini-golf) + $5 (arcade tokens) + $20 (go-karts) = $30.

Morgan's budget is $90. To find out how much money is left for her friends, we subtract the total cost of the activities from her budget: $90 - $30 = $60.

Since each friend will not be charged for the activities, the $60 is the amount that can be used to buy something for her friends. However, the question asks for the number of friends she can invite, not the amount of money she can spend on them. 

Since the problem does not specify what she can buy for her friends, we will assume that she can invite as many friends as the budget allows, assuming each friend will get $0. 

The number of friends she can invite is $60 / $0 = infinity. However, this is not a realistic answer, as it is not possible to invite an infinite number of friends. 

A more realistic answer would be to assume that the $60 is for food or other expenses for her friends. In this case, we can assume that each friend will get $0.50 (a reasonable amount for food or other expenses). 

The number of friends she can invite is $60 / $0.50 = 120."

So, the change he has after buying the candy is 10 - 1.5x.

Next, he takes half of this change and spends it on gumballs. Since each gumball costs $0.05, the total cost of the gumballs is 0.05 * (1/2) * (10 - 1.5x) = 0.025 * (10 - 1.5x).

We are given that he bought 40 gumballs, so the total cost of the gumballs is 0.05 * 40 = $2.

Now, we can set up an equation to solve for x:

0.025 * (10 - 1.5x) = 2

To solve for x, we can start by dividing both sides by 0.025:

10 - 1.5x = 80

Next, we can subtract 10 from both sides:

-1.5x = 70

Now, we can divide both sides by -1.5:

x = -70 / 1.5
x = -46.67

However, since we can't buy a negative amount of candy, this solution is not valid. Let's re-examine the problem.

We know that Billy spent $2 on gumballs, which is half of his change. So, his change after buying the candy is 2 * 2 = $4.

The change he has after buying the candy is 10 - 1.5x = 4.

Now, we can solve for x:

10 - 1.5x = 4

Subtracting 10 from both sides:

-1.5x = -6

Dividing both sides by -1.5:

x = 4

So, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the age of Carver's son, we need to first determine Carver's age and then calculate twice that age. 

Let's denote Carver's age as C and his son's age as S. We are given that C = 45. 

We are also given that C = 2S - 5. 

Substituting C = 45 into the equation, we get:
45 = 2S - 5

To solve for S, we need to isolate S on one side of the equation. We can do this by adding 5 to both sides:
45 + 5 = 2S - 5 + 5
50 = 2S

Next, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for S:
50 / 2 = 2S / 2
25 = S

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the total distance the train travels in one trip, we need to add the distances between the three cities. The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles, and the distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles. 

The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs, which is 75 + 100 = 175 miles. So, the distance from the third city to the first city is 175 - 50 = 125 miles.

The total distance for one trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles.

To find out how many days the train goes between services, we need to divide the total distance the train can travel before needing service (18,000 miles) by the total distance it travels in a day (900 miles).

18,000 / 900 = 20 days.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the amount of stuffing needed for the collie beds, we first need to calculate the average amount of stuffing between the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds. 

The average amount of stuffing is (8 + 2) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for the chihuahua beds: 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.

Next, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for the collie beds: 3 * 5 = 15 pounds.

Finally, we add the total amount of stuffing needed for the chihuahua beds and the collie beds: 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total time taken for the trip, we need to calculate the time taken for each part of the trip and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time taken for the trip to his friend's house. The distance is 200 miles and the speed is 70 mph. 

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 200 miles / 70 mph
Time = 2.857 hours (approximately)

However, he had to take a detour that added 10 miles to his trip. So, the actual distance traveled to his friend's house is 200 + 10 = 210 miles. 

Time taken for the detour = 10 miles / 70 mph
Time taken for the detour = 0.143 hours (approximately)

Total time taken to reach his friend's house = 2.857 hours + 0.143 hours
Total time taken to reach his friend's house = 3 hours

Now, let's calculate the time taken for the trip back home. The distance is 240 miles and the speed is 80 mph.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 240 miles / 80 mph
Time = 3 hours

Total time taken for the trip = Time taken to reach his friend's house + Time taken for the trip back home
Total time taken for the trip = 3 hours + 3 hours
Total time taken for the trip = 6 hours

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we first need to find the total number of students present on Friday. 

Total number of fourth-graders = 96
Number of girls = 43
Number of boys = Total number of fourth-graders - Number of girls
Number of boys = 96 - 43 = 53

Now, we know that 4 fourth-grade boys were absent on Friday. To find the number of boys present, we subtract the number of absent boys from the total number of boys.

Number of boys present = Number of boys - Number of absent boys
Number of boys present = 53 - 4
Number of boys present = 49

The final answer is: 49"
"To find the total number of kids in the park, we first need to determine the number of boys. Since there are twice the number of boys as girls, and there are 6 girls, we can calculate the number of boys by multiplying the number of girls by 2.

Number of boys = 2 * Number of girls
Number of boys = 2 * 6
Number of boys = 12

Now, to find the total number of kids in the park, we add the number of girls and the number of boys.

Total number of kids = Number of girls + Number of boys
Total number of kids = 6 + 12
Total number of kids = 18

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as M, the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting as S, and the number of customers kicked out for physical violence as V.

We are given that M = 3.

We are also given that the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting (S) equals four times the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks minus 5. So, S = 4M - 5 = 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7.

We are also given that the number of customers kicked out for physical violence (V) is three times the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting. So, V = 3S = 3(7) = 21.

We are given that a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart. The total number of people kicked out is the sum of the people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence. So, M + S + V = 50.

Substituting the values we found earlier, we get 3 + 7 + 21 = 31.

Since the total number of people kicked out is 50, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is 50 - 31 = 19.

The final answer is: 19"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many points Erin has after scoring 14 points. We know that Erin now has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8. 

Let's denote the number of points Erin had before scoring 14 points as x. After scoring 14 points, Erin will have x + 14 points. Since Erin now has three times more points than Sara, we can set up the equation:

x + 14 = 3 * 8

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 14 = 24

Subtracting 14 from both sides of the equation, we get:

x = 10

So, Erin had 10 points before scoring 14 points.

The final answer is: 10"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to break down the expenses into different categories.

First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames. Each picture frame costs $20, and the logo etching costs an additional 20% of the frame's cost. 

20% of $20 is 0.20 * $20 = $4. 
So, the total cost of each picture frame with the logo etching is $20 + $4 = $24.

Since there are 44 seniors, the total cost of the picture frames is 44 * $24 = $1056.

Next, 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each. The total cost of the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the cords for the officers. 1/4 of the seniors are officers, which is 44 / 4 = 11 officers. The cost of the cords for the officers is 11 * $12 = $132.

The total cost of the senior gifts is the sum of the costs of the picture frames, pins, and cords: $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

The final numerical answer is: $1198"
"To find the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we first need to calculate the materials cost. Since the original price of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400 and making it yourself saves 20%, we can calculate the materials cost as follows:

Original price = $400
Savings = 20% of $400 = 0.20 * $400 = $80
Materials cost = Original price - Savings = $400 - $80 = $320

So, the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper is $320.

"To find the total number of tennis shoes sold, we need to calculate the number of shoes sold each day and then add them together.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes they sold on Friday, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the amount they did the day before, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, six people returned their pairs because they didn't fit, so we need to subtract those from the total number of shoes sold on Sunday. 14 - 6 = 8 pairs.

Now, let's add up the total number of shoes sold: 14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 8 (Sunday) = 50 pairs.

Since each pair has 2 shoes, we multiply the total number of pairs by 2 to get the total number of shoes sold: 50 * 2 = 100.

"To find the total amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we first need to find the value of the faulty pieces and subtract it from the total amount spent.

The total amount spent is $400,000. 
The value of the faulty pieces is 40% of $400,000. 
40% can be written as 0.4 in decimal form. 
So, the value of the faulty pieces is 0.4 * $400,000 = $160,000.

Now, we subtract the value of the faulty pieces from the total amount spent to find the value of the functioning pieces:
$400,000 - $160,000 = $240,000.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many apples Lucy picked on Monday, then add the apples picked on Tuesday and Wednesday.

Let's start by finding out how many apples Lucy picked on Monday. Since she sold all the apples picked on Monday and made $56 at $4 per apple, we can divide the total amount of money by the price per apple to find the number of apples picked on Monday.

Apples picked on Monday = Total money made / Price per apple
Apples picked on Monday = $56 / $4
Apples picked on Monday = 14

Now, we know that Lucy picked 12 apples on Tuesday. On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she did the previous day, which is 2 * 12 = 24 apples.

Total apples picked over the three days = Apples picked on Monday + Apples picked on Tuesday + Apples picked on Wednesday
Total apples picked over the three days = 14 + 12 + 24
Total apples picked over the three days = 50

"To find the monthly payment, we need to calculate the total interest paid over the five months and then divide it by the number of months.

The formula for simple interest is: Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

Given:
Principal (P) = $3,650
Rate (R) = 10% or 0.10
Time (T) = 5 months

Interest = P * R * T
= $3,650 * 0.10 * 5

Now, we need to find the total amount Karan has to pay, which is the principal plus the interest.
Total Amount = Principal + Interest
= $3,650 + $1,825
= $5,475

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month for 5 months, we divide the total amount by the number of months:
Monthly Payment = Total Amount / Number of Months
= $5,475 / 5

"To find the total profit per hour, we need to first calculate the total revenue and the total cost.

Millie buys supplies for $18 to make 3 pitchers of lemonade. Each pitcher holds 12 cups, so she makes a total of 3 * 12 = 36 cups of lemonade.

She sells each cup of lemonade for $1, so her total revenue is 36 * $1 = $36.

Her total cost is $18.

To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the revenue: $36 - $18 = $18.

Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, we need to find out how many hours it takes her to sell all the lemonade. Since she has 36 cups, and she sells 4 cups per hour, it will take her 36 / 4 = 9 hours to sell all the lemonade.

"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to calculate the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu and add it to the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson.

First, let's find the number of messages James delivers to Mr. Yu. Since he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can multiply the number of messages to Ms. Thompson by 1/3.

Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * Messages to Ms. Thompson
Messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * 66
Messages to Mr. Yu = 22

Now, we can add the number of messages to Mr. Yu and Ms. Thompson to find the total number of messages James delivers.

Total messages = Messages to Ms. Thompson + Messages to Mr. Yu
Total messages = 66 + 22

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of the rides for both David and Dasha.

Since each ride costs 2 tickets at $2 per ticket, the cost of one ride is 2 * $2 = $4.

David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides. This means he doesn't need to buy any additional tickets for the rides. 

Dasha buys tickets for 9 rides. Since each ride costs $4, the total cost for Dasha is 9 * $4 = $36.

The total cost for Dasha is $36, and the total cost for David is $30. 

To find out how much money David saves, we subtract the cost for David from the cost for Dasha: $36 - $30 = $6.

"To find the total number of bugs, we first need to find the number of millipedes and stink bugs. 

Nancy saw 90 spiders. The number of millipedes is 1/3rd of the number of spiders, so the number of millipedes is 90 / 3 = 30.

The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12, so the number of stink bugs is 2 * 30 - 12 = 48.

Now, we add the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs to find the total number of bugs: 90 + 30 + 48 = 168.

The final answer is: 168"
"To find the difference between Alice and Erica's ages, we first need to determine Alice's age. Since Beth is 5 years older than Erica, and Erica is 30 years old, Beth's age is 30 + 5 = 35 years.

Alice is 7 years older than Beth, so Alice's age is 35 + 7 = 42 years.

The difference between Alice and Erica's ages is 42 - 30 = 12 years.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total calories consumed by John, we need to calculate the total ounces of milk he drank and then multiply it by the calories per ounce.

First, we know John drank 2 glasses of milk, and each glass is 8 ounces. So, the total ounces of milk he drank is 2 * 8 = 16 ounces.

Since milk has 3 calories per ounce, we multiply the total ounces by the calories per ounce: 16 * 3 = 48 calories.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the total amount the builder earns in a year, we first need to calculate his daily earnings and then multiply it by the total number of days he works in a year.

The builder works 4 weeks every month and 6 days every week. So, the total number of days he works in a month is 4 weeks * 6 days/week = 24 days.

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of days he works in a year is 24 days/month * 12 months/year = 288 days/year.

The builder gets paid $50 every day. Therefore, his total earnings in a year would be 288 days/year * $50/day = $14,400/year.

The final answer is: $14,400"
"To find out how many bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of flour and milk required for the quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. Since Mark is making a quadruple batch, we multiply the ingredients by 4:

- Flour: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups
- Milk: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark will need to buy:
12 cups / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags of flour

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so Mark will need to buy:
4 cups / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles of milk

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour:
6 bags of flour - 2 bottles of milk = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the energy saved, we first need to calculate the original energy consumption and the new energy consumption. 

The original energy consumption can be calculated by multiplying the power (watts) by the time (hours) and then by the number of days. 

Original energy consumption = 900 watts * 8 hours * 30 days
First, convert watts to kilowatts: 900 watts = 0.9 kilowatts
Original energy consumption = 0.9 kilowatts * 8 hours * 30 days
Original energy consumption = 0.9 * 8 * 30
Original energy consumption = 216 kilowatt-hours (kWh)

Now, let's calculate the new energy consumption after reducing the usage by 5 hours a day. 
New energy consumption = 0.9 kilowatts * (8 - 5) hours * 30 days
New energy consumption = 0.9 kilowatts * 3 hours * 30 days
New energy consumption = 0.9 * 3 * 30
New energy consumption = 81 kWh

Now, we can find the energy saved by subtracting the new energy consumption from the original energy consumption.
Energy saved = Original energy consumption - New energy consumption
Energy saved = 216 kWh - 81 kWh
Energy saved = 135 kWh

The final answer is: 135"
"To find the average number of stripes, we first need to calculate the total number of stripes and then divide it by the total number of zebras.

There are two zebras with 17 stripes each, so that's 2 * 17 = 34 stripes.
There's a zebra with 36 stripes.
There's another zebra with half the number of stripes as the third zebra, which is 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.

The total number of stripes is 34 + 36 + 18 = 88.
The total number of zebras is 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.

To find the average, we divide the total number of stripes by the total number of zebras: 88 / 4 = 22.

The final answer is: 22"
"To determine the total cost of the meat and cheese, we first need to calculate the total number of sandwiches required to serve 20 people. Since each sandwich serves 4 people, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each sandwich serves:

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, we need a total of 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

The cost of the meat is $7.00 per pound, so the total cost of the meat is:
5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00

The cost of the cheese is $3.00 per pound, so the total cost of the cheese is:
5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

The total cost of the meat and cheese is the sum of the cost of the meat and the cost of the cheese:
$35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

The final answer is: $50.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the initial number of corns and cannolis Allan has at home. 

Since Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis and he has 40 cannolis, the initial number of corns is 2 * 40 = 80.

Allan bought 60 more cannolis and 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. So, he bought 60 cannolis and 60 - 40 = 20 corns.

Now, we add the initial and the additional items to find the total number of each item. The total number of cannolis is 40 (initial) + 60 (additional) = 100. The total number of corns is 80 (initial) + 20 (additional) = 100.

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 100 (cannolis) + 100 (corns) = 200.

The final answer is: 200"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Elliott wants to walk 10,000 steps a day. He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. Since half of 10,000 is 5,000, he completed 5,000 steps on his walks to and from school.

He then did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So, the total steps he has taken so far are 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000.

After that, he went for a short jog and realized that he only had 2,000 steps left to take to reach his goal of 10,000 steps. This means that the total steps he has taken so far (6,000) plus the steps he took during his jog is equal to 10,000. 

Let's represent the steps he took during his jog as 'x'. Then, the equation becomes 6,000 + x = 10,000.

To find the value of 'x', we need to isolate it. We can do this by subtracting 6,000 from both sides of the equation:

x = 10,000 - 6,000
x = 4,000

So, Elliott took 4,000 steps during his jog.

The final answer is: 4000"
"To find out how many minutes Toby will be early, we need to calculate the total time it takes for him to read the book and travel to the airport.

First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book: 
45 pages * 200 words per page = 9000 words

Next, we'll calculate the time it takes for Toby to read the book:
9000 words / 300 words per minute = 30 minutes

Now, we'll add the time it takes to get to the airport:
30 minutes (reading time) + 10 minutes (travel time) = 40 minutes

Since Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to leave, we'll subtract the total time from the available time:
60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes

Toby will be 20 minutes early."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to first determine the number of employees and their total hours worked in each month.

In May, the company hired 40 employees. Each employee worked 40 hours per week for 4 weeks, so the total hours worked by each employee in May is 40 * 4 = 160 hours. The total amount paid to each employee in May is 160 * $15 = $2400.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 1/4 * 40 = 10 employees left. So, the remaining number of employees is 40 - 10 = 30. Each of these employees worked 160 hours in June, and the total amount paid to each employee in June is 160 * $15 = $2400.

The total amount paid to the employees in May is 40 * $2400 = $96,000. The total amount paid to the employees in June is 30 * $2400 = $72,000.

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000.

The final answer is: $168,000"
"To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The sale is ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means that the second pound is half off, which is $1.50 off. So, the cost of 2 pounds of taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the magnets. Sally bought 4 magnets at $0.25 each, so the total cost of the magnets is 4 x $0.25 = $1.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items: $4.50 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1 (magnets) = $7.

Sally started with $10, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from the initial amount: $10 - $7 = $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To find the total amount spent by Tim, we first need to calculate the cost of the two packages of fireworks and the finale firework.

The first package of fireworks costs $400. The second package costs twice as much, so it's 2 * $400 = $800.

The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Tim gets a 20% discount on the two packages. To find the discount amount, we multiply the total cost by 0.20: $1200 * 0.20 = $240.

The discount amount is subtracted from the total cost: $1200 - $240 = $960.

The finale firework costs $150. Adding this to the discounted cost of the fireworks, we get $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To determine how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we first need to calculate how many cookies she eats in 30 days. 

Since Shannon eats 2 cookies a night, we multiply the number of cookies she eats per night by the number of nights in 30 days. There are 30 nights in 30 days. 

2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies

Since Shannon wants to have enough cookies for 30 days, we need to make sure she has at least 60 cookies. 

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies needed by the number of cookies per recipe. 

60 cookies / 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozen cookies

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozen cookies to have enough for 30 days. 

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. 

First, let's find the number of candles that smell like wet dog. Since 5% of the candles have this defect, we can calculate it as follows:

Number of candles that smell like wet dog = Total number of candles * (Percentage of candles with the defect / 100)
= 50000 * (5 / 100)
= 2500

However, the problem states that these candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode. This means that 1% of the candles that smell like wet dog will explode. We can calculate the number of candles that smell like wet dog and explode as follows:

Number of candles that smell like wet dog and explode = Number of candles that smell like wet dog * (Percentage of candles that explode / 100)
= 2500 * (1 / 100)
= 25

So, the final answer is: 
25"
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we first need to find the price of each blouse after the 30% discount. 

The discount amount is 30% of the regular price, which is 0.3 * $20 = $6. 

So, the discounted price of each blouse is $20 - $6 = $14.

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses is 4 * $14 = $56.

The final answer is: $56"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathered from the tallest trees as T, from the average trees as A, and from the shortest trees as S. 

Since Joanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees, we have T = 30.

From the shortest trees, Joanne gathered half the amount she gathered from the tallest trees, so S = 30 / 2 = 15.

The total number of apples Joanne gathered is the sum of the apples from the three types of trees, so we can write the equation: T + A + S = Total apples gathered by Joanne.

We know that Joanne's sister gathered twice as many apples from the tallest trees and 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees. So, the sister gathered 2T apples from the tallest trees and 3S apples from the shortest trees.

Since the sister didn't gather any apples from the average trees, the total number of apples she gathered is 2T + 3S.

The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, so we can write the equation: T + A + S + 2T + 3S = 500.

Substituting the values of T and S, we get: 30 + A + 15 + 2(30) + 3(15) = 500.

Combine like terms: 30 + A + 15 + 60 + 45 = 500.

Combine the constants: 150 + A = 500.

Subtract 150 from both sides: A = 350.

The final answer is: 350"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D.

We know that the total number of heads is 180, and since each animal has one head, we can write the equation:

C + D = 180

We also know that the total number of bumps is 304, and since camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump, we can write the equation:

2C + D = 304

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve for C and D by subtracting the first equation from the second equation:

(2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know C, we can substitute this value into the first equation to solve for D:

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

Therefore, there are 56 dromedaries in the herd.

The final answer is: 56"
"To find the total distance traveled by Tom, we need to break down the information given.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day. So, the total distance covered in the first 4 days is 4 * 200 = 800 kilometers.

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. 30% of 800 kilometers is 0.3 * 800 = 240 kilometers. So, the total distance covered in the next two days is 240 kilometers.

On the next day, he wasn't traveling at all, so the distance covered is 0 kilometers.

During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total distance covered in the second week is 7 * 300 = 2100 kilometers.

Now, let's add up the distances covered in each period: 
- First 4 days: 800 kilometers
- Next two days: 240 kilometers
- Next day: 0 kilometers
- Second week: 2100 kilometers

Total distance = 800 + 240 + 0 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.

The final answer is: 3140"
"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to work backwards from Peter's locker size. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, Zack's locker must be 4 times as big as Peter's locker.

Let's calculate Zack's locker size:
Zack's locker size = 4 * Peter's locker size
Zack's locker size = 4 * 5 cubic inches
Zack's locker size = 20 cubic inches

Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, Timothy's locker must be twice as big as Zack's locker.

Let's calculate Timothy's locker size:
Timothy's locker size = 2 * Zack's locker size
Timothy's locker size = 2 * 20 cubic inches
Timothy's locker size = 40 cubic inches

Stanley's initial elevation: 10,000 feet
Distance the comb fell: 4,000 feet
Elevation where the comb fell: 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet

Now, we need to find the difference between the elevation where the comb fell and Oliver's elevation to determine how much Oliver needs to climb.

Elevation where the comb fell: 6,000 feet
Oliver's elevation: 3,000 feet

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

1. Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock.
2. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each. So, the total number of cats taken away is 4 * 5 = 20.
3. The remaining cats on the rock are 50 - 20 = 30.
4. Later, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find 3/5 of 30, we multiply 30 by 3/5, which is (30 * 3) / 5 = 90 / 5 = 18.
5. The number of cats that ran after the mouse is 18, so the remaining cats on the rock are 30 - 18 = 12.

"To find the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to break it down into the different pricing periods and calculate the cost for each period.

The first 6 months are $8 a month, so the cost for this period is:
6 months * $8/month = $48

The next 8 months are at the normal price of $12 a month, so the cost for this period is:
8 months * $12/month = $96

After that, the price increased to $14 a month. Since 2 years is 24 months, and we've already accounted for 14 months, there are 10 months left at the new price. The cost for this period is:
10 months * $14/month = $140

Now, let's add up the costs for each period to find the total cost for 2 years:
$48 + $96 + $140 = $284

The total cost for 2 years of the service is $284."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let the cost of the jogger jeans be x. Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, the cost of the tattered jeans is x + $6.

The total savings is $6, and Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. This means that 1/3 of the total savings is the savings from the jogger jeans, and 2/3 of the total savings is the savings from the tattered jeans.

We can set up the equation:

(1/3) * (total savings) = savings from jogger jeans
(2/3) * (total savings) = savings from tattered jeans

Since the total savings is $6, we can substitute this value into the equations:

(1/3) * $6 = savings from jogger jeans
(2/3) * $6 = savings from tattered jeans

Simplifying the equations, we get:

$2 = savings from jogger jeans
$4 = savings from tattered jeans

The cost of the jogger jeans is x, and the cost of the tattered jeans is x + $6. The savings from the jogger jeans is $2, so the original cost of the jogger jeans is $2 + $6 = $8.

The original cost of the jogger jeans is $8, and the original cost of the tattered jeans is $28. To find the difference in cost, we subtract the original cost of the tattered jeans from the original cost of the jogger jeans:

$8 - $28 = -$20

However, since we are looking for how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans, we take the absolute value of the difference:

|-20| = $20

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cards Kenny sold to get the remaining $50. Since he sold the cards for $1.5 each, we can divide the remaining money by the price per card to find the number of cards sold.

Let's denote the total number of cards as 'x'. Since Kenny keeps 1/3 of the cards, he sells 2/3 of them. The number of cards sold is 2/3 * x.

The money he gets from selling the cards is 2/3 * x * $1.5. This is equal to the remaining $50.

We can set up the equation: 2/3 * x * $1.5 = $50

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3/2 to get rid of the fraction: x * $1.5 = $50 * 3/2

x * $1.5 = $75

Now, we can divide both sides by $1.5 to find x: x = $75 / $1.5

x = 50

So, Kenny started with 50 cards.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, the caterer prepared enough hot dogs for half of the guests to have two hot dogs. Since there are 36 guests, half of them would be 36 / 2 = 18. So, the caterer prepared enough hot dogs for 18 guests to have two hot dogs each.

This means the caterer prepared 18 * 2 = 36 hot dogs for the first 18 guests. However, since the caterer prepared enough for 18 guests to have two hot dogs, the total number of hot dogs prepared is 36.

Now, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hot dog. This means that the 18 guests who were initially supposed to have two hot dogs got their second hot dog, and the remaining 22 guests (40 - 18 = 22) also got a second hot dog.

Since the caterer had prepared 36 hot dogs, and 40 guests got a second hot dog, there are not enough hot dogs for the 40th guest. This means that the 40th guest did not get a second hot dog.

"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the total cost of the items before the discount and then apply the 20% discount.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- The set of pot and pans costs $120.00
- The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00
- 5 separate utensils at $5.00 each will cost 5 x $5.00 = $25.00

The total cost of the items before the discount is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

Now, let's apply the 20% discount to the total cost:

20% of $165.00 is 0.20 x $165.00 = $33.00

The discount amount is $33.00, so we subtract this from the total cost:

$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

The final cost of Charlotte's order is $132.00.

"To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we first need to determine how much gas was in each container. Since 15 gallons were equally divided into 5 containers, we can divide 15 by 5 to find the amount in each container.

15 gallons / 5 containers = 3 gallons per container

Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we can convert the 3 gallons to pints by multiplying 3 by 8.

3 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 24 pints

Josey needed 1/4 of a container, so we need to find 1/4 of 3 gallons. To do this, we can multiply 3 by 1/4.

3 gallons * 1/4 = 0.75 gallons

Now, we convert 0.75 gallons to pints by multiplying by 8.

0.75 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 6 pints

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money George had initially. Since he had 1% of his money left after spending $5, we can set up an equation to find the initial amount.

Let's denote the initial amount as 'x'. Since 1% of 'x' is $5, we can write the equation as:

0.01x = 5

To find 'x', we can divide both sides by 0.01:

x = 5 / 0.01
x = 500

So, George initially had $500.

Now, let's find out how much he spent on chips. He bought 3 bags of chips for 40 cents each, so the total cost of chips is:

3 * 0.40 = $1.20

Since he spent $5 in total, the amount he spent on candy bars is:

5 - 1.20 = $3.80

Now, we need to find out how many candy bars he bought. Each candy bar costs 75 cents, so we can divide the total amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar:

3.80 / 0.75 = 5.07

Since we can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can buy 5 candy bars for $3.75 and still have $0.05 left, which is not enough to buy another candy bar. Therefore, George bought 5 candy bars.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many lollipops each of Ray's friends received, we first need to determine how many lollipops he shared with them. 

Ray had 25 lollipops initially and kept 5 for himself. So, the number of lollipops he shared is 25 - 5 = 20.

Since he shared these lollipops equally among his four friends, we need to divide the total number of lollipops shared (20) by the number of friends (4).

20 / 4 = 5

So, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the remaining weight of the cake, we first need to determine how much of the cake was eaten. Since Rory and her mom each had a piece, that's 2 pieces in total. 

The cake was cut into 8 pieces, and 2 were eaten, so 8 - 2 = 6 pieces remain. 

Since the cake weighs 20 ounces and it was cut into 8 equal pieces, we can find the weight of each piece by dividing the total weight by the number of pieces: 20 ounces / 8 = 2.5 ounces per piece.

Now, we multiply the weight of one piece by the number of remaining pieces: 2.5 ounces * 6 = 15 ounces.

The remaining cake weighs 15 ounces."
"To find out how many oranges each person will get, we first need to determine the total number of oranges Sitti and Juris have. 

Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges. 

Total oranges = 34 + 22 = 56

Since they are sharing the oranges with 6 other friends, including themselves, the total number of people sharing the oranges is 8.

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people.

Oranges per person = Total oranges / Total people
= 56 / 8
= 7

So, everyone will get 7 oranges.

The final answer is: 7"
"To find the cost per serving, we first need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients. 

Antoine wants to double the amount of onions, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions. The cost of onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, which costs 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

Since the soup serves 6 people, the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes Bernadette to get to the theater and then calculate how much earlier she needs to leave than Wayne.

Since it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, and Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's, Bernadette's drive will take 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, so she needs to leave 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, Bernadette needs to leave 4 + 5 = 9 minutes before Wayne.

The final numerical answer is: 9"
"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we first need to find the width of the room. We know the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards. 

First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length in feet is 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet.

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is length * width = area. We can rearrange this formula to find the width: width = area / length. 

Plugging in the values, we get width = 360 square feet / 9 feet = 40 feet.

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter of the room using the formula: perimeter = 2 * (length + width). 

Plugging in the values, we get perimeter = 2 * (9 feet + 40 feet) = 2 * 49 feet = 98 feet.

The final answer is: 98"
"To find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we need to calculate the total number of beads each sister has.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
1 pack of red beads = 1 x 20 = 20 beads
2 packs of clear beads = 2 x 20 = 40 beads
Total beads Elizabeth has = 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, she has:
3 packs of blue beads = 3 x 20 = 60 beads
4 packs of red beads = 4 x 20 = 80 beads
Total beads Margareth has = 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, we need to find the difference in the number of beads between the two sisters:
Difference = Total beads Margareth has - Total beads Elizabeth has
Difference = 140 - 60
Difference = 80

The final answer is: 80"
"To find the final temperature of the house, we need to calculate the temperature increase due to the oven and the temperature decrease due to the open window.

First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to the oven. The oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour, and Marcus bakes for 3 hours. So, the total temperature increase is 5 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 15 degrees.

Now, let's calculate the temperature decrease due to the open window. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Since the window is open for 30 minutes, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are there in 30 minutes. 30 minutes / 10 minutes = 3 intervals. So, the total temperature decrease is 2 degrees/interval * 3 intervals = 6 degrees.

Now, let's subtract the temperature decrease from the temperature increase: 15 degrees (increase) - 6 degrees (decrease) = 9 degrees.

The initial temperature of the house was 40 degrees. So, the final temperature is 40 degrees + 9 degrees = 49 degrees.

The final answer is: 49"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it took James to complete each segment of the triathlon. 

Let's start with the swim. Since James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon, and Jon took 40 minutes, we can calculate James' swim time as follows:

James' swim time = Jon's swim time - (10% of Jon's swim time)
= 40 - (0.1 * 40)
= 40 - 4
= 36 minutes

Next, we know that James took 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. Jon took 1 hour and 20 minutes (or 80 minutes) for the bike ride, so James took:

James' bike time = Jon's bike time + 5 minutes
= 80 + 5
= 85 minutes

Now, let's find out how long it took Jon to complete the triathlon. We know that Jon took 40 minutes for the swim, 80 minutes for the bike ride, and 50 minutes for the run. So, the total time for Jon is:

Jon's total time = 40 + 80 + 50
= 170 minutes

We are given that Jon won by 10 minutes, which means James took 10 minutes longer than Jon to complete the triathlon. Therefore, James' total time is:

James' total time = Jon's total time + 10 minutes
= 170 + 10
= 180 minutes

Now, we can find James' run time by subtracting his swim and bike times from his total time:

James' run time = James' total time - James' swim time - James' bike time
= 180 - 36 - 85
= 59 minutes

The final answer is: 59"
"To find the length of Movie A, we need to first find the length of Movie B and then calculate one-fourth of that length.

Movie C is 1.25 hours, which is equal to 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes.

Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so Movie B is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes.

Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, so Movie A is 80 / 4 = 20 minutes.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay, we first need to calculate the total cost of the hay. 

First, we need to find out how many miles the horse ran. Since the horse ran for 30 minutes at 32MPH, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. 

30 minutes is 0.5 hours (since 1 hour = 60 minutes). 

Now, we can find the distance traveled by multiplying the speed by the time: 

Distance = Speed * Time 
Distance = 32MPH * 0.5 hours 
Distance = 16 miles 

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile, and it ran 16 miles, the total hay consumed is: 

Total Hay = 16 miles * 1/2 bail/mile 
Total Hay = 8 bails 

Each bail costs $3, so the total cost of the hay is: 

Total Cost = 8 bails * $3/bail 
Total Cost = $24 

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of: 

Total Money = 6 * $5 
Total Money = $30 

To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the total money: 

Change = Total Money - Total Cost 
Change = $30 - $24 
Change = $6 

The final answer is: $6"
"To find out how many trays Rozanne can put out, we first need to determine the total number of eggs she has. 

Rozanne uses 4 dozen eggs from cases. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 4 dozen eggs would be 4 * 12 = 48 eggs. 

In addition to the eggs from the cases, she also uses 2 loose eggs. So, the total number of eggs is 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Each glass of eggnog requires 5 eggs, so the total number of glasses she can make is 50 / 5 = 10 glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, the total number of trays she can put out is 10 / 5 = 2 trays.

The final answer is: 2"

"To find the salesman's profit, we first need to calculate the total revenue from the flash sale and the department store sales.

The salesman sold 17 sneakers at $20 each during the flash sale, so the revenue from the flash sale is:
17 * $20 = $340

The salesman sold the remaining 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers to the department store at $25 each. The revenue from the department store sales is:
31 * $25 = $775

The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from the flash sale and the department store sales:
$340 + $775 = $1115

The cost of the case of 48 sneakers is $576. To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the total revenue:
$1115 - $576 = $539

The salesman's profit is $539.

The final answer is: $539"

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the regular price of popcorn as P. 

The total cost of buying a movie ticket and popcorn and soda at regular price is 12 + P + 3 = 15 + P.

The total cost of the super ticket is 20, and the extra cost for popcorn and soda is 1. 

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the difference in cost between the two options is 2. 

So, we can set up the equation: 15 + P - 20 + 1 = 2.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 15 + P - 19 = 2.

Combine like terms: -4 + P = 2.

Add 4 to both sides: P = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the cost of filling one balloon before the price increase. 

Let's denote the original cost of filling one balloon as 'x'. The total cost of filling 20 balloons is $900, so we can write the equation as 20x = 900. 

To find the value of 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 20: x = 900 / 20 = 45. 

This means the original cost of filling one balloon was $45. 

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20, so the new cost of filling one balloon is 45 + 20 = 65 dollars.

Now, we need to find the total cost of filling 170 balloons at the new price. The total cost is 170 * 65 = 11,050 dollars.

The final answer is: 11050"
"To find the average speed of the car during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled at 60 mph for 2 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 60 mph x 2 hours
Distance = 120 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled at 30 mph for 1 hour:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 30 mph x 1 hour
Distance = 30 miles

Now, let's find the total distance traveled:
Total Distance = 120 miles + 30 miles
Total Distance = 150 miles

The total time taken is the sum of the time taken at 60 mph and 30 mph:
Total Time = 2 hours + 1 hour
Total Time = 3 hours

Finally, we can calculate the average speed:
Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
Average Speed = 150 miles / 3 hours
Average Speed = 50 mph

"To find the total volume of soil needed, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed and then multiply it by the total number of beds.

The volume of one raised bed is calculated as length * width * height. 
Volume = 2 feet * 8 feet * 2 feet = 32 cubic feet.

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:
Total Volume = 32 cubic feet/bed * 10 beds = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. To find the total number of bags needed, we divide the total volume by the volume of one bag:
Number of bags = Total Volume / Volume per bag = 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet/bag = 160 bags.

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:
Total Cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag = 160 bags * $12/bag = $1920.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of green cards first. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:

Number of red cards = 15
60% of 15 = 0.6 * 15 = 9
Number of green cards = 15 + 9 = 24

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards:
Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
= 15 + 24
= 39

To find the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards:
Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
= 15 + 24 + 39

"To find the total weight of the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and add them together.

The farmer buys 2 boxes of sugar cubes, each weighing 1 pound, so the total weight of sugar cubes is 2 * 1 = 2 pounds.

The farmer buys 4 bags of carrots, each weighing 12 pounds, so the total weight of carrots is 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.

The farmer buys 42 bales of hay, each weighing 75 pounds, so the total weight of hay is 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.

The farmer buys 20 sacks of oats, each weighing 65 pounds, so the total weight of oats is 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

The total weight of all the feed is 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3400 pounds.

Since the farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, we need to divide the total weight of the feed by the truck's capacity to find the number of trips needed.

3400 / 2250 = 1.511 (round up to the nearest whole number since we can't make a fraction of a trip)

So, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To find out how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate the total earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the earnings from aluminum cans. Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans a week. Since an aluminum can is worth 2 cents, her weekly earnings from aluminum cans are 3 * 2 = 6 cents. 

For a four-week month, her earnings from aluminum cans would be 6 * 4 = 24 cents.

Next, let's calculate the earnings from plastic bottles. Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles a week. Since a plastic bottle is worth 3 cents, her weekly earnings from plastic bottles are 5 * 3 = 15 cents.

For a four-week month, her earnings from plastic bottles would be 15 * 4 = 60 cents.

The remaining pencils after two months are 300 - 60 = 240.

At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. This means 1/3 * 240 = 80 pencils were left.

The final answer is: 80"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as 'x'. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, which is x/2. He also gets two extra cookies for cleaning his room. So, the total number of cookies he gets is x/2 + 2.

We are given that Matt wants to eat five cookies in total. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x/2 + 2 = 5.

To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable x. First, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: x/2 = 5 - 2, which simplifies to x/2 = 3.

Next, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction: x = 3 * 2, which simplifies to x = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To find the combined length of the remoras, we need to convert their individual lengths to feet and then add them together. 

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, a 6-inch remora is equal to 6/12 = 0.5 feet. 

There are two remoras, so their combined length is 2 * 0.5 = 1 foot.

The shark's length is 10 feet. To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy, we divide the combined length of the remoras by the shark's length and multiply by 100.

(1 / 10) * 100 = 10%

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the total number of students as 'x'. We know that three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer, which means one-fourth do not have a desktop computer. Since 20 students do not have a desktop computer, we can set up the equation:

1/4 * x = 20

To solve for 'x', we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4 to isolate 'x':

x = 20 * 4
x = 80

So, there are 80 students at that grade level. 

The final answer is: 80"
"To find out how many days Jason has to break in the shoes, we need to multiply the number of days he has (21 days, since there are 7 days in a week and he has 3 weeks) by the number of days he walks per week (4 days). 

21 days * 4 days/week = 84 days

Now, we need to find out how many minutes he has to walk each day. To do this, we divide the total number of minutes (240 minutes) by the total number of days (84 days).

240 minutes / 84 days = 2.857 minutes/day

So, Jason has to spend approximately 2.86 minutes walking each day to break in the new shoes.

The final answer is: 2.86"
"To find out how many books each child got, we need to first determine the total number of books Sarah bought. Since each book costs $15 and she spent $300, we can divide the total amount spent by the cost of each book.

Total amount spent = $300
Cost of each book = $15

Total number of books = Total amount spent / Cost of each book
Total number of books = $300 / $15
Total number of books = 20

Since Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, we can divide the total number of books by 4 to find out how many books each child got.

Number of books per child = Total number of books / 4
Number of books per child = 20 / 4
Number of books per child = 5

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we need to first find the total number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts. 

We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find this. The formula is Total = A + B - Both, where A is the number of kids allergic to dairy, B is the number of kids allergic to peanuts, and Both is the number of kids allergic to both.

A = 9 (kids allergic to dairy)
B = 6 (kids allergic to peanuts)
Both = 3 (kids allergic to both)

Total = A + B - Both
Total = 9 + 6 - 3
Total = 12

However, this counts the kids allergic to both twice, so we need to subtract them once to avoid double-counting. 

Total = 12 - 3
Total = 9

Now, to find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we subtract the total number of kids allergic to anything from the total number of kids in the class.

Total kids in the class = 32
Kids allergic to anything = 9
Kids not allergic to anything = Total kids in the class - Kids allergic to anything
Kids not allergic to anything = 32 - 9
Kids not allergic to anything = 23

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total number of people going on the tour, we need to calculate the total number of employees and the total number of tour guides.

First, let's find the total number of employees: 
There are 3 groups of 200 employees each, so the total number of employees is 3 * 200 = 600.

Next, let's find the total number of tour guides: 
There are 3 groups, and each group has 7 tour guides, so the total number of tour guides is 3 * 7 = 21.

Now, let's add the total number of employees and tour guides to find the total number of people going on the tour: 
Total number of people = Total number of employees + Total number of tour guides
Total number of people = 600 + 21
Total number of people = 621

The final answer is: 621"
"To find the total cost of the trip, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel.

The cost of the plane tickets is $5000 each, and since there are two people, the total cost of the plane tickets is 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

The hotel is 20% more expensive than normal, so the new price is 1.2 * $1500 = $1800 per day. Since they are there for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is the sum of the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel, which is $10,000 + $5400 = $16,400.

The final answer is: $16,400"
"To find out how many tubes of paint Jasper has, we need to determine the number of tubes of blue and yellow paint he has.

Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint. Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, so Jasper has 4 / 2 = 2 tubes of blue paint.

Ben has 3 tubes of yellow paint. Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, so Jasper has 3 * 3 = 9 tubes of yellow paint.

To find the total number of tubes of paint Jasper has, we add the number of blue and yellow tubes: 2 (blue) + 9 (yellow) = 11.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we first need to determine the weight of the 2010 penny. 

Since the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can calculate its weight by multiplying the weight of the 1959 penny by 3/4.

Weight of 1959 penny = 48 grains
Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * 48 grains
Weight of 2010 penny = 36 grains

Now, we can find the combined weight of the two pennies by adding their individual weights.

Combined weight = Weight of 1959 penny + Weight of 2010 penny
Combined weight = 48 grains + 36 grains
Combined weight = 84 grains

The final answer is: 84"
"To find out how much more they need to earn, we need to calculate the total amount they have already earned and subtract that from their goal.

Keegan earned $83 and Tasha earned $91, so together they earned $83 + $91 = $174.

Their goal is to raise $200. To find out how much more they need to earn, we subtract the amount they have already earned from their goal: $200 - $174 = $26.

Therefore, they need to earn $26 more to reach their goal.

The final answer is: $26"
"To find out how many songs Luri can add to his player, we first need to determine how many songs he currently has. Since Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, and Gabriel has 20 songs, Luri has 3 * 20 = 60 songs.

The maximum capacity of the player is 100 songs. To find out how many more songs Luri can add, we subtract the number of songs he already has from the maximum capacity: 100 - 60 = 40.

Now, we need to find out how many more songs Gabriel can add. Since Gabriel has 20 songs, he can add 100 - 20 = 80 more songs.

To find the difference in the number of songs they can add, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add: 80 - 40 = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the total amount of money Stetson gave up, we first need to find out how many oranges he ate. Since Stetson ate 2/5 of the oranges and they picked 60 oranges, we can calculate the number of oranges he ate as follows:

Number of oranges eaten = (2/5) * 60
= (2 * 60) / 5
= 120 / 5
= 24

Since Stetson gave up $10 for each orange he ate, we can multiply the number of oranges he ate by the amount he gave up per orange:

Total amount given up = Number of oranges eaten * Amount per orange
= 24 * 10
= 240

The final answer is: $240"
"To find the cost of Jillian's handbag, we need to first calculate 3 times the cost of her shoes. 

The cost of her shoes is $80. 
3 times the cost of her shoes is 3 * 80 = 240.

Since her handbag cost $20 less than 3 times as much as her shoes, we need to subtract $20 from the result. 
240 - 20 = 220.

The final answer is: $220"
"To find out how many hours James runs a week, we need to calculate the total miles he runs in a week and then divide that by his speed.

First, let's find the total miles James runs in a week. He runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week, so:

Total miles per week = 12 miles/day * 5 days/week = 60 miles/week

Now, we know James runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour. To find the total hours he runs in a week, we can divide the total miles by his speed:

Total hours per week = Total miles per week / Speed
= 60 miles/week / 10 miles/hour
= 6 hours/week

So, James runs 6 hours a week. 

6"
"To determine the total amount of oats needed, we need to calculate the daily consumption of oats by the horses and then multiply it by the number of days.

Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and there are two meals per day. So, the daily consumption per horse is 5 pounds/meal * 2 meals = 10 pounds/day.

Since Uncle Ben has four horses, the total daily consumption is 10 pounds/day * 4 horses = 40 pounds/day.

For five days, the total consumption would be 40 pounds/day * 5 days = 200 pounds.

Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats, so the number of bags needed is 200 pounds / 50 pounds/bag = 4 bags.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the number of girl Pomeranians, we first need to find the total number of Pomeranians. Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can calculate this as follows:

Total puppies = 27
Pomeranians = (2/3) * Total puppies
Pomeranians = (2/3) * 27
Pomeranians = 18

Now, we need to find the number of girl Pomeranians. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we can calculate this as follows:

Girl Pomeranians = (1/3) * Pomeranians
Girl Pomeranians = (1/3) * 18
Girl Pomeranians = 6

Since he promises to save $2 daily, we can divide the remaining amount by the daily savings to find out how many days it will take:

$8 (remaining amount) / $2 (daily savings) = 4 days

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many eggs Jaime won't be able to place on the tray, we first need to determine the total capacity of the trays. Since each tray can hold 24 eggs and Jaime has 2 trays, the total capacity is 24 * 2 = 48 eggs.

Jaime has 64 eggs, but the trays can only hold 48 eggs. To find out how many eggs won't fit, we subtract the total capacity from the number of eggs: 64 - 48 = 16.

So, Jaime won't be able to place 16 eggs on the tray.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total amount Sally spent, we need to calculate the cost of the family-size pizza first. Since it costs 3 times as much as the small pizza, we multiply the cost of the small pizza by 3.

Cost of small pizza: $8

"To find the cost per individual razor after the discount, we need to calculate the total cost of 2 packs of razors with the sale and coupon applied.

First, let's calculate the cost of 2 packs of razors at the sale price. Since it's buy one get one free, Heather only needs to pay for 1 pack, which costs $4.00. So, the total cost for 2 packs is $4.00.

Now, let's apply the $2.00 coupon to the total cost. The new total cost is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since each pack contains 4 razors, 2 packs will have 2 * 4 = 8 razors. To find the cost per individual razor, we need to divide the total cost by the number of razors: $2.00 / 8 = $0.25 per razor.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.25 * 100 = 25 cents.

"To find the total height of the human pyramid, we need to calculate the height of each level and add them up.

The 4 girls on the bottom are 64"" tall each. 
4 * 64"" = 256""

The 3 girls on top of the 4 are also 64"" tall each. 
3 * 64"" = 192""

The 2 girls on top of the 3 are also 64"" tall each. 
2 * 64"" = 128""

The shortest girl at the top is 60"" tall.

Now, we add up the heights of all the levels:
256"" + 192"" + 128"" + 60"" = 576""

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches):
576"" / 12 = 48 feet

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the total number of minutes Charisma walked, we need to calculate the total number of 5-minute breaks she took in a day and then multiply it by the number of days she worked.

Charisma works 8 hours a day, and she takes a 5-minute break every hour. So, the total number of 5-minute breaks in a day is 8 hours * 1 break per hour = 8 breaks per day.

Since each break is 5 minutes long, the total number of minutes she walked in a day is 8 breaks * 5 minutes per break = 40 minutes per day.

Charisma worked for 5 days, so the total number of minutes she walked is 40 minutes per day * 5 days = 200 minutes.

"To find the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car, we need to calculate the cost of the morning rides and the cost of the afternoon rides separately, and then add them together.

The cost of the morning rides is the cost per ride multiplied by the number of rides. Since Paul drives twice a day for 14 days, he drives a total of 2 * 14 = 28 rides in the morning. The cost per ride is $6, so the total cost of the morning rides is 28 * $6 = $168.

The cost of the afternoon rides is also the cost per ride multiplied by the number of rides. Since Paul drives twice a day for 14 days, he drives a total of 2 * 14 = 28 rides in the afternoon. The cost per ride is $2, so the total cost of the afternoon rides is 28 * $2 = $56.

To find the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car, we add the cost of the morning rides and the cost of the afternoon rides: $168 + $56 = $224.

Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so she brought 5 * 10 = 50 oranges.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so she brought 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

The total number of oranges they have is 50 + 70 = 120 oranges.

One Greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, so the number of pies they can make is 120 / 3 = 40.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation for each venue and then equate them to find the break-even point.

Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'. 

For the first venue, the total cost is the flat fee of $200 plus the cost of food for each guest, which is $5x. So, the total cost for the first venue is 200 + 5x.

For the second venue, the total cost is the cost per guest, which is $25x, since food is already included.

To find the break-even point, we set the two costs equal to each other:

200 + 5x = 25x

Now, we need to solve for x. Subtract 5x from both sides:

200 = 20x

Now, divide both sides by 20:

10 = x

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, we can start by assigning variables to the unknown quantities. Let's say David found 'x' insects. Since Lily found 7 more than David, Lily found 'x + 7' insects. 

We are also given that David found half of what Bodhi found. This means Bodhi found '2x' insects, as David's collection is half of Bodhi's. 

The total number of insects collected is 43, which is the sum of the insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi. We can write this as an equation:

x + (x + 7) + 2x = 43

Combine like terms to simplify the equation:

4x + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides of the equation:

4x = 36

Divide both sides by 4 to solve for x:

x = 9

Now that we know David found 9 insects, we can find out how many insects Lily found by adding 7 to David's collection:

Lily found 9 + 7 = 16 insects.

"To find the total yards of yarn used, we need to calculate the yards used by Mariah and her grandma separately and then add them together.

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, and there are 364 yards in a skein. To find 1/4 of 364, we multiply 364 by 1/4 (which is the same as dividing by 4).

364 yards / 4 = 91 yards

So, Mariah used 91 yards of yarn.

Mariah's grandma used 1/2 of a skein, which is the same as 2/4. To find 2/4 of 364, we multiply 364 by 2 and then divide by 4.

364 * 2 = 728
728 / 4 = 182 yards

So, Mariah's grandma used 182 yards of yarn.

Now, we add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma together.

91 yards (Mariah) + 182 yards (grandma) = 273 yards

The final answer is: 273"
"To find the total number of gifts Cherrie bought, we need to calculate the total number of gifts her friends want and then add the 10 random gifts she bought.

First, let's calculate the total number of gifts her friends want. 2 friends want 5 gifts each, so that's 2 x 5 = 10 gifts. The other 3 friends want 2 gifts each, so that's 3 x 2 = 6 gifts. 

Now, let's add the number of gifts the 2 friends want and the number of gifts the other 3 friends want: 10 + 6 = 16 gifts.

Finally, we add the 10 random gifts Cherrie bought: 16 + 10 = 26.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total cost of the grape and green apple gum. We know that Suzie paid $2 for the grape gum and half as much for the green apple gum, which is $2 / 2 = $1.

The total cost of the grape and green apple gum is $2 + $1 = $3. 

Since Suzie paid $7 in total and she bought 4 packs of gum, we can subtract the cost of the grape and green apple gum from the total to find the cost of the strawberry gum. 

$7 - $3 = $4. 

Since Suzie bought 2 packs of strawberry gum, we can divide the total cost of the strawberry gum by 2 to find the cost of each pack.

"To find the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to determine which type of wood gives him the most sticks per dollar spent. 

First, let's calculate the cost per stick for each type of wood:

For a 2 x 4, Frederick can get 200 sticks for $4. 
Cost per stick = $4 / 200 sticks = $0.02 per stick

For a 2 x 8, Frederick can get 400 sticks for $6.
Cost per stick = $6 / 400 sticks = $0.015 per stick

Since the 2 x 8 costs less per stick, we should prioritize buying 2 x 8 lumber. 

Now, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces Frederick can buy with his $24:

Number of 2 x 8 pieces = $24 / $6 = 4

Since each 2 x 8 piece gives 400 sticks, the total number of sticks Frederick can make is:

Total sticks = 4 * 400 = 1600

However, we need to check if buying 2 x 4 lumber will give him more sticks. 

Number of 2 x 4 pieces = $24 / $4 = 6

Since each 2 x 4 piece gives 200 sticks, the total number of sticks Frederick can make is:

Total sticks = 6 * 200 = 1200

Comparing the two options, buying 2 x 8 lumber gives him more sticks. 

The final answer is: 1600"
"To find the total cost of snowshoes for Mario's dogs, we first need to determine the total number of snowshoes required. Since each dog has 4 legs and Mario has 6 dogs, the total number of legs is 6 * 4 = 24.

Since each dog needs a pair of snowshoes, and each pair covers 4 legs, we need to divide the total number of legs by 4 to get the total number of pairs of snowshoes required. However, since each dog needs a pair, we simply need to know how many dogs there are, which is 6.

The total number of snowshoes required is 6 pairs.

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of pairs by the cost per pair: 6 * $12.00 = $72.00

"To find out how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips for a week and then subtract the cost of the weekly pass.

Janet takes two bus trips per day, five days a week. So, the total number of bus trips per week is 2 * 5 = 10.

Each bus trip costs $2.20, so the total cost of her bus trips for a week is 10 * $2.20 = $22.

The weekly bus pass costs $20. To find out how much Janet would save, we subtract the cost of the pass from the total cost of her bus trips: $22 - $20 = $2.

Therefore, Janet would save $2 by buying a weekly bus pass.

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of cows and sheep at both the farm and the zoo, and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of cows at the zoo. We are told that the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does. Since the farm has 30 cows, the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.

Next, let's find the number of sheep at the farm. We are told that the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does. Since the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's find the total number of animals at the farm and the zoo. The farm has 30 cows and 10 sheep, for a total of 30 + 10 = 40 animals. The zoo has 60 cows and 20 sheep, for a total of 60 + 20 = 80 animals.

The total number of animals at the farm and the zoo is 40 + 80 = 120.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many items Sophia bought. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of items Sophia bought, we can represent the number of items Sophia bought as 'x'. 

Rose bought 4 times the number of items Sophia bought, so the number of items Rose bought is 4x. We know that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, so the total number of items Rose bought is 12 + 4 = 16. 

Since Rose bought 4 times the number of items Sophia bought, we can set up the equation 4x = 16. To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 4, which gives us x = 4.

Now that we know Sophia bought 4 items, we can find the total number of items Sophia bought by adding the number of onions and potatoes she bought. However, we don't know the exact number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought. We only know that the total number of items she bought is 4.

To find the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we need to find the ratio of onions to potatoes that Rose bought. Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, so the ratio of onions to potatoes is 12:4 or 3:1. 

Since Sophia bought 4 items, and the ratio of onions to potatoes is 3:1, we can assume that Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato. 

The total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is 3 + 1 = 4.

"To determine the calorie deficit needed, we first need to calculate the number of days Andy has to reach his goal. Since his birthday is on July 19th and today is December 31st, we can calculate the number of days as follows:

December has 31 days, January has 31 days, February has 28 days (assuming a non-leap year), March has 31 days, April has 30 days, May has 31 days, June has 30 days, and July has 19 days. 

Total days = 31 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 211 days

Now, we need to calculate the total number of calories Andy needs to burn to lose 30 pounds. Since he needs to burn 3500 calories to lose 1 pound, the total calories needed to be burned is:

Total calories = 30 pounds * 3500 calories/pound = 105,000 calories

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories by the number of days:

Daily calorie deficit = Total calories / Total days
= 105,000 calories / 211 days
= approximately 497 calories per day

So, Andy needs to create a calorie deficit of approximately 497 calories per day to reach his goal.

Since Gerald works for a week, which has 7 days, and he earns $30 per day, his total earnings for the week would be:

$30/day * 7 days = $210

Now, let's subtract the amount he spent from his total earnings:

$210 (total earnings) - $100 (amount spent) = $110

So, Gerald has $110 left."
"To find out how many milliliters of water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total distance she will run. Since each lap is 0.25 km and she needs to run 8 laps, we multiply the number of laps by the distance per lap.

Distance = Number of laps * Distance per lap
Distance = 8 * 0.25 km
Distance = 2 km

Since Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs, we multiply the total distance by the amount of water needed per kilometer.

Total water needed = Distance * Water per kilometer
Total water needed = 2 km * 60 ml/km
Total water needed = 120 ml

The final answer is: 120"
"To find out how much money Julie had left, we need to calculate the amount she spent on clothes and CDs, and then subtract that from the initial amount.

First, let's calculate the amount she spent on clothes. 20% of $500 is 0.2 x 500 = $100.

Now, let's subtract the amount spent on clothes from the initial amount: $500 - $100 = $400.

Next, let's calculate the amount she spent on CDs. 25% of $400 is 0.25 x 400 = $100.

Now, let's subtract the amount spent on CDs from the remaining amount: $400 - $100 = $300.

The final answer is: $300"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let's denote the cost of the lot as 'x'. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write the equation: x + 3x = 120,000.

Combining like terms, we get 4x = 120,000.

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 4: x = 120,000 / 4 = 30,000.

Since the cost of the house is 3x, we multiply x by 3: 3 * 30,000 = 90,000.

The house cost $90,000.

The final answer is: $90,000"
"To find the profit, we first need to calculate the total cost and total revenue.

The total cost is the cost of the canvas bags, which is 8 packs * 5 bags per pack * $4 per bag = 8 * 5 * 4 = $160.

The total revenue is the selling price of the bags, which is 8 bags * $8 per bag = 8 * 8 = $64.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $64 - $160 = -$96.

However, since profit cannot be negative, it seems there's an error in the problem. The selling price of $8 per bag is lower than the cost price of $4 per bag, which is not possible in a real-world scenario. 

Assuming the selling price is higher than the cost price, let's recalculate the profit. 

The total cost is still $160. 

Let's assume the selling price is x. The total revenue is 8 * x = 8x.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is 8x - 160.

To find the minimum selling price for a profit, we need to set the profit greater than 0. 

8x - 160 > 0
8x > 160
x > 20

So, the selling price must be more than $20 per bag to make a profit.

However, since the problem asks for the profit, let's assume the selling price is $8 per bag, which is not possible. 

If we assume the selling price is $20 per bag, the total revenue is 8 * 20 = $160.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $160 - $160 = $0.

If the selling price is higher than $20, the profit will be more than $0.

Since the problem asks for the profit, let's assume the selling price is $8 per bag, which is not possible. 

However, if we assume the selling price is $8 per bag, the profit is -$96.

If the selling price is higher than $20, the profit will be more than -$96.

Since the problem asks for the profit, let's assume the selling price is $8 per bag, which is not possible.

However, if we assume the selling price is $8 per bag, the profit is -$96.

"To find out how many cookies Kelsie made, we need to first determine how many cookies Josh made. Since Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, and Suzanne made 36 cookies, we can calculate Josh's cookies as follows:

Josh's cookies = Suzanne's cookies / 4
Josh's cookies = 36 / 4
Josh's cookies = 9

Now that we know Josh made 9 cookies, we can find out how many Kelsie made. Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh, so we can calculate Kelsie's cookies as follows:

Kelsie's cookies = 2 * Josh's cookies
Kelsie's cookies = 2 * 9
Kelsie's cookies = 18

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total amount of money Ali has. 

Ali has four $10 bills, which is 4 * $10 = $40. 
He also has six $20 bills, which is 6 * $20 = $120. 
The total amount of money Ali has is $40 + $120 = $160.

Ali gives his sister half of the total money, which is $160 / 2 = $80. 
So, he is left with $160 - $80 = $80.

Now, Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount to buy dinner. 
3/5 of $80 is (3/5) * $80 = $48.

To find the amount of money Ali has after buying dinner, we subtract the amount he spent from the remaining amount: 
$80 - $48 = $32.

The final answer is: $32"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it takes Rob to shingle a house in minutes. Since Rob takes 2 hours, we need to convert this to minutes. 

1 hour = 60 minutes
2 hours = 2 * 60 = 120 minutes

Now, we know that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time it takes Rob. Let's first find out what double the time it takes Rob is. 

Double the time it takes Rob = 2 * 120 = 240 minutes

Now, we add 40 minutes to this to find out how long it takes Royce. 

Time it takes Royce = 240 + 40 = 280 minutes

"To find the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour, we need to calculate the individual rates of each person and then add them together.

Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Bobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony, so Bobby can pick 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.

Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy can pick 2 * 5 = 10 quarts per hour.

Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy, so Ricky can pick 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

Now, let's add the individual rates together to find the total number of quarts of strawberries that they can pick per hour: 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29.

"To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we first need to determine how many cups of raisins she has available for the oatmeal cookies. 

Since she wants to divide the raisins equally among the oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix, we can divide the total number of cups of raisins by 3. 

Total raisins = 27 cups
Raisins for oatmeal cookies = Total raisins / 3
Raisins for oatmeal cookies = 27 / 3
Raisins for oatmeal cookies = 9 cups

Now, we need to find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make with 9 cups of raisins. Each batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins. 

Number of batches = Raisins for oatmeal cookies / Raisins per batch
Number of batches = 9 / (3/4)
To divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal.
Number of batches = 9 * (4/3)
Number of batches = 12

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we first need to calculate her daily and weekly electric consumption before and after adding the new device.

Before adding the new device, Ada's daily electric consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. Since there are 24 hours in a day, her daily consumption is 12 * 24 = 288 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per day.

After adding the new device, her daily consumption will be 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour. So, her daily consumption will be 14 * 24 = 336 kWh per day.

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7. 

Before adding the new device, Ada's weekly consumption is 288 * 7 = 2016 kWh.
After adding the new device, her weekly consumption is 336 * 7 = 2352 kWh.

The cost of electricity is $1.50 per kWh. So, the weekly cost before adding the new device is 2016 * $1.50 = $3024.
The weekly cost after adding the new device is 2352 * $1.50 = $3540.

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is $3540 - $3024 = $516.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how long it would take one person to paint a whole house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take them twice as long to paint a whole house, which is 10 days.

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can calculate the total hours it would take one person to paint a whole house by multiplying the number of days by 24:

10 days * 24 hours/day = 240 hours

Now, if 5 people are painting a whole house, we can divide the total hours it would take one person to paint a whole house by the number of people:

240 hours / 5 people = 48 hours

So, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

4. Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Now, let's calculate the total number of sofas and chairs they have:

Ophelia's sofas: 20
Ophelia's chairs: 22
Jenna's sofas: 64

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money Tom spent on the headphone set. We can do this by subtracting the cost of the CD from the total amount he paid.

Total amount paid = $48
Cost of CD = $4
Cost of headphone set = Total amount paid - Cost of CD
= $48 - $4
= $44

Now that we know the cost of the headphone set, we can find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with that amount.

Cost of one CD = $4
Number of CDs Tom could have bought with the cost of the headphone set = Cost of headphone set / Cost of one CD
= $44 / $4
= 11

So, Tom could have bought 11 more CDs if he had decided not to buy the headphone set.

The total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is 40."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off. So, the number of people left on the bus is 48 - 8 = 40.

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (which is 8) get into the bus. So, 5 * 8 = 40 people get in. Now, the total number of people on the bus is 40 (left) + 40 (got in) = 80.

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off. So, the number of people left on the bus is 80 - 21 = 59.

Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on. Since 21 got off, 3 times fewer would be 21 / 3 = 7. So, 7 passengers get in. Now, the total number of people on the bus is 59 (left) + 7 (got in) = 66.

The final number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop is 66."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, so his current age is 27 - 5 = 22 years.
2. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. 
   Jame's age in 8 years will be 22 + 8 = 30 years.
   Twice Jame's age in 8 years will be 2 * 30 = 60 years.
   So, Jame's cousin's age in 8 years will be 60 - 5 = 55 years.
3. Since Jame's cousin will be 55 in 8 years, his current age is 55 - 8 = 47 years.

Now, let's find the difference in their current ages: 47 (cousin's age) - 22 (Jame's age) = 25 years.

The total cost of the computer and the printer is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800. 

Since Errol bought 2 monitors, the cost of the two monitors is $2,400 - $1,800 = $600. 

To find the cost of one monitor, we divide the total cost of the monitors by 2: $600 / 2 = $300.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many shells the boys brought in total. Since there are 10 boys (half of 20 kids) and each brought 60 shells, the total number of shells brought by the boys is 10 * 60 = 600.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means the girls brought 600 + 4 * 60 shells. 

First, we calculate 4 * 60, which is 240. Then we add 600 to this, which is 840. 

Since there are 10 girls (half of 20 kids), we need to divide the total number of shells brought by the girls by 10 to find out how many shells each girl brought. 

So, 840 / 10 = 84.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much Elvis needs to save in the first half of the month. 

Let's assume the number of days in the first half of the month is x. Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half, the number of days in the second half is also x.

The total number of days in the month is 30 (April has 30 days). So, the total number of days in the first half is 15 (half of 30).

Now, let's denote the amount Elvis saves in the first half as y. Then, the amount he saves in the second half is 2y.

The total amount Elvis needs to save is $1125. So, we can set up the equation:

y + 2y = 1125

Combine like terms:

3y = 1125

Divide both sides by 3:

y = 375

Now that we know Elvis saves $375 in the first half, we can find out how much he needs to save in the second half. Since he saves twice as much in the second half, the amount he saves in the second half is 2y = 2 * 375 = 750.

x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms:

5x = 100

Now, divide both sides by 5 to solve for x:

x = 20

Since x represents the amount Brad gets, and Jeff gets 4 times as much, we can find Jeff's amount by multiplying x by 4:

The shop gives a 10% discount on all the purchased items. To find the discount amount, we multiply the total cost by 0.10: $30 * 0.10 = $3.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Daniel has to spend: $30 - $3 = $27.

The final answer is: $27"
"To find the total cost of the items, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of five hamburgers at $4 each is 5 x $4 = $20.
The cost of ten packs of potato fries at $0.30 each is 10 x $0.30 = $3.
The cost of five cans of fruit drinks at $2 each is 5 x $2 = $10.

Now, let's add the costs together: $20 + $3 + $10 = $33.

Carly pays with a $50 bill, so the change she gets back is $50 - $33 = $17.

The final answer is: $17"
"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we need to break down her sales into two parts: the first $1000 and the sales above $1000.

For the first $1000, she earns a 30% commission:
$1000 * 0.30 = $300

For the sales above $1000, which is $2500 - $1000 = $1500, she earns an additional 10% commission:
$1500 * 0.10 = $150

Now, we add the two amounts together to find her total earnings:
$300 + $150 = $450

The final answer is: $450"
"To determine how many additional bottles of water Bill needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles he already has and the total number of bottles he needs.

Bill started with 2 cases of water, each containing 24 bottles. So, the total number of bottles he has is 2 * 24 = 48.

Since Bill wants to have 2 bottles of water for each of his 70 guests, the total number of bottles he needs is 70 * 2 = 140.

To find out how many additional bottles he needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles he needs: 140 - 48 = 92.

Therefore, Bill needs to buy 92 additional bottles of water.

The final answer is: 92"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. 

When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as in cold water. Since it takes Ray 16 minutes to swim a mile in cold water, twice that time is 2 * 16 = 32 minutes. Adding 2 minutes to that gives us 32 + 2 = 34 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water. 

In cold water, it takes Ray 16 minutes to swim a mile, so for 3 miles it would be 3 * 16 = 48 minutes.

In warm water, it takes Ray 34 minutes to swim a mile, so for 3 miles it would be 3 * 34 = 102 minutes.

The difference in time between swimming 3 miles in warm water and cold water is 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

The final answer is: 54"
"To determine how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we need to calculate his weekly earnings and then divide the target savings by his weekly earnings.

First, let's calculate John's daily earnings: 
$2 per hour * 5 hours per day = $10 per day

Next, let's calculate John's weekly earnings: 
$10 per day * 4 days per week = $40 per week

Now, let's divide the target savings by his weekly earnings to find out how many weeks it will take him to save $80:
$80 / $40 per week = 2 weeks

"To find the total number of holes in the bag, we need to calculate the number of holes in the buttons with two holes and the number of holes in the buttons with four holes.

There are 7 buttons with 2 holes each, so the total number of holes in these buttons is 7 * 2 = 14.

There are 21 - 7 = 14 buttons with 4 holes each, so the total number of holes in these buttons is 14 * 4 = 56.

The total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is 14 + 56 = 70.

"To find the size of Peter's locker, we need to start with Timothy's locker size and work our way down.

Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches. 
Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, so Zack's locker is 24 / 2 = 12 cubic inches.
Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, so Peter's locker is 12 / 4 = 3 cubic inches.

The final answer is: 3"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many cups of coffee Juan currently drinks. Since Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks, and Octavia drinks half the daily recommended amount, we need to find the daily recommended amount first.

Let's assume the daily recommended amount is x cups. Then, Octavia drinks x/2 cups. Since Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks, Juan drinks 10 * (x/2) = 5x cups.

We are given that the daily recommended amount is 4 cups. So, we can set up the equation 5x = 4 to find the value of x.

However, this equation doesn't make sense because 5x cannot equal 4. It seems there is a mistake in the problem. Let's assume the daily recommended amount is actually 8 cups (since 4 cups is half of 8 cups). Then, Octavia drinks 8/2 = 4 cups, and Juan drinks 10 * 4 = 40 cups.

Since Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to 4 cups, we need to find the difference between 40 cups and 4 cups.

The final answer is: 36"
"To find the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we need to calculate the number of hamsters and guinea pigs separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the total number of hamsters: 
There are 3 cages with 10 hamsters each, so the total number of hamsters is 3 * 10 = 30.

Next, let's find the total number of guinea pigs: 
There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each, so the total number of guinea pigs is 3 * 5 = 15.

Now, let's add the total number of hamsters and guinea pigs to find the total number of rodents: 
Total rodents = Total hamsters + Total guinea pigs
Total rodents = 30 + 15
Total rodents = 45

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the average weight of the three friends, we need to first find their individual weights. 

Mark's weight is given as 150 pounds. 
Susan's weight is 20 pounds less than Mark's, so Susan's weight is 150 - 20 = 130 pounds. 
Bob's weight is twice as much as Susan's, so Bob's weight is 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, we need to find the average weight of the three friends. To do this, we add their weights and divide by 3. 
Average weight = (Mark's weight + Susan's weight + Bob's weight) / 3 
Average weight = (150 + 130 + 260) / 3 
Average weight = 540 / 3 
Average weight = 180 

The final answer is: 180"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the total angle the sun will be from the ground after 10 hours. 

The initial angle of the pyramid from the ground is 32 degrees. The sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, so its initial angle from the ground is 0 degrees (since it's directly above the pyramid). 

The sun moves 5 degrees per hour, so after 10 hours, it will move 5 * 10 = 50 degrees.

However, since the sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, we need to add the initial angle of the pyramid to the angle the sun moves. 

So, the total angle from the ground to the sun will be 32 (initial angle of the pyramid) + 50 (angle the sun moves) = 82 degrees.

The final answer is: 82"
"To find out how many packs of candles James needs to buy, we first need to determine the total number of candles required. Since James has two sons, one 12 years old and the other 4 years younger, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Typically, birthday candles are used in the number equal to the age of the person. Therefore, James needs 12 candles for the older son and 8 candles for the younger son, totaling 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Since a pack of 5 candles costs $3, we need to find out how many packs James needs to buy. To do this, we divide the total number of candles needed (20) by the number of candles in a pack (5). 

20 / 5 = 4

So, James needs to buy 4 packs of candles. 

The cost of 4 packs of candles is 4 * $3 = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To find out how many pages Judy read in the first week, we need to calculate the total minutes she read in the first week and then convert that to pages. 

In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night. Since there are 7 nights in a week, she read for a total of 15 * 7 = 105 minutes.

Given that Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we can find out how many pages she read in 105 minutes. First, let's find out how many 1.5-minute intervals are in 105 minutes. We can do this by dividing 105 by 1.5, which equals 70. 

Now, we multiply the number of 1.5-minute intervals by the number of pages she can read in that time. 70 * 2 = 140 pages.

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

To find the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we add the pages she read in the first week to the pages she read in the second week. 140 + 100 = 240 pages.

The final answer is: 240"
"To find out how many sandwiches are left, we need to calculate how many Cody and Trevor ate, and then subtract that from the total number of sandwiches.

Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, which is 12 / 3 = 4 sandwiches.

Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches, which is 12 / 4 = 3 sandwiches.

In total, they ate 4 + 3 = 7 sandwiches.

Now, we subtract the number of sandwiches eaten from the total number of sandwiches: 12 - 7 = 5.

So, there are 5 sandwiches left.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote Shiloh's nephew's current age as 'x'. 

In 7 years, Shiloh will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old. At that time, his nephew will be x + 7 years old. According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. This can be expressed as:

51 = 3(x + 7)

Now, let's solve for 'x':

51 = 3x + 21

Subtract 21 from both sides:

30 = 3x

Divide both sides by 3:

10 = x

So, Shiloh's nephew is 10 years old today.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. The tooth fairy left $5.00 for the first tooth.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave $1.00 each, so that's 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave half the amount of the previous three teeth, which is $1.00 / 2 = $0.50 per tooth. So, for the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon:

$5.00 (first tooth) + $3.00 (next three teeth) + $1.00 (last two teeth) = $9.00

The final answer is: $9.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many goals Mark and Anna scored. 

Let's start with Anna's goals. We know that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, and Richie scored 80 goals. So, we can set up an equation to find Anna's goals:

Richie's goals = Anna's goals + 45
80 = Anna's goals + 45

Now, we can solve for Anna's goals by subtracting 45 from both sides of the equation:

Anna's goals = 80 - 45
Anna's goals = 35

Now that we know Anna's goals, we can find Mark's goals. We know that Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, and Richie scored 80 goals. So, we can set up an equation to find Mark's goals:

Richie's goals = Mark's goals + 20
80 = Mark's goals + 20

Now, we can solve for Mark's goals by subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation:

Mark's goals = 80 - 20
Mark's goals = 60

Now that we know Mark's and Anna's goals, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers:

Total goals = Richie's goals + Mark's goals + Anna's goals
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35
Total goals = 175

The final answer is: 175"
"To find out how much more money Mitchell made than Liam, we need to first calculate the total amount of money each of them made. 

Liam made $63 in total. 

Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 apiece, so we multiply the number of lemonades by the price per lemonade: 21 * 4 = 84. 

Now, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings to find the difference: 84 - 63 = 21.

The final answer is: $21"
"To find the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate how much he spent on each type of action figure and then find the total number of action figures he bought.

First, let's find out how much Peter spent on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday. He spent $5 each day for 4 days, so the total amount spent on wooden action figures is:

$5 * 4 = $20

Since Peter has $70 and spent $20 on wooden action figures, he has $70 - $20 = $50 left.

Now, let's find out how many plastic action figures he can buy with the remaining money. He will spend $2 each day for 3 days (Thursday, Friday, and Saturday), so the total amount spent on plastic action figures is:

$2 * 3 = $6

However, Peter has $50 left, and he can't buy a fraction of an action figure, so he can buy 2 plastic action figures with the remaining money.

Now, let's find the total number of action figures Peter bought:

Number of wooden action figures = 4
Number of plastic action figures = 2

Total number of action figures = 4 + 2 = 6

"To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we first need to calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week and then per month.

The total number of roses ordered per week is 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered per month is 65 * 4 = 260 roses.

Ford grows 40 roses every week, so the total number of roses he grows per month is 40 * 4 = 160 roses.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the total number of roses he grows per month from the total number of roses ordered per month: 260 - 160 = 100.

"To calculate the net profit, we need to find the total revenue and total cost.

The total revenue is the number of sandwiches sold multiplied by the price per sandwich. 
10 sandwiches * $7.00 per sandwich = $70.00

The total cost consists of the cost of bread and the cost of cheese and condiments. 
The cost of bread is $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches. 
So, the cost of bread per sandwich is $3.00 / 10 sandwiches = $0.30 per sandwich.
The cost of cheese and condiments per 10 sandwiches is $30.00, so the cost per sandwich is $30.00 / 10 sandwiches = $3.00 per sandwich.
The total cost per sandwich is $0.30 (bread) + $3.00 (cheese and condiments) = $3.30 per sandwich.
The total cost for 10 sandwiches is $3.30 per sandwich * 10 sandwiches = $33.00.

The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00
Net profit = $37.00

"To find out how much money Kate can make, we need to determine the total number of muffin crayons she can make and then multiply that by the price of each muffin crayon.

First, let's find the total number of crayon pieces. Since there are 3 boxes of 64 crayons, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of crayons per box:

3 boxes * 64 crayons/box = 192 crayon pieces

Since Kate melts 8 small pieces of crayons together to make one muffin crayon, we divide the total number of crayon pieces by 8 to find the total number of muffin crayons:

192 crayon pieces / 8 pieces/muffin crayon = 24 muffin crayons

Now, we multiply the number of muffin crayons by the price of each muffin crayon to find the total amount of money Kate can make:

24 muffin crayons * $1.50/muffin crayon = $36

"To calculate the total cost, we need to find the area of the bedroom and then calculate the cost of the new carpet, padding, and installation.

The area of the bedroom is the length multiplied by the width: 
Area = length * width
Area = 18 * 12
Area = 216 square feet

The cost of the new carpet is $12 per square foot, so the total cost of the carpet is:
Carpet cost = Area * $12
Carpet cost = 216 * $12
Carpet cost = $2592

The cost of the padding is $2 per square foot, so the total cost of the padding is:
Padding cost = Area * $2
Padding cost = 216 * $2
Padding cost = $432

The cost of removing the old carpet is $4 per square foot, so the total cost of removal is:
Removal cost = Area * $4
Removal cost = 216 * $4
Removal cost = $864

The cost of installing the new carpet is $34 per square foot, so the total cost of installation is:
Installation cost = Area * $34
Installation cost = 216 * $34
Installation cost = $7344

The total cost is the sum of the carpet cost, padding cost, removal cost, and installation cost:
Total cost = Carpet cost + Padding cost + Removal cost + Installation cost
Total cost = $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344
Total cost = $11332

"To find the percentage by which the oven is off, we need to calculate the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature, and then divide it by the set temperature.

The difference between the actual and set temperature is 468 - 450 = 18 degrees.

The percentage by which the oven is off is (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%.

Since the oven is off by 4% for any recipe, we need to find the temperature that is 4% less than 520 degrees.

To do this, we can calculate 4% of 520 and subtract it from 520.

4% of 520 is (4/100) * 520 = 20.8.

Now, subtract 20.8 from 520 to get the temperature Maggie should set her oven to: 520 - 20.8 = 499.2.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of cups and dishes Judy brought. 

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of cups Judy brought is 12, and the total number of cups her friend brought is 40. The total number of cups is 12 + 40 = 52.

The total number of dishes Judy brought is 24, and the total number of dishes her friend brought is 44. The total number of dishes is 24 + 44 = 68.

"To find the cost per pair of contacts, we first need to determine the total number of contacts and the total cost of the boxes.

Since 90 contacts last Pete 45 days, we can find the number of contacts he uses per day by dividing 90 by 45:

90 contacts / 45 days = 2 contacts per day

Since Pete buys 2 boxes, the total number of contacts will be:

90 contacts/box * 2 boxes = 180 contacts

The total cost of the boxes with a 10% discount is:

$100.00 * 2 boxes = $200.00
10% of $200.00 = $20.00
$200.00 - $20.00 = $180.00

Now, we can find the cost per pair of contacts by dividing the total cost by the total number of contacts:

$180.00 / 180 contacts = $1.00 per contact

Since a pair of contacts is 2 contacts, the cost per pair is:

$1.00 per contact * 2 contacts = $2.00 per pair

"To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we need to calculate their individual earnings first.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, for a total of 3 hours. Her hourly wage is $10, so her total earnings are 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 hours. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, which is 3 * 1 = 3 hours. So, John worked a total of 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

John's total earnings are 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

"To find out how much water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total calories she burns during her activities. 

She spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories/hour. So, the total calories burned from aerobics is 2 * 500 = 1000 calories.

She also spends 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories/hour. So, the total calories burned from running is 1 * 600 = 600 calories.

The total calories burned is the sum of calories burned from aerobics and running, which is 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns, we need to divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many 200-calorie units she burned. 

Total calories burned / 200 = 1600 / 200 = 8

Since she needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, she needs to drink 8 * 100 = 800 ml of water.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G.

We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write the equation: B + R + G = 4500.

We also know that the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, so we can write the equation: R = 0.99B.

We also know that the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so we can write the equation: G = 1.01B.

Now we can substitute the expressions for R and G into the first equation: B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500.

Combine like terms: 3.00B = 4500.

Divide both sides by 3.00: B = 1500.

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red jelly beans: R = 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485.

And we can find the number of green jelly beans: G = 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515.

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and the number of red jelly beans is: G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the average of the three measurements, we need to first find the third measurement. Jared's initial speed is 47 WPM, and it increased to 52 WPM. If he increases it by 5 WPM again, his new speed will be 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

Now, we have the three measurements: 47, 52, and 57. To find the average, we add them up and divide by 3.

Average = (47 + 52 + 57) / 3
Average = 156 / 3
Average = 52

The final answer is: 52"
"To find the difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks, we need to calculate the weight change for each option and then find the difference.

If Martin eats Cheerios every day for breakfast, he'll lose 1.25 pounds/week. After 5 weeks, he'll lose 1.25 * 5 = 6.25 pounds.

If Martin eats donuts every day for breakfast, he'll gain 1.75 pounds/week. After 5 weeks, he'll gain 1.75 * 5 = 8.75 pounds.

The difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options is 8.75 - 6.25 = 2.5 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2.5}$"
"To determine the total number of people attending, we need to calculate the number of people invited via email, the number of friends Alex's friends will bring, and the number of Alex's friends and their spouses attending.

First, let's calculate the number of people invited via email. Each of the 100 people invited will bring 2 friends, so the total number of people invited via email is 100 + (100 * 2) = 300.

Next, Alex calls 10 friends and 8 of them will be bringing their spouses, so the total number of Alex's friends and their spouses is 10 + 8 = 18.

Now, we add the number of people invited via email and the number of Alex's friends and their spouses to get the total number of people attending. 

Total number of people attending = 300 + 18 = 318

However, we also need to consider Alex herself, so we add 1 to the total number of people attending.

Total number of people attending, including Alex = 318 + 1 = 319

Therefore, Alex will need 319 seats.

The final answer is: 319"
"To find the weight of the Mastiff, we need to start from the Papillon's weight. The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, and the Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher. 

First, we find the Dachshund's weight: 10 pounds * 2 = 20 pounds.

Then, we find the Papillon's weight: 20 pounds / 4 = 5 pounds.

Finally, we find the Mastiff's weight: 5 pounds * 44 = 220 pounds.

The final answer is: 220"
"To find the total cost of the boots on eBay, we need to calculate the shipping cost first. Since the shipping cost on eBay is twice as much as it is on Amazon, and the shipping cost on Amazon is $4, the shipping cost on eBay is 2 * $4 = $8.

The total cost of the boots on eBay is the cost of the boots plus the shipping cost, which is $13 + $8 = $21.

The total cost of the boots on Amazon is $16 + $4 = $20.

To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we need to subtract the total cost on Amazon from the total cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To solve this problem, we can use exponential growth. The initial height of the beanstalk is 4 feet, and it doubles every day. We want to find the number of days it takes for the beanstalk to be taller than 20 feet.

Let's start by calculating the height of the beanstalk for each day:

Day 1: 4 feet
Day 2: 4 * 2 = 8 feet
Day 3: 8 * 2 = 16 feet
Day 4: 16 * 2 = 32 feet

As we can see, on the 4th day, the beanstalk will be taller than 20 feet. Therefore, it will take 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we first need to calculate how many grams of protein he gets per day. 

Since a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein, we can find the protein percentage in a cup of mushrooms by dividing the protein by the weight: 3 grams / 100 grams = 0.03 or 3%.

Now, we know that John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day. To find out how many grams of protein he gets per day, we multiply the weight of mushrooms he eats by the protein percentage: 200 grams * 0.03 = 6 grams of protein per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7 to find the weekly protein intake: 6 grams/day * 7 days = 42 grams of protein per week.

The final answer is: 42"
"Let's break down the information given. If Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can represent his current age as 'x'. 

Five years ago, Jerry's age would be 'x - 5'. According to the problem, Jerry's current age is twice his age 5 years ago, so we can write the equation as:

x = 2(x - 5)

Expanding the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting '2x' from both sides of the equation gives us:

-x = -10

Dividing both sides by -1, we get:

x = 10

So Jerry's current age is 10 years. 

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

10 + 3 = 13

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

The final answer is: 13"
"To find out how many hours George needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the dental work. 

The base price for two implants is 2 * $2000 = $4000. 
For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain, which costs an extra $500. So, the total cost for the implants with the crown is $4000 + $500 = $4500. 
However, since he's already put down a deposit of $600, we subtract that from the total cost: $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Now, we need to find out how many hours George needs to work to earn $3900 at $15 per hour. 

To do this, we divide the total amount he needs to earn ($3900) by his hourly wage ($15): $3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

The final answer is: 260"
"Let's denote the smallest angle as 'x'. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, which is 2x, and one angle is three times the smallest angle, which is 3x.

Since the sum of the three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:

One angle is twice the smallest angle: 2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees
One angle is three times the smallest angle: 3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has in cents. 

First, let's convert the quarters to cents: 8 quarters * 25 cents/quarter = 200 cents.
Next, let's convert the dimes to cents: 6 dimes * 10 cents/dime = 60 cents.
Then, we already have the number of nickels in cents: 14 nickels * 5 cents/nickel = 70 cents.
Lastly, we have the number of pennies in cents: 15 pennies * 1 cent/penny = 15 cents.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money Colby has: 200 cents + 60 cents + 70 cents + 15 cents = 345 cents.

Since each gumball costs a nickel (5 cents), we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball: 345 cents / 5 cents = 69.

The final answer is: 69"
"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of pet and then add them together.

Dogs have 4 legs each, and there are 5 dogs, so the total number of dog legs is 5 x 4 = 20.

Cats have 4 legs each, and there are 2 cats, so the total number of cat legs is 2 x 4 = 8.

Birds have 2 legs each, and there are 10 birds, so the total number of bird legs is 10 x 2 = 20.

Now, we add the total number of legs for each type of pet: 20 (dog legs) + 8 (cat legs) + 20 (bird legs) = 48.

The total number of legs in the pet store is 48."
"To find the weight Jamaal uses after increasing the 8-pound weight by 50%, we first need to calculate 50% of 8 pounds. 

50% of 8 pounds is 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds. 

Now, we add this to the original weight: 8 pounds + 4 pounds = 12 pounds. 

However, Jamaal finds this weight too heavy, so he uses a weight two pounds lighter than this. 

The weight he now uses is 12 pounds - 2 pounds = 10 pounds.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of games Steve receives each year and then sum them up over the three years.

In the first year, Steve gets 5 games as a birthday gift and 5 games as Christmas gifts, for a total of 10 games. He also buys 1 game per month for 12 months, which is 12 games. So, in total, he has 10 + 12 = 22 games in the first year.

In the second year, Steve gets 5 games as birthday and Christmas gifts, for a total of 10 games. He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, which is 24 games. So, in total, he has 10 + 24 = 34 games in the second year.

In the third year, Steve gets 5 games as birthday and Christmas gifts, for a total of 10 games. He buys 4 games per month for 12 months, which is 48 games. So, in total, he has 10 + 48 = 58 games in the third year.

Now, we need to sum up the total number of games Steve has over the three years: 22 + 34 + 58 = 114 games.

The final answer is: 114"
"To find the rate at which the plane is traveling, we need to divide the distance it traveled by the time it took. 

Distance = 1200 miles
Time = 3 hours

Rate = Distance / Time
Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Rate = 400 miles per hour

Now, we need to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this rate.

Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

Since the question asks for the additional hours, we need to subtract the initial time from the total time.

Additional hours = Total time - Initial time
Additional hours = 5 hours - 3 hours
Additional hours = 2 hours

"To find the total amount of chocolates made by Marissa in an hour, we need to first find out how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz makes in an hour. 

Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. To find out how many pounds he makes in an hour, we divide 120 by 2. 

120 / 2 = 60 pounds per hour for Ruiz.

Since Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz, we multiply 60 by 3/4.

60 * (3/4) = 45 pounds per hour for Marissa.

Now, we know that both Ruiz and Marissa work for 12 hours a day. To find the total amount of chocolates made by Ruiz in 12 hours, we multiply 60 by 12.

60 * 12 = 720 pounds for Ruiz.

To find the total amount of chocolates made by Marissa in 12 hours, we multiply 45 by 12.

45 * 12 = 540 pounds for Marissa.

Now, we add the total amount of chocolates made by Ruiz and Marissa to find the total amount of chocolates made together.

720 + 540 = 1260 pounds.

"To find the total amount of money Patrick earned, we need to calculate the total number of cups sold and the total revenue from each time period, then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total number of cups sold in the first four hours:
15 cups/hour * 4 hours = 60 cups

The total revenue from the first four hours is:
60 cups * $0.50/cup = $30

Next, let's calculate the total number of cups sold in the next two hours:
10 cups/hour * 2 hours = 20 cups

The total revenue from the next two hours is:
20 cups * $0.60/cup = $12

Now, let's add the total revenue from both time periods:
$30 + $12 = $42

"To find out how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to calculate the total number of rotations the tire can handle and divide it by the number of rotations per mile.

First, let's find the total number of rotations per month. Since the tire rotates 725 times every 2 miles, we can find the number of rotations per mile by dividing 725 by 2.

725 rotations / 2 miles = 362.5 rotations per mile

Since Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, we can find the total number of rotations per month by multiplying the number of rotations per mile by the number of miles driven per month.

362.5 rotations/mile * 400 miles/month = 145,000 rotations/month

Now, we can find the total number of rotations the tire can handle in a year by multiplying the number of rotations per month by 12.

145,000 rotations/month * 12 months/year = 1,740,000 rotations/year

Now, we can find the total number of years the tire can last by dividing the total number of rotations the tire can handle by the number of rotations per year.

10,440,000 rotations / 1,740,000 rotations/year = 6 years

"To find out how much money Joe will have left after the purchase, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he wants to buy and then subtract that from the initial amount of money he has.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount. The shirt costs $25 and the shorts cost $35, so the total cost is $25 + $35 = $60.

Since there's a 30% off sale, we need to calculate the discount amount. To do this, we multiply the total cost by the discount percentage (30% or 0.3). The discount amount is $60 * 0.3 = $18.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final cost of the items. $60 - $18 = $42.

Since sales tax is included, we don't need to calculate it separately. We can subtract the final cost from the initial amount of money Joe has. $50 - $42 = $8.

So, Joe will have $8 left after the purchase.

The final answer is: $8"
"To determine the amount of butter needed, we first need to calculate the total number of croissants Juan wants to make in a week. Since he wants to make 4 dozen a day for a week, we multiply the number of dozen croissants per day by the number of days in a week.

4 dozen/day * 7 days/week = 28 dozen/week

Since 1 dozen croissants require 1/4 pound of butter, we multiply the total number of dozen croissants by the amount of butter needed per dozen.

28 dozen/week * (1/4 pound/dozen) = 7 pounds/week

So, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week.

"To find the cost of repaving Lewis' street, we need to multiply the cost per meter by the length of his street. 

Cost per meter: $194
Length of Lewis' street: 490 meters

Cost to repave Lewis' street = Cost per meter * Length of Lewis' street
Cost to repave Lewis' street = $194 * 490
Cost to repave Lewis' street = $95,060

Now, to find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's, we need to calculate the cost of repaving Monica's street and then subtract it from the cost of repaving Lewis' street.

Cost to repave Monica's street = Cost per meter * Length of Monica's street
Cost to repave Monica's street = $194 * 150
Cost to repave Monica's street = $29,100

Now, let's find the difference in cost:
Difference in cost = Cost to repave Lewis' street - Cost to repave Monica's street
Difference in cost = $95,060 - $29,100
Difference in cost = $65,960

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of John's research. 

First, let's find the total number of months his research took. Since it took 10 times longer than the initial 5 months, it took 5 * 10 = 50 months.

The initial funding was $100,000 for the first 5 months. After that, the funding increased by 50% each month. 

To find the cost for each month after the first 5 months, we need to calculate the increase in funding. Since it's a 50% increase, we can multiply the previous month's funding by 1.5.

The funding for the 6th month would be $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000.
The funding for the 7th month would be $150,000 * 1.5 = $225,000.
We can continue this pattern to find the funding for each month.

However, a more efficient way to find the total cost is to use the formula for the sum of a geometric series. The formula is S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r), where S is the sum, a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.

In this case, a = $100,000, r = 1.5, and n = 45 (since we're considering the first 5 months as one term and the remaining 45 months as 45 terms).

S = $100,000 * (1 - 1.5^45) / (1 - 1.5)
S = $100,000 * (1 - 4.3047 * 10^13) / (-0.5)
S ≈ $100,000 * 2.6083 * 10^13
S ≈ $2.6083 * 10^15

Now, we need to add the initial 5 months' funding to this total. The initial 5 months' funding is $100,000 * 5 = $500,000.

Total cost = $2.6083 * 10^15 + $500,000

The final answer is: $2,608,300,000,000,000"

The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, the third player ate 16 ounces of steak.

Now, let's add up the total amount of meat consumed: 
6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces.

"To find the total number of flowers that have bloomed, we first need to find the total number of flowers in the garden. Since there are 10 rows with 20 flowers in each row, the total number of flowers is 10 * 20 = 200.

Since only 4/5 of the flowers have bloomed, we can find the number of bloomed flowers by multiplying the total number of flowers by 4/5. 

Number of bloomed flowers = (4/5) * 200
= 4 * 40
= 160

The final answer is: 160"
"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to first convert her speed from kb/s to Mb/s and then multiply it by the number of seconds in an hour.

1 Mb = 1000 kb
Ashley's speed in kb/s = 20 kb/s

To convert kb/s to Mb/s, we divide by 1000:
20 kb/s / 1000 = 0.02 Mb/s

There are 3600 seconds in an hour. To find Ashley's speed in Mb/h, we multiply her speed in Mb/s by the number of seconds in an hour:
0.02 Mb/s * 3600 s/h = 72 Mb/h

The final answer is: 72"
"To find the total number of cars towed, we need to calculate the number of cars towed in the first three days and the remaining days separately and then add them together.

In the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day. So, the total number of cars towed in the first three days is 3 * 10 = 30.

In the remaining days, there are 4 days (7 - 3 = 4). The tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars each day, so it pulled 10 - 4 = 6 cars per day. The total number of cars towed in the remaining days is 4 * 6 = 24.

Now, we add the total number of cars towed in the first three days and the remaining days: 30 + 24 = 54.

The final answer is: 54"
"To find out how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to calculate the difference between his current height and the required height, and then divide that by his growth rate.

First, let's convert Adam's height from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

40 inches / 12 = 3.33 feet

Since Adam needs to be 4 feet tall to ride the roller coaster, we subtract his current height from the required height:

4 feet - 3.33 feet = 0.67 feet

Now, we need to convert this difference back to inches, since Adam's growth rate is given in inches per year:

0.67 feet * 12 inches/foot = 8 inches

Now, we can divide the difference in height by Adam's growth rate to find out how many years it will take for him to reach the required height:

8 inches / 2 inches/year = 4 years

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find out how much James made, we need to calculate the profit from selling the cars, then apply his commission.

First, let's find the total cost of the cars: 10 cars * $25,000 = $250,000.

The company paid 30% of the cost to acquire the cars, so the amount they paid is 0.3 * $250,000 = $75,000.

The profit from selling the cars is the selling price minus the cost to acquire them: $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.

James gets a 10% commission on the profit, so his commission is 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

Therefore, James made $17,500.

The final answer is: $17,500."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that 25% of the 100 riders can stay upright on the wave. To find the number of riders who can stay upright, we multiply 100 by 0.25 (which is 25% expressed as a decimal).

100 * 0.25 = 25

So, 25 riders can stay upright on the wave.

Next, we know that 60% of these 25 riders are women. To find the number of women who can stay upright, we multiply 25 by 0.6 (which is 60% expressed as a decimal).

25 * 0.6 = 15

Since the remaining riders who can stay upright are men, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright.

25 - 15 = 10

Therefore, 10 men can stay upright on the wave.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total price for all three jewels, we need to find the prices of the gold and silver jewels first.

Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, we know that the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of a diamond jewel. 

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * Price of diamond jewel
Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * $2000
Price of gold jewel = $1600

The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold. 

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
Price of silver jewel = $1600 - $400
Price of silver jewel = $1200

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels.

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
Total price = $2000 + $1600 + $1200
Total price = $4800

The final answer is: $4800"
"To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to calculate the number of each type of stamp and add them together.

Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.

He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

To find the total number of stamps, we add the number of each type of stamp together: 16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45.

The final answer is: 45"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the relative speed between Bob and Tom. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract Tom's speed from Bob's speed to get the relative speed.

Relative speed = Bob's speed - Tom's speed
Relative speed = 55 mph - 70 mph
Relative speed = -15 mph

However, since speed cannot be negative, we need to take the absolute value of the relative speed.

Relative speed = | -15 mph | = 15 mph

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed to find the time it will take for Tom to catch up with Bob.

Time = Distance / Relative speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many fish Darren caught first, and then add 3 to that number to find out how many fish Tommy caught.

We know that Naomi caught 17 fish. Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, so we subtract 6 from 17 to find out how many fish Darren caught:

17 (Naomi's fish) - 6 = 11

Now that we know Darren caught 11 fish, we add 3 to that number to find out how many fish Tommy caught:

11 (Darren's fish) + 3 = 14

So, Tommy caught 14 fish.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to determine the maximum number of classes he can attend without exceeding the $10 per class limit.

Let's assume the cost per class is $10. If Manny attends all 10 classes, the total cost would be 10 classes * $10 per class = $100. However, he signed up for classes for $60, so he has a remaining balance of $40.

Since his parents won't sign him up again if the cost exceeds $10 per class, we need to find the maximum number of classes he can attend without exceeding this limit. 

Let's denote the number of classes he can miss as 'x'. The total cost of the classes he attends would be 10 - x classes * $10 per class. This should be less than or equal to $60 (the initial cost) plus the remaining balance of $40, which is $100.

10 - x classes * $10 per class <= $100

Simplifying the equation:

10 - 10x <= 100

Subtract 10 from both sides:

-10x <= 90

Divide both sides by -10 (remember to reverse the inequality sign when dividing by a negative number):

x >= 9

Since x represents the number of classes Manny can miss, the maximum number of classes he can miss is 9.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the total weekly production, we first need to determine the daily production of Julie and Jewel, and then multiply it by 7 (the number of days in a week).

Jewel processes 50 customers per day. Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, Julie processes 2 * 50 = 100 customers per day.

The combined daily production of Julie and Jewel is 50 (Jewel's production) + 100 (Julie's production) = 150 customers per day.

To find the total weekly production, we multiply the combined daily production by 7: 150 * 7 = 1050.

The final answer is: 1050"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Paisley ran 4 miles.
2. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so Reggie ran 5 * 4 = 20 miles.
3. Reggie also ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, so Lynn ran 20 - 3 = 17 miles.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges, we first need to find the cost of one apple and one orange. 

The cost of 4 apples is $5.20, so the cost of one apple is $5.20 / 4 = $1.30. 

The cost of 3 oranges is $3.30, so the cost of one orange is $3.30 / 3 = $1.10.

Now, we can find the cost of 5 apples: 5 apples * $1.30/apple = $6.50.

Next, we can find the cost of 5 oranges: 5 oranges * $1.10/orange = $5.50.

Finally, we can add the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges to find the total cost: $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To find the volume of the hole, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth. 

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Since it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we can multiply the volume by the time it takes to shovel one cubic foot.

Time = Volume * time per cubic foot
Time = 72 * 3
Time = 216 seconds

Therefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.

216"
"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add them to the base price.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade costs $7,500.

The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of the leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of the running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the features and the base price:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500.

"To find the total amount Tim will make in a year, we need to calculate his new monthly salary and then multiply it by 12.

First, let's calculate the 5% raise on his monthly salary. 
5% of $20,000 is 0.05 * $20,000 = $1,000. 
So, his new monthly salary will be $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000.

Next, let's calculate the bonus, which is half a month's salary. 
Half of $21,000 is $10,500.

Now, let's add the bonus to his new monthly salary. 
$21,000 + $10,500 = $31,500.

Finally, let's multiply his new monthly salary by 12 to find the total amount he will make in a year. 
$31,500 * 12 = $378,000.

The final answer is: $378,000"

"To find the age of Steve's son's wife, we need to determine the ages of Steve's son and his wife.

First, we know Steve's age is 60 years. His wife is 4 years older than him, so his wife's age is 60 + 4 = 64 years.

Their son is half as old as his mom, so his age is 64 / 2 = 32 years.

Steve's son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, so her age is 32 - 3 = 29 years.

"To find the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions, we first need to find the total amount of flour in one bag. Since the bag is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, we can find the total amount of flour in one bag by multiplying the number of portions by the weight of each portion.

Total flour in one bag = 8 portions * 2 kilograms/portion = 16 kilograms

Now, we need to find the total amount of flour in three bags. We can do this by multiplying the total amount of flour in one bag by 3.

Total flour in three bags = 16 kilograms/bag * 3 bags = 48 kilograms

"To find the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley, we need to calculate the distance each of them biked and then add them together.

Alisa biked at 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours. To find the distance she biked, we multiply her speed by the time:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 12 miles/hour x 4.5 hours
Distance = 54 miles

Stanley biked at 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours. To find the distance he biked, we multiply his speed by the time:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour x 2.5 hours
Distance = 25 miles

Now, we add the distances biked by Alisa and Stanley to find the total distance:

Total Distance = Distance biked by Alisa + Distance biked by Stanley
Total Distance = 54 miles + 25 miles
Total Distance = 79 miles

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil. Bill can dig 4 feet/hour through soil, and he needs to dig 24 feet of soil. 

Time to dig through soil = Total soil depth / Rate of digging through soil
Time to dig through soil = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour
Time to dig through soil = 6 hours

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the clay. Bill can dig half as fast through clay, so his rate of digging through clay is 4 / 2 = 2 feet/hour. He needs to dig 8 feet of clay.

Time to dig through clay = Total clay depth / Rate of digging through clay
Time to dig through clay = 8 feet / 2 feet/hour
Time to dig through clay = 4 hours

Now, we add the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay to get the total time.

Total time = Time to dig through soil + Time to dig through clay
Total time = 6 hours + 4 hours
Total time = 10 hours

"To find the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost of the pomegranates on each day and then subtract the two amounts.

On the first day, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. However, she got a $2 discount, so the price per pomegranate is $20 - $2 = $18. The total cost is 20 * $18 = $360.

On the second day, the price per pomegranate is $30, but there's a 10% discount on the total cost. The discount amount is 10% of $30 * 20 = 0.1 * $600 = $60. The final price after the discount is $600 - $60 = $540.

The difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is $360 - $540 = -$180. However, since we can't have a negative price difference, we need to consider the absolute difference, which is $180."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find the total sales from green hats in the first month. Since the sales from red hats were half the total amount she earned from selling green hats, let's denote the total sales from green hats as 'x'. This means the sales from red hats are x/2.

We know that the sales from red hats were $400, so we can set up the equation:

x/2 = 400

To find 'x', we multiply both sides by 2:

x = 400 * 2
x = 800

So, the total sales from green hats in the first month were $800.

Now, let's find the total sales from both red and green hats in the first month:

Total sales in the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
= 400 + 800
= 1200

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. To find the total sales in the second month, we multiply the total sales in the first month by 3/4:

Total sales in the second month = (3/4) * 1200
= 900

Now, let's find the total sales in two months:

Total sales in two months = Total sales in the first month + Total sales in the second month
= 1200 + 900
= 2100

"To find out how many dollars were withheld from Sally's wage, we need to determine the total amount she should have received and subtract the actual amount in her account.

First, let's calculate the total amount Sally should have received. Since her weekly wage is $300, and she started with $200 in her account, the total amount she should have received is $300 (weekly wage) + $200 (initial amount) = $500.

However, the actual amount in her account is $420. To find out how much was withheld, we subtract the actual amount from the total amount she should have received: $500 (total amount) - $420 (actual amount) = $80.

The amount withheld from Sally's wage is $80.

$80"
"To determine the number of eggs Lori needs, we first need to find out how many deviled egg halves each guest will eat. Since each guest eats 3 deviled egg halves, and Lori is inviting 16 guests, the total number of deviled egg halves needed is 3 * 16 = 48.

Since Lori needs 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves, we need to find out how many deviled egg halves 1 egg can make. This is 2 deviled egg halves per egg. 

Now, we divide the total number of deviled egg halves needed by the number of deviled egg halves per egg to find the total number of eggs needed. 48 / 2 = 24 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens of eggs needed. 24 / 12 = 2.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many pages Shiela has left to write, we need to determine the total number of pages she has already written and subtract that from the total required pages.

Since Shiela has finished writing 1/3 of the paper, we can calculate the number of pages she has written as follows:

1/3 of 15 pages = (1/3) * 15 = 5 pages

Now, we subtract the number of pages she has written from the total required pages:

15 pages (total) - 5 pages (written) = 10 pages

So, Shiela has 10 pages left to write.

"To determine how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading, we need to calculate how many days it will take him to read the entire book. 

First, let's calculate the total number of days Mike plans to read: 30 days. 

Next, let's calculate the total number of pages Mike plans to read in 30 days: 10 pages/day * 30 days = 300 pages.

Since the book has 200 pages, and Mike plans to read 300 pages in 30 days, he will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline. 

The number of days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading is 10."
"To find the total cost of the plane for the first year, we need to calculate the cost of the plane itself, the hanger rental, and the fuel costs.

The cost of the plane is $150,000.

The hanger rental is $5000 per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total hanger rental cost for the first year is $5000 * 12 = $60,000.

The fuel cost is twice the hanger rental, which is $5000 * 2 = $10,000 per month. The total fuel cost for the first year is $10,000 * 12 = $120,000.

Now, we add the cost of the plane, the hanger rental, and the fuel costs to find the total cost for the first year: $150,000 + $60,000 + $120,000 = $230,000.

The final answer is: $230,000"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. It took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice.
2. It took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, so it took her 30 + 20 = 50 minutes to cook pork.
3. Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. Half of 80 is 40 minutes.

Now, let's add up the cooking times for all the food: 
- Rice: 30 minutes
- Pork: 50 minutes
- Beans: 40 minutes

Total cooking time = 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture and then find the difference.

For the first mixture, we have 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts. The cost of almonds is $10 per pound, and the cost of walnuts is $15 per pound. 

The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is (1/2) * $10 = $5. 
The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is (1/3) * $15 = $5.

The total cost of the first mixture is $5 + $5 = $10.

For the second mixture, we have 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts. 

The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is (1/5) * $10 = $2.
The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is (1/3) * $15 = $5.

The total cost of the second mixture is $2 + $5 = $7.

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between the two mixtures. The difference is $10 - $7 = $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of sheep as S and the number of geese as G.

Since sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs, we can write the equation for the total number of legs as:

4S + 2G = 70

We are also given that the total number of animal heads is 20. Since sheep and geese both have one head, we can write the equation for the total number of heads as:

S + G = 20

Now we have a system of two equations:

1) 4S + 2G = 70
2) S + G = 20

We can solve this system of equations by multiplying the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of G in both equations the same:

2(S + G) = 2(20)
2S + 2G = 40

Now we can subtract this new equation from the first equation to eliminate G:

(4S + 2G) - (2S + 2G) = 70 - 40
2S = 30

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

S = 15

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee and the cost of the donut. 

First, let's find the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee. Since it's 20% more than the normal brand, we need to calculate 20% of $5 and add it to $5.

20% of $5 = 0.2 * $5 = $1
Cost of the more expensive brand = $5 + $1 = $6 per pound

Since Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day and he buys a week's worth, he needs 7 pounds of coffee. 

Cost of the coffee = 7 pounds * $6 per pound = $42

The cost of the donut is $2.

Total cost = Cost of the coffee + Cost of the donut = $42 + $2 = $44

The final answer is: $44"

Adding the cost of the bucket of fried chicken: $4.00 + $8.00 = $12.00
Adding the cost of the bottle of soda: $12.00 + $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's subtract the total cost of the items from the $20.00 Gus spent:

$20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

The apple pie cost $7.00.

Total newspapers delivered = 600
Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers delivered - (Newspapers delivered to District A + Newspapers delivered to District C)

"To find out how many recipes John learns, we need to calculate the total class time and then divide it by the time it takes to learn a new recipe.

The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time, so the total class time per week is 4 * 2 = 8 hours.

Since the class lasts for 6 weeks, the total class time is 8 hours/week * 6 weeks = 48 hours.

John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time. To find out how many recipes he learns, we need to divide the total class time by 1.5 hours.

Total recipes learned = Total class time / Time to learn a new recipe

"To find the number of math teachers, we first need to find the number of history teachers and then subtract that from the total number of teachers. 

60% of 150 teachers are history teachers. To find 60% of 150, we multiply 150 by 0.6. 

150 * 0.6 = 90

So, there are 90 history teachers. To find the number of math teachers, we subtract the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers.

150 - 90 = 60

There are 60 math teachers. 

Each math teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. To find the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day, we multiply the number of math teachers by the number of hours they sleep per day.

60 * 6 = 360

"To solve this problem, we need to find the amount of money Kassidy and Rayna have. 

First, we know Aurelia has $120. Since Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, we can calculate Kassidy's money as follows:
Kassidy's money = 3/4 * Aurelia's money
Kassidy's money = 3/4 * 120
Kassidy's money = 90

Now, we know Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy. So, we can calculate Rayna's money as follows:
Rayna's money = Kassidy's money + 60
Rayna's money = 90 + 60
Rayna's money = 150

Now that we have the money of all three, we can find the total amount of money they have together:
Total money = Aurelia's money + Kassidy's money + Rayna's money
Total money = 120 + 90 + 150
Total money = 360

To find out how much each would have if they decided to add together their money and share equally among them, we need to divide the total money by 3:
Money per person = Total money / 3
Money per person = 360 / 3
Money per person = 120

"To find the number of good days left in the month, we need to first determine the total number of good days recorded by Christina. We know that she had 12 good days in the first 30 days. However, we also know that her first 8 days were good, her second 8 days were bad, and her third 8 days were neutral. This means that the good days in the first 30 days are only the first 8 days.

So, the total number of good days in the first 30 days is 8. 

Now, we are given that the next 3 days were good, neutral, and good. We need to add these 3 days to the total number of good days. 

Total good days = 8 (in the first 30 days) + 3 (in the next 3 days) = 11

However, we are asked to find the number of good days left in the month. Since we are considering the next 3 days as part of the month, we need to subtract these 3 days from the total number of good days.

Good days left in the month = Total good days - 3 = 11 - 3 = 8

"To find out how many books Sally has, we need to work backwards from the information given about Janey. We know Janey has 21 books and that this is 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has.

Let's represent the number of books Sally has as 'x'. We can then write an equation based on the given information:

Janey's books = 2 * Sally's books + 3
21 = 2x + 3

Now, we need to solve for 'x'. To do this, we'll first subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

21 - 3 = 2x + 3 - 3
18 = 2x

Next, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 2 to isolate 'x':

18 / 2 = 2x / 2
9 = x

So, Sally has 9 books.

"To find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches, we need to first convert the initial height from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so we multiply 20 feet by 12 inches per foot.

20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Now, we know the bamboo grows 30 inches a day and it's currently 240 inches tall. To find out how many days it will take to reach 600 inches, we subtract the current height from the target height and divide by the daily growth rate.

600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Now, we divide the remaining height by the daily growth rate.

360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs. This means each dog has 1 toy. When 8 more dogs arrive, James needs 8 more toys to bring the total to 12 dogs with 1 toy each. So, he buys 8 more toys.

Now, there are 12 dogs, and James goes back to find that there are twice as many more dogs, which means there are 2 * 8 = 16 more dogs. This makes a total of 12 + 16 = 28 dogs. Since each dog needs 1 toy, James needs 16 more toys to bring the total to 28 dogs with 1 toy each.

However, when James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs those toys. This means he needs 16 - 3 = 13 more toys.

Initially, James had 4 toys. He bought 8 more toys, then 16 more toys, and finally 13 more toys. So, the total number of toys James needs is 4 + 8 + 16 + 13 = 41.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cookies Max and Summer have. 

Since Katarina has 68 cookies and she has 5 less than Max, Max must have 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.

Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, but we don't know how many cookies the Cookie Monster has. However, we can find out how many cookies Max has in relation to Summer. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Max has 73 - 23 = 50 less cookies than Summer. 

Since Max has 73 cookies, Summer must have 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Now we know the number of cookies each person has: Katarina has 68, Max has 73, and Summer has 96. To find the total number of cookies, we add these numbers together: 68 + 73 + 96 = 237.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes to mow half the lawn in each mode and then add those times together.

First, let's find the time it takes to mow half the lawn in turtle mode. Since it takes 1 hour to mow the entire lawn in turtle mode, it will take 0.5 hours to mow half the lawn. We need to convert this to minutes, so we multiply 0.5 hours by 60 minutes per hour, which is 30 minutes.

Next, let's find the time it takes to mow half the lawn in rabbit mode. Since it takes 40 minutes to mow the entire lawn in rabbit mode, it will take 20 minutes to mow half the lawn.

Now, we add the times together: 30 minutes (turtle mode) + 20 minutes (rabbit mode) = 50 minutes.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how much longer John and Jack have to get to school without being late, we need to calculate the total time they have taken to reach the fire station and subtract that from the total time they have to reach school.

They have 30 minutes to reach school. They have already taken 6 minutes to get to the corner where the library is and another 13 minutes to get to the fire station. 

Total time taken so far = 6 minutes + 13 minutes = 19 minutes

Time left to reach school = Total time to reach school - Time taken so far
= 30 minutes - 19 minutes
= 11 minutes

Therefore, John and Jack have 11 minutes to get to school without being late."

"To find the total number of cookies, we first need to determine how many cookies each person bakes. Greta bakes 30 cookies, and Celinda bakes twice as many, so Celinda bakes 2 * 30 = 60 cookies. 

The total number of cookies is the sum of the cookies baked by Greta and Celinda, which is 30 + 60 = 90 cookies.

After eating 10 cookies, the number of cookies left is 90 - 10 = 80 cookies.

So, there are 80 cookies in the box.

"Let's denote the age of the younger twin as T, the age of the older twin as T+7, and the age of the triplet as t. We know that there are two twins and one triplet, so we can write the equation: 2T + t = 44.

We also know that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so we can write another equation: T = t + 7.

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first one: 2(t + 7) + t = 44.

Expanding the equation, we get: 2t + 14 + t = 44.

Combine like terms: 3t + 14 = 44.

Subtract 14 from both sides: 3t = 30.

Divide both sides by 3: t = 10.

Now that we know the age of the triplet, we can find the age of the older twin: T = t + 7 = 10 + 7 = 17.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find out how many minutes John has to nap, we first need to calculate the total time he spends on homework. 

Math homework: 20 minutes

Total homework time: 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes

John has 3 hours before dinner. We need to convert 3 hours to minutes: 
3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Now, we subtract the total homework time from the total available time to find out how many minutes John has to nap:
180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes

John has 100 minutes to nap."
"To find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we first need to find the cost of one candy. We know that 5 lollipops and 4 candies cost $3.20, and each lollipop costs $0.40. 

First, let's find the total cost of the 5 lollipops: 5 * $0.40 = $2.00

Now, we subtract the cost of the lollipops from the total cost to find the cost of the candies: $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20

Since there are 4 candies, we divide the total cost of the candies by 4 to find the cost of one candy: $1.20 / 4 = $0.30

Now that we know the cost of one candy, we can find the total cost of 10 lollipops: 10 * $0.40 = $4.00

We also know the cost of one candy, so we can find the total cost of 10 candies: 10 * $0.30 = $3.00

Finally, we add the cost of the lollipops and the candies to find the total cost: $4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many coins Rong and Neil save per month. Rong saves 20 coins per month. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, which is 20 + (2/5 * 20) = 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Now, let's calculate the total number of months they have been saving. Since they started saving 10 years ago, and there are 12 months in a year, they have been saving for 10 * 12 = 120 months.

Now, let's calculate the total number of coins Rong and Neil have saved. Rong saves 20 coins per month, so in 120 months, he will have saved 20 * 120 = 2400 coins. Neil saves 28 coins per month, so in 120 months, he will have saved 28 * 120 = 3360 coins.

The total number of coins they have saved is 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins.

The final answer is: 5760"
"To find the total bill, we first need to calculate the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check. The cost of the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40. 

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, which means the total bill is the heartworm check divided by 0.6. Let's call the total bill 'x'. Then, 0.6x = $40 + $20 (vaccines) + heartworm check. However, we don't know the cost of the heartworm check yet, so we'll call it 'y'. 

The total bill is the sum of the vaccines and the heartworm check, which is $40 + y. Since the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, we can write the equation as 0.6($40 + y) = y. 

Solving for y, we get 0.6($40 + y) = y. 
0.6 * $40 + 0.6y = y 
$24 + 0.6y = y 
$24 = y - 0.6y 
$24 = 0.4y 
y = $24 / 0.4 
y = $60 

Now that we know the heartworm check is $60, we can find the total bill by adding the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check. 
Total bill = $40 + $60 = $100 

Since John brought $125 with him, he leaves with $125 - $100 = $25.

The final answer is: $25"
"To find the total price of the crate, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and add them together.

The cost of one banana is twice as much as one apple, so it's 2 * $0.5 = $1.
The cost of one orange is three times as much as one banana, so it's 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of each type of fruit in one crate:
- Bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- Apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- Oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

Adding these costs together, we get the total price of the crate: $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

The final answer is: $32"
"To find the total number of square feet in Brittany's comforter, we need to calculate the total number of squares and multiply it by the area of each square, which is 1 square foot.

First, let's find the number of blue squares. Since there are 4 more blue squares than red squares, and there are 14 red squares, the number of blue squares is 14 + 4 = 18.

Next, let's find the number of green squares. Since there are 6 more green squares than blue squares, and there are 18 blue squares, the number of green squares is 18 + 6 = 24.

Now, let's find the number of white squares. Since there are 12 fewer white squares than green squares, and there are 24 green squares, the number of white squares is 24 - 12 = 12.

Now, let's add up the number of squares of each color: 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68.

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

The final answer is: 68"
"To find out how many chairs Mia needs, we first need to determine the total number of chairs she has. Since there are 8 high chairs and the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs, we can calculate the number of regular chairs by multiplying 8 by 5.

8 high chairs * 5 = 40 regular chairs

Now, we add the number of high chairs and regular chairs to find the total number of chairs.

8 high chairs + 40 regular chairs = 48 chairs

Since there will be 42 adults and 15 babies attending, we need to find the total number of chairs required. Babies will use high chairs, so we add the number of adults and babies.

42 adults + 15 babies = 57 people

Since each person needs a chair, we need 57 chairs in total. To find out how many more chairs Mia needs, we subtract the number of chairs she has from the total number of chairs required.

57 total chairs - 48 available chairs = 9 more chairs

"To find the number of 8-point bucks, we first need to find the total number of bucks in the field. Since 50% of the deer are bucks, we can calculate this as follows:

Total deer = 50
Bucks = 50% of 50 = 0.5 * 50 = 25

Next, we need to find the number of 8-point bucks. Since 20% of the bucks are 8-point, we can calculate this as follows:

8-point bucks = 20% of 25 = 0.2 * 25 = 5

So, there are 5 8-point bucks in the field.

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the total points collected by Adam, Betty, Martha, and Tom, and then subtract that from the minimum threshold of 400 points.

First, let's find Betty's points. Since Betty collected 30% more points than Adam, we can calculate it as follows:
Betty's points = Adam's points + (30% of Adam's points)
Betty's points = 50 + (0.3 * 50)
Betty's points = 50 + 15
Betty's points = 65

Now, let's find Tom's points. We know that Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom, and Martha's points are not given. However, we can express Martha's points in terms of Tom's points:
Martha's points = 3 * Tom's points

We also know that Tom has 30 points less than Betty:
Tom's points = Betty's points - 30
Tom's points = 65 - 30
Tom's points = 35

Now, we can find Martha's points:
Martha's points = 3 * Tom's points
Martha's points = 3 * 35
Martha's points = 105

Now, let's find the total points collected by the class:
Total points = Adam's points + Betty's points + Martha's points + Tom's points
Total points = 50 + 65 + 105 + 35
Total points = 255

To find the points the class is missing, we subtract the total points from the minimum threshold:
Points missing = Minimum threshold - Total points
Points missing = 400 - 255
Points missing = 145

"To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we first need to calculate the total number of fireworks set off in the city and then find 40% of that number. 

The city is setting off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks set off in the city is 15 * 20 = 300.

40% of 300 is 0.4 * 300 = 120.

Hannah will also set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each in her backyard, which is 3 * 5 = 15 fireworks.

So, the total number of fireworks Hannah will see is 120 (from the city) + 15 (from her backyard) = 135.

"To find the total amount spent on snacks and drinks, we first need to determine the total number of people and the total number of items (drinks and snacks) they buy.

Aiden and his 12 friends make 13 people. When they meet up with 7 more friends, the total number of people becomes 13 + 7 = 20.

Each person buys enough drinks and snacks to fill the seats, which means each person buys 2 drinks and 3 snacks. So, the total number of drinks and snacks bought is 20 * 2 (drinks) + 20 * 3 (snacks) = 40 drinks + 60 snacks = 100 items.

Since each item costs $2, the total amount spent on snacks and drinks is 100 items * $2 = $200.

"To find out how many pounds Gary's truck can carry, we first need to determine how much Gordy's truck can carry. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, and Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds, Gordy's truck can carry 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.

Now, we know that the combined capacity of all three trucks is 11,600 pounds. We already know that Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds and Gordy's truck can carry 4,800 pounds. To find out how much Gary's truck can carry, we subtract the combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity of all three trucks.

Gary's truck capacity = Total capacity - (Gissela's capacity + Gordy's capacity)
Gary's truck capacity = 11,600 - (4,000 + 4,800)
Gary's truck capacity = 11,600 - 8,800
Gary's truck capacity = 2,800

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of dumplings each male ate. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, and each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

There are 8 males in the group, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 * 4 = 32.

There are 6 females in the group, and each female ate 3 dumplings, so the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 * 3 = 18.

The total number of dumplings eaten by the group is 32 (by males) + 18 (by females) = 50.

Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is equal to the total number of dumplings eaten by the group, which is 50.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money Gerald initially received from the $100. 

The ratio of the money Gerald and Julia received is 3:2. This means that for every 3 parts Gerald gets, Julia gets 2 parts. The total number of parts is 3 + 2 = 5.

Since Gerald spent $10 on a book, we need to find out how much he initially received. Let's assume the value of 1 part is x. Then, Gerald's share is 3x and Julia's share is 2x.

We know that the total amount of money is $100, so we can set up the equation: 3x + 2x = 100

Combine like terms: 5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5: x = 20

Now that we know the value of 1 part is $20, we can find Gerald's initial amount: 3x = 3 * 20 = 60

Gerald initially received $60. He spent $10 on a book, so he has $60 - $10 = $50 left.

"To find the speed of the turtle, we need to divide the speed of the cat by 5, since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle. 

Speed of the cat = 15 feet/second
Speed of the turtle = Speed of the cat / 5
Speed of the turtle = 15 / 5
Speed of the turtle = 3 feet/second

Now, we can find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds by multiplying its speed by the time.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 3 feet/second * 40 seconds
Distance = 120 feet

"To find out how many hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we need to determine how much more money they need to raise and then divide that by the amount they raise per hour.

First, let's find out how much more money they need to raise: 
$6300 (goal) - $2100 (raised so far) = $4200

Since they raised $2100 in 3 hours, we can find out their hourly rate by dividing the amount raised by the number of hours:
$2100 / 3 hours = $700 per hour

Now, we can divide the remaining amount they need to raise by their hourly rate to find out how many more hours they need to fundraise:
$4200 / $700 per hour = 6 hours

Since they've already raised money for 3 hours, we need to add those hours to the hours they still need to fundraise:
6 hours + 3 hours = 9 hours

"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes, we first need to find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city, and then subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes.

The city uses 40% of the river's water. 

80% of that 40% is used for industrial purposes. To find 80% of 40%, we multiply 0.8 by 0.4, which equals 0.32 or 32%. 

So, 32% of the river's water is used by the city for industrial purposes. 

To find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the industrial percentage from the total city usage: 40% - 32% = 8%.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the rate at which the factory makes chocolate and vanilla ice cream per hour.

For chocolate ice cream, the factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours. To find the rate per hour, we divide the total quarts by the number of hours: 100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts per hour.

For vanilla ice cream, the factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours. To find the rate per hour, we divide the total quarts by the number of hours: 50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now, we need to find the total quarts made in 48 hours. We multiply the rate per hour for each flavor by the total number of hours and add the results together: (50 quarts/hour * 48 hours) + (12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours) = 2400 + 600 = 3000 quarts.

- 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each: 4 x $2.50 = $10.00
- 3 mini quiches at $4.00 apiece: 3 x $4.00 = $12.00
- 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 apiece: 13 x $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items: $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Since Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him 10% off his purchase, we need to calculate the discount amount: 10% of $50.00 = 0.10 x $50.00 = $5.00

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total cost: $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

"To find the total number of taps, we need to calculate the number of taps for each scenario and add them together.

When Helga's arms are at her sides, she taps her right foot at 300 taps per minute and her left foot at 250 taps per minute. The combined rate is 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute.

When her arms are raised, she taps at a rate of 200 taps per minute with each foot. The combined rate is 200 + 200 = 400 taps per minute.

Helga dances for 5 minutes in total, with her arms raised for 2 minutes and her arms at her sides for 3 minutes.

The number of taps when her arms are at her sides is 550 taps/minute * 3 minutes = 1650 taps.

The number of taps when her arms are raised is 400 taps/minute * 2 minutes = 800 taps.

The total number of taps is 1650 + 800 = 2450 taps.

The final answer is: 2450"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole and compare it to the potential damage to Ron's car.

The cost of fixing the pothole includes the fine for unauthorized road maintenance and the cost of the asphalt. 

The fine for unauthorized road maintenance is $120. 
The cost of 3 buckets of asphalt is 3 * $25 = $75.

The total cost of fixing the pothole is $120 + $75 = $195.

The potential damage to Ron's car is $450.

To find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole, we subtract the total cost of fixing the pothole from the potential damage to his car: $450 - $195 = $255.

The final answer is: $255"
"To find the total number of chairs left, we need to subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the total number of chairs initially available.

First, let's find the total number of chairs initially available: 
170 (normal chairs) + 23 (baby chairs) = 193 chairs

Next, let's find the total number of chairs sent for repair: 
20 (normal chairs) + 13 (baby chairs) = 33 chairs

Now, let's subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the total number of chairs initially available: 
193 - 33 = 160

The restaurant has 160 chairs left."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many slices were eaten by Bryce and his friends, and then subtract that from the total number of slices.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 5 people in total, including Bryce, and 2/3 of them ate 2/3 of their pizzas, we can consider 2/3 of 5 people as 10/15 or 2/3. So, 2/3 of the people ate 2/3 of their pizzas.

Since each pizza has 12 slices, and 2/3 of the people ate 2/3 of their pizzas, we can calculate the total number of slices eaten by these people as follows:

(2/3) * (2/3) * 5 * 12 = (4/9) * 60 = 26.67

However, since we can't have a fraction of a slice, we'll round down to 26 slices eaten by Bryce and two friends.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 5 people in total, and 2 friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas, the remaining 2 friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. We can consider 2/3 of 5 people as 10/15 or 2/3, and the remaining 2/3 as 10/15 or 2/3. So, 2/3 of the people ate 2/3 of their pizzas, and the remaining 2/3 of the people ate ¾ of their pizzas.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas, which is (3/4) * 12 = 9 slices each.

So, the total number of slices eaten by the two remaining friends is 9 * 2 = 18.

Now, we can find the total number of slices eaten by all the friends:

26 (eaten by Bryce and two friends) + 18 (eaten by the two remaining friends) = 44

The total number of slices in 5 pizzas is 5 * 12 = 60.

Now, we can find the number of slices left:

60 (total slices) - 44 (slices eaten) = 16

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the average time the cat and dog take to eat the sausages, we first need to determine the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages. 

The cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes. Since the dog eats the same number of sausages in 2/3 the amount of time the cat takes, we can calculate the dog's time as follows:

Dog's time = (2/3) * Cat's time
Dog's time = (2/3) * 30 minutes
Dog's time = 20 minutes

Now, we have the time taken by both the cat and the dog. To find the average time, we add their times and divide by 2:

Average time = (Cat's time + Dog's time) / 2
Average time = (30 minutes + 20 minutes) / 2
Average time = 50 minutes / 2
Average time = 25 minutes

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to first convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

8 feet * 12 inches/foot = 96 inches
Adding the 4 inches, we get:
96 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's represent the length of one of Bobby's shoes as 'x'. Then, the length of one of Topher's shoes can be represented as 9x + 10. We know this is equal to 100 inches, so we can set up the equation:

9x + 10 = 100

Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation gives us:

9x = 90

Dividing both sides of the equation by 9 gives us:

x = 10

So, one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches long.

"To find the total number of windows smashed by Hannah, we need to calculate the number of windows from students' cars and teachers' cars separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of windows from students' cars. There are 64 students' cars with 4 windows each. A quarter of the students' cars' windows are smashed, which is 1/4 * 64 = 16 cars. Since each car has 4 windows, the total number of windows from students' cars is 16 * 4 = 64.

Next, let's find the number of windows from teachers' cars. There are 32 teachers' cars with 2 windows each. Three-fourths of the teachers' cars' windows are smashed, which is 3/4 * 32 = 24 cars. Since each car has 2 windows, the total number of windows from teachers' cars is 24 * 2 = 48.

Now, let's add the number of windows from students' cars and teachers' cars to find the total number of windows smashed by Hannah. 64 + 48 = 112.

The final answer is: 112"
"To find the total number of blue spools, we need to add the number of light blue and dark blue spools. 

Total blue spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60

Next, we need to find the total number of spools. 

Total spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 150

Now, we can find the percentage of blue spools by dividing the total number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of blue spools = (60 / 150) * 100 = 40%

The final answer is: 40"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Initially, 5000 people were in line at 8:00. By midday, 2/5 of them had voted. 

2/5 of 5000 is (2/5) * 5000 = 2000 people who voted by midday.

So, the number of people remaining by midday is 5000 - 2000 = 3000.

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. 

2/3 of 3000 is (2/3) * 3000 = 2000 people who voted by 16:00.

The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 3000 - 2000 = 1000.

The final answer is: 1000"
"To find out how many packs of gum Parker will need, we need to calculate the total number of pieces of gum he will chew in 30 days and then divide that by the number of pieces in a pack.

Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day. To find the total number of pieces he will chew in 30 days, we multiply the number of pieces he chews per day by 30:

4 pieces/day * 30 days = 120 pieces

Now, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces in a pack to find out how many packs he will need:

120 pieces / 15 pieces/pack = 8 packs

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the total number of s'mores needed, we first need to calculate the total number of s'mores required for the kids and the adults separately.

For the kids, 9 kids want 2 s'mores each, so the total number of s'mores needed for the kids is 9 * 2 = 18.

For the adults, 6 adults will eat 1 s'more each, so the total number of s'mores needed for the adults is 6 * 1 = 6.

The total number of s'mores needed is the sum of the s'mores needed for the kids and the adults, which is 18 + 6 = 24.

Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 s'mores, we need to divide the total number of s'mores needed by 8 to find out how many sleeves are required. 24 / 8 = 3.

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we need to divide the total number of sleeves required by 3 to find out how many boxes are needed. 3 / 3 = 1.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the ages of Dora's father and mother. 

Given that Dora is 15 years old, we can find her father's age by using the information that her father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. 

Father's age = 2 * Dora's age + 8
Father's age = 2 * 15 + 8
Father's age = 30 + 8
Father's age = 38

Now, we know that Dora's mother is four years younger than her father. 

Mother's age = Father's age - 4
Mother's age = 38 - 4
Mother's age = 34

To find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we add their ages together.

Total combined age = Dora's age + Father's age + Mother's age
Total combined age = 15 + 38 + 34
Total combined age = 87

"To find the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying, we need to calculate the weight of each book and then add them together.

Cindy has 3 math and science books, so the total weight of these books is 3 x 2 = 6 pounds.

Her French book weighs 4 pounds and her English book weighs 3 pounds.

Her history book weighs twice as much as her English book, so it weighs 2 x 3 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of all the books together: 6 (math and science) + 4 (French) + 3 (English) + 6 (history) = 19 pounds.

"To find the number of votes candidate C received, we first need to determine the number of votes candidate B received. 

Candidate A received 20% of the votes, which is 0.2 * 100 = 20 votes.

Candidate B received 50% more than candidate A's votes, so the number of votes candidate B received is 20 + (50% of 20) = 20 + (0.5 * 20) = 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

Since there were 100 voters in total, the number of votes candidate C received is 100 - (votes received by A + votes received by B) = 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 votes.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many apples Beck has initially. Since Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, and Boris has 100 apples, we can calculate Beck's initial number of apples as follows:

Beck's initial apples = Boris's apples - 23
Beck's initial apples = 100 - 23
Beck's initial apples = 77

Now, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. So, Beck's new number of apples is:

Beck's new apples = Beck's initial apples + 10
Beck's new apples = 77 + 10
Beck's new apples = 87

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris. Boris still has 100 apples, and Beck has 87 apples. So, the difference is:

Difference = Boris's apples - Beck's new apples
Difference = 100 - 87
Difference = 13

For giant cubes: 3 cubes * 4 ounces/cube = 12 ounces
For medium cubes: 7 cubes * 2 ounces/cube = 14 ounces
For small cubes: 8 cubes * 0.5 ounces/cube = 4 ounces

Total water used = 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces

Now, subtract the total water used from the total amount of water available: 
32 ounces - 30 ounces = 2 ounces

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many books Steven has, and then compare Clara's and Alice's book counts.

Since Clara has two times as many books as Steven, and Clara has 20 books, we can set up the equation: 2 * Steven's books = 20. 

To find Steven's books, we divide both sides of the equation by 2: Steven's books = 20 / 2 = 10.

Now we know Steven has 10 books. Since Alice has 6 more books than Steven, we can find Alice's book count by adding 6 to Steven's count: Alice's books = 10 + 6 = 16.

To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract Alice's book count from Clara's: Clara's books - Alice's books = 20 - 16 = 4.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the cost of a half-gallon jar. Since a gallon jar costs $5 and it's $2 more than a half-gallon jar, we can set up an equation:

Gallon jar = Half-gallon jar + $2
5 = Half-gallon jar + 2
Half-gallon jar = 5 - 2
Half-gallon jar = 3

Now that we know the cost of a half-gallon jar, we can find the cost of 16 half-gallon jars:
16 * 3 = 48

Next, we need to find the cost of 10-gallon jars. Since a gallon jar costs $5, we can multiply this by 10:
10 * 5 = 50

Now, we add the cost of 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars to find the total amount of money Cecelia spent:
Total cost = 50 + 48
Total cost = 98

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of students who like to play music. We are given that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number who like to play basketball. Since 5 students like to play basketball, the number of students who like to play music is 2 * 5 = 10.

We know that the total number of students is 50, and 10 like to bake, 5 like to play basketball, and 10 like to play music. To find the number of students who like to play video games, we subtract the number of students who like to bake, play basketball, and play music from the total number of students.

Number of students who like to play video games = Total number of students - (Number of students who like to bake + Number of students who like to play basketball + Number of students who like to play music)

"To find the number of boys in each class, we first need to find the total number of girls in both classes. Since 40% of the students in each class are girls, and there are 80 students in total, we can set up an equation to find the number of students in each class.

Let x be the number of students in each class. Then, 2x = 80 (since there are two classes with the same number of students).

Solving for x, we get x = 80 / 2 = 40.

Now that we know there are 40 students in each class, we can find the number of girls in each class. 40% of 40 is 0.4 * 40 = 16 girls in each class.

Since there are 40 students in each class and 16 are girls, the number of boys in each class is 40 - 16 = 24.

"To find out how much money the tomato vendor saves a week, we need to first calculate the daily savings and then multiply it by 7.

The vendor used to buy 500 tomatoes a day at $.5 each, so his daily cost was 500 * $.5 = $250.

With the new vendor, he buys the same 500 tomatoes at $.4 each, so his new daily cost is 500 * $.4 = $200.

The daily savings is the difference between the old cost and the new cost: $250 - $200 = $50.

To find the weekly savings, we multiply the daily savings by 7: $50 * 7 = $350.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Initially, Lorraine has 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

First, she trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers. 
Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons.

Now, she has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

Next, she trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers. 
Since each large sticker is worth a large button, she gets 20 large buttons.

Now, she has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

She trades the rest of her large stickers (20) for small buttons. 
Since each large sticker is worth three small stickers, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

Now, let's count the total number of buttons she has: 
- 27 small buttons from trading small stickers
- 20 large buttons from trading large stickers
- 60 small buttons from trading large stickers

Total buttons = 27 + 20 + 60 = 107 buttons.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as 'x'. Since the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, the number of votes in favor can be represented as 2x.

The total number of council members is 33, and the sum of votes in favor and against the regulation should equal the total number of council members. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:

3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 11

Since x represents the number of votes against the new regulation, the number of votes in favor is 2x. 

2x = 2 * 11
2x = 22

"To find the total number of hours the 20 playlists will last, we need to first find the total number of songs across all playlists and then multiply that by the length of each song.

The total number of songs across all playlists is the number of songs in one playlist multiplied by the number of playlists: 300 songs/playlist * 20 playlists = 6000 songs.

Since each song is 10 hours long, the total number of hours the playlists will last is the total number of songs multiplied by the length of each song: 6000 songs * 10 hours/song = 60,000 hours.

The final answer is: 60000"
"To find the number of people who think horse #12 will win, we first need to find the number of people who think horse #2 will win and then the number of people who think horse #7 will win.

20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win. To find 20% of 50, we multiply 50 by 0.2.

50 * 0.2 = 10

So, 10 people think horse #2 will win.

Now, we need to find the number of people who think horse #7 will win. 60% of the remaining people think horse #7 will win. The remaining people are 50 - 10 = 40.

60% of 40 is 0.6 * 40 = 24.

So, 24 people think horse #7 will win.

Now, we need to find the number of people who think horse #12 will win. The total number of people who think either horse #2 or horse #7 will win is 10 + 24 = 34.

The number of people who think horse #12 will win is 50 - 34 = 16.

The final answer is: 16"
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given. We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. 

Let's denote the total number of Pomeranians as P. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we can set up the equation:

1/3 * P = 6

To find the total number of Pomeranians, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3:

P = 6 * 3
P = 18

Now that we know there are 18 Pomeranians, and two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can denote the total number of puppies as J. We can set up the equation:

2/3 * J = 18

To find the total number of puppies, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3/2:

J = 18 * (3/2)
J = 27

So, Jana has 27 puppies. 

The final answer is: 27"
"To find out how much more Jayden needs to buy the camera, we first need to calculate how much money he has after receiving the money from his sister. 

Jayden initially had $70. His sister gave him half of her $90 allowance, which is $45. 

So, Jayden now has $70 + $45 = $115.

The camera costs $200. To find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the amount he has from the cost of the camera: $200 - $115 = $85.

Therefore, Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera.

The final answer is: $85"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. 

Let's denote the number of cases of shingles the second house needs as 'x'. Since the first house needs 1/2 of what the second house needs, the first house needs x/2 cases of shingles.

We are given that the third house needs double the first house, so the third house needs 2 * (x/2) = x cases of shingles.

We know that the total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. We can set up an equation to represent this:

x + x/2 + x = 250

To simplify the equation, we can multiply all terms by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + x + 2x = 500

Combine like terms:

5x = 500

Now, divide both sides by 5:

x = 100

Since the third house needs x cases of shingles, and we found that x = 100, the third house needs 100 cases of shingles.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of each person's purchase and then add them together.

Leila buys 3 cucumbers at $2 each, so her total cost is 3 * $2 = $6.

Jack buys 5 tomatoes at $1 each, so his total cost is 5 * $1 = $5.

Chase buys 1 head of lettuce at $3, so his total cost is $3.

Now, let's add their costs together: $6 (Leila) + $5 (Jack) + $3 (Chase) = $14.

The final answer is: $14"
"To find the number of pears George has, we need to calculate 45% of the number of bananas and add it to the number of bananas. 

First, let's find 45% of 200 bananas:
45% of 200 = 0.45 * 200 = 90

Now, let's add this to the number of bananas:
200 (bananas) + 90 (additional pears) = 290

Since George has both bananas and pears, we need to add the number of bananas and pears to find the total number of fruits:
290 (bananas and pears) + 200 (bananas) = 490

The total number of fruits George has is 490."
"To find out how many candy bars Marissa bought for Jimmy, we need to subtract the cost of the ball from the amount of money Marissa had initially. 

Marissa had $80 and spent $20 on the ball. 

$80 (initial money) - $20 (cost of the ball) = $60

Now, we need to find out how many candy bars she can buy with $60, given that each candy bar costs $5.

$60 (remaining money) / $5 (cost of each candy bar) = 12

So, Marissa bought 12 candy bars for Jimmy.

12"
"To find out how much money Sam needs to spend, we first need to determine how many kilograms of oranges are required to make 4 liters of juice. Since Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges to make 1 liter of juice, we can multiply this by 4 to get the total amount of oranges needed for 4 liters.

5 kilograms/orange * 4 liters/orange = 20 kilograms/orange

Now, we know that each kilogram of oranges costs $3. To find the total cost, we multiply the total kilograms of oranges needed by the cost per kilogram.

20 kilograms/orange * $3/orange = $60

So, Sam would have to spend $60 to make 4 liters of juice.

The final answer is: $60"
"To find out how many books Ahmed read, we need to divide the number of books Ezra read by 2, since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed. 

Ezra read 300 books, so Ahmed read 300 / 2 = 150 books.

Now, we need to add the number of books Ezra decided to read to the number of books he already read. Ezra decided to read 150 more books, so we add 150 to 300.

300 + 150 = 450

Now, we need to add the number of books Ahmed read to the total number of books Ezra read. 

450 + 150 = 600

The final answer is: 600"
"To find out how much Tanya earned, we need to calculate her earnings for each day separately and then add them together.

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Since she earns $15 per hour, her total earnings for the hours worked would be 5 hours * $15/hour = $75. Additionally, she earns $5 per day for teaching more than 3 classes, so she earns an extra $5 for Monday. Therefore, her total earnings for Monday are $75 + $5 = $80.

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Her earnings for the hours worked would be 2 hours * $15/hour = $30. Since she teaches less than 3 classes, she does not earn the extra $5 per day. Therefore, her total earnings for Wednesday are $30.

Now, let's add her earnings for both days: $80 (Monday) + $30 (Wednesday) = $110.

The final answer is: $110"
"To find the difference in the number of vanilla scents sold compared to the fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of each type of scent sold.

The company sold 5 vanilla scents and there are 4 vanilla scents available, so the total number of vanilla scents sold is 5 * 4 = 20.

The company sold 2 fruity scents and there are 8 fruity scents available, so the total number of fruity scents sold is 2 * 8 = 16.

Now, we need to find the difference between the total number of vanilla scents sold and the total number of fruity scents sold. 

Difference = Total vanilla scents sold - Total fruity scents sold
Difference = 20 - 16
Difference = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate how much money Bennet will make from selling the eggplants. 

He sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total amount he will make from eggplants is 20 * 3 = $60.

Since Bennet wants to make a total of $135, and he will make $60 from the eggplants, he needs to make $135 - $60 = $75 from selling the corn.

He has 25 ears of corn, and he needs to make $75 from them. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the total amount he needs to make from corn ($75) by the number of ears of corn (25).

$75 / 25 = $3

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To find the total time Tatiana has available for soccer, video games, and reading, we need to add the hours she has on Saturday and Sunday. 

Total time available = 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

She reads for 3 hours, so the remaining time for soccer and video games is:
Remaining time = Total time available - Time spent reading
Remaining time = 12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours

She plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time:
Time spent playing video games = 1/3 * 9 hours = 3 hours

Now, we can find the time spent playing soccer:
Time spent playing soccer = Remaining time - Time spent playing video games
Time spent playing soccer = 9 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours

To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we divide the time spent playing soccer by the total time available and multiply by 100:
Percentage of weekend spent playing soccer = (Time spent playing soccer / Total time available) * 100
Percentage of weekend spent playing soccer = (6 hours / 12 hours) * 100 = 50%

The final answer is: 50"
"To find out how many pencils Anthony kept, we need to follow the steps of the problem.

Anthony started with 50 pencils. He gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon. 

1/2 of 50 is 50 * 0.5 = 25. So, Anthony gave 25 pencils to Brandon. 

Now, Anthony has 50 - 25 = 25 pencils left.

He then gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. 

3/5 of 25 is 25 * 3/5 = 25 * 0.6 = 15. So, Anthony gave 15 pencils to Charlie.

Now, Anthony has 25 - 15 = 10 pencils left.

Therefore, Anthony kept 10 pencils.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time it takes for him to drive to the museum, the time he spends at the museum, and the time it takes for him to drive back home.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Jack to drive to the museum. Since he drives at 75 mph and the distance is 150 miles, we can use the formula time = distance / speed.

Time to drive to the museum = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

Since he spends 6 hours at the museum, we need to add this to the time it takes to drive to the museum to get the total time he is away from home before driving back.

Total time before driving back = 2 hours (to the museum) + 6 hours (at the museum) = 8 hours

Now, we need to calculate the time it takes for Jack to drive back home. Since the distance is the same (150 miles) and his speed is the same (75 mph), we can use the same formula.

Time to drive back home = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

Now, we add the time it takes to drive back home to the total time before driving back to get the total time Jack is gone from home.

Total time Jack is gone from home = 8 hours (before driving back) + 2 hours (driving back) = 10 hours

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of wheels needed for the toys, we need to calculate the number of wheels required for the cars and the motorcycles separately and then add them together.

For the cars, Henry needs 4 wheels for each of the 57 cars. So, the total number of wheels needed for the cars is 57 * 4 = 228.

For the motorcycles, Henry needs 2 wheels for each of the 73 motorcycles. So, the total number of wheels needed for the motorcycles is 73 * 2 = 146.

Now, we add the total number of wheels needed for the cars and the motorcycles: 228 + 146 = 374.

Since Henry has a box with 650 wheels in it, we subtract the total number of wheels needed from the total number of wheels available: 650 - 374 = 276.

The final answer is: 276"
"To find the amount you have to pay after a 20% discount, we need to calculate 20% of the original price and subtract it from the original price.

First, let's find 20% of $1000. 
20% of $1000 = 0.20 * $1000 = $200

Now, subtract the discount from the original price.
$1000 - $200 = $800

So, you have to pay $800 after the discount.

The final answer is: $800"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how many movies are in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of movies in series = Total movies / 3
= 600 / 3
= 200 movies

Now, let's find out how many movies are not in series. This is the remaining movies after subtracting the movies in series from the total:

Remaining movies = Total movies - Movies in series
= 600 - 200
= 400 movies

Next, let's find out how many of these remaining movies are older movies. Since 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of older movies = 40% of 400
= 0.4 * 400
= 160 movies

Now, let's find out how many movies are normal movies. This is the remaining movies after subtracting the older movies from the remaining movies:

Normal movies = Remaining movies - Older movies
= 400 - 160
= 240 movies

Now, let's calculate the cost of the movies in series. Since they cost $6 each, we can calculate this as follows:

Cost of movies in series = Number of movies in series * Cost per movie
= 200 * $6
= $1200

Next, let's calculate the cost of the older movies. Since they cost $5 each, we can calculate this as follows:

Cost of older movies = Number of older movies * Cost per movie
= 160 * $5
= $800

Finally, let's calculate the cost of the normal movies. Since they cost $10 each, we can calculate this as follows:

Cost of normal movies = Number of normal movies * Cost per movie
= 240 * $10
= $2400

Now, let's add up the costs of all the movies to find the total cost:

Total cost = Cost of movies in series + Cost of older movies + Cost of normal movies
= $1200 + $800 + $2400
= $4400

The final answer is: $4400"

The cost of apricots is 6 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $18.00.

Now, we add the costs together: $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00.

The final answer is: $38.00"
"To find the distance to the vacation spot, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by both driving and hiking. 

First, let's find the speed at which they hiked. They drove at 50 miles per hour, and they hiked at 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Half of 50 is 25, and 5 miles per hour less than that is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

The time they spent driving is 6 hours - 1.5 hours = 4.5 hours. The distance they drove is speed multiplied by time, which is 50 * 4.5 = 225 miles.

The time they spent hiking is 1.5 hours, and their hiking speed is 20 miles per hour. The distance they hiked is speed multiplied by time, which is 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

The total distance to the vacation spot is the sum of the driving distance and the hiking distance, which is 225 + 30 = 255 miles.

The final answer is: 255"
"To find the difference in their scores, we need to calculate the points each of them earns from enemies, berries, and the timer.

Let's assume Emma's score from enemies is x. Since Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, Ava's score from enemies will be x + 8.

Emma's score from berries is 3 (since she collects 3 berries), and Ava collects 3 + 3 = 6 berries.

Now, let's consider the timer. The longer Ava takes, the lower her score will be. Since Ava finishes 4 seconds slower than Emma, let's assume Emma finishes the level in t seconds. Then, Ava finishes in t + 4 seconds.

Emma's score from the timer is 30t, and Ava's score from the timer is 30(t + 4).

The total score for Emma is x + 3 + 30t, and the total score for Ava is x + 8 + 6 + 30(t + 4).

Simplifying Ava's total score, we get x + 8 + 6 + 30t + 120 = x + 134 + 30t.

The difference in their scores is (x + 134 + 30t) - (x + 3 + 30t) = 131.

The final answer is: 131"
"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we first need to determine the total cost of the two pizzas that are already known. Since two pizzas cost 30 dollars each, the total cost for these two pizzas is 2 * 30 = 60 dollars.

Now, we subtract the cost of these two pizzas from the total cost of all four pizzas to find the total cost of the other two pizzas. The total cost of all four pizzas is 64 dollars, so the total cost of the other two pizzas is 64 - 60 = 4 dollars.

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we can find the cost of each pizza by dividing the total cost of the other two pizzas by 2. The cost of each of the other two pizzas is 4 / 2 = 2 dollars.

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of times they ride their bikes on usual days and the number of times they ride on the two extra days.

On usual days, they ride their bikes 3 times a day for 5 days. So, the total number of times they ride on usual days is 3 * 5 = 15.

On the two extra days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, which is 2 * 3 = 6 times a day. Since there are two extra days, the total number of times they ride on these days is 6 * 2 = 12.

Now, we add the total number of times they ride on usual days and the extra days to get the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week. 15 + 12 = 27.

"Let's break down the information given:

Initially, Bob had 7 fish in his pond: 3 orange and 4 white.

After buying more fish, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Let's denote the number of white fish he bought as 'x'. The number of orange fish he bought would then be 2x.

The total number of fish in the pond after buying more fish is 7 (initial fish) + 17 (new fish) = 24.

The total number of orange fish in the pond is 3 (initial orange fish) + 2x (new orange fish) = 3 + 2x.

The total number of white fish in the pond is 4 (initial white fish) + x (new white fish) = 4 + x.

Since the total number of fish in the pond is 24, we can set up the equation: 3 + 2x + 4 + x = 24.

Combine like terms: 7 + 3x = 24.

Subtract 7 from both sides: 3x = 17.

Divide both sides by 3: x = 17/3.

However, since we can't have a fraction of a fish, we need to re-examine the problem. The issue here is that the number of fish bought is 17, which is not a multiple of 3. This means that the number of white fish bought must be a whole number.

Let's re-examine the equation: 3 + 2x + 4 + x = 24.

Combine like terms: 7 + 3x = 24.

Subtract 7 from both sides: 3x = 17.

Since 17 is not a multiple of 3, we need to find a number that, when multiplied by 3, is close to 17. However, we know that the number of white fish bought must be a whole number.

Let's try to find a number that, when multiplied by 3, is close to 17. We can try multiplying 3 by 5 and 6: 3 * 5 = 15 and 3 * 6 = 18.

Since 15 is less than 17 and 18 is greater than 17, we can try to find a number that is between 5 and 6. Let's try 5.5, but since we can't have a fraction of a fish, we'll try 5 and 6.

If x = 5, then the number of orange fish bought is 2x = 10. The total number of orange fish in the pond is 3 + 10 = 13. The total number of white fish in the pond is 4 + 5 = 9.

If x = 6, then the number of orange fish bought is 2x = 12. The total number of orange fish in the pond is 3 + 12 = 15. The total number of white fish in the pond is 4 + 6 = 10.

However, we know that the total number of fish in the pond is 24. If x = 5, the total number of fish in the pond is 3 + 10 + 4 + 5 = 22, which is less than 24. If x = 6, the total number of fish in the pond is 3 + 12 + 4 + 6 = 25, which is greater than 24.

Since x = 5 results in a total number of fish less than 24 and x = 6 results in a total number of fish greater than 24, the number of white fish bought must be between 5 and 6.

Let's try x = 5.5. However, since we can't have a fraction of a fish, we'll try to find a number that is between 5 and 6.

"To calculate the weekly fuel consumption, we need to determine the total miles driven per week and then divide it by the car's fuel efficiency.

The one-way distance between home and office is 5 miles, and Andy drives to and from work, so the total distance per day is 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles.

Since Andy drives to work from Monday to Friday, the total miles driven per week is 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.

Now, we can calculate the fuel consumption per week by dividing the total miles driven by the car's fuel efficiency: 50 miles/week / 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week.

The price of regular gas is $3/gallon, so the weekly fuel cost is 5 gallons/week * $3/gallon = $15/week.

The final answer is: $15"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Carrie was given and then subtract the amount she spent.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie was given:

- 10 twenties = 10 x $20 = $200
- 140 quarters = 140 x $0.25 = $35

Total amount of money = $200 + $35 = $235

Carrie spent all the quarters, which is $35, and 3/5 of the twenties. To find 3/5 of the twenties, we multiply $200 by 3/5:

3/5 x $200 = (3/5) x 200 = 3 x 40 = $120

Carrie spent $120 from the twenties and $35 from the quarters, so the total amount she spent is:

Total amount spent = $120 + $35 = $155

The final answer is: $155"

"To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we first need to determine the total percentage of smart TVs and analog TVs sold. 

One-fourth of the TVs are smart TVs, which is 1/4 or 25%. One-eighth of the TVs are analog TVs, which is 1/8 or 12.5%. 

The total percentage of smart and analog TVs sold is 25% + 12.5% = 37.5%. 

Since the rest of the TVs are OLED, we subtract the total percentage of smart and analog TVs from 100% to find the percentage of OLED TVs. 

100% - 37.5% = 62.5%

Now, we can find the number of OLED TVs sold by multiplying the total number of TVs sold (40) by the percentage of OLED TVs (62.5% or 0.625).

Number of OLED TVs sold = 40 * 0.625 = 25

The final answer is: 25"

Total cost of the trip: $300
Amount covered by the school: $150
Amount John has: $50

Amount John is missing: $300 - $150 - $50 = $100

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the temperature at night and then calculate how many logs Carson needs to burn to reach the minimum temperature of 32 degrees.

First, let's find the temperature at night. It's 33 degrees colder during the night compared to the day, and the day temperature is 45 degrees. 

Night temperature = Day temperature - 33
Night temperature = 45 - 33
Night temperature = 12 degrees

Since the pipes will freeze at 32 degrees, Carson needs to heat the house from 12 degrees to 32 degrees. 

Temperature increase needed = 32 - 12
Temperature increase needed = 20 degrees

Each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we divide the temperature increase needed by the heat per log.

Number of logs = Temperature increase needed / Heat per log
Number of logs = 20 / 5
Number of logs = 4

The final answer is: 4"
"To solve this problem, we first need to find the total number of groups formed. Since 90 people were divided into 9-person groups, we can find the total number of groups by dividing 90 by 9.

90 people / 9 people per group = 10 groups

Next, we need to find out how many groups had members bring back 2 seashells each. Since 3/5 of the groups did this, we can multiply the total number of groups by 3/5.

3/5 * 10 groups = 6 groups

Now, we need to find the total number of seashells brought back by these 6 groups. Since each group brought back 2 seashells, we can multiply the number of groups by 2.

6 groups * 2 seashells per group = 12 seashells

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the number of people on the train after the two stops, we need to subtract the number of people who got off and add the number of people who got on.

Initially, there are 172 people on the train.

At the first stop, 47 people get off, so we subtract 47 from 172:
172 - 47 = 125

Then, 13 people get on, so we add 13 to 125:
125 + 13 = 138

At the next stop, 38 people get off, so we subtract 38 from 138:
138 - 38 = 100

Therefore, there are 100 people on the train.

"To find Jamie's total earnings for the day, we need to calculate her earnings for the regular 8 hours and the additional 3 hours. 

Her regular hourly rate is $20. For the first 8 hours, she earns 8 * $20 = $160.

For the additional 3 hours, she is paid 150% of her regular hourly rate. This means she earns 1.5 * $20 = $30 per hour for the additional hours. For 3 hours, she earns 3 * $30 = $90.

To find her total earnings, we add the earnings from the regular hours and the additional hours: $160 + $90 = $250.

"To find the total number of lions in the enclosure, we need to calculate the number of male lions and add it to the number of female lions and lion cubs.

First, we know there are 12 female lions. The number of male lions is half the number of female lions, so the number of male lions is 12 / 2 = 6.

Next, we add the number of male lions to the number of female lions: 12 (female lions) + 6 (male lions) = 18.

Then, we add the number of lion cubs to the total number of adult lions: 18 (adult lions) + 14 (lion cubs) = 32.

The total number of lions in the enclosure is 32."
"To find the amount Mike will have left over after purchasing the jeans, we first need to calculate the discounted price of the jeans. 

The original price of the jeans is $40, and they are 25% off. To find the discount amount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage (25% or 0.25).

Discount = Original Price * Discount Percentage
Discount = $40 * 0.25
Discount = $10

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the discounted price.

Discounted Price = Original Price - Discount
Discounted Price = $40 - $10
Discounted Price = $30

Since Mike pays with a $50 bill, we need to find out how much he will have left over after paying for the jeans.

Amount Left Over = Payment - Discounted Price
Amount Left Over = $50 - $30
Amount Left Over = $20

The final answer is: $20"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to first determine the total number of employees after three months and then multiply that by the monthly salary of each employee.

The company initially has 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. So, after one month, the total number of employees will be 200 + 20 = 220. After two months, it will be 220 + 20 = 240, and after three months, it will be 240 + 20 = 260.

"To find out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we need to calculate their total earnings after working 20 hours.

Billy's initial hourly wage was $10. After 2 months, he got a raise of $0.50 per hour, making his new hourly wage $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. On his first anniversary, he got another raise of $1.00 per hour, making his final hourly wage $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50.

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary, which was $10. So, Sally's starting salary is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. 

Now, let's calculate their total earnings after working 20 hours:

Billy's total earnings = 20 hours * $11.50 per hour = $230
Sally's total earnings = 20 hours * $10.50 per hour = $210

The difference in their earnings is $230 - $210 = $20.

"To find the total number of trees planted by the students, we first need to find the total number of students. 

There are 40 classes with an average of 25 students per class. So, the total number of students is 40 * 25 = 1000.

Each student plants 1 tree, so the total number of trees planted by students is 1000.

Next, we need to find the total number of teachers. There are 40 classes with an average of 3 teachers per class. So, the total number of teachers is 40 * 3 = 120.

Each teacher plants 2 trees, so the total number of trees planted by teachers is 120 * 2 = 240.

Now, we add the total number of trees planted by students and teachers to find the total number of trees planted at the end of the campaign.

Total trees = 1000 (by students) + 240 (by teachers) = 1240.

"To find the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy, we first need to find the total number of stuffed animals she currently has. 

She has 3 puppies, 5 koalas, 2 zebras, and 4 frogs. 

Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Now, we need to find 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. 

30% of 14 = 0.3 * 14 = 4.2

Since Bubbles can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, we'll round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we'll consider the context of the problem. If she buys 5 stuffed goats, the percentage of stuffed goats will be 5/19, which is approximately 26.32%. Since 4.2 is less than 5, we can buy 4 stuffed goats and still be below the 30% threshold. However, to exactly reach 30%, we need to buy 5 stuffed goats.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total hours Kris has played and subtract that from the target of 30 hours.

First, let's calculate the hours Kris played in the first 2 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, 2 weeks is 2 * 7 = 14 days. If Kris plays for half an hour every day, she plays 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours in the first 2 weeks.

Next, let's calculate the hours Kris played in the next week. If Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week, she plays 7 * 2 = 14 hours in the next week.

Now, let's add the hours Kris played in both periods: 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours.

To find out how many hours Kris still needs to play, we subtract the total hours played from the target of 30 hours: 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours and then find the difference between the two distances.

The first car is traveling at 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel:
Distance = Speed x Time = 60 miles/hour x 2 hours = 120 miles

The second car is traveling at 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel:
Distance = Speed x Time = 70 miles/hour x 2 hours = 140 miles

The difference in distance between the two cars is:
Difference = 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

So, after 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car.

"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school.

First, let's find the number of students who passed in each grade level:

- Third-graders: 340 out of 500 passed
- Fourth-graders: 40 out of 100 passed
- Fifth-graders: The pass rate is twice the fourth-graders', so it's 2 * 40 = 80 out of 100 passed

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who passed:
340 (third-graders) + 40 (fourth-graders) + 80 (fifth-graders) = 460 students passed

Next, let's calculate the total number of students in the school:
500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000 students

Now, we can find the overall pass rate:

"To find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we first need to determine how many square inches of mosaic he can make with the glass chips he has. 

Since it takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic, and each bag holds 72 chips, we need to find out how many chips Milo has in total. 

Milo has 2 bags of glass chips, so he has 2 * 72 = 144 chips.

Since it takes 12 chips to make 1 square inch, we can divide the total number of chips by 12 to find out how many square inches Milo can make: 144 / 12 = 12 square inches.

Since Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall, and he can make 12 square inches of mosaic, we can find the length of the mosaic by dividing the total square inches by the height: 12 / 3 = 4 inches.

Therefore, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long.

"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students. 

Four students drank 1.5 quarts each, so the total amount of tea consumed by these students is 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts.

Sixteen students drank 2 quarts each, so the total amount of tea consumed by these students is 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

The total amount of tea consumed is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 10 quarts of tea left, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is 38 + 10 = 48 quarts.

To convert quarts to gallons, we know that 1 gallon is equal to 4 quarts. 

So, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party in gallons is 48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

"To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we first need to determine the total number of candies he has. 

Initially, Dale had 100 candies. He sold 150, so he was left with 100 - 150 = -50 candies. However, this is not possible since you can't have a negative number of candies. This means he must have sold more than he had initially. 

Let's recalculate: Dale initially had 100 candies, but he sold 150, which is more than he had. This means he must have had some candies left from the initial order and then ordered more. 

Since he ended up with a negative number, let's assume he had x candies left after selling 150. Then, he ordered 100 more. So, the equation becomes x + 100 = -50. Solving for x, we get x = -150. This means he had -150 candies left after selling 150, which is not possible.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students at the end of each month and then subtract the initial number of students from it.

At the beginning of the year, there are 10 students.

- At the end of January, the number of students doubles, so there are 10 * 2 = 20 students.
- At the end of February, the number of students doubles again, so there are 20 * 2 = 40 students.
- At the end of March, the number of students doubles again, so there are 40 * 2 = 80 students.
- At the end of April, the number of students doubles again, so there are 80 * 2 = 160 students.
- At the end of May, the number of students doubles again, so there are 160 * 2 = 320 students.

Now, we need to find the number of additional students who joined by the end of May, above and beyond the initial number of students. 

320 (students at the end of May) - 10 (initial students) = 310

The final answer is: 310"
"To find the total number of branches Felix climbed, we need to divide the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch. 

Total money made: $105
Cost per branch: $0.25

Total branches climbed = Total money made / Cost per branch
Total branches climbed = $105 / $0.25
Total branches climbed = 420

Since Felix worked during the week (7 days), we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day.

Average branches per day = Total branches climbed / Number of days
Average branches per day = 420 / 7
Average branches per day = 60

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the total number of petals, we need to calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers and then subtract the petals that were lost.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals from each set of flowers:

- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 * 5 = 15 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 * 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 * 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 * 7 = 42 petals

Now, let's add up the total number of petals: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

However, Rose dropped 1 petal from each set of flowers, so we need to subtract the total number of petals lost: 1 * 4 = 4 petals

Now, let's subtract the petals lost from the total number of petals: 101 - 4 = 97 petals

The final answer is: 97"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many marshmallows are left after John and DeSean make their S'mores and account for the ones they dropped. 

First, let's calculate the total number of marshmallows used by John and DeSean. Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, and they each made 9 S'mores, the total number of marshmallows used is 9 + 9 = 18.

However, they also dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground, so we need to subtract those from the total number of marshmallows used. But since we are trying to find out how many marshmallows are left, we should subtract the total number of marshmallows used from the initial number of marshmallows in the bag. 

So, the total number of marshmallows left is 35 - (18 + 3) = 35 - 21 = 14.

Since there are 14 marshmallows left, and there are two kids, we need to divide the remaining marshmallows by 2 to find out how many each kid can have. 

14 / 2 = 7

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time each person plays and then determine how many quarters are used.

Jack can play for 20 minutes. His two friends who are worse can play for half as long, which is 20 / 2 = 10 minutes. The friend who is better can play for 1.5 times as long, which is 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes.

Since they play for 4 hours, we need to convert this to minutes: 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the total time each person plays:

- Jack: 240 minutes
- Two worse friends: 2 * 10 minutes = 20 minutes each, so 2 * 20 minutes = 40 minutes total
- Better friend: 240 minutes

Now, let's calculate the total time played by all friends: 240 (Jack) + 40 (worse friends) + 240 (better friend) = 520 minutes.

Since Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter, we need to calculate how many 20-minute intervals are in 520 minutes: 520 / 20 = 26.

However, we need to account for the fact that the better friend plays for 30 minutes, which is 1.5 times 20 minutes. So, we need to calculate how many 30-minute intervals are in 240 minutes: 240 / 30 = 8.

Since the better friend plays for 30 minutes, we need to add 1.5 quarters for each 30-minute interval. So, 8 * 1.5 = 12 quarters for the better friend.

For the other two friends, they play for 10 minutes each, which is half of 20 minutes. We need to calculate how many 10-minute intervals are in 40 minutes: 40 / 10 = 4.

Since each 10-minute interval costs 1 quarter, we need 4 quarters for each of the two worse friends, so 2 * 4 = 8 quarters.

Now, let's calculate the total quarters used: 26 (for Jack) + 8 (for the two worse friends) + 12 (for the better friend) = 46 quarters.

Since each quarter costs $0.25, the total amount of money used is: 46 * $0.25 = $11.50

The final answer is: $11.50"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. 

Let's denote the amount of citrus zest as Z, the amount of fragrance as F, the amount of salt as S, the amount of sugar as Su, and the amount of oil as O.

We are given that Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, so F = Z.

We are also given that she uses the same amount of salt as sugar, so S = Su.

Additionally, she uses twice as much oil as salt, so O = 2S.

And she uses twice as much salt as zest, so S = 2Z.

Since F = Z, we can substitute F with Z in the equation S = 2Z, resulting in S = 2Z.

Now we have two equations: S = 2Z and S = Su. Since S = 2Z and S = Su, we can set 2Z = Su.

We are also given that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces. The total amount of the mixture is the sum of the amounts of all the ingredients: O + F + S + Su + Z.

Since F = Z, we can substitute F with Z in the total amount equation, resulting in O + Z + S + Su + Z.

We know that S = 2Z and S = Su, so we can substitute S with 2Z and Su with 2Z in the total amount equation, resulting in O + Z + 2Z + 2Z + Z.

Combine like terms: O + 6Z.

We are given that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, so we can set up the equation O + 6Z = 10.

We are also given that O = 2S and S = 2Z. We can substitute O with 2S and S with 2Z in the equation O + 6Z = 10, resulting in 2S + 6Z = 10.

Since S = 2Z, we can substitute S with 2Z in the equation 2S + 6Z = 10, resulting in 2(2Z) + 6Z = 10.

Simplify the equation: 4Z + 6Z = 10.

Combine like terms: 10Z = 10.

Divide both sides by 10: Z = 1.

Now that we know Z = 1, we can find S by substituting Z into the equation S = 2Z, resulting in S = 2(1) = 2.

Since O = 2S, we can substitute S with 2 into the equation O = 2S, resulting in O = 2(2) = 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total amount of money John spent, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows separately and then add them together.

The cost of the goats is 3 * $500 = $1500.
The cost of the cows is 2 * $1500 = $3000.

Now, we add the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows together: $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

The final answer is: $4500"
"To find out how many more cupcakes Paul needs to buy, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs.

First, let's add the number of chocolate and toffee cupcakes Paul already has: 
8 (chocolate cupcakes) + 40 (toffee cupcakes) = 48 cupcakes

Now, let's subtract the number of cupcakes Paul already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs:
63 (total cupcakes needed) - 48 (cupcakes Paul already has) = 15

So, Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes.

The final answer is: 15"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

2. Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find 20% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.2: 40 * 0.2 = 8. So, Joe sells 8 cars.

3. Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars to his mother.

4. Now, let's find out how many cars Joe has left. Initially, he had 40 cars. He sold 8 and gave away 16. So, the total number of cars he gave away or sold is 8 + 16 = 24.

5. To find out how many cars Joe has left, we subtract the total number of cars he gave away or sold from the initial number of cars: 40 - 24 = 16.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to first determine the total amount raised by the students. Since the charity raised a total of $175,000 and $50,000 came from organizations, the amount raised by the students is $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000.

Now, we know that there are 20 students and they all earn the same amount. To find out how much each student raised, we divide the total amount raised by the number of students: $125,000 / 20 = $6,250.

The final answer is: $6,250"
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked on the first day and the second day, and then add them together.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. 

On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she walked on the first day, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

To find the total time in minutes, we need to convert the hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

8 hours = 8 * 60 = 480 minutes
4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes

Now, we add the time from both days:
480 minutes + 240 minutes = 720 minutes

The final answer is: 720"
"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to first determine the total number of cars in the parking lot after the first break. Initially, there were 50 cars. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, so the total number of cars after the first break is 50 + 20 = 70.

When Hunter got out of class for the lunch break, he realized that 1/2 the number of cars in the parking lot had gone. This means that 1/2 of 70 cars left, and the remaining 1/2 stayed. To find the number of cars that left, we multiply 70 by 1/2, which is 35. 

So, the number of cars that left is 35. To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to subtract the number of cars that left from the total number of cars after the first break. The total number of cars after the first break is 70, and the number of cars that left is 35. 

The total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is 70 - 35 = 35. 

The final answer is: 35"
"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of tasks he completes in a day and then multiply it by the number of days he works in a week.

John does 30 cycles of work a day, and each cycle has 5 different tasks. So, the total number of tasks he completes in a day is:
30 cycles/day * 5 tasks/cycle = 150 tasks/day

Since each task pays $1.20, the total amount John makes in a day is:
150 tasks/day * $1.20/task = $180/day

John works a full 7-day week, so the total amount he makes in a week is:
$180/day * 7 days = $1260

The final answer is: $1260"
"To find the total points scored by Sasha, we need to calculate her points in both games. 

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. 

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points. Therefore, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

To find the total points scored by Sasha, we add her points from both games: 14 + 4 = 18.

The final answer is: 18"
"To find the total number of tins of cat food, we multiply the number of packages of cat food by the number of tins per package: 8 * 11 = 88 tins of cat food.

To find the total number of tins of dog food, we multiply the number of packages of dog food by the number of tins per package: 6 * 6 = 36 tins of dog food.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of tins of cat food and dog food: 88 - 36 = 52.

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as 'x'. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is 341, which is the sum of the cards Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have. Therefore, we can write the equation: x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341.

Combine like terms: 7x + 12 = 341.

Subtract 12 from both sides: 7x = 329.

Divide both sides by 7: x = 47.

Since PJ has x cards, PJ has 47 cards. Smendrick has 3x cards, so Smendrick has 3 * 47 = 141 cards. Becca has 3x + 12 cards, so Becca has 3 * 47 + 12 = 147 cards.

"To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color of eggs and then add them together.

Cindy had 5 green eggs. 
She had twice as many blue eggs as green ones, so she had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.
She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.
She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add the number of eggs of each color together: 5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27.

The final answer is: 27"
"To calculate the total cost of shipping, we need to calculate the cost per pound and the cost per mile, then multiply them by their respective weights and distances. 

The cost per pound is $0.35, and the book weighs 4 pounds, so the cost for the weight is 4 * $0.35 = $1.40. 

The cost per mile is $0.08, and the book needs to be returned 20 miles away, so the cost for the distance is 20 * $0.08 = $1.60.

The total shipping cost is $1.40 + $1.60 = $2.00.

The book cost $32, but Amazon will only refund 75% of the purchase price, so the refund amount is 0.75 * $32 = $24.

The total amount Milly will lose is the shipping cost minus the refund amount, which is $2.00 - $24 = -$22.00. However, since we can't lose a negative amount of money, we need to recalculate the refund amount as the loss. 

The loss is the shipping cost minus the refund amount, which is $2.00 - $24 = -$22.00. To find the actual loss, we need to find the difference between the refund amount and the book's cost. The actual loss is $32 - $24 = $8. 

The final answer is: $8"
"To find out how much money Mulan has left, we need to calculate the total amount of money she spent and subtract that from the total amount of money she had initially.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Mulan spent:

- Two pairs of jeans at $30 each will be 2 x $30 = $60.
- A bag for $20.

Total money spent = $60 (jeans) + $20 (bag) = $80.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Mulan has left:

Initial amount of money = $40 (initially) + $100 (from her father) = $140.
Total money spent = $80.

Money left = Initial amount of money - Total money spent
= $140 - $80
= $60.

The final answer is: $60"
"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the production for the first three weeks and then determine the pattern.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.
In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.
In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Now, let's add up the production for the first three weeks: 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in total each month, we can find out how much he produces in the fourth week by subtracting the production of the first three weeks from the total production: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

The final answer is: 14,000"
"To find the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends on TikTok in a week and then multiply it by 4.

First, let's calculate the time Britany spends on TikTok in a week:

- She records 18 videos, each taking 4 minutes. So, the total time spent recording videos is 18 * 4 = 72 minutes.
- She spends 2 hours writing songs, which is 2 * 60 = 120 minutes.
- She spends 15 minutes each day for 6 days on makeup, so the total time spent on makeup is 15 * 6 = 90 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time spent on TikTok-related activities in a week:
72 (recording) + 120 (writing songs) + 90 (makeup) = 282 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 282 minutes to hours:
282 / 60 = 4.7 hours

Now, let's multiply the time spent on TikTok in a week by 4 to find the time spent in a month:
4.7 hours/week * 4 weeks/month = 18.8 hours

The final answer is: 18.8"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to first determine the cost of the initial installation and then add the cost of the additional items.

The initial installation includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. However, Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures that she needs installed. Since the initial installation already includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, and 1 chandelier, we only need to consider the additional items.

Angela has 2 extra mirrors (6 - 4 = 2), 1 extra chandelier (2 - 1 = 1), and 10 extra pictures (20 - 10 = 10). The cost of the initial installation is $129.00.

The cost of the additional items is $15.00 per item. So, the total cost of the additional items is:
2 (mirrors) + 1 (chandelier) + 10 (pictures) = 13 items
13 items * $15.00 per item = $195.00

Now, we add the cost of the initial installation and the cost of the additional items:
$129.00 (initial installation) + $195.00 (additional items) = $324.00

The final answer is: $324.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much money Anthony has saved, and then calculate 40% more than that amount.

First, we know that Eva has saved $20.00. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, so Anthony has saved $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.

Since Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony, we need to find 40% of $30.00 and add it to $30.00. 

40% of $30.00 is 0.4 x $30.00 = $12.00. 

So, Roy has saved $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

The final answer is: $42.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the ratio of Naruto's lifting ability to Pompei's lifting ability. 

First, we know that Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, and Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch. So, Saskay can lift a mountain 12 inches.

Next, we know that Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, and Saskay can lift a mountain 12 inches. So, Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Then, we know that Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, and Kagiyami can lift a mountain 48 inches. So, Naruto can lift a mountain 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches). So, Naruto can lift a mountain 480 / 12 = 40 feet.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find the total distance traveled by Mason, we need to calculate the distance covered in the first 4 hours and the distance covered in the next 6 hours, and then add them together.

Distance = Speed x Time

For the first 4 hours:
Distance = 8 miles/hour x 4 hours = 32 miles

For the next 6 hours:
Distance = 8 miles/hour x 6 hours = 48 miles

Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the speed of the kangaroos. Since it takes 3 kangaroos 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can assume that the total distance is the same for all animals. Let's denote the speed of a kangaroo as 's'. The total distance traveled by the 3 kangaroos is 3s * 18 hours.

Now, we need to find the speed of the turtles, which is half the speed of a kangaroo. So, the speed of a turtle is s/2.

Since the distance remains the same, we can set up a proportion to find the time it takes for the turtles to travel the same distance. Let 't' be the time it takes for the turtles to travel the distance.

The distance traveled by the 3 kangaroos is equal to the distance traveled by the 4 turtles. So, we can set up the equation:

3s * 18 = 4 * (s/2) * t

Simplifying the equation, we get:

54s = 2st

Dividing both sides by 2s, we get:

27 = t

So, it will take the 4 turtles 27 hours to travel across the highway.

The final answer is: 27"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many dishes Jada and Rory made. 

Since Kora made 20 dishes, and Rory made 20 more than Kora, Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.

Jada made twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

Now, we need to add up the number of dishes made by all three: Kora (20), Rory (40), and Jada (80).

20 + 40 + 80 = 140

The final answer is: 140"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Erika has after receiving her payment and her mom's contribution. 

First, let's calculate the price of the new laptop after trading in her old one: 
$600 (original price) - $200 (discount) = $400

Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, so she must have $400 - $50 = $350.

She received $150 from her part-time job and $80 from her mom, so the total amount she received is $150 + $80 = $230.

Now, let's subtract the total amount she received from the amount she needs to buy the laptop: 
$350 (amount needed) - $230 (amount received) = $120

This means Erika already had $120 in her purse before receiving any money.

The final answer is: $120"
"To find out how many slices Adam has left, we first need to calculate the total number of slices he has. 

First, let's calculate the number of slices from the large apples. Since a large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces, and Adam has 3 large apples, the total number of slices from large apples is 3 * 5 = 15.

Next, let's calculate the number of slices from the small apples. Since a small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces, and Adam has 5 small apples, the total number of slices from small apples is 5 * 3 = 15.

Now, we add the number of slices from the large and small apples to get the total number of slices Adam has. 15 (large) + 15 (small) = 30.

Adam eats 15 slices, so to find out how many slices are left, we subtract the number of slices eaten from the total number of slices. 30 - 15 = 15.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find out how many cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to determine the total amount of milk the farmer currently produces. Since he extracts 5 liters of milk a day from each cow and he has 3 cows, the total amount of milk he currently produces is 5 * 3 = 15 liters.

Now, we need to find out how many cows he needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day. To do this, we can divide the target amount of milk (25 liters) by the amount of milk each cow produces (5 liters). 

25 / 5 = 5 cows. 

However, the farmer already has 3 cows, so we need to find out how many more cows he needs. 

5 (total cows needed) - 3 (cows he already has) = 2.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the length of each used portion and subtract it from the original length of the glue stick.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so the used portion is 1 - 1/6 = 5/6. The length of the used portion is 5/6 * 12 mm = 10 mm.

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so the used portion is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3. The length of the used portion is 1/3 * 12 mm = 4 mm.

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so the used portion is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2. The length of the used portion is 1/2 * 12 mm = 6 mm.

Now, let's calculate the total length of the used portions: 10 mm + 4 mm + 6 mm = 20 mm.

The total length of the glue sticks is 3 * 12 mm = 36 mm.

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 36 mm - 20 mm = 16 mm.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. Since Jack has an unknown number of socks, let's call it 'x'. Then, Peter has 2x socks.
4. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so the number of socks Jack has is 60 / 2 = 30.
5. Now we know that Peter has 2x socks and Jack has 30 socks. Since Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, we can set up the equation 2x = 30. Solving for x, we get x = 15.
6. So, Jack has 30 socks and Peter has 2x = 2 * 15 = 30 socks.
7. The total number of socks is 30 (Jack's socks) + 30 (Peter's socks) = 60 socks.
8. The total number of dishes is 30 (Peter's dishes) + 60 (Jack's dishes) = 90 dishes.

The total number of socks and dishes together is 60 + 90 = 150."
"To find the number of students good at math, we need to consider the total number of students and the number of students good at both subjects. 

Let's denote the number of students good at both math and English as x. We know that the total number of students is 20, and the number of students good at math only is 5, and the number of students good at English only is 8.

We can set up an equation based on the total number of students:

Total students = Students good at math only + Students good at English only + Students good at both

20 = 5 + 8 + x

Simplifying the equation:

20 = 13 + x

Subtract 13 from both sides:

7 = x

This means that 7 students are good at both math and English. To find the total number of students good at math, we need to add the number of students good at math only (5) and the number of students good at both (7):

Students good at math = Students good at math only + Students good at both

"To solve this problem, we need to understand that it's a simple interest scenario. The interest rate is 3/4 of the original amount per year, which can be expressed as 0.75 or 75% of the principal amount.

The formula for simple interest is: A = P(1 + rt), where A is the total amount, P is the principal amount, r is the interest rate, and t is the time period in years.

Given that the principal amount (P) is $300, the interest rate (r) is 0.75, and the time period (t) is 3 years, we can plug these values into the formula:

A = 300(1 + 0.75*3)
A = 300(1 + 2.25)
A = 300(3.25)
A = 975

The total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is $975.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of white shirts with no collars and the number of floral shirts with no buttons.

First, let's find the number of white shirts with collars. Since half of the white shirts have collars, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of white shirts with collars = Total number of white shirts / 2
= 40 / 2
= 20

Now, let's find the number of white shirts with no collars:

Number of white shirts with no collars = Total number of white shirts - Number of white shirts with collars
= 40 - 20
= 20

Next, let's find the number of floral shirts with buttons. We are given that 20 of the floral shirts have buttons.

Now, let's find the number of floral shirts with no buttons:

Number of floral shirts with no buttons = Total number of floral shirts - Number of floral shirts with buttons
= 50 - 20
= 30

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars:

Difference = Number of floral shirts with no buttons - Number of white shirts with no collars
= 30 - 20
= 10

"To find out how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we first need to determine the total number of glue sticks required. Since each student needs 2 glue sticks and there are 27 students, the total number of glue sticks needed is 27 * 2 = 54.

Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks required by the number of glue sticks per pack to find out how many packs are needed. However, since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs and expects to have some extra glue sticks left over, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.

To do this, we can divide 54 by 8, which gives us 6.75. Since we can't buy a fraction of a pack, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 7.

Therefore, Mr. Jackson will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water passing through the river at the given point over the three days.

On the first day, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

On the second day, the amount of water passing through the river doubles, so it becomes 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.

On the third day, the amount of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons, so it becomes 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

To find the total amount of water passing through the river at that point over the three days, we need to add the amounts from each day: 4000 + 8000 + 14000 = 24000 gallons.

The total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 24000 gallons.

The final answer is: 24000"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of exponential growth, as the number of infected people increases by a fixed factor each day.

Day 1: 10 people are initially infected. Each of them infects 6 others, so the total number of infected people becomes 10 + (10 * 6) = 10 + 60 = 70.

Day 2: The 70 infected people from Day 1 infect 6 others each, so the total number of infected people becomes 70 + (70 * 6) = 70 + 420 = 490.

Day 3: The 490 infected people from Day 2 infect 6 others each, so the total number of infected people becomes 490 + (490 * 6) = 490 + 2940 = 3430.

Therefore, after three days, there are 3430 people infected.

"To find out how much money Julieta received, we need to calculate 10% of Rafaela's total tips and subtract that from Rafaela's total tips. 

Rafaela received 40 * $20 = $800 in tips. 

10% of $800 is 0.1 * $800 = $80. 

So, Julieta received $800 - $80 = $720 in tips.

Now, to find the total amount of money they received altogether, we add Rafaela's and Julieta's tips: $800 + $720 = $1520.

The final answer is: $1520"
"To find out how many oranges Jennifer remained with, we need to calculate the total number of oranges given to her children.

Next, we add the oranges given to her son: 6 oranges + 3 oranges = 9 oranges.

Now, we subtract the total number of oranges given away from the initial number of oranges Jennifer bought: 12 oranges - 9 oranges = 3 oranges.

So, Jennifer remained with 3 oranges.

The final answer is: 3"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Claire earns 1 badge per month.
- Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge than Claire, so Amber earns 1/2 badge per month.
- Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so Wendy earns 3 badges per month.

In a 1-year time frame (12 months), the number of badges earned by each person would be:
- Claire: 1 badge/month * 12 months = 12 badges
- Amber: 0.5 badges/month * 12 months = 6 badges
- Wendy: 3 badges/month * 12 months = 36 badges

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a 1-year time frame, we subtract the number of badges earned by Amber from the number of badges earned by Wendy:
36 badges (Wendy) - 6 badges (Amber) = 30 badges

The final answer is: 30"
"To find out how much Paige raised, we need to calculate the total number of slices she baked and sold. 

First, let's find out how many hours she baked. She baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is 5 hours.

Since she can bake 2 loaves per hour, and each hour she baked for 5 hours, she baked a total of 2 * 5 = 10 loaves.

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices is 10 * 8 = 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, and she sold all 80 slices. To find the total amount raised, we need to convert the total number of slices to dollars. 

Since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents, we can convert 50 cents to dollars by dividing by 100. So, 50 cents is equal to 0.5 dollars.

Now, we multiply the number of slices by the price per slice: 80 * 0.5 = 40 dollars.

The final answer is: $40"
"To find the total number of coins Gretchen has, we need to determine the number of silver coins first. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, and Gretchen has 70 gold coins, we can set up an equation to find the number of silver coins.

Let's denote the number of silver coins as 'x'. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins can be represented as 'x + 30'. We know that the number of gold coins is 70, so we can set up the equation:

x + 30 = 70

To solve for 'x', we subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:

x = 70 - 30
x = 40

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins. To find the total number of coins, we add the number of gold coins and silver coins:

Total coins = 70 (gold coins) + 40 (silver coins)
Total coins = 110

The final answer is: 110"
"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we first need to determine the total number of burritos consumed. 

There were 50 students at the picnic, and each student was given 10 burritos. So, the total number of burritos given to the students is 50 * 10 = 500.

Mr. George also ate 20 burritos. Therefore, the total number of burritos consumed is 500 (by students) + 20 (by Mr. George) = 520.

Since there were 600 burritos ordered initially, the total number of leftover burritos is 600 - 520 = 80.

"To find the number of yellow cars, we first need to determine the number of green and blue cars. 

We know there are 12 red cars. The rink has 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so the number of green cars is 12 - 2 = 10.

The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars, so the number of blue cars is 3 * 10 = 30.

Now, we know the total number of red, green, and blue cars: 12 (red) + 10 (green) + 30 (blue) = 52.

Since the rink has 75 cars in total, the number of yellow cars is 75 - 52 = 23.

"Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as F, the number of books Anne has as A, and the number of books Sofie has as S. 

We are given the following information:
1. S + A + F = 85 (The total number of books is 85)
2. S = A + 25 (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. A = F - 12 (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

We can substitute the second equation into the first one to get:
(A + 25) + A + F = 85
Combine like terms:
2A + 25 + F = 85

Now, we can substitute the third equation into the above equation to get:
2(F - 12) + 25 + F = 85
Expand the equation:
2F - 24 + 25 + F = 85
Combine like terms:
3F + 1 = 85

Subtract 1 from both sides:
3F = 84

Divide both sides by 3:
F = 28

"To find out how much Greg will spend on Jello, we first need to determine how many Jello cups he needs to buy. Since there will be 30 kids and each kid will have 4 Jello cups, the total number of Jello cups needed is 30 * 4 = 120.

Since one 3-ounce box of Jello makes 10 small Jello cups, we need to find out how many boxes of Jello Greg needs to buy. To do this, we divide the total number of Jello cups needed by the number of Jello cups one box makes: 120 / 10 = 12.

Now that we know Greg needs 12 boxes of Jello, we can calculate the total cost. Each box costs $1.25, so the total cost will be 12 * $1.25 = $15.

The final answer is: $15"

"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we first need to determine how much Keenan spends in a month. Since Madeline pays 60% of the total cost, Keenan pays the remaining 40%. 

First, let's calculate Keenan's monthly expenditure: 
Total monthly expenditure = $400
Madeline's monthly expenditure = 60% of $400 = 0.6 * $400 = $240
Keenan's monthly expenditure = Total monthly expenditure - Madeline's monthly expenditure
Keenan's monthly expenditure = $400 - $240 = $160

Now, we need to find out how much Keenan spends per week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we can divide Keenan's monthly expenditure by 4:
Keenan's weekly expenditure = Keenan's monthly expenditure / 4
Keenan's weekly expenditure = $160 / 4
Keenan's weekly expenditure = $40

The final answer is: $40"
"To find out how many pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to calculate the total number of pieces he ate on each day and add them up.

On the first day, he ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces. To find 2/5 of 60, we multiply 60 by 2 and divide by 5:
60 * 2 = 120
120 / 5 = 24

So, on the first day, he ate 24 pieces.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces. To find the remaining pieces after the first two days, we subtract the pieces eaten on the first two days from the total:
60 - 24 - 10 = 26

Now, we need to find 7/13 of 26:
26 * 7 = 182
182 / 13 = 14.15 (round to 14 since we can't eat a fraction of a piece)

So, on the third day, he ate 14 pieces.

Now, let's add up the pieces eaten on each day:
24 (first day) + 10 (second day) + 14 (third day) = 48

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water, we first need to determine the cost per bottle of soda and the cost per bottle of water.

The cost of 7 bottles of soda is $21.00, so the cost per bottle of soda is $21.00 / 7 = $3.00 per bottle.

The cost of 4 bottles of water is $8.00, so the cost per bottle of water is $8.00 / 4 = $2.00 per bottle.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:

Cost of 3 bottles of soda = 3 * $3.00 = $9.00
Cost of 2 bottles of water = 2 * $2.00 = $4.00

Total cost = $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00

The cost of each bolt is $0.03, and David wants to buy 16 bolts. 

Total cost = Number of bolts * Cost per bolt
Total cost = 16 * $0.03
Total cost = $0.48

Now, we subtract the total cost from the initial amount of money David has:

Initial amount = $12.48
Total cost = $0.48
Amount left = Initial amount - Total cost
Amount left = $12.48 - $0.48
Amount left = $12.00

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To find out how much Ella would earn after 12 hours of dog walking at the same rate, we need to first determine her hourly rate. 

We know that Ella earned $33 for 3 hours of dog walking. To find her hourly rate, we can divide the total amount earned by the number of hours worked.

Hourly rate = Total amount earned / Number of hours worked
Hourly rate = $33 / 3 hours
Hourly rate = $11 per hour

Now that we know her hourly rate, we can calculate how much she would earn after 12 hours of dog walking.

Total earnings after 12 hours = Hourly rate * Number of hours worked
Total earnings after 12 hours = $11 per hour * 12 hours
Total earnings after 12 hours = $132

"To find out how many marbles Paul has left, we need to follow the sequence of events.

Initially, Paul has 52 marbles. His friend gave him 28 marbles, so now he has 52 + 28 = 80 marbles.

Then, he lost 1/4 of his marbles. To find 1/4 of 80, we multiply 80 by 1/4, which is the same as dividing 80 by 4. 

80 / 4 = 20

So, Paul lost 20 marbles. To find out how many marbles he has left, we subtract 20 from the total number of marbles he had after receiving the gift from his friend.

80 - 20 = 60

Therefore, Paul has 60 marbles left.

"To find Amy's total score, we need to calculate the points she earns from each type of question and add them together.

First, let's calculate the points from the multiple-choice questions. Amy correctly answers 80% of the 10 multiple-choice questions, so she gets 0.8 * 10 = 8 questions correct. Since each question is worth 1 point, she earns 8 points from the multiple-choice questions.

Next, let's calculate the points from the true/false questions. Amy correctly answers 90% of the 20 true/false questions, so she gets 0.9 * 20 = 18 questions correct. Since each question is worth 1 point, she earns 18 points from the true/false questions.

Finally, let's calculate the points from the long-answer questions. Amy correctly answers 60% of the 5 long-answer questions, so she gets 0.6 * 5 = 3 questions correct. Since each question is worth 5 points, she earns 3 * 5 = 15 points from the long-answer questions.

"To find out how much money Isaias bought the chickens for, we first need to determine how many chickens he plans to sell. Since he has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them, we can calculate the number of chickens he plans to sell as follows:

Number of chickens to sell = 300 * (3/5)
= 300 * 0.6
= 180 chickens

Now, we know that Isaias plans to sell 180 chickens at $50 per chicken. To find the total revenue, we multiply the number of chickens by the price per chicken:

Total revenue = 180 * $50
= $9000

Since Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000, we can set up an equation to find the total cost of the chickens:

Total revenue - Total cost = Profit
$9000 - Total cost = $2000
Total cost = $7000

Therefore, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for sale for $7000.

The final answer is: $7000"

Since Julie sold 14 glasses, we can find out how many more glasses she sold than Micah by subtracting the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold.

Glasses sold by Julie = 14
Glasses sold by Micah = 16
Difference = Glasses sold by Julie - Glasses sold by Micah = 14 - 16 = -2

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Sarah will get from selling the rope. The rope is 20 meters long, and her friend wants to buy it for $2 a meter. 

Total money from selling the rope = Length of the rope * Price per meter
Total money from selling the rope = 20 * 2
Total money from selling the rope = 40

Now, let's calculate the cost of the new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 a meter, and Sarah wants to buy a rope of the same length (20 meters).

Cost of the new rope = Length of the new rope * Price per meter
Cost of the new rope = 20 * 1.5
Cost of the new rope = 30

Now, let's calculate how much money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope.

Money left over = Total money from selling the rope - Cost of the new rope
Money left over = 40 - 30
Money left over = 10

The final answer is: $10"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Melanie's current age. Since in 10 years, she will be 18 years old, we can subtract 10 from 18 to find her current age.

Current age = 18 - 10 = 8 years

Now, we need to find the number of years it will take for her age to be thrice her current age. Let's call this number 'x'. We can set up an equation to represent this situation:

Current age + x = 3 * Current age

Substituting the value of current age, we get:

8 + x = 3 * 8

Simplifying the equation, we get:

8 + x = 24

Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get:

x = 16

So, it will take 16 years for Melanie's age to be thrice her current age.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's find the cost of the chicken. Since each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, and the 5 packs of bacon cost $10, the cost of each pack of chicken is $10 / 5 = $2. Since Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, the total cost of the chicken is 6 * $2 = $12.

Next, let's find the cost of the strawberries. Each pack of strawberries costs $4, and Kelly has 3 packs, so the total cost of the strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.

Now, let's find the cost of the apples. Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is $4 / 2 = $2. Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost of the apples is 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items in Kelly's cart: $10 (bacon) + $12 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $48.

Finally, let's subtract the total cost of the items from Kelly's budget: $65 - $48 = $17.

The final answer is: $17"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total runtime of the final concert without the encore. Since the encore is 15 minutes, we subtract that from the total runtime to get the runtime of the concert itself.

Total runtime of the final concert = 65 minutes
Runtime of the encore = 15 minutes
Runtime of the concert itself = Total runtime of the final concert - Runtime of the encore
= 65 - 15
= 50 minutes

Since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship:

Runtime of the final concert = 2 * Runtime of the usual concert
50 = 2 * Runtime of the usual concert

To find the runtime of the usual concert, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 2:

Runtime of the usual concert = 50 / 2
= 25 minutes

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how many toys Argo has now, we need to subtract the number of toys he gave away from the total number of toys he initially had.

Initially, Argo had 200 toys. He gave away 40 toys to Alyssa, 80 toys to Bonnie, and 30 toys to Nicky. 

First, let's add up the number of toys he gave away: 40 + 80 + 30 = 150 toys.

Now, let's subtract the number of toys he gave away from the initial number of toys: 200 - 150 = 50.

So, Argo has 50 toys now.

On Tuesday, they make 125 chimichangas. 
On Wednesday, they also make 125 chimichangas. 
On Friday, they make twice as many as on Tuesday and Wednesday, which is 2 * 125 = 250 chimichangas.

Now, let's add the number of chimichangas made on each day: 
125 (Tuesday) + 125 (Wednesday) + 250 (Friday) = 500

"To find the number of pairs of microphones that can be arranged, we first need to find the total number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs. 

Let's assume the total number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs is 'x'. Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the total number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs is 2x.

However, we know that the singer has 50 microphones in total. Since 20% of the microphones won't find any space to fit in, the number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs is 80% of 50, which is 0.8 * 50 = 40.

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs of microphones that can be arranged is 40 / 2 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the total number of birds, we need to calculate the number of birds in each group and add them together.

First, let's find the number of birds nesting in the bushes: 6 birds.

Next, we need to find 2/3 of the number of birds nesting in the bushes. To do this, we multiply 6 by 2/3, which is the same as multiplying 6 by 2 and then dividing by 3. 

6 * 2 = 12
12 / 3 = 4

So, 2/3 of the number of birds nesting in the bushes is 4. Since Jerry also sees 4 birds flying overhead, we add these to the number of birds nesting in the bushes: 6 + 4 = 10.

Now, let's find the number of birds feeding. Jerry sees 3 groups of 8 birds each, so we multiply 3 by 8 to find the total number of birds feeding: 3 * 8 = 24.

Finally, we add the number of birds nesting, flying, and feeding to find the total number of birds: 6 + 10 + 24 = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find out how many cookies were in each jar, we need to first determine how many cookies Lani had left after eating 5. 

Lani started with 55 cookies and ate 5, so she had 55 - 5 = 50 cookies left.

Since she placed the remaining cookies equally into 5 jars, we need to divide the remaining cookies by 5.

50 cookies / 5 jars = 10 cookies per jar.

The final answer is: 10"
"To find the total number of petals on the orchids, we multiply the number of orchids by the number of petals per orchid: 5 orchids * 5 petals/orchid = 25 petals.

To find the total number of petals on the daisies, we multiply the number of daisies by the number of petals per daisy: 4 daisies * 10 petals/daisy = 40 petals.

Now, we subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies to find the difference: 40 petals - 25 petals = 15 petals.

The daisies have 15 more petals compared to the orchids.

"To find the percentage of flowering plants, we first need to determine the number of flowering plants. 

There are 100 plants in total. One-fourth of them are indoor plants, which is 100 * (1/4) = 25 plants. 

The remaining plants are 100 - 25 = 75 plants. Two-thirds of these remaining plants are outdoor plants, which is 75 * (2/3) = 50 plants. 

The rest of the remaining plants are flowering plants, which is 75 - 50 = 25 plants.

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100: (25 / 100) * 100 = 25%.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to determine the speed of the thingamabob first. Since the whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob, and the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, we can find the speed of the thingamabob by dividing the speed of the whatchamacallit by 11.

Speed of thingamabob = Speed of whatchamacallit / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 121 / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 11 meters per second

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the whirligig by multiplying the speed of the thingamabob by 5.

Speed of whirligig = Speed of thingamabob * 5
Speed of whirligig = 11 * 5
Speed of whirligig = 55 meters per second

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the cost of the yogurt. Since the yogurt is half the price of the salad, and the salad costs $6, the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.

Now, let's denote the cost of one carrot as 'x'. Ellen pays a total of $11 for her daily goods, which include 2 carrots, a salad, and a yogurt. We can write an equation to represent this:

2x + 6 + 3 = 11

Combine the constants on the left side of the equation:

2x + 9 = 11

Subtract 9 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 2

Divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 1

The cost of one carrot is $1.

"To find out how much Mark makes a week, we need to calculate his new hourly wage and then multiply it by the number of hours he works in a week.

Mark's new hourly wage is $10 (old wage) + $2 (raise) = $12 per hour.

Mark works 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, so the total number of hours he works in a week is 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week.

Now, we multiply his new hourly wage by the total number of hours he works in a week: $12/hour * 40 hours/week = $480/week.

The final answer is: $480"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn. Let's denote the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn as 'x'. 

Since she mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as Joe's, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times. 

The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.

The total number of lawns she mowed is the sum of the lawns she mowed each week, which is 3x + x + 5x = 9x.

We know that she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn, and since she mowed Joe's lawn 'x' times, she made a total of $6x from mowing lawns.

We also know that she made a total of $80 from both lemonade sales and mowing lawns. So, we can set up the equation:

6x + lemonade sales = 80

We also know that she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn, and since she mowed Joe's lawn 'x' times, she made a total of $6x from mowing lawns. We also know that she mowed Joe's lawn 'x' times, so the total number of lawns she mowed is 9x. Since she made $6 for each lawn, the total amount she made from mowing lawns is 9x * 6 = 54x.

We can now set up the equation:

54x + lemonade sales = 80

Since we know that she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn, we can substitute 6x for 54x - 48 in the equation:

6x + lemonade sales = 80
6x + lemonade sales = 80
6x = 80 - lemonade sales
6x = 80 - (80 - 54x)
6x = 54x - 26
6x - 54x = -26
-48x = -26
x = 26/48
x = 13/24

Now that we know x, we can find the total amount she made from mowing lawns:
Total from mowing lawns = 54x
Total from mowing lawns = 54 * (13/24)
Total from mowing lawns = 702/24
Total from mowing lawns = 29.25

Now that we know the total amount she made from mowing lawns, we can find the amount she made from lemonade sales:
Lemonade sales = 80 - Total from mowing lawns
Lemonade sales = 80 - 29.25
Lemonade sales = 50.75

"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Martha initially had some notebooks, but we don't know the exact number. However, we know that after buying 5 more, she had a total of 7 notebooks. This means she initially had 7 - 5 = 2 notebooks.

Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, and Martha initially had 2 notebooks, Joseph had 3 * 2 = 6 notebooks.

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph. Martha has 7 notebooks, and Joseph has 6 notebooks. So, Martha has 7 - 6 = 1 more notebook than Joseph.

"To find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we first need to determine the distance rowed by Anis. 

Since Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, we can calculate Anis's distance by multiplying Dijana's distance by 1 and 1/5 (which is equivalent to 6/5). 

Dijana's distance = 50 miles
Anis's distance = 50 * (6/5) = 60 miles

Now, we can find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis by adding their individual distances.

Total distance = Dijana's distance + Anis's distance
Total distance = 50 + 60
Total distance = 110 miles

The final answer is: 110"
"To find out how many cookies each of Susan's nephews will get, we first need to determine the total number of cookies available after her husband took some. 

Initially, Susan had 100 cookies. Her husband took 4 cookies, so we subtract 4 from 100 to get the remaining number of cookies: 100 - 4 = 96.

Now, we need to divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews, which is 6. To do this, we'll divide 96 by 6.

96 ÷ 6 = 16

So, each of Susan's nephews will get 16 cookies."
"To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we first need to determine how many pages each of them read in total. 

Denise read 10 pages yesterday and 5 more than Daniel's yesterday's reading today. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read 13 + 5 = 18 pages today. 

So, Denise's total reading is 10 + 18 = 28 pages. Daniel read 13 pages yesterday and 0 pages today, making his total 13 pages.

The difference in their total reading is 28 - 13 = 15 pages.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of bowls that can be filled with the leftover soup and then divide that by the number of child-sized bowls.

Since the pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls, and there are 3 adults (Calvin, his wife, and himself), the total number of bowls that can be filled for dinner is 3 adult bowls. 

However, since the pot can fill 8 child bowls, we can assume that 3 adult bowls is equivalent to 6 child bowls (since 4 adult bowls = 8 child bowls). 

So, the total number of child bowls that can be filled for dinner is 6. 

After dinner, there will be 2 child bowls left over (since 8 - 6 = 2).

Each child will eat one bowl for lunch, so the number of times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup is 2."

"To find out how much material Jo needs, we need to calculate the total amount of material required for the small and large masks separately and then add them together.

For small masks, Jo needs 2 yards of material to make 4 masks. To find out how much material is needed for 20 small masks, we can set up a proportion:

2 yards / 4 masks = x yards / 20 masks

Cross-multiplying, we get:
2 * 20 = 4x
40 = 4x
x = 40 / 4
x = 10 yards

So, Jo needs 10 yards of material to make 20 small masks.

For large masks, Jo needs 2.25 yards of material to make 3 masks. To find out how much material is needed for 8 large masks, we can set up a proportion:

2.25 yards / 3 masks = x yards / 8 masks

Cross-multiplying, we get:
2.25 * 8 = 3x
18 = 3x
x = 18 / 3
x = 6 yards

So, Jo needs 6 yards of material to make 8 large masks.

Now, we add the material needed for small and large masks together:
10 yards (small) + 6 yards (large) = 16 yards

So, Dean gave 6 marbles to Jamie. 

Now, we know Dean gave 10 marbles to Donald. 

In total, Dean gave away 6 + 10 = 16 marbles.

To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we subtract the marbles he gave away from the total number of marbles he had: 
30 - 16 = 14

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Adam's age four years ago as 'x'. Since Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, we can write an equation:

Duncan's age eight years ago = 2 * Adam's age four years ago
Duncan's age eight years ago = 2x

We know that Duncan's current age is 60. To find his age eight years ago, we subtract 8 from his current age:

Duncan's age eight years ago = 60 - 8
Duncan's age eight years ago = 52

Now we can equate this to 2x:

52 = 2x

To find x, we divide both sides by 2:

x = 52 / 2
x = 26

This means Adam's age four years ago was 26. To find Adam's current age, we add 4 to x:

Adam's current age = 26 + 4
Adam's current age = 30

Finally, to find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8
Adam's age in 8 years = 38

"To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount of money Julia and Nadine had, and then divide it by 2 to find out how much each of them received as allowance.

First, let's find the cost of the balloons. 1 dozen balloons is equal to 12 balloons. Since 2 balloons cost $0.5, 12 balloons will cost 12 * $0.5 / 2 = $3.

The total cost of the cake and the balloons is $11 + $3 = $14.

The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is $7 * 2 = $14.

The total cost of the cake, balloons, and ice cream is $14 + $14 = $28.

Since Julia and Nadine used all the money they had to buy these items, the total amount of money they had is $28.

Since they had the same amount of allowance, we can divide the total amount of money by 2 to find out how much each of them received. 

$28 / 2 = $14

The selling price of each lollipop is $0.8, so the total revenue is 300 * $0.8 = $240.

The cost of each lollipop is $0.5, so the total cost is 300 * $0.5 = $150.

The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost, which is $240 - $150 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the total number of pets Larry has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet and then add them together.

Larry has 3 cats.

He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.

He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.

He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 * 7 = 21 fish.

He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

To find the total number of pets, we add the number of each type of pet together: 3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47.

The final answer is: 47"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many slices of bread Abby and Josh can eat together in a day. Since Josh eats twice as much as Abby, and Abby eats 2 slices a day, Josh eats 2 * 2 = 4 slices a day.

Together, they eat 2 (Abby's slices) + 4 (Josh's slices) = 6 slices a day.

To find out how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to divide the total number of slices (24) by the number of slices they eat in a day (6).

24 slices / 6 slices per day = 4 days

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the total number of shells Martha has collected by her 10th birthday, we need to calculate the number of months she has been collecting shells. Since Martha started collecting shells at 5 years old and we want to know the total by her 10th birthday, we need to consider the months from her 5th birthday to her 10th birthday.

There are 12 months in a year. From her 5th birthday to her 10th birthday, Martha would have been 5 years old for 1 year, 6 years old for 1 year, 7 years old for 1 year, 8 years old for 1 year, and 9 years old for 1 year. 

So, the total number of months is 5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months.

Since Martha collects one shell every month, the total number of shells she has collected is equal to the total number of months she has been collecting shells.

The final answer is: 60"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many cups of tea are in each row. Since Lana divides the 27 cups into 3 rows, we can divide 27 by 3 to get the number of cups in each row.

27 cups / 3 rows = 9 cups per row

Since Lana creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, the number of mint tea cups in each row will be half of the total cups in each row.

9 cups per row / 2 = 4.5 cups of mint tea per row

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a cup, we can assume that Lana will distribute the remaining cups to make the number of mint tea cups whole. But in this case, we are looking for the number of mint tea cups in each row before the remaining cups are used to make cinnamon tea.

The remaining cups are used to make 15 cups of cinnamon tea, but this information is not necessary to find the number of mint tea cups in each row.

Therefore, the number of mint tea cups in each row is 4.5."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip. 

Let's break down the information given:

- The sloth takes 4 hours to make a round trip (down and back up) to collect berries.
- The sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

Since the sloth takes 4 hours for a round trip, in 8 hours, he can make 8 / 4 = 2 round trips.

If he makes 2 round trips, he will collect a total of 2 * x berries, where x is the number of berries he picks up per trip.

We want this total to be 24 berries, so we can set up the equation:

2 * x = 24

To find the minimum number of berries he can pick up per trip, we need to solve for x:

x = 24 / 2
x = 12

So, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip is 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the amount of water in the tank. Since Anthony and his father fill the tank with half the amount of water in the pool, we can calculate this as follows:

10000 gallons (pool) / 2 = 5000 gallons (tank)

Next, we need to find out how much water is used from the tank over 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so we can multiply this rate by the number of days:

500 gallons/day * 6 days = 3000 gallons

Now, we subtract the amount of water used from the initial amount in the tank to find the remaining water:

5000 gallons (initial) - 3000 gallons (used) = 2000 gallons

The final answer is: 2000"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much money Colby has left and then determine how many movies he can see with the remaining money.

Colby's initial budget is $150. He has already spent money on:

- 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays: 5 * $10 = $50
- 8 movies on other days: 8 * $7 = $56
- 2 tubs of popcorn: 2 * $8 = $16
- 4 boxes of candy: 4 * $2 = $8

Total spent: $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130

Colby has $150 - $130 = $20 left.

Each movie costs $10, and he wants to buy a popcorn ($8) and a box of candy ($2) for the last movie. So, the cost for the last movie will be $10 + $8 + $2 = $20.

Colby can see 1 more movie with the remaining money.

The final answer is: 1"
"To find the total calories of the pastries, we first need to calculate the calories of each type of mini pastry. 

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3 of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories. 

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3 of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, we can calculate the total calories of each type of pastry. There are 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories from cinnamon rolls is 200 * 200 = 40,000 calories. There are 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories from blueberry muffins is 300 * 150 = 45,000 calories.

The total calories of all the pastries is the sum of the calories from cinnamon rolls and blueberry muffins, which is 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories.

The final answer is: 85000"
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed and then divide it by the number of days.

On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday, she removed twice as many as Monday, so 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs.
On Wednesday, she removed twice as many as Tuesday, so 2 * 78 = 156 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 78 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 378

There are 5 days in total. 

Average number of Junebugs removed per day = Total Junebugs removed / Number of days
= 378 / 5
= 75.6

"To find the distance traveled by the bus, we multiply its speed by the time it traveled: 60 miles/hour * 5 hours = 300 miles.

To find the distance traveled by the car, we multiply its speed by the time it traveled: 30 miles/hour * 8 hours = 240 miles.

Now, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus to find the difference: 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles.

The final answer is: 60"
"To find the number of bouncy balls, we need to subtract the total number of toys Sophie had before buying the bouncy balls from the total number of toys she has now. 

First, let's add up the number of blocks, stuffed animals, and rings: 
31 (blocks) + 8 (stuffed animals) + 9 (rings) = 48

Now, we subtract this total from the number of toys Sophie has now: 
62 (total toys now) - 48 (total toys before bouncy balls) = 14

The number of bouncy balls is 14."
"Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as p, and John's age as j. We are given the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old. This can be written as P + p + j = 100.
2. Paul is 10 years older than John, which can be written as p = j + 10.
3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age, which can be written as P = p + j.

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to get P = (j + 10) + j, which simplifies to P = 2j + 10.

Now, we can substitute the expression for P into the first equation: (2j + 10) + p + j = 100.

We can substitute the second equation into this expression: (2j + 10) + (j + 10) + j = 100.

Combine like terms: 4j + 20 = 100.

Subtract 20 from both sides: 4j = 80.

Divide both sides by 4: j = 20.

Now that we know John's age, we can find Paul's age using the second equation: p = j + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30.

Finally, we can find Peter's age using the third equation: P = p + j = 30 + 20 = 50.

The final answer is: 50"
"To find the total number of balloons, we need to calculate the initial number of balloons and then add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom.

Initially, Maria had 1 water balloon, and her 4 friends had 2 balloons each. So, the total initial number of balloons is:
1 (Maria's balloon) + (4 friends * 2 balloons per friend) = 1 + 8 = 9 balloons

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional balloons is:
5 people * 3 balloons per person = 15 balloons

Now, we add the initial number of balloons to the additional balloons:
9 (initial balloons) + 15 (additional balloons) = 24 balloons

The final answer is: 24"
"To find out how many tables they need, we first need to calculate the total number of boxes of stuff they have. 

10 people donate 5 boxes each, so they have 10 * 5 = 50 boxes from donations. 
They already have 10 boxes, so the total number of boxes is 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

Since they can fit 2 boxes per table, they will need 60 / 2 = 30 tables.

However, they already own 15 tables. To find out how many more tables they need, we subtract the number of tables they own from the total number of tables needed: 30 - 15 = 15.

Therefore, they need 15 new tables.

The final answer is: 15"
"To find the average total distance spat, we need to calculate the total distance spat by each person and then divide it by the total number of seeds spat.

Zoey spits 40 seeds, each 10 feet, so the total distance spat by Zoey is 40 * 10 = 400 feet.

Sydney spits 35 seeds, each 12 feet, so the total distance spat by Sydney is 35 * 12 = 420 feet.

The total number of seeds spat is 40 + 35 = 75.

The total distance spat is 400 + 420 = 820 feet.

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the total distance spat by the total number of seeds spat: 820 / 75 = 10.93 (rounded to two decimal places).

The final answer is: 10.93"
"To determine which widget maker is more profitable, we need to calculate the total number of widgets each machine can produce in a month and then multiply that by the selling price of each widget.

First, let's calculate the total number of widgets each machine can produce in a month. The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets per hour and runs 24 hours a day. 

60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = 1440 widgets/day
1440 widgets/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets/month

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets per hour and runs 24 hours a day.

45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = 1080 widgets/day
1080 widgets/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets/month

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from each machine. Each widget sells for $6.

Revenue from Widgeteer 3000: 43,200 widgets/month * $6/widget = $259,200/month
Revenue from WidgetMaster 9000: 32,400 widgets/month * $6/widget = $194,400/month

To find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000, we subtract the revenue from the WidgetMaster 9000 from the revenue from the Widgeteer 3000.

$259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

The final answer is: $64,800"
"To find out how much Cameron would save, we first need to calculate the cost of his stay with the option of adding on 70 pesos for every hour after the 12-hour mark and then compare it to the cost of a 24-hour stay.

Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours. Since the first 12 hours are already included in the initial charge, he needs to pay for the additional 5 hours.

The cost for the additional 5 hours is 5 * 70 = 350 pesos.

The total cost for Cameron's stay would be 1000 (initial 12-hour charge) + 350 (additional 5 hours) = 1350 pesos.

Now, let's compare this to the cost of a 24-hour stay, which is 1600 pesos.

The amount Cameron would save is 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

The final numerical answer is: 250"
"To find the total amount of hay needed, we first need to calculate the amount each sheep needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds, and each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, we can calculate the amount each sheep needs as follows:

Twice the amount each goat needs: 2 * 5 = 10 pounds
3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs: 10 - 3 = 7 pounds

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep separately:

For the goats: 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds
For the sheep: 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds

To find the total amount of hay needed, we add the amount needed for the goats and the sheep:

Total hay needed = 75 pounds (goats) + 84 pounds (sheep) = 159 pounds

"To find out how much James spent on the CDs, we first need to calculate the original price of the CDs and then subtract the discount. 

The original price of 10 CDs is 10 * $15 = $150. 

Since James gets a 40% discount, we need to find 40% of $150. 
40% of $150 = 0.4 * $150 = $60.

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price: $150 - $60 = $90.

James spent $90 on the CDs.

Next, we need to find out how much he got back from selling 5 CDs. 
He sold each CD for $40, so he got 5 * $40 = $200.

To find out how much money James was out, we subtract the amount he got back from the amount he spent: $90 - $200 = -$110.

However, since James can't be out a negative amount of money, this means he actually lost money. He spent more than he got back. 

The final numerical answer is: -$110"

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's calculate the time James took to swim 60% of the distance. The total distance is 20 miles, and 60% of that is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles. 

Since James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time taken to swim 12 miles is 12 / 2 = 6 hours.

After swimming, James rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

Now, let's calculate the remaining distance. The total distance is 20 miles, and James has already swum 12 miles, so the remaining distance is 20 - 12 = 8 miles.

James then swims the remaining distance at half his original speed, which is 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour. The time taken to swim 8 miles at this speed is 8 / 1 = 8 hours.

The total time taken is the sum of the swimming time, resting time, and the time taken to swim the remaining distance. So, the total time is 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.

First, let's calculate the commission from the New York Times sales:

- Number of copies sold: 6
- Price per copy: $5
- Commission rate: 10%
- Commission per copy: 10% of $5 = 0.1 * $5 = $0.5
- Total commission from New York Times: 6 * $0.5 = $3

Next, let's calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal sales:

- Number of copies sold: 10
- Price per copy: $15
- Commission rate: 8%
- Commission per copy: 8% of $15 = 0.08 * $15 = $1.2

"To find out how many points Azibo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Bahati and Dinar. 

Let's denote the points scored by Dinar as 'x'. Since Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, Bahati's points can be represented as 'x + 10'. 

We know that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so Azibo's points can be represented as '(x + 10) - 20' or 'x - 10'.

The total points scored by the team is 45, which is the sum of the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar. We can write this as an equation:

x + (x + 10) + (x - 10) = 45

Combine like terms:

3x = 45

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 15

Now that we know Dinar scored 15 points, we can find Azibo's points by substituting x into the expression 'x - 10':

Azibo's points = 15 - 10 = 5

"To find the total number of reports Vince stapled, we need to calculate the total time he spent stapling reports and then multiply it by his stapling rate.

First, let's find the total time in minutes. Vince stapled reports from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is a total of 15 hours. 

15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Now, we know Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find his stapling rate per minute, we divide 30 reports by 15 minutes:

30 reports / 15 minutes = 2 reports/minute

Now, we multiply the total time in minutes by his stapling rate per minute:

900 minutes * 2 reports/minute = 1800 reports

So, Vince stapled 1800 reports altogether.

The final answer is: 1800"
"To find out how many minutes Kim slept on her bed, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m. This is a total of 8 hours, which is 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 5:55 a.m. instead of 6 a.m. This means she slept from 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m., which is a total of 7 hours and 55 minutes, or 7 * 60 + 55 = 455 minutes.

Now, we need to subtract the time she was sleepwalking, which was from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. This is a total of 23 minutes.

So, the total time she slept on her bed is 455 - 23 = 432 minutes.

Two dozen cups is equal to 2 x 12 = 24 cups.

Since Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, we can multiply the number of cups by 2/3 to find the number of measuring spoons:

24 cups * (2/3) = 16 spoons

Now, Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so we need to subtract 6 from the initial number of spoons:

16 spoons - 6 spoons = 10 spoons

Jonathan has 24 cups and 10 spoons remaining.

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is 24 + 10 = 34."
"To find the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we first need to calculate the number of occupied beds and then subtract it from the total capacity.

The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 of them are occupied. 

1/5 of 1000 is 100. So, the number of occupied beds is 100.

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, we need to calculate the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks have 14 days.

The total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks is 50 * 14 = 700.

Now, we add the initial occupied beds (100) to the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks (700) to get the total occupied beds after 2 weeks.

Total occupied beds = 100 + 700 = 800

Now, we subtract the total occupied beds from the total capacity to get the number of unoccupied beds.

Total unoccupied beds = 1000 - 800 = 200

She sends 16 emails a day, and 7 of them are work emails. So, the number of non-work emails is 16 - 7 = 9.

Two-thirds of the remainder (non-work emails) are to her family. Two-thirds of 9 is (2/3) * 9 = 6. This means she sends 6 emails to her family.

Now, we need to find out how many emails are left after sending to her family. Since she sends 6 emails to her family, the remaining emails are 9 - 6 = 3.

One-third of the remaining emails are to her boyfriend. One-third of 3 is (1/3) * 3 = 1.

So, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

The final answer is: 1"
"To solve this problem, we need to find Shawna's age first, and then use that to find her father's age.

Since Aliya is 3 years old, and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, we can calculate Shawna's age as follows:
Shawna's age = 3 * Aliya's age
Shawna's age = 3 * 3
Shawna's age = 9

Now that we know Shawna's age, we can find her father's age. Her father is five times as old as Shawna, so:
Father's age = 5 * Shawna's age
Father's age = 5 * 9
Father's age = 45

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number Courtney reported and subtract it from the reported number.

Let's assume the number Courtney reported is 100%. Since she overstated the number by 20%, the actual number is 80% of the reported number.

First, we need to find 20% of 48. To do this, we multiply 48 by 0.20 (which is 20% expressed as a decimal).

20% of 48 = 48 * 0.20 = 9.6

Now, we subtract 9.6 from 48 to find the actual number of people who attended the concert.

Actual number = 48 - 9.6 = 38.4

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 38.4.

The final answer is: 38.4"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. We know that Jason carried 2 balls, and Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey. This means Jeffrey carried half the number of balls Jason carried, which is 2 / 2 = 1 ball.

Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried 2 balls, Jordan carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls carried by each of them: 1 (Jeffrey) + 2 (Jason) + 4 (Jordan) = 7 balls.

However, this is the number of balls the boys carried, not the total number of balls the coach brought to practice. Since the boys carried all the balls in one trip, the total number of balls the coach brought to practice is equal to the number of balls the boys carried.

The final answer is: 7"
"To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day. 

The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day, 13 holes on the second day, and 8 holes on the third day. However, they filled in 2 holes on the third day. So, the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29.

The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, there were 4 * 10 = 40 holes by the end of the fourth day.

Since we know there were 29 holes at the end of the third day, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is 40 - 29 = 11.

The final answer is: 11"
"Let's break down the problem. We know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and the third person got 15 more than each of them. 

Let's denote the number of corn chips the third person got as x. Since the third person got 15 more than Amora and Lainey, we can write an equation:

x = 70 + 15
x = 85

So, the third person got 85 corn chips. 

Now, we know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and the third person got 85 corn chips. To find the total number of corn chips, we add the number of corn chips each person got:

Total corn chips = 70 + 70 + 85
Total corn chips = 225

The final answer is: 225"
"To find the total cost of travel, we need to calculate 50% more than the cost of supplies. 

First, let's find 50% of the cost of supplies. 50% of $400 is 0.5 * 400 = $200.

Now, we add this to the cost of supplies to find the total cost of travel. $400 (supplies) + $200 (50% of supplies) = $600.

The final answer is: $600"
"Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, Stan as S, and Alex as X. We are given the following information:

1. X = S + 5
2. S = 4A - 13
3. A + S + X = 339

We can substitute the first equation into the third equation to get:
A + S + (S + 5) = 339
Combine like terms:
2S + A + 5 = 339

Now, substitute the second equation into the above equation:
2(4A - 13) + A + 5 = 339
Expand the equation:
8A - 26 + A + 5 = 339
Combine like terms:
9A - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:
9A = 360

Divide by 9:
A = 40

Now that we know A, we can find S:
S = 4A - 13
S = 4(40) - 13
S = 160 - 13
S = 147

The final answer is: 147"
"To find the total number of episodes, we need to determine how many episodes there are in total. Since there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, and each episode is 20 minutes long, we can set up an equation.

Let x be the number of episodes. Since each episode is 20 minutes long, the total number of minutes is 20x. We are also told that the number of episodes is half the number of minutes per episode, so we can write the equation as x = 20/2.

Solving for x, we get x = 10. This means there are 10 episodes in total.

Now, we can find the total number of minutes John will spend watching the show by multiplying the number of episodes by the length of each episode: 10 * 20 = 200.

The final answer is: 200"
"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in the southerly direction and then add it to the distance traveled in the northerly direction.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled in the southerly direction for the first 10 hours at 30 miles per hour:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 miles/hour * 10 hours = 300 miles

Then, the bird flies towards the north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour:
Distance = Speed * Time = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours = 36 miles

Since this distance is in the opposite direction, we need to subtract it from the initial distance to find the net distance traveled in the southerly direction:
Net distance = 300 miles - 36 miles = 264 miles

Finally, the bird flies towards the south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour:
Distance = Speed * Time = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours = 110 miles

To find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we add the net distance traveled in the southerly direction and the distance traveled in the final southerly direction:
Total distance = 264 miles + 110 miles = 374 miles

The final answer is: 374"
"To find the total number of brownies Greta had left over, we need to calculate the total number of brownies she received and subtract the number of brownies eaten.

Greta made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies for herself, which is 12 brownies. 

At her office, she received 1/2 a dozen brownies, which is 6 brownies. 

Her friends brought 4 dozen brownies, which is 48 brownies.

In total, Greta received 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies.

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies.

To find the number of brownies left over, we subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies received: 66 - 18 = 48.

The final answer is: 48"
"To find the total age of all three family members, we first need to determine their individual ages.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 2 * 8 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means her age is 75% of Nani's age. To find 75% of Nani's age, we multiply his age by 0.75: 8 * 0.75 = 6 years.

Now that we have the ages of all three family members, we can find the total age by adding their ages together: 8 (Nani) + 16 (brother) + 6 (sister) = 30 years.

The final answer is: 30"
"To find the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time it takes for each type of stringing and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time for synthetic gut racquets: 3 racquets * 15 minutes per racquet = 45 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time for polyester string racquets: 5 racquets * 22 minutes per racquet = 110 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time for hybrid sets: 4 racquets * 18 minutes per racquet = 72 minutes.

Finally, we add the times together: 45 minutes + 110 minutes + 72 minutes = 227 minutes.

The final answer is: 227"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first two phones and the remaining phones. 

The first two phones cost the full price of $600 each, so the total cost for the first two phones is 2 * $600 = $1200.

The remaining phones are 2 (for the kids and the wife), and each of these phones is half the price of the first two, which is $600 / 2 = $300.

The total cost for the remaining phones is 2 * $300 = $600.

Now, we add the cost of the first two phones and the remaining phones to get the total cost: $1200 + $600 = $1800.

The final answer is: $1800"
"To find the total number of players in both teams, we first need to determine the number of players on Zeke's team. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, and Carlton's team has 13 players, we can calculate the number of players on Zeke's team by adding 7 to 13.

13 (Carlton's players) + 7 = 20

Now that we know Zeke's team has 20 players, we can find the total number of players in both teams by adding the number of players on each team.

13 (Carlton's players) + 20 (Zeke's players) = 33

The final answer is: 33"
"To find the total number of wooden slats needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2l + 2w, where l is the length and w is the width.

Given the length (l) is 15 feet and the width (w) is 10 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

P = 2(15) + 2(10)
P = 30 + 20
P = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

50 feet * 2 slats/foot = 100 slats

Therefore, Robert will need 100 wooden slats for his fence.

The final answer is: 100"
"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we first need to determine the total number of oranges she had initially. Since she bought 12 boxes of oranges, and each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges is:

12 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 240 oranges

Next, Mrs. Harrington gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes each, which is a total of 4 boxes. Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges given away is:

4 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 80 oranges

Now, we subtract the number of oranges given away from the total number of oranges to find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington had left:

240 oranges - 80 oranges = 160 oranges

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges, which is:

160 oranges * 1/4 = 40 oranges

To find out how many oranges she sold, we subtract the number of oranges she kept from the total number of oranges she had left:

160 oranges - 40 oranges = 120 oranges

Mrs. Harrington sold 120 oranges.

"To solve this problem, we need to know the number of states in the USA and India. The USA has 50 states. 

First, let's find half the number of states in the USA: 50 / 2 = 25.

Since India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, we add 4 to 25: 25 + 4 = 29.

Now, we know India has 29 states. To find the total number of states in both countries together, we add the number of states in the USA and India: 50 + 29 = 79.

The final numerical answer is: 79"
"To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books. 

The total cost of the books is the sum of the cost of the dictionary, the dinosaur book, and the children's cookbook. 

Total cost = $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39

Since Tyler has already saved $14 from his allowance, we need to subtract this from the total cost to find out how much more he needs to earn.

Amount needed to earn = Total cost - Amount saved = $39 - $14 = $25

Now, we can find out how many hours Tyler needs to work by dividing the amount he needs to earn by his hourly wage.

Hours needed to work = Amount needed to earn / Hourly wage = $25 / $5 = 5 hours

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many cherries Richard and Jerry have. 

Since Robert has 30 cherries and has 10 more than Richard, we can set up an equation to find out how many cherries Richard has. Let's denote the number of cherries Richard has as R. Then, we have the equation: R + 10 = 30. 

To find R, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation: R = 30 - 10. 

R = 20.

Now that we know Richard has 20 cherries, we can find out how many cherries Jerry has. Since the total number of cherries is 60, and Robert and Richard have 30 and 20 cherries respectively, we can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting the total number of cherries Robert and Richard have from the total number of cherries: 60 - 30 - 20 = 10.

So, Jerry has 10 cherries.

Now, we can find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry by subtracting the number of cherries Jerry has from the number of cherries Robert has: 30 - 10 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many boxes of gingerbread and apple pie Sunny sold on both Saturday and Sunday, and then calculate the total earnings.

Let's denote the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday as G and the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday as A.

We know that on Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread, so G = 10.

We also know that on Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday, and on Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie. This means that A = 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie were sold on Saturday.

On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday is G + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15.

Now we have the number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie sold on both days:

- Saturday: G = 10, A = 11
- Sunday: G = 15, A = 15

To find the total earnings, we need to multiply the number of boxes sold by the price of each item and add them together.

The total earnings from gingerbread on Saturday is 10 * $6 = $60.
The total earnings from apple pie on Saturday is 11 * $15 = $165.
The total earnings from gingerbread on Sunday is 15 * $6 = $90.
The total earnings from apple pie on Sunday is 15 * $15 = $225.

The total earnings for Saturday is $60 + $165 = $225.
The total earnings for Sunday is $90 + $225 = $315.

The total earnings for two days is $225 + $315 = $540.

The final answer is: $540"
"To determine the total amount of sunscreen needed, we need to calculate the total number of ounces Pamela will use over the 8-day period. 

Since she reapplies sunscreen every hour and will be outside 4 hours a day, she will reapply sunscreen 4 times a day. 

Over 8 days, she will reapply sunscreen 4 times/day * 8 days = 32 times.

Since each application is 1 ounce, she will need 32 ounces of sunscreen.

Each bottle contains 8 ounces, so to find out how many bottles she needs, we divide the total ounces needed by the ounces per bottle: 32 ounces / 8 ounces per bottle = 4 bottles.

Therefore, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the price of the red car, we need to calculate 40% of the price of the blue car and subtract it from the price of the blue car.

First, let's find 40% of the price of the blue car. 
40% of $100 = 0.4 * $100 = $40

Now, subtract $40 from the price of the blue car to find the price of the red car.
Price of the red car = Price of the blue car - 40% of the price of the blue car
Price of the red car = $100 - $40
Price of the red car = $60

Since the question asks for the cost of both cars, we have the price of the red car as $60 and the price of the blue car as $100.

The final numerical answer is: $160"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Let's denote Emil's current age as E, his dad's age as D, and his brother's age as B. 

We know that Emil is 19 years old now, so E = 19.

When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad, so 24 = 0.5D. 

We can solve for D by multiplying both sides by 2: D = 48.

We also know that when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother, so 24 = 2B.

We can solve for B by dividing both sides by 2: B = 12.

Now that we have the ages of Emil's dad and brother, we can find their current ages by subtracting 5 from D and B, respectively, since Emil is 19 now and will be 24 in 5 years.

Dad's current age = D - 5 = 48 - 5 = 43.

Brother's current age = B - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7.

The sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother now is 43 + 7 = 50.

Adrianne's mother gave her 20 beads.
Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the beads together: 20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find the total amount of crawfish Joe caught, we need to calculate the amount he caught each day and add them together.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.

On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add the total amount of crawfish Joe caught: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can find the total number of servings by dividing the total amount of crawfish by the serving size: 21 / 3 = 7.

"To find the number of students leaving early, we first need to find the number of football players, and then add the number of cheerleaders or band members.

First, let's find the number of football players. 20% of 30 students are football players. 

20% of 30 = 0.20 * 30 = 6

So, there are 6 football players.

Now, let's find the number of remaining students. Since 6 students are football players, the remaining students are 30 - 6 = 24.

Out of the remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band.

25% of 24 = 0.25 * 24 = 6

So, there are 6 cheerleaders or band members.

Now, we add the number of football players and the number of cheerleaders or band members to find the total number of students leaving early.

6 (football players) + 6 (cheerleaders or band members) = 12

"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we first need to determine Charlie's shoe size. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size five boots, we can calculate Charlie's size as follows:

Charlie's size = 5 * Sophie's size
Charlie's size = 5 * 5
Charlie's size = 25

Now, we can find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie by adding their sizes and dividing by 2:

Average size = (Sophie's size + Charlie's size) / 2
Average size = (5 + 25) / 2
Average size = 30 / 2
Average size = 15

"To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to calculate the total space available for plants. 

First, we need to convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches since the width of the plants is given in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so the length of the flower bed in inches is 111 * 12 = 1332 inches.

Next, we need to subtract the space between the plants. Since there are 17 plants, there will be 16 spaces between them. The total space between the plants is 16 * 1.5 = 24 feet, which is 24 * 12 = 288 inches.

Now, we subtract the total space between the plants from the total length of the flower bed to get the total space available for the plants: 1332 - 288 = 1044 inches.

Since each plant is 12 inches wide, we can divide the total space available for plants by the width of each plant to get the total number of plants that can fit: 1044 / 12 = 87.

However, Pat already owns 17 flowers, so we need to subtract 17 from the total number of plants that can fit to find out how many more plants she needs to buy: 87 - 17 = 70.

Each plant costs $6, so we multiply the number of plants Pat needs to buy by the cost of each plant to find the total cost: 70 * 6 = 420.

First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations. 

4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds

Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations = 12 pounds + 15 pounds = 27 pounds

Now, let's subtract the amount of soil used from the total amount of soil they bought.

30 pounds (total soil) - 27 pounds (used soil) = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, we can plant 3 roses with the remaining soil.

"To find out how many shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we first need to calculate how much she saves each month. 

Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month and sets 25% of her paycheck aside for shoes. To find 25% of $2,000.00, we multiply $2,000.00 by 0.25.

$2,000.00 * 0.25 = $500.00

So, Jessica saves $500.00 each month for shoes. 

To find out how many shoes she can buy in a year, we need to multiply the monthly savings by 12 (the number of months in a year).

$500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00

Now, we need to find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy with $6,000.00. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00.

$6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6

So, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two separate tasks: peeling and cooking. 

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp. Emily can peel 6 shrimp a minute, so to find the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp, we divide 90 by 6. 

90 / 6 = 15 minutes to peel the shrimp.

Next, we need to calculate the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp. Emily can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, so to find the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp, we divide 90 by 30 and then multiply by 10.

90 / 30 = 3, then 3 * 10 = 30 minutes to cook the shrimp.

However, since peeling and cooking are done sequentially, we need to add the time for both tasks. 

15 minutes (peeling) + 30 minutes (cooking) = 45 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net change in temperature after the air conditioner has been running and turned off.

First, let's calculate the temperature change when the air conditioner is running on low for 3 hours:

Temperature change on low = -2 degrees/hour * 3 hours = -6 degrees

Next, let's calculate the temperature change when the air conditioner is running on high for 4 hours:

Temperature change on high = -3 degrees/hour * 4 hours = -12 degrees

Now, let's calculate the total temperature change when the air conditioner is running:

Total temperature change while running = -6 degrees + (-12 degrees) = -18 degrees

The air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours, and the room will warm up at 2 degrees an hour. So, the temperature change while the air conditioner is off is:

Temperature change while off = 2 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 4 degrees

Now, let's calculate the net temperature change:

Net temperature change = Total temperature change while running + Temperature change while off
= -18 degrees + 4 degrees
= -14 degrees

Since the net temperature change is -14 degrees, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how old Bill's dad was when Bill saw the comet for the second time. 

Since Bill saw the comet when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet, let's denote the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet as 'x'. Then, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time would be 3x.

We know that the time between the two sightings is 75 years, so we can set up the equation: 

x + 75 = 3x

Subtracting x from both sides of the equation gives us:

75 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = 37.5

Now that we know Bill's dad was 37.5 years old when he saw the comet, we can find out how old Bill was when his dad saw the comet. We are given that Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. 

So, the age difference between Bill and his dad is 37.5 - 30 = 7.5 years.

Since Bill was 30 years old when his dad saw the comet, we can find Bill's age when his dad saw the comet by subtracting 7.5 from 30:

30 - 7.5 = 22.5

However, the question asks for Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time. Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, and Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old, we need to find out how many times the comet has orbited the sun since then.

Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, and Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old, we can divide 30 by 75 to find out how many times the comet has orbited the sun since then:

30 / 75 = 0.4

Since 0.4 is less than 1, the comet has not orbited the sun a full time since Bill's dad saw it. Therefore, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time is the same as his age when his dad saw the comet, which is 22.5 years.

However, since age cannot be a fraction, we can round down to the nearest whole number. 

The final answer is: 22"
"To find the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks for each category and then add them together.

1. Checks for the electric bill: Since Buford writes a check once per month, and there are 12 months in a year, he writes 12 checks for the electric bill per year.
2. Checks for the gas bill: Similarly, Buford writes a check once per month for the gas bill, so he also writes 12 checks for the gas bill per year.
3. Checks to the church: Buford writes a check twice per month to the church, so in a year, he writes 2 * 12 = 24 checks to the church.
4. Checks to the pest and lawn service: Buford writes a check quarterly, which means 4 times a year. So, he writes 4 checks to the pest and lawn service per year.

Now, let's add up the total number of checks:

12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52

The final answer is: 52"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the total number of flights made by the first plane as 'x'. Since the second plane makes 44 flights, which is half the number of flights made by the first plane, the first plane makes 2 * 44 = 88 flights per day.

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, which is (3/4) * 88 = 66 flights. The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of flights to France and Germany is (1/2) * (88 - 66) = 11.

Since the flights to France and Germany are equal, the number of flights to France is 11.

The final answer is: 11"
"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the individual howling times and then add them together.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. 
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, let's add the individual howling times together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents and subtract that from the cost of the trousers.

Adam's mother gave him $6. 
His father gave him twice as much as his mother, so his father gave him 2 * $6 = $12.

The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Since the trousers cost $30, we subtract the amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers to find out how much he had to contribute from his savings: $30 - $18 = $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To find the age of Wilfred, we first need to find the average age of the group. We know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. Let's denote the average age as 'x'. 

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age, Helene's age is 2x. 

The total age of the group is 20, and we know the ages of Akbar and Alessandro. We can set up an equation to represent the total age of the group:

x + 2x + 3 + 4 = 20

Combine like terms:

3x + 7 = 20

Subtract 7 from both sides:

3x = 13

Divide by 3:

x = 13/3

Now that we have the average age, we can find Helene's age:

Helene's age = 2x = 2 * (13/3) = 26/3

We know the total age of the group is 20, and we have the ages of Akbar and Alessandro. We can find Wilfred's age by subtracting the sum of their ages from the total age:

Wilfred's age = 20 - (3 + 4 + 26/3)

First, convert the whole numbers to fractions with a denominator of 3:

Wilfred's age = 20 - (9/3 + 4/3 + 26/3)

Combine the fractions:

Wilfred's age = 20 - 39/3

Convert 20 to a fraction with a denominator of 3:

Wilfred's age = 60/3 - 39/3

Subtract the fractions:

Wilfred's age = 21/3

To convert the fraction to a whole number, divide the numerator by the denominator:

Wilfred's age = 7

The final answer is: 7"
"To find out how much Walter's lawyer will contribute, we need to calculate the total amount collected from Walter's neighbors and the online fund, and then multiply it by 3.

Walter collects $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. 

Total amount collected so far = $500 + $1500 = $2000

Walter's friend donates $200, but this is not included in the amount that the lawyer will base his donation on. The lawyer will donate three times the amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund, which is $2000.

Lawyer's contribution = 3 * $2000 = $6000

The final answer is: $6000"
"To find the total number of cookies, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies brought by the guests. Since each guest brought 15 cookies and there were 100 guests, the total number of cookies is 100 * 15 = 1500.

The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door. So, the number of cookies given to the church is 1/2 * 1500 = 750.

Since each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, we can find the number of people in the church by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received. 

Number of people in the church = Total cookies given to the church / Cookies per person
= 750 / 15
= 50

The final answer is: 50"
"To solve this problem, let's assume the total number of slices the watermelon is divided into is 'x'. Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices is 6. 

Let's denote the number of slices each kid gets as 'k'. Since each adult gets twice as many slices as each kid, the number of slices each adult gets is '2k'. 

We know that the total number of slices is 6, so we can write the equation: 2 * 2k + 4 * k = 6. 

Simplifying the equation, we get 4k + 4k = 6, which is 8k = 6. 

Dividing both sides by 8, we get k = 6/8, which simplifies to k = 3/4.

Since each adult gets 2k slices, each adult gets 2 * (3/4) = 3/2 slices.

The total number of slices is 6, so the total number of slices is 6. The total number of slices the adults get is 2 * (3/2) = 3. 

The percentage of the watermelon each adult gets is (3/6) * 100, which is 50%.

The final answer is: 50"
"To determine how many hours Doctor Jones has left to update his records, we first need to calculate the total time spent on rounds and appointments.

Time spent on rounds: 
- Number of inpatients: 9
- Time per inpatient: 20 minutes
- Total time spent on rounds: 9 * 20 = 180 minutes

Time spent on appointments: 
- Number of appointments: 10
- Time per appointment: 30 minutes
- Total time spent on appointments: 10 * 30 = 300 minutes

Total time spent on rounds and appointments: 180 + 300 = 480 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we need to convert the total time spent to hours:
480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Doctor Jones spends 9 hours at the clinic, so we subtract the time spent on rounds and appointments from his total time:
9 - 8 = 1 hour

Therefore, Doctor Jones has 1 hour left to update his records.

"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to make the cake. 

First, let's add the time it takes to make the cake batter (20 minutes) and bake the cake (30 minutes): 20 + 30 = 50 minutes.

Next, we add the time it takes to cool the cake (2 hours or 120 minutes): 50 + 120 = 170 minutes.

Then, we add the time it takes to frost the cake (10 minutes): 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 180 minutes to hours by dividing by 60: 180 / 60 = 3 hours.

Now, we need to add the 3 hours to the time at which Jordan wants to serve the cake, which is 5:00 pm. 

5:00 pm + 3 hours = 8:00 pm.

Therefore, Jordan should start making the cake by 8:00 pm at the latest to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm.

The final answer is 8:00."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we need to first determine the total number of boxes sold by both Lisa and Peter. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so together they sold 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

Since they sold 64 chocolate bars together and they sold 8 boxes, we can divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes to find out how many chocolate bars are in a box.

64 / 8 = 8

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

The final answer is: 8"
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to first calculate the daily earnings and then multiply it by the number of days in a month.

The cost to rent the studio per session is $25, and there are 3 sessions per week. The cost per student per session is $1.50. 

First, let's calculate the weekly earnings from the students:
10 students * $1.50 per student = $15 per session
Since there are 3 sessions per week, the weekly earnings from students are:
$15 per session * 3 sessions = $45 per week

The weekly rental cost is:
$25 per session * 3 sessions = $75 per week

The weekly earnings of the dance studio are:
$45 per week (from students) - $75 per week (rental cost) = -$30 per week

However, this is a negative number, which doesn't make sense. This means the dance studio is actually losing money per week. Let's re-evaluate the calculation.

The weekly earnings from students are correct: $45 per week. However, the rental cost is $75 per week, which is more than the earnings from students. This means the dance studio is losing money per week.

To find the monthly earnings, we need to calculate the weekly earnings and multiply it by the number of weeks in a month. However, since the dance studio is losing money per week, we can't calculate the monthly earnings in the same way.

Let's assume the dance studio operates for 4 weeks in a month. The monthly earnings would be:
-$30 per week * 4 weeks = -$120

However, this is a negative number, indicating the dance studio is losing money."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box for both Peter and Martha, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes.

For Peter: 64 chocolate bars / 4 boxes = 16 chocolate bars per box
For Martha: 56 chocolate bars / 7 boxes = 8 chocolate bars per box

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter and Martha. 

Difference = 16 (Peter's chocolate bars per box) - 8 (Martha's chocolate bars per box) = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the number of female porcupines, we multiply the total population by 3/5. 

Number of female porcupines = 50 * (3/5) = 30

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, we need to find the total number of babies born in a year. There are 12 months in a year.

Total babies born in a year = 30 * 4 * 12 = 1440

Now, we add the total number of babies born in a year to the initial population to find the total number of porcupines after a year.

Total porcupines after a year = 50 + 1440 = 1490

The final answer is: 1490"
"To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the width, length, and depth of the pool. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (such as a swimming pool) is V = l * w * h, where V is the volume, l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height (or depth).

Given the dimensions of the pool: 
- Length (l) = 25 feet
- Width (w) = 14 feet
- Depth (h) = 4 feet

We can calculate the volume as follows:
V = l * w * h
V = 25 * 14 * 4
V = 1400 cubic feet

The pool company instructed them to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate how many gallons of water they need. 
Gallons = V * 5.9
Gallons = 1400 * 5.9
Gallons = 8260 gallons

The cost for the pool company to come and fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon:
Cost = Gallons * $0.10
Cost = 8260 * $0.10
Cost = $826

The final answer is: $826"
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to determine the number of blue and yellow sticks first. 

We know there are 9 red sticks. Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red, the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14.

The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is 14 - 3 = 11.

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks: 9 (red) + 14 (blue) + 11 (yellow) = 34.

"To find the total number of female students, we first need to determine the number of students over 16 and under 16, and then find the number of female students in each group.

1. Total students = 3000
2. Students over 16 = 3000 / 2 = 1500
3. Male students over 16 = 1500 / 4 = 375
4. Female students over 16 = 1500 - 375 = 1125
5. Students under 16 = 3000 / 2 = 1500
6. Male students under 16 = 1500 / 2 = 750
7. Female students under 16 = 1500 - 750 = 750

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank and subtract it from the tank's capacity.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped into the tank is 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 12000 gallons. 

The remaining amount of water needed to fill the tank is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation representing the charge of the power bank at the end. Let's denote the initial charge as 'x'. 

In the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining is 0.91x (since 100% - 9% = 91%, or 0.91 as a decimal).

In the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining is 0.93 * 0.91x (since 100% - 7% = 93%, or 0.93 as a decimal).

We are given that the final charge remaining is 28%. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

0.93 * 0.91x = 0.28

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.8463 (0.93 * 0.91):

x = 0.28 / 0.8463
x = 0.33

So, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 33%.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate Janet's total weekly earnings and then determine how many weeks she needs to work to save 20% of the car's cost.

First, let's calculate Janet's total weekly earnings. She makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, so her total hourly earnings are $10 + $15 = $25 per hour.

Since she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are $25/hour * 40 hours/week = $1000/week.

Next, we need to calculate 20% of the car's cost. 20% of $10,000 is 0.20 * $10,000 = $2000.

Now, we can determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save $2000. We can do this by dividing the amount she needs to save ($2000) by her weekly earnings ($1000). 

$2000 / $1000 = 2

So, Janet needs to work 2 weeks to save the down payment for the car.

2 kiwis at $1 each will be 2 * $1 = $2
5 apples at $0.75 each will be 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Adding these amounts together, Jamaar has spent $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9 so far.

Since Jamaar has $10, he has $10 - $9 = $1 left.

Plums cost $0.25 each, so we can divide the remaining amount by the cost of a plum to find out how many plums he can buy: $1 / $0.25 = 4.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote the number of small stuffed animals as 's' and the number of large stuffed animals as 'l'. We know that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so we can write an equation:

s = 2l

We also know that the price of a small stuffed animal is $4. Since Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small ones, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.

The total earnings from the sales are $120. We can write an equation based on the earnings:

4s + 12l = 120

Now we can substitute the expression for s from the first equation into the second equation:

4(2l) + 12l = 120

Expanding the equation:

8l + 12l = 120

Combine like terms:

20l = 120

Divide both sides by 20:

l = 6

Now that we know the number of large stuffed animals, we can find the number of small stuffed animals:

s = 2l
s = 2 * 6
s = 12

Now, we know that all the eggs except 10 were found by the twins and their friends. This means that the total number of eggs found by the twins and their friends is 100 - 10 = 90.

Since the twins found 60 eggs, the number of eggs found by the friends can be calculated by subtracting the number of eggs found by the twins from the total number of eggs found by the twins and their friends: 90 - 60 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe and then multiply it by 40 dwarves and 30 days.

First, let's find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with an iron pickaxe. Since he can mine twice as much with an iron pickaxe as with his bare hands, he can mine 2 * 12 = 24 pounds of ore per day with an iron pickaxe.

Next, let's find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe. Since he can mine 50% more with a steel pickaxe than with an iron pickaxe, he can mine 24 + (24 * 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe.

Now, let's find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day with steel pickaxes. Since one dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe, 40 dwarves can mine 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds of ore per day.

Finally, let's find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in 30 days with steel pickaxes. Since they can mine 1440 pounds of ore per day, they can mine 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds of ore in 30 days.

The final answer is: 43200"
"To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to establish the ratio of the price to the number of sandwiches for the first two packages. 

The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3, and the second package has 4 sandwiches for $6. 

We can set up a proportion to find the price per sandwich for the first two packages. 

Price per sandwich for the first package = $3 / 2 = $1.5 per sandwich
Price per sandwich for the second package = $6 / 4 = $1.5 per sandwich

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is the same for all packages. 

Now, we can find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches by multiplying the price per sandwich by the number of sandwiches: 
Price of the package with 8 sandwiches = $1.5 per sandwich * 8 sandwiches = $12

The final answer is: $12"
"To find out how much Tom has to pay per month, we first need to determine how much he still owes after using the money from selling his old bedroom set.

Tom buys a bedroom set for $3000 and sells his old bedroom for $1000. 

So, the amount he still owes is $3000 - $1000 = $2000.

Since he has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month, we need to calculate 10% of $2000.

10% of $2000 = 0.1 * $2000 = $200.

Therefore, Tom has to pay $200 per month. 

The final answer is: $200"
"To find the number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons after each event.

Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. 

First, 40% of the red balloons burst. 40% of 25 is 0.4 * 25 = 10. So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

Next, Sally released half of the yellow balloons. Half of 12 is 6, so she released 6 yellow balloons, leaving 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.

Then, she found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch. 75% of 8 is 0.75 * 8 = 6. So, she added 6 blue balloons to her clutch.

Now, let's calculate the total number of balloons she carried into the school. She had 15 red balloons, 6 yellow balloons, and 6 blue balloons. 

15 + 6 + 6 = 27

The final answer is: 27"
"To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to consider the scenarios where he won't get an extension. 

First, let's consider the scenario where the substitute teacher is present. In this case, there's a 50% chance of the substitute teacher being present, and since the homework won't be collected in this scenario, the probability of having to turn in the homework is 0%.

Next, let's consider the scenario where the normal teacher is present. In this case, there's a 60% chance (100% - 40% extension chance). Within this 60%, there's a 80% chance (100% - 20% chance of getting a personal extension) that Marcus won't get an extension.

Now, we can calculate the overall probability of having to turn in the homework:

- Probability of substitute teacher: 50% * 0% = 0%
- Probability of normal teacher with no extension: 60% * 80% = 48%

The total probability of having to turn in the homework is the sum of these two probabilities: 0% + 48% = 48%.

The final answer is: 48%"
"To find out how many tickets each graduate can receive, we first need to determine the total number of available seats for guests. 

Total capacity of the Fine Arts Center: 6000
Seats for graduates: 950
Seats for faculty: 300

Total seats taken: 950 (graduates) + 300 (faculty) = 1250
Available seats for guests: 6000 - 1250 = 4750

Since there are 950 graduates, we need to divide the available seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate can receive.

4750 (available seats) ÷ 950 (number of graduates) = 5

The final answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the relationship between the number of small beans and the number of large beans. We know that eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean. 

Let's start by finding the number of medium-sized beans Grandpa can eat. Since it takes 75 large beans to fill him up, and he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, he can eat 2 * 75 = 150 medium-sized beans.

Now, we know that eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean. So, if Grandpa can eat 150 medium-sized beans, he can eat 150 * 3 = 450 small beans.

The final answer is: 450"
"To find out how much Melissa makes per hour after expenses, we need to first calculate her total earnings and total expenses. 

Melissa spends 6 hours a day for 3 days, so her total hours worked is 6 * 3 = 18 hours. 

Her total earnings are $15 per day for 3 days, which is 15 * 3 = $45.

Her total expenses for parking are $3 per day for 3 days, which is 3 * 3 = $9.

Now, we subtract her total expenses from her total earnings to find her net earnings: 45 - 9 = $36.

To find out how much she makes per hour after expenses, we divide her net earnings by her total hours worked: 36 / 18 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of the books and the cost of the pencils separately and then add them together.

The cost of the books is 3 * 16 = 48 dollars.
The cost of the pencils is 3 * 6 = 18 dollars.

Now, we add the cost of the books and the pencils together: 48 + 18 = 66 dollars.

The total amount spent is 66 dollars.

"To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to first determine the total number of soda bottles he will place along the driveway.

The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. To find the total number of bottles, we can divide the width of the driveway by the spacing between the bottles:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Since it takes Richard 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, we can multiply the number of bottles by the time it takes to set off each one:

8 bottles * 5 seconds per bottle = 40 seconds

Therefore, it will take Richard 40 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find out how many packs Uncle Franky can make, we first need to determine the total number of apples he has. Since he ordered two boxes and each box contains 40 apples, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of apples per box.

Total apples = 2 boxes * 40 apples/box = 80 apples

Next, we need to find out how many packs he can make with 80 apples. Since each pack contains 8 apples, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per pack.

Number of packs = Total apples / apples per pack = 80 / 8 = 10

So, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples.

"To find out how much money Amor will have left, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she bought and subtract that from the initial amount of money she had.

The cost of 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese is 2 * $11 = $22.
The cost of 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese is 3 * $6 = $18.
The total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40.

Amor starts with $50, so subtracting the total cost of the cheese from that amount, we get $50 - $40 = $10.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim lost due to loans and lost income while in college. 

First, let's calculate the total amount of loans he took: 
4 years * $50,000/year = $200,000

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money he lost due to not working while in college. 
His income before college was $25,000/year. 
His income after college is $25,000/year * 3 = $75,000/year. 
The difference in income is $75,000/year - $25,000/year = $50,000/year. 
The total amount of money he lost due to not working while in college is $50,000/year * 4 years = $200,000.

The total amount of money he needs to earn is the sum of the loans and the lost income: 
$200,000 (loans) + $200,000 (lost income) = $400,000.

Now, let's calculate how long it will take him to earn this amount at his new income of $75,000/year:
Time = Total amount / Annual income
Time = $400,000 / $75,000
Time = 5.33 years

The final answer is: 5.33"
"To find the total area of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the larger fabric pieces. The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide, so the larger fabric pieces will be 6 + 2 = 8 feet long and 8 + 2 = 10 feet wide.

The area of each piece of fabric is length times width, so the area of each piece is 8 * 10 = 80 square feet. Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, he needs a total of 2 * 80 = 160 square feet of fabric.

The final numerical answer is: 160"
"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then add them together.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. One-fifth of 425 is 425 / 5 = 85. 17 more than that is 85 + 17 = 102. So, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. Twice as many as Tuesday is 102 * 2 = 204. 5 more than that is 204 + 5 = 209. So, on Wednesday, they delivered 209 letters.

Now, let's add the number of letters delivered each day: 425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736.

"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we first need to calculate their current heights. 

Xavier's initial height was 4 feet, which is equivalent to 48 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches). He grew 3 inches over the summer, so his current height is 48 + 3 = 51 inches.

Cole's initial height was 50 inches, and he grew 2 inches over the summer, so his current height is 50 + 2 = 52 inches.

The difference in height between Cole and Xavier is 52 - 51 = 1 inch.

"To solve this problem, we can start by assigning variables to the unknowns. Let's say the amount taken by the first person is x.

Since the second person took $80 more than the first, the amount taken by the second person is x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the amount taken by the third person is 2(x + 80).

We know that the total amount divided is $1920, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920

Combine like terms again:

4x + 240 = 1920

Subtract 240 from both sides:

4x = 1680

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 420

The first person's share is $420.

"To find the total hours worked by each painter, we first need to calculate the total hours worked in 3 weeks. 

There are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks have 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Since the painters worked 3/8ths of a day every day, we need to find out how many hours that is. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3/8 * 24 = 9 hours.

Now, we multiply the hours worked per day by the number of days to get the total hours worked: 9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours.

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4 to get the hours worked by each painter: 189 hours / 4 = 47.25 hours.

The final answer is: 47.25"
"Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as 'x'. 

Since Rory retrieved four more balls in the first set than in the second, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set, which is given as 19. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for x, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Expanding the equation:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

Number of balls in the first set = x + 4
= 6 + 4

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation of the car from 2007 to 2010.

The car was bought in 2007 for $20,000. 

The price of the car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year. 

First, we'll calculate the price of the car in 2008:
Price in 2008 = 20,000 - (20,000 * 0.21) = 20,000 - 4,200 = $15,800

Next, we'll calculate the price of the car in 2009:
Price in 2009 = 15,800 - (15,800 * 0.21) = 15,800 - 3,318 = $12,482

Finally, we'll calculate the price of the car in 2010:
Price in 2010 = 12,482 - (12,482 * 0.21) = 12,482 - 2,623.22 = $9,858.78

The final answer is: $9,858.78"

"To find out how many loads of laundry Greg does in a week, we need to calculate the total number of twin and king size sheets he puts on the beds and then divide that by the number of sheets he can wash at a time.

Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. Since each twin bed requires 1 set of sheets and the king size bed requires 1 set, the total number of sets of sheets he puts on the beds is 4 (twin) + 1 (king) = 5 sets.

Since the laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time, we need to calculate how many twin sets he needs to wash in a week. He has 4 twin beds, so he needs to wash 4 / 2 = 2 sets of twin sheets per week. 

For the king size bed, he needs to wash 1 set per week.

So, in a week, he needs to wash 2 (twin) + 1 (king) = 3 sets of sheets.

Since he has 5 sets of sheets to wash in total, and he can wash 3 sets per week, he needs to do 5 / 3 = 1.67 loads of laundry per week. However, since you can't do a fraction of a load, we round up to the nearest whole number. 

In a year, there are 52 weeks. So, the total number of loads of laundry he does in a year is 2 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 104 loads/year.

"To find out how many days the cat food will last, we need to divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the amount of cat food each cat eats per day (60 grams).

First, we need to calculate the total amount of cat food Imma's 3 cats eat per day. Since each cat eats 60 grams of food twice a day, we multiply 60 grams by 2 to get the daily consumption per cat, which is 120 grams. Then, we multiply this by the number of cats, which is 3.

Daily consumption per cat: 60 grams * 2 = 120 grams
Total daily consumption for 3 cats: 120 grams * 3 = 360 grams

Now, we divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the total daily consumption (360 grams) to find out how many days it will last.

720 grams / 360 grams = 2

The cat food will last for 2 days."

"Let's denote Donovan's part as 'x'. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, Betsy's part can be represented as 'x + 18'. The total time taken to make the meal is the sum of their individual times, which is given as 98 minutes. 

We can set up the equation: x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms: 2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides: 2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2: x = 40

Since x represents Donovan's part, and Betsy's part is x + 18, we can find Betsy's part by adding 18 to x: Betsy's part = 40 + 18 = 58

The cost of the painkillers is $4/pill for 30 pills. So, the cost of the painkillers is $4 * 30 = $120.

The cost of parking is $6/hour for 2 hours. So, the cost of parking is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, let's add up the costs: $200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482.

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."

"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center, we need to calculate the number of classes that visited each day and then add them up.

On Monday, 32 classes visited.
On Tuesday, twice as many visited, so 2 * 32 = 64 classes visited.
On Wednesday, three times as many visited, so 3 * 64 = 192 classes visited.
On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add up the number of classes that visited each day:
32 + 64 + 192 + 30 + 25 = 303

The final answer is: 303"
"To find the average score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the number of tests. 

First, let's add up the scores of the first 3 tests: 100 + 100 + 100 = 300. 

Then, we add the score of the 4th test: 300 + 80 = 380.

Now, we divide the total score by the number of tests: 380 / 4 = 95.

The final answer is: 95"
"To find the total number of pizzas left, we first need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by both the glee club and the football team.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. To find 70% of 20, we multiply 20 by 0.7:
20 * 0.7 = 14 pizzas eaten by the glee club.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. They ate 80% of them. To find 80% of 40, we multiply 40 by 0.8:
40 * 0.8 = 32 pizzas eaten by the football team.

Now, we add the number of pizzas eaten by both groups to find the total number of pizzas eaten:
14 (glee club) + 32 (football team) = 46 pizzas eaten in total.

The total number of pizzas ordered was 20 (glee club) + 40 (football team) = 60 pizzas.

To find the number of pizzas left, we subtract the total number of pizzas eaten from the total number of pizzas ordered:
60 - 46 = 14 pizzas left.

The final answer is: 14"
"To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the number of big coupons. Since Anthony wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, and he's sending out 700 small coupons, he'll send out 2 * 700 = 1400 big coupons.

The cost of mailing the small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents.

The cost of mailing the big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

Now, let's add the cost of mailing the small and big coupons together: 3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100: 24500 / 100 = 245 dollars.

The final answer is: $245"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches. This means Sidney ordered 10 - 3 = 7 meatball sub sandwiches.

2. Each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs. So, the total number of meatballs in the 7 sub sandwiches is 7 * 4 = 28.

3. Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. This means there are now 7 - 4 = 3 sub sandwiches left.

4. Since each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the remaining 3 sub sandwiches is 3 * 4 = 12.

The final answer is: 12"
"To find the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we first need to determine the number of trucks that did not experience mechanical failures. 

Since a quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures, we can calculate the number of trucks that failed as follows:

Number of trucks dispatched = 20
Number of trucks with mechanical failures = 20 * (1/4) = 5

Now, we subtract the number of trucks with mechanical failures from the total number of trucks dispatched to find the number of trucks that reached the farmers:

Number of trucks that reached the farmers = 20 - 5 = 15

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. To find the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we multiply the number of trucks that reached the farmers by the tons of fertiliser each truck carried:

Total tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers = 15 * 20 = 300

The final answer is: 300"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of 6 pounds of butter with the promotion. 

First, let's calculate the cost of 6 pounds of butter at the regular price: 6 pounds * $4.00 per pound = $24.00.

Since the promotion is buy one pound of butter get one half off, we can consider it as a 50% discount on the second pound of butter. 

For the first pound, the cost is $4.00. For the second pound, the cost is $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00. 

For the remaining 4 pounds, the cost is 4 * $4.00 = $16.00.

The total cost is $4.00 + $2.00 + $16.00 = $22.00.

The final answer is: $22.00"
"To find the total cost of the party, we first need to determine the total number of guests. Kayla invited 25 classmates, 7 dance class girls, and 13 family members, which totals 25 + 7 + 13 = 45. However, 4 people said they could not come, so we subtract those from the total: 45 - 4 = 41.

The base fee for renting the theater is $125. Since there are 41 guests, and the additional fee is $6 per guest, we multiply 41 by 6 to get the additional cost: 41 * 6 = 246.

Now, we add the base fee and the additional cost to get the total cost: 125 + 246 = 371.

The final answer is: $371"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much money Maggie and Riza spent. 

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which is 1/4 of $60. To find this, we multiply 60 by 1/4, which is the same as dividing 60 by 4. 

60 / 4 = 15

So Maggie spent $15. This means she has $60 - $15 = $45 left.

Riza spent one-third of her money, which is 1/3 of $60. To find this, we multiply 60 by 1/3, which is the same as dividing 60 by 3.

60 / 3 = 20

So Riza spent $20. This means she has $60 - $20 = $40 left.

Now, we need to find the total amount of money they have left. To do this, we add the money Maggie and Riza have left.

$45 (Maggie's money) + $40 (Riza's money) = $85

The final answer is: $85"
"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we first need to determine how many bananas the first and second monkeys eat each day. 

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day.

Since there are three monkeys in total, the total number of bananas they eat each day is 10 + 14 + x, where x is the number of bananas the third monkey eats. However, we know that the total number of bananas is 315, and they last for a week, which is 7 days. 

So, the total number of bananas eaten in a week is 315 * 7 = 2205. 

Since the first two monkeys eat 10 + 14 = 24 bananas each day, the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day is (2205 - 24 * 7) / 7.

First, calculate 24 * 7 = 168. 
Then, subtract 168 from 2205: 2205 - 168 = 2037.
Now, divide 2037 by 7: 2037 / 7 = 291.

The final answer is: 291"
"To find out how many puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we need to determine how many pieces he placed in total and then subtract the pieces he placed before the hour. 

Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, which is 500 / 2 = 250 pieces. 

Then, he finished another 500 piece puzzle. 

So, in total, he placed 250 + 500 = 750 pieces. 

Since he already placed 250 pieces before the hour, we subtract those from the total to find out how many pieces he placed during the hour: 750 - 250 = 500.

The final answer is: 500"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the roses and then find out how much change Jenny will get.

First, let's calculate the cost of the roses. Jenny bought 15 roses, but since a dozen roses cost $15, we can't buy a fraction of a dozen. So, we'll calculate the cost of 12 roses and the cost of 3 additional roses separately.

The cost of 12 roses is $15. 
The cost of 3 additional roses is 3 * $2 = $6.

The total cost of the roses is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny arrived with five $5 bills, which is a total of 5 * $5 = $25.

To find out how much change she will get, we subtract the total cost of the roses from the amount she arrived with: $25 - $21 = $4.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the $4 into quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so there are 4 * 4 = 16 quarters in $4.

The final answer is: 16"
"To find the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to calculate the revenue from each item and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the revenue from milkshakes: 
6 milkshakes * $5.50 each = 6 * 5.50 = $33

Next, let's calculate the revenue from burger platters: 
9 burger platters * $11 each = 9 * 11 = $99

Now, let's calculate the revenue from sodas: 
20 sodas * $1.50 each = 20 * 1.50 = $30

Finally, let's add the revenue from all items together: 
$33 + $99 + $30 = $162

"To find the time Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the time from the moment he arrives at the station to the moment the fourth train arrives.

The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the first train leaves the station at 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the second train leaves the station at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes. The third train leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it also leaves at 125 minutes.

The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes. This is the time Paul will board his train.

Since Paul is waiting for the fourth train, we need to find the time from the moment he arrives at the station to the moment the fourth train arrives. We don't know the exact time Paul arrives at the station, but we can assume it's 0 minutes for simplicity. 

The time Paul will wait for his train is 145 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many toothpicks Melanie has saved so far and then determine how many more weeks it will take her to reach 200 toothpicks.

Melanie saved 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. To find the total number of toothpicks she has saved, we multiply the number of toothpicks saved per week by the number of weeks:

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Since Melanie needs 200 toothpicks for the sculpture, we subtract the number of toothpicks she has saved from the total required:

200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take Melanie to save the remaining 80 toothpicks at a rate of 10 toothpicks per week:

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

Therefore, Melanie will need 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we first need to determine the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch and the price at which he sold it to his friend.

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price, so the price he paid is 75% of $2000, which is 0.75 * $2000 = $1500.

Then, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, which is 1.2 * $1500 = $1800.

To find the discount percentage, we need to find the difference between the original price and the price at which Mr. Rogers' friend bought the watch, and then divide it by the original price and multiply by 100.

The discount is ($2000 - $1800) = $200.

The percentage discount is ($200 / $2000) * 100 = 10%.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours and then multiply it by the rate at which the springs create jellyfish.

There are 60 minutes in an hour and 60 seconds in a minute. So, the total number of seconds in 4 hours is:

60 minutes/hour * 60 seconds/minute * 4 hours = 14400 seconds

Since each spring creates a new jellyfish every second, the total number of jellyfish created by one spring in 14400 seconds is 14400.

Now, if we have 5 springs working at the same rate, the total number of jellyfish created in 14400 seconds is:

14400 * 5 = 72000

So, 5 springs working at the same rate would create 72000 jellyfish in 4 hours.

The final answer is: 72000"
"To find Frankie's score, we need to first calculate twice Binkie's score and then add 15 to it. 

Binkie's score is 90. Twice Binkie's score is 2 * 90 = 180. 

Now, we add 15 to 180 to find Frankie's score: 180 + 15 = 195.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance James walked and then divide it by his speed.

First, James walked to the store, which is 4 miles. Then, he walked back home, which is another 4 miles. So, the total distance he walked is 4 + 4 = 8 miles.

Since James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour, we can calculate the time it took him to walk the total distance by dividing the total distance by his speed: 8 miles / 4 miles per hour = 2 hours.

However, this is the total time it took him to walk to the store and back home. Since the question asks for the time it took him to reach the store, we need to divide this time by 2, as he walked to the store and then back home. So, the time it took him to reach the store is 2 hours / 2 = 1 hour.

The final answer is: 1"
"To find out how much money Jenny saved, we first need to calculate the total cost of buying the bananas individually and then compare it to the cost of buying them in bunches.

If Jenny buys 10 bunches with 4 bananas per bunch, she buys a total of 10 * 4 = 40 bananas.

The cost of buying 40 bananas individually would be 40 * $0.80 = $32.00.

The cost of buying 10 bunches is $3.00 per bunch, so the total cost is 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

To find the savings, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as 'x'. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets 'x + 60' feet.

We know that the total amount of fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the rate of growth per year, we need to divide the growth in inches by the number of years. 

Growth per year = 8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches per year.

Now, we can multiply the growth per year by the total number of years to find the total growth in 13 years.

Total growth = 2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches.

The final answer is: 26"
"To find the total earnings, we first need to determine the number of each type of bike sold. 

Given that half of the bikes sold were Trekking bikes, and there were 300 bikes sold in total, the number of Trekking bikes sold is 300 / 2 = 150.

15% of the bikes sold were BMX bikes. To find the number of BMX bikes sold, we multiply 300 by 0.15: 300 * 0.15 = 45.

Since the rest of the bikes were MTB, we subtract the number of Trekking and BMX bikes from the total: 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes sold.

Now, we know the number of each type of bike sold: 150 Trekking, 45 BMX, and 105 MTB.

The price of a BMX bike is half the price of an MTB, so the price of a BMX bike is $500 / 2 = $250.

The total earnings from Trekking bikes is 150 * $450 = $67,500.

The total earnings from BMX bikes is 45 * $250 = $11,250.

The total earnings from MTB bikes is 105 * $500 = $52,500.

To find the total earnings, we add the earnings from each type of bike: $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250.

The final answer is: $131,250"
"To find out how many bales of hay are left in the field, we need to calculate the total number of bales made by the farmer and the total number of bales picked up by the truck, then subtract the latter from the former.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour. In a 6-hour day, the farmer will make 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour. In a 6-hour day, the truck will pick up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

Now, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the total number of bales made by the farmer: 30 - 18 = 12.

The number of bales of hay left in the field is 12."
"To find the total time John spends learning, we need to calculate the time spent in classes, and the extra time spent on Saturday and Sunday.

First, let's calculate the time spent in classes. John takes 2 extra classes, each 40 minutes long, 5 days a week. 

Time spent in classes per day = 2 * 40 minutes = 80 minutes
Time spent in classes per week = 80 minutes * 5 days = 400 minutes

Now, let's calculate the extra time spent on Saturday and Sunday. John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on extra learning time. 

First, we need to find the total minutes in a week. There are 24 hours in a day, and 7 days in a week. 

Total minutes in a day = 24 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 1440 minutes
Total minutes in a week = 1440 minutes/day * 7 days = 10080 minutes

Now, we can find the extra time spent on Saturday and Sunday.

Extra time per week = 1/16 * 10080 minutes = 630 minutes

Now, we can find the total time spent learning per week.

Total time spent learning per week = Time spent in classes per week + Extra time per week
Total time spent learning per week = 400 minutes + 630 minutes = 1030 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60.

Total time spent learning per week in hours = 1030 minutes / 60 = 17.17 hours

"To find the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the height of each child in inches. 

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the first child's height in inches is 6 * 12 = 72 inches.

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child's height is 72 + 2 = 74 inches.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child's height is 74 - 5 = 69 inches.

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child's height is 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

The final answer is: 72"
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to determine the number of bags sold and then multiply that by the price per bag.

Since the orchard sold a total of 2000 apples and each bag contains 10 apples, we can find the number of bags sold by dividing the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag:

2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags

Now, we can multiply the number of bags sold by the price per bag to find the total earnings:

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the amount of meat left after the Allosaurus ate. 

The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat. Before that, the velociraptors scavenged half of what was left. So, the amount of meat left after the velociraptors ate was twice the amount the Allosaurus ate, which is 2 * 270 = 540 kilograms.

Now, the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, which means the velociraptors scavenged half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. So, the amount of meat left after the T-Rex ate was twice the amount the velociraptors ate, which is 2 * 540 = 1080 kilograms.

Since the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, the original amount of meat on the triceratops was twice the amount the T-Rex ate, which is 2 * 1080 = 2160 kilograms.

"To calculate the total cost of painting the room, we need to find the total area of the walls that need to be painted and then divide it by the coverage of a gallon of paint to find out how many gallons are needed. After that, we can multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon to get the total cost.

First, let's find the total area of the walls:

- North and south walls: 2 walls * 10 ft * 8 ft = 160 sq ft
- East and west walls: 2 walls * 5 ft * 8 ft = 80 sq ft
- Total area: 160 sq ft + 80 sq ft = 240 sq ft

Since a gallon of paint covers 20 sq ft, we need to divide the total area by the coverage of a gallon to find out how many gallons are needed:

240 sq ft / 20 sq ft/gallon = 12 gallons

Now, we can multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon to get the total cost:

12 gallons * $12/gallon = $144

"To find the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to determine the probability of her choosing a shaken can out of the remaining cans.

Initially, there were 12 sodas. Ellen shook 3 of them, so 9 were unshaken. She took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 8 unshaken and 3 shaken sodas. Ellen's brother took 1 shaken and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 2 shaken and 6 unshaken sodas.

The total number of sodas left is 2 (shaken) + 6 (unshaken) = 8.

The probability of Ellen's friend choosing a shaken can is the number of shaken cans divided by the total number of cans: 2/8 = 0.25.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.25 * 100 = 25%.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the distance each train travels in 3 hours and then add those distances together.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. To find the distance it travels in 3 hours, we multiply its speed by the time:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour x 3 hours
Distance = 180 miles

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour. To find the distance it travels in 3 hours, we multiply its speed by the time:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour x 3 hours
Distance = 90 miles

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, we add the distances they traveled to find the total distance between them:

Total Distance = Distance of first train + Distance of second train
Total Distance = 180 miles + 90 miles
Total Distance = 270 miles

The final answer is: 270"
"To find the total number of people Billy can help, we first need to determine the number of days he works. 

March has 31 days, and April has 19 days (since April 19th is the last day). So, the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th is 31 + 19 = 50 days.

Billy takes 20% of these days off, which is 0.2 * 50 = 10 days. Therefore, he works 50 - 10 = 40 days.

Since Billy can help 2 people per hour and works 3 hours a day, he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

To find the total number of people he can help, we multiply the number of days he works by the number of people he can help per day: 40 * 6 = 240.

"To find the total number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people that were transported by the buses and the cars, and then subtract that from the total number of people that were present.

First, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the buses: 
12 buses * 35 people per bus = 420 people

Next, let's calculate the total number of people transported by the cars: 
20 cars * 3 people per car = 60 people

Now, let's add the number of people transported by the buses and the cars: 
420 people + 60 people = 480 people

Since the question asks for the number of people inside the church, we need to subtract the number of people transported from the total number of people present. However, the total number of people present is not given. We can only calculate the number of people that were not inside the church, which is the number of people transported. 

To find the number of people inside the church, we need more information about the total number of people present. However, we can assume that the question is asking for the number of people that were not inside the church, which is the number of people transported.

Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
Martha's age = 24 - 4
Martha's age = 20

Now that we know Martha's age, we can find Jeff's age since he is 10 years older than Martha.

Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
Jeff's age = 20 + 10
Jeff's age = 30

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 x 15-minute breaks per day. 

First, let's convert the breaks into minutes: 2 x 15 minutes = 30 minutes.

Now, let's add the lunch and breaks: 30 minutes (lunch) + 30 minutes (breaks) = 60 minutes per day.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours: 60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour.

Now, let's multiply the daily time by 5: 1 hour * 5 = 5 hours.

The total time spent on lunch and breaks after 5 days is 5 hours.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we first need to determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can multiply 8 by 3.5 to find Micah's total.

8 * 3.5 = 28 miles

Now that we know Micah ran 28 miles, we can subtract the total miles run by Amber and Micah from the total miles run by all three to find out how many miles Ahito ran.

Total miles run by all three = 52 miles
Miles run by Amber = 8 miles
Miles run by Micah = 28 miles
Miles run by Ahito = Total miles - (Miles run by Amber + Miles run by Micah)
Miles run by Ahito = 52 - (8 + 28)
Miles run by Ahito = 52 - 36
Miles run by Ahito = 16 miles

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total amount she spent after returning the item and then add it to the initial charge.

1. Initial charge: $85.00
2. Return: -$15.00 (since she returned an item)
   New balance after return: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

3. Frying pan purchase: 20% off $20.00
   Discount: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
   Price after discount: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00
   New balance: $70.00 + $16.00 = $86.00

4. Towel purchase: 10% off $30.00
   Discount: 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
   Price after discount: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00
   New balance: $86.00 + $27.00 = $113.00

The new balance on her credit card is $113.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as 'x'. 

A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is x/5.

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (x/5) * (1/3) = x/15.

The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue, so the number of small jellyfish is x - x/5 = 4x/5.

We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color, which means x/15 = 6.

To find the total number of jellyfish, we can solve for x: x/15 = 6 => x = 6 * 15 = 90.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find Caroline's age, we need to determine Ben's age first, and then multiply it by 3. 

Since Chris is 4 years old, and Ben is two times older than Chris, we can calculate Ben's age as follows: 
Ben's age = 2 * Chris's age
Ben's age = 2 * 4
Ben's age = 8

Now that we know Ben's age, we can find Caroline's age by multiplying Ben's age by 3:
Caroline's age = 3 * Ben's age
Caroline's age = 3 * 8
Caroline's age = 24

The final answer is: 24"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate Lauren's total savings needed for retirement and then determine how many years she needs to work to achieve this goal.

First, let's calculate Lauren's annual expenses in retirement. Since she plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary, her annual expenses will be:

40% of $100,000 = 0.4 x $100,000 = $40,000

Since Lauren plans to live for 20 years in retirement, her total expenses will be:

$40,000 x 20 = $800,000

Next, we need to calculate Lauren's annual savings. Since she saves 20% of her salary, her annual savings will be:

20% of $100,000 = 0.2 x $100,000 = $20,000

Now, we need to calculate how many years Lauren needs to work to save $800,000 at an annual savings rate of $20,000. We can use the formula:

Number of years = Total savings / Annual savings
= $800,000 / $20,000
= 40 years

However, this is the total number of years Lauren needs to work to save for retirement, but we need to subtract the 20 years she plans to live in retirement. Therefore, the number of years Lauren needs to work is:

40 - 20 = 20 years

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the length of each final cut, we need to first divide the total length of the ribbon by 4 to get the length of each of the initial cuts. 

100 cm / 4 = 25 cm

Then, we need to divide the length of each initial cut by 5 to get the length of each final cut.

25 cm / 5 = 5 cm

"To find the total population of the school, we can use the information given about the boys. Since 40% of the school population is 240 boys, we can set up the equation:

0.4x = 240

where x is the total population of the school.

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.4:

x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

Now that we know the total population of the school is 600, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total population:

Number of girls = Total population - Number of boys
= 600 - 240
= 360

The final answer is: 360"
"To find the total amount spent, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items before applying the coupon. 

The cost of the set of pots is $19, and the cost of the sack of garden soil is $26. 

Total cost = cost of pots + cost of soil = $19 + $26 = $45

Now, we need to subtract the coupon value from the total cost to get the final amount spent.

Final amount spent = Total cost - coupon value = $45 - $7 = $38

"To find the average height of heels at the party, we need to calculate the total height of all the heels and then divide it by the total number of women.

The total number of women is 6 (3 wearing 4-inch heels and 3 wearing 2-inch heels).

The total height of the heels for the women wearing 4-inch heels is 3 * 4 = 12 inches.
The total height of the heels for the women wearing 2-inch heels is 3 * 2 = 6 inches.

The total height of all the heels is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.

To find the average height of heels, we divide the total height by the total number of women: 18 / 6 = 3 inches.

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike, we first need to calculate the total number of days in June. June has 30 days.

Since Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in 30 days, we can calculate her daily target by dividing the total miles by the number of days:

9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

Soledad is planning to hike 125 miles twice a day, which is a total of 250 miles per day. To find out how many more miles per day she needs to hike, we subtract her planned daily miles from her target daily miles:

310 miles per day - 250 miles per day = 60 miles per day

So, Soledad must hike 60 more miles per day to complete her journey on time.

"To find the total amount the store will receive after selling all the balls, we need to calculate the total revenue from each color of balls and add them together.

The store has 3 red balls, each costing $9. So, the total revenue from red balls is 3 * $9 = $27.

The store has 11 blue balls, each costing $5. So, the total revenue from blue balls is 11 * $5 = $55.

The store has 25 green balls, each costing $3. So, the total revenue from green balls is 25 * $3 = $75.

Now, let's add the revenues from all the balls together: $27 + $55 + $75 = $157.

"To find out how much James will have left, we first need to determine how much Pierre and Paul will take. 

Pierre wants a quarter of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/4 = 3 kg. 

Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/3 = 4 kg.

So, Pierre and Paul will take 3 + 4 = 7 kg in total.

Since they bought 12 kg, James will have 12 - 7 = 5 kg left.

"To find out how much money Raymond has left, we need to calculate the total amount of money he spent and subtract that from the initial amount he had.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money he spent: $5 (comic book) + $19 (puzzle) = $24.

Now, let's subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount he had: $21 (initial amount) - $24 (total spent) = -$3.

However, since we can't have a negative amount of money, this means that Raymond doesn't have enough money to buy the puzzle. He is short $3.

But if we consider the puzzle purchase as an impossible transaction, we can calculate the amount of money he has left after buying the comic book: $21 (initial amount) - $5 (comic book) = $16.

So, Raymond has $16 left after buying the comic book."
"To find the cost of each book, we need to first determine how much Anna spent on the books. We know she had a budget of $16 and had $2 left, so she spent $16 - $2 = $14 on the books.

Since she bought 2 books and they cost the same amount of money, we can divide the total amount spent by 2 to find the cost of each book. 

Cost of each book = Total amount spent / Number of books
Cost of each book = $14 / 2
Cost of each book = $7

"To find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times, we need to first determine the rate at which the light blinks. 

The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. To find the rate, we divide the number of blinks by the time: 255 blinks / 5 minutes = 51 blinks per minute.

Now, we can use this rate to find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times. We divide the total number of blinks by the rate: 459 blinks / 51 blinks per minute.

459 / 51 = 9 minutes.

"To find the difference between the number of female and male fishes, we first need to calculate the total number of each type of fish after Tate's purchase.

Initially, there are:
- 4 male guppies
- 7 female guppies
- 3 male goldfishes
- 5 female goldfishes

Tate buys:
- 2 male guppies
- 1 female guppy
- 2 male goldfishes
- 3 female goldfishes

So, after the purchase, the total number of each type of fish is:
- Male guppies: 4 + 2 = 6
- Female guppies: 7 + 1 = 8
- Male goldfishes: 3 + 2 = 5
- Female goldfishes: 5 + 3 = 8

Now, let's calculate the total number of male and female fishes:
- Total male fishes: 6 (guppies) + 5 (goldfishes) = 11
- Total female fishes: 8 (guppies) + 8 (goldfishes) = 16

The difference between the number of female and male fishes is: 16 - 11 = 5

"To find the total time they all took to do their chores, we need to calculate the time each person took and add them together.

Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia, so Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours to walk the dog.

Dior took over 4 hours longer than Amalia, so Dior took 4 + 4 = 8 hours to do laundry.

Now, let's add the time each person took to do their chores: 4 (Amalia) + 6 (Megan) + 8 (Dior) = 18 hours.

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 18 hours."
"To find the total distance John drives in a round trip, we need to calculate the distance of a single trip and then multiply it by 2.

The distance of a single trip is calculated using the formula: distance = speed * time. 

Given that the speed is 70 mph and the time is 2 hours, we can plug in the values: distance = 70 * 2 = 140 miles.

Since John makes two trips a month, we need to multiply the distance of a single trip by 2: 140 * 2 = 280 miles.

Therefore, John drives 280 miles a month when visiting his parents.

280"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how far Sofie will walk in 7 days. Since Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, we can multiply the number of miles she walks per day by the number of days:

10 miles/day * 7 days = 70 miles

Since Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship:

Sofie's distance = 2 * Brian's distance

We know that Sofie's distance is 70 miles, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

70 miles = 2 * Brian's distance

To find Brian's distance, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

Brian's distance = 70 miles / 2
Brian's distance = 35 miles

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

The final answer is: 35"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers and then find out how many toys the fifth worker must produce to meet the remaining demand.

First, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the 2 workers who produce 6 toys an hour:

2 workers * 6 toys/hour * 10 hours = 120 toys

Next, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the 2 workers who produce 4 toys an hour:

2 workers * 4 toys/hour * 10 hours = 80 toys

Now, let's add the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers:

120 toys + 80 toys = 200 toys

The manufacturer still needs 20 toys to meet the order, so the total number of toys needed is 400. Since the first 4 workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must produce the remaining toys to meet the demand.

Let's denote the number of toys produced by the fifth worker as x. We know that the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker and the first 4 workers is 400. We can set up the equation:

200 + x = 400

To find the value of x, we subtract 200 from both sides of the equation:

x = 400 - 200
x = 200

However, this is the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker in 10 hours. To find the number of toys produced per hour, we divide x by 10:

x / 10 = 200 / 10
x = 20

The fifth worker produces 20 toys per hour."
"To find the total weight of Elijah's dogs, we first need to find the weight of each of his dogs. 

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so we multiply 60 by 1/4 to find the weight of Elijah's first dog: 60 * (1/4) = 15 pounds.

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so we multiply 60 by 1/2 to find the weight of Elijah's second dog: 60 * (1/2) = 30 pounds.

Now, we add the weights of Elijah's two dogs to find the total weight of his dogs: 15 + 30 = 45 pounds.

To find the total weight of all three dogs, we add the weight of Kory's dog to the total weight of Elijah's dogs: 60 + 45 = 105 pounds.

The final answer is: 105"
"To solve this problem, let's work backwards from the information given.

Kris had 7 stickers left after giving some to Rob. Kris had 9 stickers and gave 7 to Rob, so Kris had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers before giving any to Rob.

Luis gave the rest of the stickers to Kris, and Kris had 16 stickers. This means Luis had 16 + 7 = 23 stickers before giving any to Kris.

Luis used half of the stickers and gave the rest to Kris. This means Luis had 23 stickers and gave half of them to Kris. Half of 23 is 11.5, but since you can't give half a sticker, we'll assume Luis had an even number of stickers. Let's try 22 stickers. Half of 22 is 11, which is a whole number.

So, Luis had 22 stickers before giving any to Kris. 

Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. Luis had 22 stickers, so Seth must have given him 22 * 2 = 44 stickers.

"To find the total number of M&M's John has, we need to calculate the total weight of the M&M's and then multiply it by the number of M&M's per ounce. 

First, let's find the total weight of the M&M's: 3 large bags * 10 ounces per bag = 30 ounces.

Since an ounce of M&M's has 30 M&M's, the total number of M&M's is 30 ounces * 30 M&M's per ounce = 900 M&M's.

Now, we need to find out how many small bags John can make. Each small bag contains 10 M&M's, so we divide the total number of M&M's by 10: 900 M&M's / 10 M&M's per small bag = 90 small bags.

The final answer is: 90"
"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we need to first calculate half of the earth's circumference. 

The earth's circumference is 40,000 kilometers. Half of that would be 40,000 / 2 = 20,000 kilometers.

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly 20,000 kilometers. We know that Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. 

To find the number of days, we can divide the total distance (20,000 kilometers) by the distance Alfie flies per day (400 kilometers). 

20,000 / 400 = 50 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the speed of the 2nd fastest car first, and then use that to find the speed of the fastest car.

Given that the average car can go 120 miles per hour, and the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, we can calculate the speed of the 2nd fastest car as follows:

Speed of 2nd fastest car = 5 * Speed of average car
= 5 * 120
= 600 miles per hour

Now, we know that the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. We can calculate the speed of the fastest car as follows:

Speed of fastest car = 1.25 * Speed of 2nd fastest car
= 1.25 * 600
= 750 miles per hour

Liam's current age is 16 years. Two years ago, Liam's age would be 16 - 2 = 14 years.

Two years ago, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince. So, Vince's age two years ago would be 14 / 2 = 7 years.

To find Vince's current age, we need to add 2 years to his age two years ago. Vince's current age is 7 + 2 = 9 years.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold as A, Madeline as M, Camden as C, and Sarah as S.

We know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so A = M.

We also know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. This can be expressed as C + S = 30 and C = S + 12.

We can rewrite the second equation as C = S + 12 and substitute it into the first equation: (S + 12) + S = 30.

Combine like terms: 2S + 12 = 30.

Subtract 12 from both sides: 2S = 18.

Divide both sides by 2: S = 9.

Now that we know S, we can find C by substituting S into the equation C = S + 12: C = 9 + 12 = 21.

Since A = M, and the total number of eggs is 56, we can write the equation A + M + C + S = 56.

Substitute the values of A, M, C, and S: A + A + 21 + 9 = 56.

Combine like terms: 2A + 30 = 56.

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2A = 26.

Divide both sides by 2: A = 13.

Now that we know A and C, we can find the difference between the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold: C - A = 21 - 13 = 8.

"To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we first need to find the total weight of the crayons and the total weight of the boxes separately.

Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce and Nik has 200 crayons, the total weight of the crayons is 200 ounces.

Each box weighs 8 ounces, and Nik will need 200 / 8 = 25 boxes to put all his crayons into. So, the total weight of the boxes is 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 200 (crayons) + 200 (boxes) = 400 ounces.

Since there are 16 ounces to a pound, we can convert the total weight from ounces to pounds by dividing by 16: 400 / 16 = 25 pounds.

The final answer is: 25"
"To find out how much John makes, we first need to determine how many logs he can make from the tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, we calculate 80% of 80 feet.

80% of 80 feet = 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet

Since each log is 4 feet long, we divide the total length of the usable tree by the length of each log to find the number of logs.

64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs

From each log, he cuts 5 planks. So, we multiply the number of logs by the number of planks per log.

16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks

He sells each plank for $1.2. To find the total amount he makes, we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank.

80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96

"To find the total amount of money they all have together, we need to first determine the monthly earnings of Valerie's brother and their mother.

Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is half of what her brother earns. So, her brother's monthly earnings are 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, which is 2 * ($5000 + $10,000) = 2 * $15,000 = $30,000.

Now, we can find the total amount of money they all have together by adding their individual monthly earnings: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The final answer is: $40,000"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Grandma's speed on the beach and on the sidewalk. 

Let's denote Grandma's speed on the beach as 'x' miles per minute. Since she walks at twice the rate on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.

We know that she walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. The time taken to walk 2 miles on the beach is 2/x, and the time taken to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk is 1/(2x).

We are given that 40 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach. This means that 2/x = 40/60 (converting 40 minutes to hours for uniformity). 

Solving for x, we get x = 2/40 * 60 = 3 miles per minute.

Now, we know that her speed on the sidewalk is 2x = 2 * 3 = 6 miles per minute.

The time taken to walk 2 miles on the beach is 2/3 = 40/60 minutes, and the time taken to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk is 1/6 minutes.

The total time taken to complete the entire 3-mile walk is 40/60 + 1/6. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 60. 

40/60 + 10/60 = 50/60 = 5/6 hours. 

To convert 5/6 hours to minutes, we multiply by 60: 5/6 * 60 = 50 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much Jane has saved so far. Since she has been saving $4 per week for 8 weeks, we can multiply the amount she saves per week by the number of weeks:

$4/week * 8 weeks = $32

Now, we need to find out how much more she needs to save to reach her goal of $60. We can subtract the amount she has already saved from her goal:

$60 - $32 = $28

Since she saves $4 per week, we can divide the amount she still needs to save by the amount she saves per week to find out how many more weeks it will take:

$28 / $4/week = 7 weeks

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many marbles Bob originally had. We know that if he receives 2 dozen (24) more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. 

Let's denote the original number of marbles as 'x'. Then, the equation can be written as:

x + 24 = 60

To find 'x', we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 24 from both sides:

x = 60 - 24
x = 36

So, Bob originally had 36 marbles. Now, if he loses 10 marbles, we need to subtract 10 from 36 to find out how many marbles he will have left:

36 - 10 = 26

"To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum temperature of the second bottle of water. 

Let's denote the temperature of the second bottle as x degrees. 

When Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle into his water bottle, the total volume of water in the bottle is 5 ounces. 

Since the temperature of the mixture is at least 40 degrees, we can set up the following equation:

(33 * 4 + x * 1) / 5 >= 40

Simplifying the equation:

132 + x >= 200

Subtracting 132 from both sides:

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of cows. Melanie's father starts with 50 cows. Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, there are 21 days in three weeks. 

Number of cows added in three weeks = 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
Total number of cows = Initial number of cows + Number of cows added
Total number of cows = 50 + 420
Total number of cows = 470

Next, let's calculate the number of chickens. Melanie's father starts with 20 chickens. Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. 

Number of chickens added in three weeks = 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens
Total number of chickens = Initial number of chickens + Number of chickens added
Total number of chickens = 20 + 210
Total number of chickens = 230

Now, let's add the total number of cows and chickens to find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks.

Total number of animals = Total number of cows + Total number of chickens
Total number of animals = 470 + 230
Total number of animals = 700

The final answer is: 700"
"To find the cost of each single bagel, we first need to calculate the total cost of the 4 packs of bagels with the 10% discount. 

The original cost of 4 packs of bagels is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00. 

Since Russell receives a 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of $40.00. 
10% of $40.00 = 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00

Now, we subtract the discount from the original cost to get the discounted cost. 
Discounted cost = Original cost - Discount = $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

Since each pack has 9 bagels, the total number of bagels in 4 packs is 4 * 9 = 36 bagels.

To find the cost of each single bagel, we divide the discounted cost by the total number of bagels. 
Cost per bagel = Discounted cost / Total number of bagels = $36.00 / 36 = $1.00

The final answer is: $1.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. We know that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops, so we can write this as an equation:

Gomer's scoops = 23 - 5
Gomer's scoops = 18

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes it takes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. We know that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops, so we can write this as an equation:

Potatoes per scoop = 6 - 3
Potatoes per scoop = 3

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes it takes to make 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. We can multiply the number of scoops by the number of potatoes per scoop:

Total potatoes = Gomer's scoops * Potatoes per scoop
Total potatoes = 18 * 3
Total potatoes = 54

So, Gomer ate 54 potatoes.

The final answer is: 54"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days and the next 30 days, then add them together and convert the total to dozens.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs in the first 30 days is 3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs.

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs in the next 30 days is 5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs.

The total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days is 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we can convert the total number of eggs to dozens by dividing by 12: 240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozen eggs.

The final answer is: 20"
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we first need to determine the total number of red and green jellybeans. We know there are 17 green jellybeans and twice as many red jellybeans, so the number of red jellybeans is 2 * 17 = 34.

The total number of green and red jellybeans is 17 + 34 = 51. Since there are a total of 60 jellybeans, the number of blue jellybeans can be found by subtracting the total number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans: 60 - 51 = 9.

The final answer is: 9"
"To find the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade, we need to calculate the total number of lemons he collects in one year and then multiply it by 10.

First, let's find the total number of lemons he collects in one year. He has 5 trees and each tree gives him 6 lemons per year. 

Total lemons per year = Number of trees * Lemons per tree per year
Total lemons per year = 5 * 6
Total lemons per year = 30

Now, we multiply the total lemons per year by 10 to find the total lemons in a decade.

Total lemons in a decade = Total lemons per year * 10
Total lemons in a decade = 30 * 10
Total lemons in a decade = 300

The final answer is: 300"
"To find the number of women who remained on the bus, we first need to find the total number of women on the bus initially. 

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, we can let the number of men be 5x and the number of women be 9x. 

Since the total number of passengers is 84, we can set up the equation: 5x + 9x = 84

Combine like terms: 14x = 84

Divide both sides by 14: x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of women on the bus initially: 9x = 9 * 6 = 54

After 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining is: 54 - 20 = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold per day. 

Faraday earned $26 from the sunflowers per day. Since each sunflower costs $2, we can find the number of sunflowers sold per day by dividing the total earnings from sunflowers by the cost of each sunflower.

Number of sunflowers sold per day = Total earnings from sunflowers / Cost of each sunflower
= $26 / $2
= 13

Next, we need to find out how many bouquets Faraday sold per day. Faraday earned $56 from the bouquets per day. Since each bouquet costs $8, we can find the number of bouquets sold per day by dividing the total earnings from bouquets by the cost of each bouquet.

Number of bouquets sold per day = Total earnings from bouquets / Cost of each bouquet
= $56 / $8
= 7

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the total number of sunflowers in each bouquet is 12. Therefore, the number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold per day is:

Number of sunflowers in bouquets sold per day = Number of bouquets sold per day * Number of sunflowers in each bouquet
= 7 * 12
= 84

Now, we can find the total number of sunflowers sold per day by adding the number of sunflowers sold directly and the number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold.

Total sunflowers sold per day = Number of sunflowers sold per day + Number of sunflowers in bouquets sold per day
= 13 + 84
= 97

To find the total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days, we multiply the total number of sunflowers sold per day by 3.

Total sunflowers sold in 3 days = Total sunflowers sold per day * 3
= 97 * 3
= 291

The final answer is: 291"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of rocks Adam can buy, the total revenue from selling 60% of the inventory, and then find the difference between the total revenue and the initial investment.

First, let's find the number of rocks Adam can buy with $100. Since each rock costs $5, we divide the total amount by the cost per rock:

100 / 5 = 20 rocks

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling 60% of the inventory. Since Adam sells 60% of 20 rocks, we multiply 20 by 0.6:

20 * 0.6 = 12 rocks

The revenue from selling each rock is $7, so we multiply the number of rocks sold by the selling price:

12 * 7 = $84

Now, let's find the difference between the total revenue and the initial investment:

Initial investment: $100
Total revenue: $84
Loss: $100 - $84 = $16

The final answer is: $16"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of days it takes Lauren to complete each type of picture scene. 

First, let's find the number of days it takes Lauren to complete each type of picture scene:

- Large-sized picture scenes: 45 / 5 = 9 days
- Medium-sized picture scenes: 36 / 6 = 6 days
- Small-sized picture scenes: 49 / 7 = 7 days

Now, we need to find the LCM of 9, 6, and 7. 

The prime factorization of 6 is 2 * 3.
The prime factorization of 7 is 7.
The prime factorization of 9 is 3^2.

To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the numbers:
- The highest power of 2 is 2 (from 6).
- The highest power of 3 is 3^2 (from 9).
- The highest power of 7 is 7 (from 7).

So, the LCM is 2 * 3^2 * 7 = 2 * 9 * 7 = 126.

Therefore, it will take Lauren 126 days to complete all the picture scenes.

"To find out how much Jen spends on food for her fish in May, we need to calculate the total cost of food for a month. 

First, we need to determine the number of days in May. May has 31 days. 

Since each fish needs $1 worth of food a day, and Jen has 3 fish, the daily cost of food for all her fish is 3 * $1 = $3.

To find the total cost for the month, we multiply the daily cost by the number of days in May: $3 * 31 = $93.

So, Jen spends $93 on food for her fish in May.

The final answer is: $93"
"To find out how many roses Patricia has now, we need to first determine how many roses she had after giving some to her mother. 

Initially, Patricia had 30 roses. She gave 24 roses to her mother, so we subtract 24 from 30 to find out how many roses she had left: 30 - 24 = 6.

Then, Patricia bought 15 more roses. To find out how many roses she has now, we add the 15 new roses to the 6 she already had: 6 + 15 = 21.

So, Patricia now has 21 roses.

The final answer is: 21"

First, let's find the total distance traveled: 
Distance traveled in the first part = 110 miles
Distance traveled in the second part = 140 miles
Total distance = 110 + 140 = 250 miles

Next, let's find the total time taken:
Time taken in the first part = 2 hours
Time taken in the second part = 3 hours
Total time = 2 + 3 = 5 hours

Now, we can calculate the average speed:
Average speed = Total distance / Total time
Average speed = 250 miles / 5 hours
Average speed = 50 miles per hour

"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning. 

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which is 0.2 in decimal form. 

The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability is 3 times the probability of the first ticket. Since the first ticket has a 20% chance, the second ticket has a 60% chance (3 * 20% = 60%). In decimal form, this is 0.6.

To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning: 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

The final answer is: 12"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many seashells Carrey collected. Let's denote the number of seashells Carrey collected as 'x'. Since Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, Carlos collected 2x seashells. We are given that Jim collected 5 more than Carlos, so Jim collected 2x + 5 seashells.

We know that the total number of seashells collected is the sum of the seashells collected by each person: x + 2x + (2x + 5) = 5x + 5.

Since they divided the seashells equally among themselves, the total number of seashells is also equal to 3 times the number of seashells each person got: (5x + 5) = 3y, where y is the number of seashells each person got.

Now, we can solve for y: 
(5x + 5) = 3y
5x + 5 = 3y
5x = 3y - 5
x = (3y - 5) / 5

However, we also know that the total number of seashells collected by Jim is 27, which is 2x + 5. So, we can set up another equation:
2x + 5 = 27
2x = 22
x = 11

Now that we know x, we can find y:
y = (5x + 5) / 3
y = (5 * 11 + 5) / 3
y = (55 + 5) / 3
y = 60 / 3
y = 20

So, each person got 20 seashells.

"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song first. Since the second song is 60% longer than the first song, we can calculate its length by adding 60% of the first song's length to the first song's length.

First, we need to convert 60% to a decimal by dividing by 100: 60 / 100 = 0.6.

Then, we multiply the first song's length by 0.6 to find the additional length: 5 minutes * 0.6 = 3 minutes.

Now, we add the additional length to the first song's length to find the second song's length: 5 minutes + 3 minutes = 8 minutes.

Finally, we add the lengths of both songs to find the total length of the cassette: 5 minutes + 8 minutes = 13 minutes.

The cost price of one device is $20, and the selling price is twice the cost price, which is 2 * $20 = $40.

The profit from one device is the selling price minus the cost price, which is $40 - $20 = $20.

Linus bought 2 devices on Monday and 4 devices on Tuesday, so the total number of devices sold is 2 + 4 = 6.

The total profit is the profit from one device multiplied by the total number of devices sold, which is $20 * 6 = $120.

"To find the length of Carl's cane, we need to determine Carl's height first. We know that Isabel is 7 feet tall and Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel. 

Isabel's height = 7 feet
Ned's height = Isabel's height - 2 feet
Ned's height = 7 - 2
Ned's height = 5 feet

Since Carl is one foot taller than Ned, we can calculate Carl's height as follows:
Carl's height = Ned's height + 1 foot
Carl's height = 5 + 1
Carl's height = 6 feet

We are given that Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. Therefore, we can calculate the length of the cane as follows:
Cane's length = Carl's height / 2
Cane's length = 6 / 2
Cane's length = 3 feet

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of bottles required to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, and then subtract the number of bottles Hortex can produce in a day.

First, let's find out how many bottles are needed to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people. Since each bottle covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand, we need to find out how many bottles are needed for 2300 people.

2300 people * 100% = 2300 people * 1 = 2300 people
Since each bottle covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand, we need to divide 2300 people by 20% (or 0.2) to find out how many bottles are needed for 2300 people.
2300 / 0.2 = 11500 bottles

Now, let's find out how many bottles Hortex can produce in a day, which is given as 4200 bottles.

To find out how many more bottles Hortex needs to produce, we subtract the number of bottles it can produce from the total number of bottles needed:
11500 - 4200 = 7300

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how many babies are wearing purple and blue. Since Carla has 8 babies and 3/4 of them are wearing purple, we can calculate the number of purple babies as follows:

Number of purple babies = 3/4 * 8 = 6

Similarly, the number of blue babies is:

Number of blue babies = 1/4 * 8 = 2

Now, let's find out how many babies are wearing bows. We know that all the blue babies and 1/3 of the purple babies are wearing bows. So, the number of purple babies wearing bows is:

Number of purple babies wearing bows = 1/3 * 6 = 2

The total number of babies wearing bows is the sum of blue babies and purple babies wearing bows:

Total number of babies wearing bows = 2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4

Now, we need to find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. This can be calculated as the number of purple babies wearing bows divided by the total number of babies wearing bows, multiplied by 100:

"To find the total amount of money Abraham will earn, we need to calculate the amount of money he earned from each sale and add them together.

First, Abraham sold half of his land for $50. Since he owns 80 square meters, half of that is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters. 

Next, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. Since he owns 80 square meters, 1/4 of that is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters. 

Now, let's calculate the amount of land he has left. He started with 80 square meters, sold 40 square meters, and then sold 20 square meters. So, he has 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters left.

He sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, the amount of money he earned from selling the remaining land is 20 * 3 = $60.

"To find the total amount John makes in a week, we first need to determine the number of apartments in each complex and the total number of collections he makes in a week.

The first two apartment complexes have 200 apartments each, so the total number of apartments in these two complexes is 2 * 200 = 400.

The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, which means it is 160% of the other two combined (100% + 60% = 160%). To find the number of apartments in the last complex, we multiply the total number of apartments in the first two complexes by 1.6 (which is the same as 160% or 160/100).

Number of apartments in the last complex = 400 * 1.6 = 640

Total number of apartments = 400 + 640 = 1040

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so the total number of collections he makes in a week is 3 * 1040 = 3120.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection for each apartment, so the total amount he makes in a week is 3120 * $0.40 = $1248.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of fruits produced by the tree in each year and then sum them up.

In the 5th year, the tree produces 50 fruits.
In the 6th year, it produces 3 times the initial amount, which is 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
In the 7th year, it produces 7 times the initial amount, which is 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
In the 8th year, it produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree, but we don't know the production of a 10-year-old tree yet. We'll come back to this later.
In the 9th year, the tree doesn't produce any fruits.
In the 10th year, a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now, let's find the production of an 8-year-old tree. We know that a 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits. Since an 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree, an 8-year-old tree produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

Now, let's sum up the total number of fruits produced by the tree in each year:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's assume Ronnie was given $5. Since Rissa was given thrice as much, Rissa was given 3 * $5 = $15.

After each of them gave an equal amount of money to their little sister, let's call the amount they gave 'x'. So, Ronnie is left with $5 - x and Rissa is left with $15 - x.

We are given that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, which means (15 - x) = (4/5) * 15. 

To find the value of x, we can solve the equation: 
(15 - x) = (4/5) * 15
15 - x = 12
x = 3

Now that we know x, we can find out how much money Ronnie is left with:
Ronnie's money left = $5 - x

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the amount of red, white, and purple paint as 'r'. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, the total amount of these three colors is 3r.

We know that half the mural is yellow, so the amount of yellow paint is 12 / 2 = 6 pints.

The total amount of paint used in the mural is 12 pints, which is the sum of the red, white, purple, and yellow paint. We can write this as an equation:

3r + 6 = 12

To solve for 'r', we need to isolate 'r' on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 6 from both sides:

3r = 12 - 6
3r = 6

Now, we can divide both sides by 3 to find the value of 'r':

r = 6 / 3
r = 2

Since 'r' represents the amount of red, white, and purple paint, and we know that there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple, the amount of red paint is also 2 pints.

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms = 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area = 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is given as 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas together: 
Total area = area of bedrooms + area of living room + area of the rest of the house
Total area = 960 + 1200 + 1000
Total area = 3160 square feet.

The final answer is: 3160"
"To find the total number of clouds Alice counted, we need to calculate the number of clouds for each day and add them up.

On Monday, Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds.

On Tuesday, she sees double the number of clouds as the day before, so she counts 3 * 2 = 6 clouds.

On Wednesday, she sees double the number of clouds as the day before, so she counts 6 * 2 = 12 clouds.

On Thursday, she sees double the number of clouds as the day before, so she counts 12 * 2 = 24 clouds.

On Friday, she sees double the number of clouds as the day before, so she counts 24 * 2 = 48 clouds.

Now, let's add up the number of clouds for each day: 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93.

The final answer is: 93"
"To find the number of pods in the new box, we need to calculate 20% of 100 and add it to 100. 

20% of 100 = 0.2 * 100 = 20
Number of pods in the new box = 100 + 20 = 120

Now, we know that the new box costs $12 and has 120 pods. To find out how many cycles we can run for $1, we need to divide the total number of pods by the cost of the box and then divide by the cost per cycle.

Cost per cycle = $12 / 120 = $0.1 per cycle

Now, we can find the number of cycles we can run for $1:
Number of cycles for $1 = 1 / $0.1 = 10

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. This means he has 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he is left with 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill, which means he uses 40 / 2 = 20 bills. This leaves him with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

4. Thomas then triples his money. Since each bill is worth $20, tripling his money means each bill is now worth $60. So, he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills, but each is worth $60.

5. To find the total amount of money he has, we multiply the number of bills by the value of each bill: 60 * $60 = $3600.

6. He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. To find the number of 5 dollar bills, we divide the total amount of money by the value of each 5 dollar bill: $3600 / $5 = 720.

The final answer is: 720"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's determine the number of goals scored by team B in the first half. Since team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, and team A scored 4 goals, team B scored 4 - 2 = 2 goals in the first half.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 2 * 4 = 8 goals.

Now, let's find out how many goals team A scored in the second half. Team A scored 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B in the second half, which is 8 * 1/4 = 2 goals.

The total number of goals scored by team A is 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals. The total number of goals scored by team B is 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals.

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much chalk the teacher has left after Monday and then determine how many days it will last.

The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk. He uses 45% of it on Monday, so we need to find 45% of 5 inches.

45% of 5 inches = 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches

This means the teacher has 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches of chalk left after Monday.

Now, we need to find out how many days the remaining 2.75 inches of chalk will last when the teacher uses 20% of it each day.

Let's assume the number of days the chalk will last is 'x'. Then, 20% of 2.75 inches will be used each day.

0.20 * 2.75 = 0.55 inches per day

Since the teacher starts with 2.75 inches, we can set up the equation:

2.75 = 0.55x

To solve for 'x', we divide both sides by 0.55:

x = 2.75 / 0.55
x = 5

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the number of students not on varsity, we first need to determine the number of students on varsity. 

One-third of the girls are on varsity, so the number of girls on varsity is 12 * (1/3) = 4. 

One-fourth of the boys are on varsity, so the number of boys on varsity is 12 * (1/4) = 3.

The total number of students on varsity is 4 (girls) + 3 (boys) = 7.

Since there are 24 students in total (12 boys and 12 girls), the number of students not on varsity is 24 - 7 = 17.

"To find out how many face masks Johnny bought, we need to first determine how many face masks Mike bought, and then calculate three times that amount and add 2.

Mike bought 5 face masks. 

Three times the number of face masks Mike bought is 3 * 5 = 15.

Johnny bought 2 more than three times as many as Mike, so we add 2 to 15: 15 + 2 = 17.

The final answer is: 17"
"To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we first need to determine the total number of teeth the dentist worked on. The dentist drilled 4 teeth and capped 7 more than he drilled, so the number of teeth capped is 4 + 7 = 11.

The total number of teeth the dentist worked on is 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15.

To find the percentage of teeth the dentist fixed, we divide the number of teeth worked on by the total number of teeth James has, and then multiply by 100.

(15 / 30) * 100 = 50%

"To find the total cost of the milk, we first need to calculate the total amount Mr. Marcellus paid for the milk. 

Total gallons of milk = 4000
Cost per gallon = $3.5
Total cost = Total gallons of milk * Cost per gallon
Total cost = 4000 * $3.5
Total cost = $14,000

Since 2/5 of the milk was expired, we need to find the amount of expired milk. 

Amount of expired milk = 2/5 * Total gallons of milk
Amount of expired milk = 2/5 * 4000
Amount of expired milk = 1600 gallons

The company will refund the cost of the expired milk. 

Refund = Amount of expired milk * Cost per gallon
Refund = 1600 * $3.5
Refund = $5,600

The final answer is: $5600"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Colin's current age as C and Wendy's current age as W.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:
W = 5(C + 7)

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:
C + 25 = (1/3)W

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))

Simplifying the equation:
C + 25 = (5/3)(C + 7)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides:
75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides:
40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2:
20 = C

"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we first need to determine the total number of books he can buy with $27000. 

Since he can buy 100 books for $500, we can find the total number of books by dividing the total amount spent ($27000) by the cost of 100 books ($500).

Total number of books = $27000 / $500 = 54

Now, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books Bob can buy per school.

Books per school = Total number of books / Number of schools
= 54 / 3

"Let's break down the events step by step:

1. Initially, 2 apples fell out of the tree. Newton picked up 2 apples, so he had 2 in his hand.
2. He put 1 apple in his pocket, leaving 1 apple in his hand. Then, he threw the apple in his hand into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. Now, he has 5 apples in his hand and 1 in his pocket.
3. He put all but 1 of the 5 apples in his hand into his pocket, leaving 1 apple in his hand. So, he now has 1 apple in his hand and 6 apples in his pocket (1 from the previous step + 5 new ones).
4. He threw the apple in his hand at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out. Now, he has 6 apples in his hand and 6 apples in his pocket.
5. He picked up all the remaining apples, which are the 6 apples in his hand and the 6 apples that fell out of the tree. So, he has a total of 12 apples.

First, let's find the total number of bags: 
Total coal ordered = 850 kg
Weight of each bag = 50 kg
Number of bags = Total coal ordered / Weight of each bag
Number of bags = 850 / 50
Number of bags = 17

Now, let's find the total cost:
Cost per bag = $18
Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
Total cost = 17 * 18
Total cost = 306

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of slices each type of pizza that Kate's friends will eat, and then determine the total number of slices needed. 

First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten by Kate's friends: 
6 friends * 6 slices per friend = 36 slices

Next, let's calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten by Kate's friends: 
6 friends * 4 slices per friend = 24 slices

Since the cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices and the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, we need to find the total number of whole pizzas needed for each type. 

For the cheese pizza: 
36 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas

For the pepperoni pizza: 
24 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas

Since Kate needs to buy whole pizzas, she needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas. 

To find the total number of pizzas Kate needs to buy, we add the number of cheese pizzas and pepperoni pizzas: 
3 cheese pizzas + 3 pepperoni pizzas = 6 pizzas

"To find the total miles Sam ran this week, we need to calculate the miles run on each day and add them together.

Sam ran 3 miles on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Since there are 3 days, we multiply 3 miles by 3 to get the total miles run on these days: 3 * 3 = 9 miles.

Sam ran 5 miles on Tuesday and Thursday. Since there are 2 days, we multiply 5 miles by 2 to get the total miles run on these days: 5 * 2 = 10 miles.

Now, we add the miles run on both sets of days: 9 miles + 10 miles = 19 miles.

"To solve this problem, we need to find the net rate at which Jay is building snowballs. He builds 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 melt every 15 minutes. 

First, let's convert the melting rate to an hourly rate. Since there are 4 15-minute intervals in an hour, the melting rate is 2 * 4 = 8 snowballs per hour.

Now, let's find the net rate at which Jay is building snowballs. This is the rate at which he builds snowballs minus the rate at which they melt: 20 - 8 = 12 snowballs per hour.

To find the time it takes for Jay to have 60 snowballs, we can divide the target number of snowballs by the net rate: 60 / 12 = 5 hours.

However, this is the time it takes to build 60 snowballs, but it doesn't account for the initial 0 snowballs Jay has. Since he starts with 0 snowballs, he needs to build 60 snowballs, which takes 5 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how old Jim was 20 years ago, when Digimon first came out. Since John is 28 now, we can subtract 20 from his current age to find his age at that time.

John's age 20 years ago = 28 - 20 = 8

Since John was twice as old as Jim 20 years ago, we can set up an equation to find Jim's age at that time:

John's age 20 years ago = 2 * Jim's age 20 years ago
8 = 2 * Jim's age 20 years ago

To find Jim's age 20 years ago, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

Jim's age 20 years ago = 8 / 2
Jim's age 20 years ago = 4

Now, to find Jim's current age, we add 20 to his age 20 years ago:

Jim's current age = Jim's age 20 years ago + 20
Jim's current age = 4 + 20
Jim's current age = 24

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as 'x'. 

On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, the remaining bandages after the first day are x - 38 + 50.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. The remaining bandages after the second day are (x - 38 + 50) - 28.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages (2 * 50 = 100) and used half a pack (50 / 2 = 25 bandages). The remaining bandages after the third day are ((x - 38 + 50) - 28) - 25 + 100.

We are given that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. So, we can set up the equation:

(x - 38 + 50) - 28 - 25 + 100 = 78

Simplifying the equation:

x - 38 + 50 - 28 - 25 + 100 = 78
x + 57 = 78

Subtracting 57 from both sides:

x = 21

"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to calculate her total hours worked and then multiply it by her hourly rate. 

Since Jen works 7.5 hours a day and there are 6 days in a week, we can calculate her total hours worked in a week as follows:
7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week = 45 hours/week

Since there are 4 weeks in April, we can calculate her total hours worked in April as follows:
45 hours/week * 4 weeks = 180 hours

Now, we can calculate her total earnings for April by multiplying her total hours worked by her hourly rate:
180 hours * $1.5/hour = $270

Additionally, since Jen has complete attendance for the month, she will receive an additional $10. Therefore, her total earnings for April will be:

"To find the total amount Jason earned, we need to calculate the earnings for each task and then add them up.

For the dishwasher, Jason emptied it 6 times at $0.50 per time, so his earnings from the dishwasher are 6 * $0.50 = $3.00.

For the laundry, Jason did it once at $3.00, so his earnings from the laundry are $3.00.

For the trash, Jason took it out twice at $0.75 per time, so his earnings from the trash are 2 * $0.75 = $1.50.

For the room, Jason cleaned it once at $1.50, so his earnings from the room are $1.50.

Now, let's add up all the earnings: $3.00 (dishwasher) + $3.00 (laundry) + $1.50 (trash) + $1.50 (room) = $8.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the cost of the scotch and the cognac separately, and then add them together.

The cost of the scotch is $600 for 10 bottles, so the cost per bottle is $600 / 10 = $60.

Since John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, he buys 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The cost of the cognac is 50% more than the scotch, so the cost per bottle of cognac is $60 + ($60 * 0.5) = $90.

The total cost of the cognac is 20 * $90 = $1800.

The total cost of everything is the sum of the cost of the scotch and the cognac: $600 + $1800 = $2400.

"To find out how much root beer was available for each person to drink, we need to calculate the total amount of root beer remaining after all the incidents.

Initially, Fred made 24 gallons of root beer.

On the first day, his children drank 4 gallons, so the remaining amount is 24 - 4 = 20 gallons.

On the second day, his wife spilled 7 gallons, so the remaining amount is 20 - 7 = 13 gallons.

On the third day, Ronnie drank 5 gallons, so the remaining amount is 13 - 5 = 8 gallons.

On the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party, and they shared the remaining root beer equally. To find out how much each person got, we need to divide the remaining amount by 3.

Remaining root beer = 8 gallons

"To find the number of fish with red stripes, we first need to calculate one-third of the total number of fish. 

One-third of 66 is 66 / 3 = 22.

Now, we know that 22 fish have red stripes. To find the number of remaining fish, we subtract the number of fish with red stripes from the total number of fish.

Remaining fish = Total fish - Fish with red stripes
Remaining fish = 66 - 22
Remaining fish = 44

Now, we need to find the number of fish with blue stripes, which is 5/11 of the remaining fish.

Number of fish with blue stripes = (5/11) * Remaining fish
Number of fish with blue stripes = (5/11) * 44
Number of fish with blue stripes = 20

Now, we need to find the total number of fish with red and blue stripes. We add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes.

Total fish with red and blue stripes = Fish with red stripes + Fish with blue stripes
Total fish with red and blue stripes = 22 + 20
Total fish with red and blue stripes = 42

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Amy had 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each, so she had a total of 2 * 4 = 8 eyeshadow colors from the palettes.

She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 eyeshadow colors each, so she had a total of 3 * 6 = 18 eyeshadow colors from the makeup sets.

In total, Amy had 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadow colors.

Her sister stole one of the palettes, which means Amy lost 4 eyeshadow colors (since each palette has 4 colors).

Now, Amy has 26 - 4 = 22 eyeshadow colors left.

Amy then uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. Since each makeup set has 6 eyeshadow colors, half of that is 6 / 2 = 3 eyeshadow colors.

So, Amy uses up 3 eyeshadow colors from one makeup set.

Now, Amy has 22 - 3 = 19 eyeshadow colors left.

"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we first need to determine the height of the two-story house and the first floor.

Mattison's height is 60 inches. The two-story house is 7 times as high as he is, so the total height of the two-story house is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.

The first floor's floor to ceiling height is thrice as high as Mattison's height, which is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

Since the two-story house is 420 inches high, and the first floor is 180 inches high, the height of the second floor is 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

The height of the roof from the second floor's floor is the same as the height of the second floor, which is 240 inches.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount John borrowed and then subtract the amount he used to pay off his debts.

First, let's calculate the amount John borrowed. He borrowed 40% of the value of his house, which is $250,000. 

40% of $250,000 = 0.4 * $250,000 = $100,000

Next, John used 60% of the borrowed amount to pay off his debts. 

60% of $100,000 = 0.6 * $100,000 = $60,000

Now, we need to find out how much money John had leftover after paying off his debts. To do this, we subtract the amount he used to pay off his debts from the amount he borrowed.

"To find the total earnings, we need to calculate the total weight of the tunas first. 

The total weight of the tunas is the sum of the weights of the three tunas: 
56 kg + 46 kg + 26 kg = 128 kg

Since a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, we multiply the total weight by the cost per kilogram to find the total earnings:
128 kg * $0.50/kg = $64

The final answer is: $64"
"To find Trinity's profit, we need to first find the selling price of the magazines. 

The cost price of the magazines is $72. Trinity sells the magazines at 11/8 of the cost price. 

To find the selling price, we multiply the cost price by 11/8:
Selling price = (11/8) * 72
Selling price = (11 * 72) / 8
Selling price = 792 / 8
Selling price = 99

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the cost price from the selling price:
Profit = Selling price - Cost price
Profit = 99 - 72
Profit = 27

The final answer is: $27"
"To find the total amount of water removed, we need to calculate the amount of water removed by each setting and then add them together.

The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed by the low setting is 1 * 3 = 3 liters.

The medium setting removes twice as much water as the low setting, which is 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 3 days, the total amount of water removed by the medium setting is 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

The high setting removes twice as much water as the medium setting, which is 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day. Since Brian ran it for 5 days, the total amount of water removed by the high setting is 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

Now, we add the total amount of water removed by each setting: 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

The final answer is: 29"
"To find out how many balloons were thrown, we need to first determine the total number of balloons Jolene and her friends had initially. Since they filled up 10 packs of balloons with 30 balloons per pack, we can calculate the total number of balloons as follows:

Total number of balloons = Number of packs * Number of balloons per pack
Total number of balloons = 10 * 30
Total number of balloons = 300

Since 12 balloons were left by the end of the afternoon, we can find the number of balloons thrown by subtracting the remaining balloons from the total number of balloons:

Number of balloons thrown = Total number of balloons - Remaining balloons
Number of balloons thrown = 300 - 12
Number of balloons thrown = 288

The final answer is: 288"
"To find the total amount of the second medicine, we need to calculate 3 times the amount of the first medicine. 

The first medicine is 14 mL, so 3 times that amount is 3 * 14 = 42 mL.

Now, we need to find the total amount of both medicines in one dose. The first medicine is 14 mL, and the second medicine is 42 mL, so the total amount in one dose is 14 + 42 = 56 mL.

To find the total amount in 8 doses, we multiply the amount in one dose by 8. 

56 mL * 8 = 448 mL.

The final answer is: 448"
"To find the combined capacity of both schools, we first need to determine the capacity of John's school. 

Since each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, we can find the capacity of one of John's classes by multiplying Ali's class capacity by 1/8.

Capacity of one of John's classes = 120 * (1/8) = 15 students

Since John has two classes, we multiply the capacity of one class by 2 to find the total capacity of John's school.

Capacity of John's school = 15 * 2 = 30 students

Now, we add the capacity of Ali's school (which is 120 students) to the capacity of John's school to find the combined capacity of both schools.

Combined capacity = 120 + 30 = 150

The final answer is: 150"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total interest Stephen owes his sister. 

First, we need to find the total interest he owes. The interest is 2% of $300, which is 0.02 * 300 = $6.

Since Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, the total amount he pays in the first 11 months is 25 * 11 = $275.

The remaining amount, including the interest, will be paid in the twelfth month. This remaining amount is the initial loan plus the interest minus the total paid in the first 11 months. So, the remaining amount is 300 + 6 - 275 = $31.

The final answer is: $31"
"To find out how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we first need to determine the total number of diaper changes required for both children. Since each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, and there are 2 children, the total number of diaper changes is 2 * 5 = 10.

Since Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, we need to find out how many diapers she changes. Half of 10 is 5, so Jordan's wife changes 5 diapers per day.

To find out how many diapers Jordan changes, we subtract the number of diapers his wife changes from the total number of diaper changes. So, 10 - 5 = 5.

Therefore, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the total number of jelly beans in the jar, we first need to calculate the volume of the jar. The jar has a square base with a side length of 6 inches and a height of 15 inches. The volume of a rectangular prism (such as the jar) is given by the formula V = lwh, where l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height.

Given that the base is square, the length and width are the same, so we can use the formula V = s^2h, where s is the side length of the square base.

V = s^2h
V = 6^2 * 15
V = 36 * 15
V = 540 cubic inches

Since the jelly beans have an efficiency of 80%, we need to divide the volume of the jar by 0.8 to get the total volume that can be occupied by the jelly beans.

Total volume for jelly beans = 540 / 0.8
Total volume for jelly beans = 675 cubic inches

Since each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, we can divide the total volume for jelly beans by the volume of a single jelly bean to get the total number of jelly beans.

Total number of jelly beans = 675 / 0.15
Total number of jelly beans = 4500

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we can multiply the total number of jelly beans by 0.3 to get the number of red jelly beans.

Number of red jelly beans = 4500 * 0.3
Number of red jelly beans = 1350

However, we are given that the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find out how far off Tim's guess was, we need to know what his guess was. Since we don't have that information, we can't calculate the exact difference. 

However, we can calculate the ratio of the true number of red jelly beans to the estimated number of red jelly beans. 

Ratio = True number of red jelly beans / Estimated number of red jelly beans
Ratio = 900 / 1350
Ratio = 0.6667

This ratio can be interpreted as a percentage, which is approximately 66.67%. This means that Tim's guess was 33.33% off the true number of red jelly beans.

If we assume that the estimated number of red jelly beans is 1350, we can calculate the difference between the true and estimated number of red jelly beans.

Difference = Estimated number of red jelly beans - True number of red jelly beans
Difference = 1350 - 900
Difference = 450

The final answer is: 450"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, the bus had 20 people. 

At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus became 20 + 40 = 60.

At the second stop, 3/4 of the people who entered at the first stop entered the bus. Since 40 people entered at the first stop, 3/4 * 40 = 30 people entered at the second stop. So, the total number of people on the bus became 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus became 2 * 90 = 180.

The bus has a capacity of 200 people. To find the remaining spaces, we subtract the current number of people from the capacity: 200 - 180 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of Pauline's visits over the 8 years. 

First, let's calculate the cost of the visits for the first 5 years. Since the cost of one visit is $2, the total cost for 5 years is 5 * 2 = $10.

Now, the cost of one visit has increased by 150%. This means the new cost of one visit is 2 + (2 * 1.5) = $5.

For the next 3 years, Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year, so the total number of visits is 3 * 3 = 9. The total cost for these 9 visits is 9 * 5 = $45.

The total cost for all 8 years is the sum of the cost for the first 5 years and the cost for the next 3 years: 10 + 45 = $55.

The final numerical answer is: $55"
"To find out how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to determine the total number of groups required and then multiply that by the time it takes for each group to try the escape room.

There are 4 grades (4-7) with 10 students in each grade, so the total number of students is 4 * 10 = 40.

Since only the top 10 students in each grade get to try the escape room, we need to find the total number of students who will try the escape room. Since there are 4 grades, we need to find the total number of students who will try the escape room in each grade, which is 10 students per grade. So, the total number of students who will try the escape room is 4 * 10 = 40.

However, only 8 students can try the escape room at a time. To find the total number of groups, we divide the total number of students who will try the escape room by the number of students per group: 40 / 8 = 5.

Since each group uses their full 45 minutes, the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room is the number of groups multiplied by the time per group: 5 * 45 = 225 minutes.

The final answer is: 225"
"To find out how much Ali has to pay John, we need to calculate the total cost of the tables and the total cost of the roof frames, then add them together.

The cost of the tables is 4 tables * $20 per table = $80.
The cost of the roof frames is 2 frames * $10 per frame = $20.

Now, we add the cost of the tables and the cost of the roof frames together: $80 + $20 = $100.

The final numerical answer is: $100"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length can be represented as 4x.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, and it is divided into two pieces. Therefore, the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is equal to 40 feet. We can write this as an equation:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Now, divide both sides of the equation by 5 to solve for x:

x = 40 / 5
x = 8

Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, we can find its length by multiplying x by 4:

Longer piece = 4x
Longer piece = 4 * 8
Longer piece = 32

The final answer is: 32"
"To determine the amount of seasoning Aiden needs, we first need to find out how many pounds of ground beef he needs to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound to find the total pounds of meat needed.

Total meatballs needed = 80
Meatballs per pound = 16

Total pounds of meat needed = Total meatballs needed / Meatballs per pound
Total pounds of meat needed = 80 / 16
Total pounds of meat needed = 5

Now that we know Aiden needs 5 pounds of ground beef, we can find out how much seasoning he needs. He adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat.

Total pounds of meat needed = 5
Seasoning per pound = 2 tablespoons

Total seasoning needed = Total pounds of meat needed * Seasoning per pound
Total seasoning needed = 5 * 2
Total seasoning needed = 10

"To find the total width of the windows, we need to multiply the width of one window by the total number of windows. 

Width of one window = 35 inches
Number of windows = 5

Total width of windows = Width of one window * Number of windows
Total width of windows = 35 * 5
Total width of windows = 175 inches

Since Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, we need to multiply the total width by 2.

Fabric needed = 2 * Total width of windows
Fabric needed = 2 * 175
Fabric needed = 350 inches

"To find the total inches of rain on Tuesday, we first need to calculate the amount of rain that fell on Monday, which is given as 2 inches. 

Next, we need to find out how much rain is expected on Tuesday, which is 1 more inch than twice the amount that fell on Monday. 

Twice the amount that fell on Monday is 2 * 2 = 4 inches. 

1 more inch than that is 4 + 1 = 5 inches.

So, the total amount of rain expected on Tuesday is 5 inches.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of treats Carly made. Since each person gets two treats and there are five people in the class, the total number of treats is 2 * 5 = 10.

Let's denote the number of cupcakes as C and the number of brownies as B. We know that B = 3C - 2, since Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes.

We also know that the total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, so C + B = 10.

Substituting the expression for B from the first equation into the second equation, we get C + (3C - 2) = 10.

Combine like terms: 4C - 2 = 10.

Add 2 to both sides: 4C = 12.

Divide both sides by 4: C = 3.

The final answer is: 3"
"To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the 20% discount. 

The original cost of both manicure and pedicure is $35 + $40 = $75. 

The 20% discount on $75 is 0.20 * $75 = $15. 

So, the discounted cost of both manicure and pedicure is $75 - $15 = $60.

Since Karen wants to add nail art on each of her fingers, and there are 10 fingers in total (5 on each hand), the cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost for Karen would be the discounted cost of manicure and pedicure plus the cost of nail art, which is $60 + $30 = $90.

The first 3 magazines send 12 issues a year, so the total from these magazines is 3 * 12 = 36 issues.

The second magazine sends 6 issues a year.

The third magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, which is 4 * 6 = 24 issues.

Now, let's add the total number of issues from all magazines: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66 issues.

So, Susan receives 66 magazines every year.

The final answer is: 66"
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given. We know that Samantha has 27 paintings and that she has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley. 

Let's denote the number of paintings Shelley has as S. Since Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, we can write an equation:

Samantha's paintings = Shelley's paintings - 12
27 = S - 12

To find the number of paintings Shelley has, we need to add 12 to both sides of the equation:

S = 27 + 12
S = 39

Now that we know Shelley has 39 paintings, we can use the information that Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim to find the number of paintings Kim has. Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as K. We can write an equation:

Shelley's paintings = Kim's paintings + 8
39 = K + 8

To find the number of paintings Kim has, we need to subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:

K = 39 - 8
K = 31

"To find the price of the toy after the discount in January, we need to calculate the price after the increase in December and then apply the decrease in January.

The initial price of the toy in November is $40.

In December, the price increased by 80%. To find the new price, we multiply the initial price by 1.8 (100% + 80% = 180%, or 1 + 0.8 = 1.8).

New price in December = $40 * 1.8 = $72

In January, the price decreased by 50%. To find the new price, we multiply the price in December by 0.5 (100% - 50% = 50%, or 1 - 0.5 = 0.5).

New price in January = $72 * 0.5 = $36

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"To find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to calculate the earnings from the standard rate lessons and the reduced rate lessons separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the earnings from the standard rate lessons. Charlie has 4 lessons at his standard rate of $80 per hour. So, the total earnings from the standard rate lessons will be:

4 lessons * $80 per lesson = $320

Next, let's calculate the earnings from the reduced rate lessons. Charlie has 2 lessons at a reduced rate, which is 25% less than his standard rate. To find the reduced rate, we need to calculate 25% of $80 and subtract it from $80.

25% of $80 = 0.25 * $80 = $20
Reduced rate = $80 - $20 = $60

Now, let's calculate the total earnings from the reduced rate lessons:

2 lessons * $60 per lesson = $120

Finally, let's add the earnings from the standard rate lessons and the reduced rate lessons to find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day:

Total earnings = $320 + $120 = $440

210 + 60 = 270
270 + 40 = 310
310 + 90 = 400
400 + 100 = 500
500 + 70 = 570
570 + 60 = 630

The sum of all the scores is 630.

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many pomelos Eve gave away. Let's start by identifying the information given:

- Eve originally had 20 pieces of pomelos.
- After giving some away, she is left with 1/4 of the pomelos she originally had.

Since Eve is left with 1/4 of the original amount, we can set up an equation to represent this situation:

Let x be the number of pomelos Eve gave away.

The equation can be written as: 20 - x = (1/4) * 20

To solve for x, we can simplify the equation:

20 - x = 5

Now, we can isolate x by subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation:

-x = -15

Multiplying both sides by -1 to solve for x:

x = 15

So, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

"To find the total amount of money Walter received, we need to calculate the number of apples he had left after eating and giving some to his sister, and then multiply that by the price per apple.

First, Walter ate 2/5 of the 60 apples. To find 2/5 of 60, we multiply 60 by 2 and divide by 5:

60 * 2 = 120
120 / 5 = 24

So, Walter ate 24 apples. Now, we subtract 24 from the total number of apples to find the remaining number:

60 - 24 = 36

Walter then gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples. To find 25% of 36, we multiply 36 by 0.25:

36 * 0.25 = 9

So, Walter gave his sister 9 apples. Now, we subtract 9 from the remaining number to find the number of apples he had left:

36 - 9 = 27

Walter sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. To find the total amount of money he received, we multiply the number of apples by the price per apple:

27 * 3 = 81

The final answer is: $81"

"To find the total distance covered by Michael in 3 days, we need to calculate the distance he travels in one day and then multiply it by 3.

First, let's convert the speed from km/hr to km/day. Since there are 24 hours in a day, we multiply 50 km/hr by 24 hours to get the distance covered in a day:

50 km/hr * 24 hr/day = 1200 km/day

Now, we multiply the daily distance by 3 to get the total distance covered in 3 days:

1200 km/day * 3 days = 3600 km

Now, we need to find the percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered. To do this, we divide the distance covered by Michael by the total distance between Alaska and Texas, and then multiply by 100:

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Madeline ate 6 grapes.
2. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make a full glass, so he used 6 * 5 = 30 grapes.
3. The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.
4. Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies. Each pie requires 12 grapes, so the total number of grapes used by their mother is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.
5. To find the total number of grapes at the beginning, we need to add the grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and their mother. However, since the grapes used by their mother are the remaining grapes, we need to subtract the grapes used by Madeline and her brother from the total number of grapes used by their mother to find the initial number of grapes. 
   Total grapes used by their mother = 48
   Total grapes used by Madeline and her brother = 36
   Initial number of grapes = Total grapes used by their mother + Total grapes used by Madeline and her brother
   Initial number of grapes = 48 + 36

"To find the total cost of making macaroni and cheese, we need to calculate the cost of the pasta, cheddar cheese, and gruyere cheese.

The cost of the pasta is $1.00 per box. Since Bud makes it once a week, he buys 52 boxes in a year (52 weeks). The total cost of the pasta is 52 * $1.00 = $52.00.

The cost of the cheddar cheese is $3.00. Since Bud makes it once a week, he buys 52 blocks in a year. The total cost of the cheddar cheese is 52 * $3.00 = $156.00.

The cost of the gruyere cheese is twice the cost of the cheddar cheese, which is 2 * $3.00 = $6.00. Since Bud makes it once a week, he buys 52 blocks in a year. The total cost of the gruyere cheese is 52 * $6.00 = $312.00.

The total cost of making macaroni and cheese is the sum of the costs of the pasta, cheddar cheese, and gruyere cheese. Total cost = $52.00 + $156.00 + $312.00 = $520.00.

"To find the total number of classrooms the custodian needs to clean, we already know that number is 80. 

The custodian has 5 days to clean the classrooms. We need to find out how many minutes they have to clean in total. Since they work 8 hours a day, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, they work 8 * 60 = 480 minutes per day.

In 5 days, they work a total of 5 * 480 = 2400 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how many minutes they spend cleaning per classroom. It takes them 15 minutes per classroom.

To find the total time spent cleaning, we multiply the number of classrooms by the time spent per classroom: 80 * 15 = 1200 minutes.

Now, we need to find the percentage of their day spent cleaning. To do this, we divide the total time spent cleaning by the total time available and multiply by 100: (1200 / 2400) * 100 = 50%.

"To solve this problem, let's first determine the capacity of each shelf. 

Let's denote the capacity of a middle shelf as 'm'. Since the bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, its capacity is 2m. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so its capacity is 2m - 5.

We know that each of the middle shelves can hold 10 books. Therefore, m = 10.

Now, we can calculate the capacity of the bottom and top shelves:
- Bottom shelf: 2m = 2 * 10 = 20 books
- Top shelf: 2m - 5 = 2 * 10 - 5 = 15 books

The total capacity of the middle shelves is 2 * 10 = 20 books. The total capacity of the bottom and top shelves is 20 + 15 = 35 books.

The total capacity of one bookcase is 20 (middle) + 20 (bottom) + 15 (top) = 55 books.

Since Elly has 110 books, we need to find out how many bookcases are required to hold all of them. 

To do this, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase: 110 / 55 = 2.

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

"To find the cost of each stick of jerky, we need to first calculate the total cost of the bag after the discount and then divide that by the number of sticks.

The original price of the bag is $18.00, and there's a $3.00 discount. So, the discounted price is $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00.

Since the price is in dollars, we need to convert it to cents for consistency. There are 100 cents in a dollar, so the discounted price in cents is $15.00 * 100 = 1500 cents.

Now, we divide the total cost in cents by the number of sticks to find the cost per stick: 1500 cents / 30 sticks = 50 cents per stick.

The final answer is: 50"
"To determine the total number of questions Audrey needs to answer correctly to move on to 7th grade, we first need to find the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly out of the total questions in both tests. 

The total number of questions in both tests is 70 + 40 = 110. To pass, she needs to answer 70% of 110 questions correctly. 

70% of 110 is calculated as 0.7 * 110 = 77. 

Now, let's find out how many questions she got right in the first test. She got 60% of 70 questions correct, which is 0.6 * 70 = 42.

To find out how many questions she needs to get right in the second test, we subtract the number of questions she got right in the first test from the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly. 

77 - 42 = 35.

So, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move onto 7th grade.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as 's' and the number of blueberry cubes as 'b'. We know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so we can write the equation:

s + b = 116

We also know that the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, so we can write another equation:

b = 5s - 4

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for 's':

s + (5s - 4) = 116

Combine like terms:

6s - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides:

6s = 120

Divide both sides by 6:

s = 20

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting 's' into the second equation:

b = 5(20) - 4
b = 100 - 4
b = 96

The final answer is: 96"
"To find the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years, we need to calculate the total number of games she has played and then multiply it by her score per game.

Ara has been playing 40 games every year for 4 years. So, the total number of games she has played is:
40 games/year * 4 years = 160 games

Since her score for every game is 21 points, we can multiply the total number of games by her score per game to find the total points:
160 games * 21 points/game = 3360 points

The final answer is: 3360"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Brendan had 10 marbles.

He dropped half of them, so he lost 10 / 2 = 5 marbles.

He found 3 marbles, so he now has 5 (lost) + 3 (found) = 8 marbles.

However, one of the marbles he picked up was a bead, not a marble. So, he got rid of 1 marble.

Now, he has 8 - 1 = 7 marbles.

"To find the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of flashlights and the number of candles separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of flashlights. There are 4 people in the family, and each person has a flashlight. So, the total number of flashlights is 4.

Next, let's calculate the number of candles. There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. 

Half of 8 rooms is 4. So, 4 rooms have 4 small candles each, which is 4 * 4 = 16 small candles. The other 4 rooms have 5 medium candles each, which is 4 * 5 = 20 medium candles. 

The total number of candles is 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles.

Now, we add the number of flashlights and the number of candles together: 4 flashlights + 36 candles = 40.

The final answer is: 40"

"To find the total time it takes to solve the Rubik's cube, we need to calculate the time for each side and add them up.

The first side takes 5 minutes. 
The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so they take 5 * 2 = 10 minutes each.
The last two sides each take half as long as the first side, so they take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes each.

Now, let's add up the time for all sides:
5 (first side) + 10 (second side) + 10 (third side) + 2.5 (fourth side) + 2.5 (fifth side) = 30 minutes

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for Phineas to cover the distance on land and in water separately, and then add them together.

Since Phineas needs to cover 200 yards, and half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, we can calculate the distance for each as follows:

Distance on land = 200 yards / 2 = 100 yards
Distance in water = 200 yards / 2 = 100 yards

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for Phineas to cover each distance:

Time on land = Distance on land / Speed on land = 100 yards / 20 yards/minute = 5 minutes
Time in water = Distance in water / Speed in water = 100 yards / 10 yards/minute = 10 minutes

Total time = Time on land + Time in water = 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes

"To find the total cost, we first need to determine how many boxes of popsicle sticks Bob needs to buy. Since he needs 56 popsicle sticks and each box contains 8 sticks, we can divide 56 by 8 to find the number of boxes needed.

56 ÷ 8 = 7

So, Bob needs 7 boxes of popsicle sticks. Each box costs $2.00, so we can multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box to find the total cost.

7 boxes * $2.00 per box = $14.00

The final answer is: $14.00"
"To find the total cost of the phone plan, we need to determine the cost of the additional phones and add it to the cost of the main phone.

Let's assume the cost of each additional phone is x. Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of the main phone is 2x.

We know that the main phone costs $20, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 20

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 20 / 2
x = 10

Now that we know the cost of each additional phone is $10, we can find the total cost of the additional phones. There are 4 additional phones, so the total cost of the additional phones is:

4x = 4 * 10
4x = 40

The total cost of the phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones:

Total cost = 20 + 40
Total cost = 60

The final answer is: $60"
"To find out how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to calculate the total number of doughnuts he sells in a day and then multiply it by the number of days in June.

Since Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day, and 1 dozen is equal to 12, we can calculate the total number of doughnuts he makes in a day as follows:

10 dozen * 12 doughnuts/dozen = 120 doughnuts/day

Since Derrick sells all the doughnuts, we can assume he sells 120 doughnuts every day.

June has 30 days. So, the total number of doughnuts Derrick sells in June is:

120 doughnuts/day * 30 days = 3600 doughnuts

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Derrick makes in June by multiplying the total number of doughnuts sold by the price per doughnut:

"To solve this problem, we need to first find John's new speaking speed after training. 

His original speed is 150 WPM (words per minute). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster, so we multiply his original speed by 2.5:

New speed = 150 WPM * 2.5 = 375 WPM

Next, we need to find the total number of words in 10 pages, each with 450 words per page:

Total words = 10 pages * 450 words/page = 4500 words

Now, we can find the time it would take John to speak 4500 words at his new speed:

Time = Total words / New speed
Time = 4500 words / 375 WPM
Time = 12 minutes

"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the total number of people he saw on the first three days and add it to the total number of people he saw on the remaining days.

On the first day, Conor saw 50 people.

On the second day, there were 20 more people than on the first day, so the number of people on the second day is 50 + 20 = 70.

On the third day, the number of people was twice the number on the second day, so the number of people on the third day is 2 * 70 = 140.

The total number of people on the first three days is 50 + 70 + 140 = 260.

Since there are 7 days in a week, and Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the remaining 4 days, the total number of people he saw on the remaining days is 60 * 4 = 240.

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 260 + 240 = 500.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of kernels that popped during each 30-second interval and then add the additional kernels that popped from residual heat.

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped.

In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount popped, so 3 * 20 = 60 kernels popped.

In the next 30 seconds, four times the initial popping rate popped, so 4 * 20 = 80 kernels popped.

In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slowed down to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, so 0.5 * 80 = 40 kernels popped.

Now, we need to calculate the additional kernels that popped from residual heat. A quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds popped from residual heat, so 0.25 * 40 = 10 kernels.

To find the total number of kernels that popped, we add the kernels from each 30-second interval: 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210 kernels.

The final answer is: 210"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of lemonade Tim needs to make, including the extra gallon for Allen. Since Tim needs to make 4 gallons of regular lemonade and 1 extra gallon that is twice as tart, we can consider the extra gallon as 2 gallons of regular lemonade. 

So, in total, Tim needs to make 4 + 2 = 6 gallons of lemonade. 

Since each gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice, and 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the total number of lemons needed. 

6 gallons * 1 cup/gallon = 6 cups of lemon juice needed

Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the total number of lemons needed by multiplying the total cups of juice needed by 6.

6 cups * 6 lemons/cup = 36 lemons

Therefore, Tim will need 36 lemons.

"To find the total amount of dog food needed in a week, we need to calculate the daily consumption of both breeds and then multiply it by 7.

The German Shepherds consume 5 kilograms each per day, and there are 3 of them. So, their daily consumption is 5 * 3 = 15 kilograms.

The Bulldogs consume 3 kilograms each per day, and there are 2 of them. So, their daily consumption is 3 * 2 = 6 kilograms.

The total daily consumption is the sum of the consumption of both breeds: 15 + 6 = 21 kilograms.

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7: 21 * 7 = 147 kilograms.

Therefore, the Kennel house will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week.

"To find the number of pink candies, we first need to determine the number of orange and yellow candies. 

We are given that there are 54 red candies. Since there are twice as many orange candies as red candies, the number of orange candies is 2 * 54 = 108.

We are also given that there are half as many yellow candies as red candies. So, the number of yellow candies is 54 / 2 = 27.

Now, we know the total number of candies is 232. We can find the number of pink candies by subtracting the number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total.

Number of pink candies = Total number of candies - (Number of red candies + Number of orange candies + Number of yellow candies)

On Sunday, she gave out 48 meals.

Total meals given out = 64 + 30 + 48 = 142 meals

Total meals Mamou has = 1,360 meals
Meals left to distribute = Total meals - Total meals given out
= 1,360 - 142
= 1,218

The final answer is: 1218"
"To find the total amount of money James has, we need to calculate the value of each coin and add them together.

A quarter is worth 25 cents.
Two nickels are worth 2 x 5 cents = 10 cents.
Seven dimes are worth 7 x 10 cents = 70 cents.

Now, let's add the values together: 25 cents + 10 cents + 70 cents = 105 cents.

The final numerical answer is: 105"
"To find the total age of all siblings, we first need to determine the age of the older brother. Since one of the brothers is 12 years old, which is half the age of the older brother, the older brother's age is 12 * 2 = 24 years.

Now, we know that all 3 sisters are 16 years old. 

The total age of the siblings is the sum of the ages of all the siblings. So, we add the age of the older brother (24), the age of the younger brother (12), and the combined ages of the 3 sisters (16 * 3 = 48).

Total age = 24 + 12 + 48 = 84

The final answer is: 84"
"To find the total time spent on meditation and yoga, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity separately and then add them together.

Meditation time per day: 15 minutes (morning) + 15 minutes (night) = 30 minutes
Since Charisma meditates 7 days a week, the total meditation time per week is: 30 minutes/day * 7 days/week = 210 minutes/week

Yoga time per day: 1 hour = 60 minutes
Since Charisma practices yoga 5 days a week, the total yoga time per week is: 60 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 300 minutes/week

Total time spent on meditation and yoga per week: 210 minutes/week (meditation) + 300 minutes/week (yoga) = 510 minutes/week

In 4 weeks, the total time spent on meditation and yoga is: 510 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 2040 minutes

The final answer is: 2040"
"To find the total square feet of fabric used, we need to calculate the total area of fabric from each type of shirt and then add them together.

The area of fabric from small shirts: 11 small shirts * 3 square feet/shirt = 33 square feet
The area of fabric from medium shirts: 8 medium shirts * 4 square feet/shirt = 32 square feet
The area of fabric from large shirts: 6 large shirts * 6 square feet/shirt = 36 square feet

Now, let's add the areas together: 33 + 32 + 36 = 101 square feet

"To find the total number of seeds, we first need to determine the number of seeds in a large sunflower. 

A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since 1 dozen equals 12, a small sunflower has 3 * 12 = 36 seeds.

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36, we multiply 36 by 0.5, which equals 18. 

Now, we add the 50% more seeds to the original 36 seeds: 36 + 18 = 54 seeds in a large sunflower.

To find the total number of seeds, we add the seeds from the small sunflower and the large sunflower: 36 + 54 = 90 seeds.

The total number of sunflower seeds is 90."
"To find out how many pens Sarah has, we first need to determine how many pens Timothy has. Since Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns, and George has 18 pens, we can calculate Timothy's pens as follows:

Timothy's pens = 3 * George's pens
Timothy's pens = 3 * 18
Timothy's pens = 54

Next, we need to find out how many pens Sarah has. Since Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, we can calculate Sarah's pens as follows:

Sarah's pens = 0.5 * Timothy's pens
Sarah's pens = 0.5 * 54
Sarah's pens = 27

The final answer is: 27"
"To solve this problem, we need to find Jackie's height before summer. 

First, we know Albert's height is 36"". Since Anne is twice the size of Albert, Anne's height is 2 * 36"" = 72"".

We also know that Jackie is 2"" shorter than Anne, so Jackie's height is 72"" - 2"" = 70"".

Since Jackie grew 3"" over the summer, her height before summer was 70"" - 3"" = 67"".

"To find the total amount of money the company will receive, we need to calculate the total number of bars produced in two weeks and then multiply it by the price per bar.

First, let's find out how many bars the company produces in one week. Since there are 7 days in a week, the company produces 5000 bars/day * 7 days/week = 35,000 bars/week.

Now, we need to find out how many bars the company produces in two weeks. 35,000 bars/week * 2 weeks = 70,000 bars.

Since each bar is sold for $2, the total amount of money the company will receive is 70,000 bars * $2/bar = $140,000.

The final answer is: $140,000"
"To find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. The original price of each T-shirt is $8. Jake buys 2 T-shirts, but he gets one of them 50% off. So, the cost of the first T-shirt is $8, and the cost of the second T-shirt is $8 * 0.5 = $4. The total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and Jake gets a 40% discount. The discount amount is $40 * 0.4 = $16. So, the cost of the shoes is $40 - $16 = $24.

Now, let's add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store. The total cost is $12 + $24 = $36.

The final answer is: $36"
"To find out how much money Ryan has, we need to calculate his total earnings from doing chores and subtract the cost of the ice cream cones.

Ryan earns $6 each week for 3 weeks, so his total earnings are 6 * 3 = $18.

He bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends at $1.25 each, so the total cost of ice cream cones is 4 * 1.25 = $5.

Now, let's subtract the cost of ice cream cones from his total earnings: 18 - 5 = $13.

The cost of a movie ticket is $6.50. To find out how many tickets Ryan can buy, we need to divide his remaining money by the cost of a ticket: 13 / 6.50 = 2.

"To find the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars, we first need to calculate the cost of making one jar and then multiply it by 10.

The cost of making one jar consists of the cost of passion fruit, jackfruit, and honey. 

Cost of passion fruit = 2 pounds * $6 per pound = $12
Cost of jackfruit = 1.5 pounds * $8 per pound = $12
Cost of honey = 2 pounds * $10 per pound = $20
Total cost of making one jar = $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

Now, we need to find the total revenue from selling 10 jars. 
Revenue from selling 10 jars = 10 jars * $50 per jar = $500

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue.
Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $500 - ($44 * 10)
Profit = $500 - $440
Profit = $60

The final answer is: $60"
"To find the total dollar amount in the jar, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and add them together.

First, let's calculate the value of each type of coin:

- 32 quarters = 32 x $0.25 = $8.00
- 95 dimes = 95 x $0.10 = $9.50
- 120 nickels = 120 x $0.05 = $6.00
- 750 pennies = 750 x $0.01 = $7.50

Now, let's add the values together:

$8.00 + $9.50 = $17.50
$17.50 + $6.00 = $23.50
$23.50 + $7.50 = $31.00

Janet has $13 left."
"To find out how much Josh makes in 2 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of days he works and then multiply it by the number of cars he services per day and his hourly wage.

Josh is open every day except Sunday and Wednesday, so he works 5 days a week. In 2 weeks, he works 5 days/week * 2 weeks = 10 days.

Since Josh services 3 cars a day, in 10 days, he services 3 cars/day * 10 days = 30 cars.

Josh gets paid $4 per car, so in 10 days, he makes 30 cars * $4/car = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To solve this problem, we need to track the number of cookies Randy has at each step.

Initially, Randy has 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies. 

For his early day snack, he ate 1 of each flavor, so he ate a total of 3 cookies. This leaves him with:
- 9 - 1 = 8 oatmeal cookies
- 4 - 1 = 3 chocolate chip cookies
- 5 - 1 = 4 sugar cookies

For lunch, he ate 2 oatmeal cookies, leaving him with:
- 8 - 2 = 6 oatmeal cookies
- 3 chocolate chip cookies (unchanged)
- 4 sugar cookies (unchanged)

He then gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends, leaving him with:
- 6 oatmeal cookies
- 3 chocolate chip cookies
- 4 - 2 = 2 sugar cookies

Finally, he bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner. This adds 4 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 4 sugar cookies to his collection. So, the total number of cookies he has now is:
- 6 + 4 = 10 oatmeal cookies
- 3 + 4 = 7 chocolate chip cookies
- 2 + 4 = 6 sugar cookies

The total number of cookies Randy has now is 10 + 7 + 6 = 23. 

The final answer is: 23"
"To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we need to calculate the amount he would get for the first half of the collection and the second half separately, and then add them together.

Since Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers, we can divide them into two equal halves: 6 toy soldiers for the first half and 6 toy soldiers for the second half.

For the first half, Matthew would get $5 per toy, so the total amount for the first half would be 6 * $5 = $30.

For the second half, Matthew would get $7 per toy, so the total amount for the second half would be 6 * $7 = $42.

To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we add the amounts for the first and second halves together: $30 + $42 = $72.

The final answer is: $72"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog and then determine how many holes Nate fills in per day. 

The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes dug is 6 * 14 = 84 holes.

Since Nate fills in 9 holes a day and the dog digs 6 new holes every night, the net number of holes filled in per day is 9 - 6 = 3 holes.

To find out how many days it takes to fill in all the holes, we divide the total number of holes by the net number of holes filled in per day: 84 / 3 = 28 days.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find the number of weeks by dividing the total number of days by 7: 28 / 7 = 4 weeks.

The final answer is: 4"
"To find the difference in average enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School, we first need to find the average enrollment at Butler High School. 

Since Butler High School enrolls an average of 3/4 as many students as Norman High School, we can calculate this by multiplying the average enrollment at Norman High School (4000) by 3/4.

Average enrollment at Butler High School = 4000 * (3/4) = 3000

Now, we need to find the difference in average enrollment between the two schools.

Difference = Average enrollment at Norman High School - Average enrollment at Butler High School
= 4000 - 3000
= 1000

The final answer is: 2325"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of test tubes as T, the number of beakers as B, and the number of Petri dishes as P.

We know that Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, so T = 16 / 2 = 8.

We also know that Igor gathered two more Petri dishes than requested, so P = 14 + 2 = 16.

The total number of items Igor had is 29, and we know that T + B + P = 29.

Substituting the values we know, we get 8 + B + 16 = 29.

Simplifying the equation, we get B + 24 = 29.

Subtracting 24 from both sides, we get B = 5.

However, we know that Igor initially picked up the correct number of beakers, which is 7. Since he lost some beakers, the number of beakers he had left is 5.

To find the number of beakers he lost, we subtract the number of beakers he had left from the initial number of beakers: 7 - 5 = 2.

The final answer is: 2"
"To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws needed for the tables and subtract that from the total number of screws he has.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws, so each table needs 4 x 2 = 8 screws.

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws needed is 8 x 4 = 32 screws.

James has 40 screws, so to find out how many he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the total number of screws he has: 40 - 32 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we first need to determine the number of eggs in each basket. 

There are 10 eggs in the first basket. Since there are twice as many eggs in the second basket, we can calculate the number of eggs in the second basket by multiplying the number of eggs in the first basket by 2.

Number of eggs in the second basket = 10 * 2 = 20

Now, we add the number of eggs in both baskets to find the total.

Total number of eggs = 10 (first basket) + 20 (second basket) = 30

"To find the total amount of money raised, we need to calculate the individual amounts raised by each girl and then add them together.

Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, who raises $430. So, Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750.

Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, who raises $300. So, Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, we add up the amounts raised by each girl: $750 (Kim) + $430 (Alexandra) + $700 (Maryam) + $300 (Sarah) = $2180.

The final answer is: $2180"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem. 

Since Aaron was able to run each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, if we let Vanessa's speed be V miles per minute, then Aaron's speed would be 2V miles per minute. 

We are given that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, and since he ran half the distance Vanessa did (because Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron), we can set up the equation 2V * 16 = 4, where 2V is Aaron's speed and 16 is the time he took to run half the distance. 

Solving for V, we get 2V = 4 / 16, which simplifies to 2V = 1/4. Dividing both sides by 2, we get V = 1/8. 

Now that we know Vanessa's speed, we can find the time it took her to run 4 miles. Since her speed is 1/8 miles per minute, the time it took her to run 4 miles is 4 / (1/8), which is equal to 4 * 8 = 32 minutes.

The final answer is: 32"
"To find out how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of line required for the existing dock. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock, we multiply 200 by 3.

200 * 3 = 600 feet of line required for the existing dock.

However, the caretaker already has 6 feet of new line. To find out how much more line he needs to buy, we subtract the amount he already has from the total amount required.

600 - 6 = 594 feet of line needed to buy.

"To find out how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to calculate their daily revenue and then multiply it by the number of days they are open.

First, let's calculate the daily revenue. They get 6 reservations a night, and each reservation includes 2 meals that cost $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine. 

Daily revenue = (6 reservations * 2 meals * $5) + (6 reservations * $5)
Daily revenue = (6 * 2 * $5) + (6 * $5)
Daily revenue = $60 + $30
Daily revenue = $90

Since they are open 2 days a week, we multiply the daily revenue by 2.

Weekly revenue = $90 * 2
Weekly revenue = $180

"To find the cost price of each watermelon, we first need to find the total cost of the watermelons. The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80, so the cost price of each watermelon is $80 / 50 = $1.60.

Now, let's find the selling price of each watermelon. The vendor sold the watermelons at a profit of 25%. To find the selling price, we need to add 25% of the cost price to the cost price. 

25% of $1.60 is 0.25 * $1.60 = $0.40. 

Now, we add this to the cost price: $1.60 + $0.40 = $2.00.

So, the selling price of each watermelon is $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the current age of James and then determine the age of John's youngest son.

First, let's find James' current age. We know that James is twice as old as Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years. This means that Dora's current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

We also know that James is 9 years older than John, since John was 19 when James was born. Therefore, John's current age is 19 + 18 = 37 years.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so the youngest son's current age is 37 - 32 = 5 years.

In 3 years, the youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

"To find the total cost Mark paid, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator and the labor cost.

First, let's find the cost of the radiator. The original price is $400, but Mark gets it for 80% off. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by 0.8 (which is the same as 80%).
 
$400 * 0.8 = $320

So, Mark pays $320 for the radiator.

Next, we need to find the labor cost. The mechanic works for 3 hours at $50 an hour. To find the total labor cost, we multiply the number of hours by the hourly rate.

3 hours * $50/hour = $150

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the labor cost to find the total amount Mark paid.

$320 (radiator) + $150 (labor) = $470

The final answer is: $470"
"Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as W. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write the equation:

C + W = 20

We also know that the total number of legs is 70. Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, so we can write the equation:

2C + 4W = 70

We can solve this system of equations by multiplying the first equation by 2 to get:

2C + 2W = 40

Now, we can subtract this equation from the second equation to eliminate C:

(2C + 4W) - (2C + 2W) = 70 - 40
2W = 30

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

W = 15

Now that we know the number of cows, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find the number of chickens:

C + 15 = 20
C = 5

So, there are 5 chickens on Farmer Brown's farm.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

First, let's find the total number of slices. There are 7 pizzas, and each pizza is cut into 8 slices. 

Total slices = 7 pizzas * 8 slices/pizza = 56 slices

Now, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. There are 4 people in total, including Henry and his 3 friends.

Slices per person = Total slices / Number of people = 56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices/person

So, each person can have 14 slices.
